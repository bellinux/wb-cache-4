40|$|In this study, {{we measure}} the {{utilization}} costs {{of free trade}} agreement (FTA) tariff schemes. To do that, we use shipment-level customs data on Thai imports, which identify not only firms, source country, and commodity but also tariff schemes. We propose several measures {{as a proxy for}} FTA utilization costs. The example includes the minimum amount of firm-level savings on tariff payments, i. e., trade values under FTA schemes multiplied by the <b>tariff</b> <b>margin,</b> in all transactions. Consequently, the median costs for FTA utilization in 2008, for example, are estimated to be approximately US$ 2, 000 for exports from China, US$ 300 for exports from Australia, and US$ 1, 000 for exports from Japan. We also found that FTA utilization costs differ by rule of origin and industry...|$|E

As a result, we found that Taiwan includes products with a medium magnitude of benefits from tariff removal in the early harvest list.

We then estimated the equation for the determinants of FTA utilization by introducing an inverse of the Mills ratio estimated in the selection equation.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{determination}} of the rates of utilisation of Australian free trade agreements (FTAs). The topic is important and interesting because the utilisation rates show the usage of the agreements by traders. Low utilisation rates imply that trade agreements fail in their objective. Following a review of relevant literature, the study presents data on the utilisation rates of Australia’s preferential trade agreements (PTAs) over the time frame of 2000 - 9. This work requires some care in the definition of the utilisation rate, a matter which is discussed in detail in the presentation of this part of the empirical work. It is found that utilisation rates vary a lot. The variations appear to be related to low preferential <b>tariff</b> <b>margins</b> {{and the degree to which}} there are strict rules of origin (ROO). These rules are associated with FTAs to manage the problem of trade deflection (TD). The ROO schemes of five Australian FTAs are investigated and a ROO restrictiveness index is developed and applied to these five Australian trade agreements. The main findings are that all five ROO regimes differ significantly between the agreements, indicating that ROO are negotiated according to criteria beyond their role in managing TD. A question of interest therefore arises about the set of important determinants of ROO. One hypothesis in the literature is that more restrictive ROO are negotiated in tariff lines with relatively high preferential margins. To examine and test this hypothesis in detail, a political economy (PE) model is applied. PE and TD factors are taken into account in a test of the relative importance of these different factors. The results confirm that TD concerns in form of potential transshipment are reflected by ROO design; however this is the case only for the Australian agreements with its developing country partners. The results also show that more restrictive ROO are negotiated in tariff lines with high applied tariff rates and for commodities where a potential import penetration may occur. The higher the potential competition in the form of trade penetration and the higher market access in the form of low preferential tariff rats, the more restrictive are the negotiated ROO. Therefore, these results suggest that ROO are used as both a trade protection and as a tariff substitution tool. The research then returns to the question of the impact of ROO on the utilisation rates and trade development in Australia’s FTAs. An equation is estimated in which the relationship and impact of ROO and preferential <b>tariff</b> <b>margins</b> on the utilisation rates is tested. To avoid endogeneity between tariff rates and ROO as identified in this thesis, the study employs the instrumental variable method by using the results of the determinants of ROO as an instrument. Two main hypotheses are examined, namely (1) do more restrictive ROO increase trade costs and with that lower the application of preferential treatment in form of utilisation rates, and (2) do preferential <b>tariff</b> <b>margins</b> serve as an incentive to apply for preferential treatment. The results show a strong negative relationship between the degree of restrictiveness of ROO and the utilisation rates and a positive relationship between preferential <b>tariff</b> <b>margins,</b> and utilisation rates.

40|$|There {{has been}} much debate over the value of {{preferential}} trade programs offered by industrial countries, granting duty-free or reduced-duty access for many exports from developing countries. 1 Some leaders from developing countries and nongovernmental organizations have argued that preference erosion would have serious development consequences and requires compensation (e. g., Oxfam 2005). Other leaders have argued that vulnerability to preference erosion is lim-ited to only a few countries and products, and thus requires more targeted assist-ance (WTO 2004). A country that is granted trade preferences would presumably see demand for its exports grow, relative to demand for exports from countries still facing most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs. If the country receiving preferences is small, its exports {{would continue to be}} sold in the importing country at the prevailing tariff- inclusive price, with the exporter earning the difference. Thus, the benefits of such preferences for the exporting country would be increased exports and a transfer of rent from the importing country.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the private sector}} responds to export opportunities induced by FTAs, using evidence from the Thai manufacturing sector during the period 2003 - 08. The core methodology is to undertake an inter-product panel-data econometric analysis {{to gain a better}} understanding of FTA utilization across products. Different from previous studies, it makes an explicit distinction between actual and preferential trade in which the latter is measured by the administrative records of FTA implementation. Our findings suggest that the product coverage is limited. Products that have benefited from FTA tariff preferences so far are highly concentrated. Our key finding from the econometric analysis is that as rules of origin (ROO) constraints are binding empirically, the ability to comply with ROO as well as <b>tariff</b> <b>margin</b> does matter in firms ’ decisions to use FTAs. The estimated cost in compiling ROO is equivalent to a tariff in the range of 2 % to 10 %. Besides, the FTA impact on exports is conditioned by trade volume during the pre-signing FTA period. The key policy inference is that it is unlikely to be able to promote exports by maximizing the number of FTAs, while ignoring the nature of FTA partners. The nature of the FTA partner does matter in establishing whether the signed FT...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to gain more information on Free Trade Agreement utilization and the determinants behind it. The study was conducted using mixed research methods to answer the research questions: 1. What is the utilization rate of EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement by Korean exports to Finland? 2. What is the role of the importer in Free Trade Agreement utilization decision-making and can it partly explain the utilization rate? Quantitative part of this thesis focused on producing and analyzing trade data to calculate the utilization rate. In the qualitative part, seven Finnish importers of South Korean products were interviewed. The results of this study are twofold. Firstly, importer has a significant role in the FTA utilization process and it should be considered to be one of the main utilization determinants. Importers role in utilization decision making depends on the level of awareness it has of the Free Trade Agreement. Based on this awareness it can either have an active role or an inactive role in deciding whether or not to utilize the preferential tariffs. Factors influencing FTA awareness are found to be firm size, market conditions and scale of trade. Secondly, the utilization rate of EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement by Korean exports to Finland is significantly lower than expected. This study concludes that one of the factors that have influenced the low utilization rate has been Finnish importers low awareness of the Free Trade Agreement. Additionally this study found out that there is a positive correlation between the <b>tariff</b> <b>margin</b> and the utilization rate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{in depth}} {{the use of}} free trade agreements (FTAs) in Thailand {{to shed light on}} the ongoing negotiation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The key finding is that while certificate of origin records significantly increased over the period in consideration, their value remained less than one-third of total trade. The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and its successor, ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), accounted for the largest share with a noticeably declining relative importance. Products that are often traded under an FTA preferential trade scheme are highly concentrated, dominated by automotive (both vehicles and auto parts), electrical appliances, petrochemical products, and processed foods. Firms in these sectors are generally large in size and their products have a high level of local content. Evidence that the top 15 items are usually subject to high <b>tariff</b> <b>margins</b> suggests the presence of costs incurred to firms when applying for a certificate of origin. Our analysis suggests that we should be avoid maximizing a number of signed FTAs as a mercantilism style policy tool kit to open up market as well as maximize net export earnings as we tried {{in the early years of}} the new millennium. Instead, FTAs could be used as a gradual step in making a progress of unfinished business in trade and investment policy reform. To encourage firms to use the signed FTA, policy focus should be on the rules of origin and their related administrative procedures...|$|R

40|$|When {{introducing}} a new telecom service {{it is very}} important for the operator to set the tariff right. Being too prudent by setting the tariff too high will most probably put the operator out of competition. On the other hand, setting the tariff too low might skim profits, lead to cannibalization of other services, forcing the operator to raise the tariffs - which clearly has a negative impact on the user satisfaction and coupled market share. Current telecom networks make progressively use of an all IP network, in which all services run over the same infrastructure. While this move allows reducing costs due to economies of scale and scope, it disguises the costs of each of the different services within the full costs of the network. As the tariff is expected to be sustainable in the long run, the costs associated to the roll-out of the new service should at least be covered by the (forecasted) revenues. Different allocation schemes can be used for discovering the costs associated to each of the services over the network, and their use leads {{to a better understanding of}} the margins on sustainable tariffs as opposed to stand alone or break even calculations. The whole calculation is largely dependent on the forecasts of adoption, bandwidth growth and cost evolution. Within this paper we will first investigate the sensitivity of the calculated tariff margins on changes of these inputs. In a second phase we will investigate what impact the calculated <b>tariff</b> <b>margin</b> might have on the adoption of the service. We also indicate that there are important changes to these margins when quantifying this impact and using iterative calculations...|$|E

Econometric results are plausible (they satisfy the revealed preference criterion that estimated costs of RoO should be less than preference rates when utilization rates of NAFTA preference are significantly positive), and they indicate that changes in tariff classification are more costly for final goods than for intermediate goods.

40|$|Do tariffs inhibit {{trade flows}} by {{limiting}} the entry of exporting firms (`extensive margin') or by restricting the average volume exported by each firm (`intensive margin') ? Using a gravity equation approach, we analyze how the decrease in tariffs promoted during the 1990 s by the Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreement affected the trade margins of French firms across 57 sectors and in 147 countries, from 1993 to 2002. Our main contribution is to estimate the elasticity of trade for both margins, controlling for the unobserved heterogeneity of trade flows thanks to a three-dimensional panel and to time-varying tariffs {{as a measure of}} variable trade costs. Our results show that the number of firms exporting in a given sector to a given destination is related to the level of tariffs. But they also show that the decrease in tariffs determined by the implementation of the Uruguay Round did not lead more firms to export and instead, only encouraged incumbent exporters to increase their shipments. We control for two problems that may affect our basic specification: tariff changes may be endogenous and zero flows are not included. Our results are confirmed - even when the extensive margin is significant, its contribution is very small. <b>tariffs,</b> trade <b>margins,</b> Uruguay Round...|$|R
40|$|In recent debates, trade {{preference}} erosion {{has been viewed}} by some as damaging to developing countries, and by others as insignificant, except in a few cases.

S. nonreciprocal {{trade preference}} programs in order to shed light on this debate. Highly disaggregated data are used to quantify the margins, coverage, utilization, and value of agricultural and nonagricultural tariff preferences for all beneficiary countries in the U. S. regional programs and in the Generalized System of Preferences. Results show that U. S. regional tariff preference programs are generally characterized by high coverage of beneficiary countries'exports, high utilization by beneficiary countries, and low <b>tariff</b> preference <b>margins</b> (except on apparel). For 29 countries, the value of U. S. tariff preferences was 5 percent or more of 2003 dutiable exports to the United States, even after incorporating actual utilization. Most of this value is attributable to nonagricultural tariff preferences, and to apparel preferences in particular. These results suggest that preference erosion may be significant for more countries than many had thought.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the reaction of}} French firms to the drop in tariffs that {{has occurred in the}} late 1990 s, mainly {{as a consequence of the}} Uruguay Round Agreement. To perform this estimation, we use data from the French customs and tariff rates provided by the TRAINS data base. Like in Buono and Lalanne (2009), we take advantage of the variations in tariffs over time. It allows us to exploit the panel structure of the data, which is not possible when using distance instead of tariffs. The results and the estimated reaction of firms to changes in variable export costs are strongly affected. From a cross-section, we find that the effect of tariffs on exports channels evenly through the number of exporting firms - the extensive margin - and through the exports per firm - the intensive margin. When using the panel structure, only the intensive <b>margin</b> reacts to <b>tariff</b> reductions. To understand what underlies this result, we study the role played by incumbent exporters. The latter are responsible for 95  % of the response of French exports to tariff reductions. Finally, we find that firms respond to these lower export costs by increasing their amounts exported by product rather than by exporting new products. <b>Tariffs,</b> Trade <b>margins,</b> Uruguay Round...|$|R

40|$|Ten {{years after}} the end of central planning, {{enormous}} interregional price differences indicate that Russian food markets are not well integrated spatially. Trade potentials are thus not exploited, most probably because of high trade costs. Besides transport costs, transaction costs seem to play an important role as an impediment to interregional arbitrage. These transaction costs can be very high in transition countries due to underdeveloped market structures and weak public institutions. After subtracting transport costs from interregional price differences, large differences remain, particularly in the case of high-value products. It is assumed that these residual price differences constitute the transaction cost component of total trade costs. The regional economic impact of different trade cost components is quantified using a bi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Simulations show that the results are quite different between the two stylized regions (East and West), depending on which trade cost component is reduced. While the welfare effects of varying customs <b>tariffs</b> and transport <b>margins</b> are rather limited, lower transaction costs of trade seem to be a promising way to achieve a better functioning food market in Russia.

40|$|Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) aim at {{increasing}} trade flows via reductions on applied tariffs and the incentives {{created by the}} difference between the applied and the most favoured nation (MFN) <b>tariff,</b> the preference <b>margin.</b> An often omitted element in PTAs evaluation is the possibility that the wedge between preferential and MFN tariffs may induce a preference rent. This paper analyses empirically who captures the preference rent by exploiting a unique dataset of imports in the European Union at a highly disaggregated level (CN- 10) linked to information on the preferential regime used and the tariff applied. In order to remove potential bias and measurement errors from comparing preferential prices from specific countries and products with average MFN prices, this paper uses the prices from the same country, product and year. This is possible since we observe in the database a large number of cases where in the same year a preferential regime is both utilised and non-utilised. Our main findings suggest that on average an exporter obtain a larger price margin under a preferential regime than under MFN. However, this preference rent is only partially appropriated by exporters with a pass-through coefficient from preference to price margins that oscillates between 0. 16 and 0. 5.

40|$|Some {{developing}} countries may experience important trade losses if tariffs are liberalized on a general most-favored-nation (MFN) basis. Sub-Saharan Africa {{appears to be}} especially vulnerable to this problem. African countries receive important Lome Convention preferences in the European Economic Community (EEC), under which duty-free treatment, or tariffs below MFN and generalized system of preferences (GSP) rates, are applied to their exports. Other OECD countries normally apply GSP duties, or even more advantageous"least developed"country preferences to African exports. The proposed Uruguay Round reductions in MFN tariffs will erode those <b>tariff</b> preference <b>margins</b> and cause some African exports to be displaced by other suppliers. The author documents the importance of African countries of existing OECD preference, particularly those of the EEC. More than 95 percent of all African-tariff-line products shipped to the EEC receive duty-free treatment, while other exporters of the same products face tariffs as much as 20 percentage points higher. Similar favorable terms of preferential access also exist in Japan and the United States, although the preference margins are smaller than in the EEC. Using a trade projection model developed by the World Bank and the UNCTAD, the author estimates that eliminating EEC, Japanese, and U. S. MFN tariffs would cause African export losses of about $ 4 billion (estimated present value). The countries {{that seem to be}} most vulnerable to these adverse trade effects are Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Senegal, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. What about the possibility that the losses African countries could experience from erosion of tariff preferences could be offset by the liberalization of nontariff measures? The author discounts this likelihood. In general, few important OECD nontariff measures are applied to African products [...] most African textile and clothing exports are even excluded from Multifibre Arrangement restrictions. And those that are applied (such as eco-labeling or licensing requirements) do not restrict trade very much. The author's observations accent the need for action to offset the impact of Africa's loss of preferences {{as a result of the}} Uruguay Round. What offsetting actions are possible and appropriate? Aggressive reform of the African countries'own trade regimes appears to be the most effective way to counter the effects of the erosion of OECD preferences.
