5|$|Many of Coffin's {{theories}} and principles {{can be seen}} in practice in her most famous creation, Harry and Ruth du Pont's gardens at their Winterthur estate. Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career. It was very fortuitously timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out the fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had somewhat better luck with her investments and the enormous fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout <b>the</b> <b>downturn.</b> With the money from her investments and the fees from the du Ponts for the Winterthur commission, Coffin was able to maintain two homes, a maid and a chauffeur despite the general economic decline.|$|E

He had a match total of 2/122, which was enough for him to secure national selection, playing in both Tests against South Africa in early 2000 at Mumbai and Bangalore as India sought a second spinner to accompany Anil Kumble, after Harbhajan Singh's performance in the role in the previous season had been deemed inadequate. Kartik scored 14 before being bowled by Shaun Pollock as India batted first and made 225. He then took 2/28 from 18 overs as the Indians restricted the tourists to 176, before collapsing to be all out for 113 in the second innings, Kartik scoring only two before Pollock had him caught behind. Kartik took 1/50 in the second innings as South Africa ground their way to the target of 163 with four wickets in hand. In the Second Test, Kartik took 3/123 and scored a duck and two as India were crushed by an innings. Overall, Kartik performed steadily, taking six wickets at 33.50.|$|E

40|$|Dissertation(MTech(Marketing)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 <b>The</b> global {{economic}} <b>downturn</b> of 2008 {{spread around the}} world and few business sectors remained unaffected. While organisations in some sectors were forced to close down or lay off employees, organisations in the retail sector mainly had to adapt to consumer’s preferences, which change in times of economic <b>downturn.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of this research was therefore to examine how {{one of the most prominent}} retailers in South Africa adapted their marketing mix strategies to changing consumer buying behaviour during <b>the</b> economic <b>downturn.</b> <b>The</b> research applied a qualitative approach and a case study methodology as its research design. An interview guide was designed for the in-depth face-to-face interviews. Additional data was collected from annual reports, various articles and the retailer’s websites. Decreased spending by consumers was one of the main consequences of <b>the</b> economic <b>downturn.</b> Throughout <b>the</b> economic <b>downturn</b> <b>the</b> retailer found it increasingly difficult to attract consumers to its stores, which prompted changes to retain and attract consumers. Therefore the main challenge for the retailer was to alter consumers’ perception that it was an expensive store to a value for money store, without compromising its quality proposition. The study found that the retailer did indeed adapt its marketing mix strategy extensively in response to <b>the</b> {{global economic}} <b>downturn.</b> <b>The</b> retailer recognised a change in their consumers’ buying behaviour and made responsive changes to their marketing strategies. This research can be useful to academics and practitioners highlighting the importance of adapting the marketing strategy to the changing environment to consolidate or even improve a retailer’s position in the market. The research can also be used by organisations in a similar situation facing an economic downturn. Even though these findings cannot be statistically generalised to a population, the findings can be used in similar situations or for theoretical generalisations, depending on homogeneity...|$|R
