5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel.</b> Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
50|$|The wings {{were sent}} to Montcalm Community College where they were {{carefully}} stripped, cleaned, repainted and recovered with silver painted fabric. <b>The</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>panels</b> and controls were disassembled and restored by Mr. Dietz's colleagues at Oldsmobile.|$|R
50|$|The hinge is {{a carbon}} {{reinforced}} element {{able to withstand}} wind speeds up to 75 km/h when open and was designed to sever the tubing and wiring looms from <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> upon emergency release in flight.|$|R
50|$|The large canopy is {{a single}} unit which {{integrates}} <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> into <b>the</b> canopy frame. It is hinged at the back in the Piontkowski fashion and opens with an upward and rearward movement. The practicality of this concept for large glider canopies has already been tested by Akaflieg Köln through the modification of three Scheibe SF-34 gliders.|$|R
5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel.</b> The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|After {{damaging}} <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> with {{a medical}} ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to}} be an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E

50|$|In 1991, the Moto Meter AG {{had been}} taken over by the Robert Bosch GmbH. Bosch/Motometer held in 1991 a market share of approx. 10% in the strong {{concentrated}} market of displaying instruments and ranked third therewith. Market leaders were Magneti Marelli and VDO in these times. Bosch/Motometer delivered 95% of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panels,</b> which were installed by the German vehicle manufacturers.|$|R
5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while he still could. In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down. The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E

25|$|Interiors were mildly revised {{with minor}} changes to <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> {{including}} {{the movement of}} the heating/air conditioning controls {{to the left of the}} steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel)</b> that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.|$|E
25|$|As a restyled {{variant of}} the Gremlin, the Spirit {{featured}} distinctly larger rear quarter windows while retaining <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> introduced on the 1978, with a wood grain overlay on DL and Limited models.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> (in the Mirage 2000 C) is {{dominated}} by a Sextant VE-130 head-up display which presents data relating to flight control, navigation, target engagement and weapon firing, and a radar screen located centrally below it.|$|E
25|$|Further {{revisions}} include {{daytime running}} lights and OBD II compliant on-board diagnostic systems, tweaking the climate control and safety alarm, a revised keyless entry system with new features was and the short list of optional equipment was expanded to include chrome wheels and a gold trim package. The 1996-'99 models also had the passenger temperature toggle buttons on the middle right portion of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> replaced with air recirculator buttons.|$|R
5000|$|The 2-seater Mustang GT was {{powered by}} a [...] {{supercharged}} 4.6L V-8, mated to a 6-speed manual in the coupe and a 5-speed automatic transmission in the convertible. The hood has twin scoops sitting in a U-shaped channel, topped by separate body color panels. This elongates the hood section, creates tailored character lines that flow into <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel's</b> twin cowl upper section, and provides cold air ducting the supercharged V8.|$|R

25|$|As the {{takeoff roll}} began, {{the first officer}} noted several times to the captain that <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> {{readings}} he was seeing {{did not seem to}} reflect reality (he was referring {{to the fact that the}} plane did not appear to have developed as much power as it needed for takeoff, despite the instruments indicating otherwise). The captain dismissed these concerns and let the takeoff proceed. Investigators later determined that there was plenty of time and space on the runway for the captain to have aborted the takeoff, and criticized his refusal to listen to his first officer, who was correct that <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> readings were wrong. The pilot was told not to delay because another aircraft was 2.5 miles out (4km) on final approach to the same runway. The following is a transcript of Flight 90's cockpit voice recorder during the plane's acceleration down the runway.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the new Insight includes {{a variation of the}} two-tier instrument panel first introduced on the 2006 Honda Civic. In this arrangement, a digital speedometer is mounted high on <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> within the driver’s normal line-of-sight for ease of visibility. An analog tachometer, fuel gauge, hybrid assist gauge, and Multi-Information Display are housed in the lower tier.|$|E
25|$|Common {{equipment}} includes {{tilt steering}} column, six-way adjustable driver seat, rear-window defroster, remote fuel {{door and a}} 60/40 split-bench folding rear seat. <b>The</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> includes a tachometer, speedometer, odometer, trip odometer, fuel gauge, coolant temperature gauge and lighting dimmer control. The IP also has a center storage tray, lighter, extra 12-volt outlet, digital quartz clock and lighted glove box.|$|E
50|$|The performance-oriented suspension, tires, {{and engine}} are {{consistent}} with its styling.
