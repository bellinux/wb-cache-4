International Fight Week {{is expected to be}} an annual July occurrence, coinciding with a Las Vegas UFC event.

We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to our surprise that we read about <b>this</b> <b>July</b> 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know exactly what he said, but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 13, 2014, {{the group}} {{announced}} that they would hold their 16th Anniversary Concert on March 22–23, 2014 at the Olympic Park Gymnastics Stadium. The concert was titled Here, referring to their very first concert in 2001 which {{was held at the}} same venue. Due to a gambling scandal that happened in November 2013, Andy was absent from the shows. However, on March 23, 2014, which was the second and last show, Lee made a surprise appearance and apologized to the audience. At the end of the show, Min-woo announced that the group will release a new album in October 2014. In this concert, they sold out 27,000 seats and the ticketing website server crashed, making it impossible to enter the site, proving the fierceness of the Shinhwa concert ticketing. Due of individual activity, Shinhwa will be making comeback in next year.Shinhwa member Eric is going to star in a KBS 2TV drama titled, Discovery of Love set to air in August. Shin Hye-sung is looking to release his solo album after winning the popular Asian award in China, while Andy is taking some time off due to his recent illegal gambling charges. Lee Min-woo is scheduled to hold a Beijing and Shanghai Asian tour <b>this</b> <b>July</b> and August. Before going to China, he will travel to Japan this month and hold a solo concert for his fans there. Shin Hye-sung, Lee Min-woo, and Jun Jin will be attending the [...] "2014 The Young The Future" [...] concert in Beijing on July 12.

Why, the one is to the other as is one of Joe Twichell's yarns repeated by a somnambulist. Goodness gracious, you read me a chapter, and it is a gentle, pearly dawn, with a sprinkle of faint stars in it; but by and by I strike it in print, and shout to myself, [...] "God bless us, how has that pallid former spectacle been turned into these gorgeous sunset splendors!" ...|$|E

60|$|But, {{truth to}} say, on <b>this</b> <b>July</b> day I {{reflected}} but {{little on the}} condition of the civilised world. Whatever sinister passions were heaving under its splendid and complex surface, I was too agitated by a simple and innocent desire of my own, to notice the signs or interpret them correctly. The most innocent of passions will take the edge off one's judgment. The desire which possessed me was simply the desire to travel. And that being so it would have taken something very plain in the way of symptoms to shake my simple trust in the stability of things on the Continent. My sentiment and not my reason was engaged there. My eyes were turned to the past, not to the future; the past that one cannot suspect and mistrust, the shadowy and unquestionable moral possession the darkest struggles of which wear a halo of glory and peace.|$|E
60|$|There was {{one more}} meeting between Cousin George and Emily Hotspur, before Sir Harry left London {{with his wife and}} daughter.

He could see at a glance that there was no danger for him on that side. Lord Alfred was talking to Lady Elizabeth when he entered, and Emily was engaged with a bald-headed old gentleman with a little ribbon and a star. The bald-headed old gentleman soon departed, and then Cousin George, in some skilfully indirect way, took an opportunity of letting Emily know that he should not go to Goodwood <b>this</b> <b>July.</b>|$|E
60|$|Everybody in {{the room}} on <b>this</b> <b>July</b> night {{had come from the}} theater.

There had been something of a boom that season in dramas whose heroes appealed to the public more pleasantly across the footlights than they might have done in real life. In the play that had opened to-night, Arthur Mifflin, an exemplary young man off the stage, had been warmly applauded for a series of actions which, performed anywhere except in the theater, would certainly have debarred him from remaining a member of the Strollers' or any other club. In faultless evening dress, with a debonair smile on his face, he had broken open a safe, stolen bonds and jewelry to a large amount, and escaped without a blush of shame via the window. He had foiled a detective through four acts, and held up a band of pursuers with a revolver. A large audience had intimated complete approval throughout.|$|E
