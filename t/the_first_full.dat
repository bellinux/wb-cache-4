5|$|After being {{recalled}} from Germania, Germanicus celebrated {{a triumph}} in Rome in AD17, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>full</b> triumph {{that the city}} had seen since Augustus's own in 29BC.

Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria, of poisoning him.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, the Lodge Freeway was {{proposed}} {{to run from}} Detroit {{as far as the}} Fenton–Clio Expressway (US23) at Fenton. The intersection with the Edsel Ford Freeway, next to Wayne State University was built in 1953 and was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>full</b> freeway-to-freeway interchange built in the United States. The freeway was dedicated on November 7, 1957, and opened without any state trunkline designation between downtown and the Wyoming Curve. The section from the Edsel Ford Freeway (now I-94) into downtown Detroit was designated as US12 by the middle of 1960.|$|E

As a result of the increase in the number of states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 12th century priory, during and shortly after Malvern's expansion throughout {{the second half of}} the 19th century over twenty Christian churches were built.

5|$|Smallpeice {{and seven}} {{of his fellow}} {{directors}} felt {{there was no other}} course of action left open to them but to ask Rowland to relinquish all executive appointments with Lonrho, but to allow him to remain on the board as a non-executive director.

Rowland, aware of the possibility, had obtained an interlocutory injunction from the High Court of Justice preventing the board from voting on his removal.|$|E

5|$|The final Delrina-branded {{version of}} WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the {{subsequent}} version 8.0 being a Symantec product.

It also reflected the development effort required to develop <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>full</b> 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set it apart from its competition at the time.|$|E

5|$|After {{extensive}} research {{that began in}} the 90s, a second push took place in March 2003, when the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen launched to the market <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>full</b> flexible-fuel car, the Gol 1.6 Total Flex. Several months later was followed by other Brazilian automakers, and by 2010 General Motors, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Citroën, Nissan and Kia Motors were producing popular models of flex cars and light trucks. The adoption of ethanol flex fuel vehicles was so successful, that production of flex cars went from almost 40 thousand in 2003 to 1.7 million in 2007. This rapid adoption of the flex technology was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place, as around 27,000 filling stations countrywide were available by 1997 with at least one ethanol pump, a heritage of the Pró-Álcool program.|$|E
5|$|During 1946, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>full</b> {{season after}} the war, Hammond played only 26 innings but scored 1,783 runs {{at an average}} of 84.90, topping the {{first-class}} averages for the eighth time in succession—still an English record as of 2015. At times, he began to show technical weaknesses. Captaining England to a 1–0 victory in a three-Test series against India, he scored one fifty, making 119 runs {{at an average of}} 39.66. He batted fifth in the order in the final match, as he would in four of his five remaining Tests. Gloucestershire fell to fifth in the County Championship, and Hammond, after enthusiastically making the team very competitive {{at the start of the}} season, became increasingly affected by pain, particularly in damp weather. As captain, he could be irritable and consciously created remoteness and division.|$|E

5|$|Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited is a 1999 {{biography}} of American General Samuel Chapman Armstrong and his associated normal school for freedmen, Hampton Institute, written by Robert Francis Engs {{and published by}} the University of Tennessee Press. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>full</b> {{biography of}} its kind, the book portrays Armstrong as a complex politician and administrator in the postbellum period who balanced the needs of opposed parties surrounding the Virginia school: its African American students, Southern white neighbors, and Northern philanthropist funders. Previous works presented Armstrong in a polarized fashion, as either a savior or handicap for freedmen. The book emphasizes Armstrong's upbringing as a missionary in Hawaii {{in the development of}} his educational philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{creation}} of the French Limousin Herd-Book in 1886, Limousins were exported to Brazil (1886), New Caledonia (1902), Uruguay (1910), Madagascar (1922), Argentina (1924), and Portugal (1929). However, the only herd that became established outside France during this period was in New Caledonia, which continued to import Limousins. It was not until after the reform of Limousin breeding in France in 1962 that significant numbers were exported around the world. Limousins were reintroduced in Argentina (1966) and Brazil (1978), and imported to other European countries such as Spain (1965), Italy (1968), the Netherlands (1969), Denmark (1970), and the United Kingdom (1971). Their introduction to the United Kingdom provided opportunities for Australia and New Zealand to import semen in 1972. Soon after, New Zealand allowed the importation of Limousins from both Ireland and the United Kingdom, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Full</b> French cattle were imported to Australia from New Zealand in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{the most}} recent year for which {{statistics}} are available, AirTrain JFK carried 6,487,118 paid passengers, with another 10 million using the service for free on-airport travel. This is a 247% increase over 2004, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>full</b> year of operation, when 2,623,791 riders paid. The 2014 paid ridership is 12% of the 53.2 million passengers that used JFK that year. The ridership of AirTrain JFK has risen each year from 2004 to 2014, which Governor Andrew Cuomo touted in a 2015 announcement in which he also announced the plan for AirTrain LaGuardia, a similar system to be built at LaGuardia Airport. The $5 fare is much cheaper than the $45 one must pay for a taxi between Manhattan and JFK, which may be a factor in the increased ridership.|$|E
