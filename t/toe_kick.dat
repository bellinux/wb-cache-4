5000|$|By contrast, Pérez's [...] {{season was}} disappointing. He posted a 5.85 ERA {{in a season}} plagued by injuries. The Pirates were forced to place him on the {{disabled}} list on June 29 after he broke his <b>toe</b> <b>kicking</b> a cart following a loss to St. Louis. He missed two and a half months, returning in September to post a 4.58 ERA in 19.2 late season innings. Pérez had also lost significant speed off his fastball.|$|R

50|$|These feet can {{be secured}} {{to the bottom}} of the cabinet by having the leg base screwed onto the cabinet bottom. They can also be {{attached}} by means of a hole drilled through the cabinet bottom at specific locations. The legs are then attached to the cabinet bottom by a slotted, hollow machine screw. The height of the cabinet can be adjusted from inside the cabinet, simply by inserting a screwdriver into the slot and turning to raise or lower the cabinet. The holes in the cabinet are capped by plastic inserts, making the appearance more acceptable for residential cabinets. Using these feet, the cabinets need not be shimmed or scribed to the floor for leveling. The <b>toe</b> <b>kick</b> board is attached to the cabinet by means of a clip, which is either screwed onto the back side of the kick board, or a barbed plastic clip is inserted into a saw kerf, also made on the back side of the kick board. This <b>toe</b> <b>kick</b> board can be made to fit each base cabinet, or made to fit a run of cabinets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} control {{strategy}} for an underactuated planar robot to achieve jumping motion by <b>toe</b> <b>kicking.</b> The model {{in this work}} consists of 4 links and is controlled by input-output linearization and output zeroing. One of the output functions is designed based on a virtual constraint on the unactuated joint. This makes the remaining zero dynamics unstable when output zeroing is achieved. Vertical jumping motion is then accomplished by designing the other output functions to synchronize the joint angles with the zero dynamics. The present scheme is verified through simulations.

5000|$|They {{made their}} pro debut on May 12, 1983, against Tony Falk and Doug Vines in Prestonsburg, Kentucky. [...] Brad was injured shortly after their debut when he blew out {{his left knee}} {{performing}} a jumping high five and <b>toe</b> <b>kick</b> with his brother. Ironically, this would become a signature maneuver during their career. He {{would be out of}} action for nearly a year and a half. While his brother was recovering from his injury, Bart was paired with Johnny Wilhoit and subsequently defeated Tojo Yamamoto and Gypsy Joe for the ICW United States Tag Team Championship. They remained champions until the promotion's close the following year.|$|E
50|$|Paninipa can be {{regarded}} as the study of leg muscles and bones and how they are connected, with the goal of either inflicting pain or outright breaking or dislocating the bones. Most striking techniques involve applying pressure to bend the target areas in unnatural ways so as to injure or break them. Such pressure may be delivered {{in the form of a}} heel smash, a <b>toe</b> <b>kick,</b> a stomp, or a knee. Targets include the groin, thighs, knees, shins, ankles, feet and toes. The upper body is used only for defensive maneuvers, making pananadiyak ideal for when combatants are engaged in a clinch. When used effectively, the strikes can bring an opponent to the ground or otherwise end an altercation by making them too weak to stand.|$|E
40|$|Impact events during skiing are frequents and {{can lead}} to damages on the {{equipment}} or injuries to the skiers. In particular, the ski-boot can be subjected to impacts either during skiing or during falling. Furthermore, kicking actions are frequent in the resorts after skiing and may involve high impacts energy. Aims of the work were: i) to evaluate impact loads acting on the boots worn by a skier during voluntary kicks against obstacles of different shapes; ii) to estimate the energies involved in the impacts for comparison with experimental impact tests on boots using a drop tower. Kinematic data were recorded by means of a stereophotogrammetric system (BTS-Italy) composed by 6 cameras working at 120 Hz. A 50 kN Futek load cell and 2 uni axial accelerometers fixed under the boot sole for vertical and horizontal acceleration were connected to an IMC Cronos data acquisition system to collect kinetic data at the obstacles with 50 kHz sampling rate. The tester was asked to perform 4 types of kick (<b>toe</b> <b>kick,</b> shell kick, heel kick and instep kick) against three types of obstacles (flat, round and prismatic) with the boot at room temperature. A session with the ski boot at − 20 ° was also performed. A 2 D lower limb rigid model was developed to estimate impact energy absorbed by the boot. The peak values of impact loads were measured with different types of obstacle or kicks directions and the highest speed value of 8. 8 m/s during toe kicks was recorded. High value impact energies were estimated from the limb total energy loss during impact: the maximal value was of 128, 3 J...|$|E

2500|$|While the Hobbit leads had {{scenes in}} Hobbiton {{interiors}} and Rivendell exteriors in Kaitoke Park with new arrival Ian Holm, Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies filmed scenes involving the Rohirrim countryside. Mortensen broke his <b>toe</b> <b>kicking</b> an Orc helmet on camera, Bloom fell off {{his horse and}} broke a rib, and Rhys-Davies' scale double Brett Beattie dislocated his knee. They spent two days injured during the [...] "orc hunting" [...] sequence seen in the second film. Soon after, they spent a month of day shoots at Helm's Deep and another three months of night shoots handled by Mahaffie, in Dry Creek Quarry outside of Wellington, during which Mortensen's tooth was knocked out and Bernard Hill was hit on the ear {{with the flat of}} a sword. The extras insulted each other in Māori and improvised stunts, partially because those dressed in Uruk-hai prosthetics got extremely cold.|$|R

5000|$|In {{ballroom dancing}} a [...] "dance step" [...] is defined as, or requires, the {{shifting}} of one's body weight {{from one foot}} to the other in time to the music. [...] "Dancing is stepping in time to the beats of the music. ... In addition to steps, there are also dance movements, such as <b>toe</b> touches, <b>kicks,</b> and hops." [...] Some genres, such as ballet, have, [...] "a clear repertoire of dance steps," [...] thus different types of dance may be characterized by their differing and shared steps. Each dance emphasizes its own moves, but often moves are shared by several dances. The steps of a dance or pattern may be listed in a step sheet.|$|R
50|$|The Kickback is {{a really}} old {{freestyle}} trick, involving a half flip backwards and then a {{one and a half}} flips forwards. It is done by placing your front foot on the front bolts and the toes of the back foot along the heelside edge in the middle of your board. You start pushing down on the toes of the back foot and when the board catches your <b>toes,</b> you jump, <b>kick</b> the board forwards, and catch it on the grip tape.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Ashurst {{was signed}} by Penrith Panthers for a record fee of £15,000, (based on {{increases}} in average earnings, this would be approximately £241,100 in 2013). While he only played two seasons in the NSWRL, he became a popular figure with the new club and was notable for his prowess as a goal-kicker. This was partially due to his style of kicking: in an era where most Australian goal-kickers would approach the ball straight-on and use their <b>toe</b> to <b>kick,</b> Ashurst went [...] "around the corner" [...] and contacted the football with his instep, soccer-style. This produced both more power and {{a higher level of}} accuracy, and by the late 1980s most native Australian goal kickers (save for Mal Meninga) switched over to this method. In 2006, Ashurst was named in the Panthers' [...] "Team of Legends".|$|R
5000|$|Tofflemire was a 1984 {{graduate}} of Post Falls High School {{where he was}} a four-year letterman in both track and football, and was inducted into the inaugural Post Falls High School Hall of Fame along with his best friend Rollin Putzier who also was a lineman in the NFL. Joe set school records in both the shot-put and discus medaling at the Idaho State Championships as well as being part of the sprint relay teams. Tofflemire was a standout in football in which he was named to multiple All State and All Star teams as a lineman and during his senior year he was honored as the Idaho Offensive Lineman of the year. Joe was highly recruited by many Division I (NCAA) teams and decided to attend the University of Arizona on a full ride scholarship. In addition to being a standout lineman he was also an All Intermountain League First Team kicker his junior and senior seasons. He kicked a 44-yard field goal his junior year in a State Playoff game versus Bishop Kelly which at that time was an Idaho high school state record. He wore a size 15, black Spot-built square <b>toe</b> <b>kicking</b> shoe and was given the name [...] "Joe the Toe" [...] by assistant coach Steve Long during a practice session. The nickname stuck, and throughout his life he was referred to by former high school, college and pro teammates simply as [...] "Toe". With a powerful leg, he could regularly kick the football through the uprights on kickoffs. Joe started off being a chubby place kicker and was moved up to the varsity team his freshman year as a kicker. After which he became completely dedicated to weight training winning many weight lifting competitions and setting many lifting records, chiseling his body into a Lou Ferrigno like physique {{to become one of the}} strongest and best linemen in Idaho Prep football history and ultimately University of Arizona and Pac-10 history.|$|R

50|$|The {{impact point}} of the Front Kick can, with {{specific}} techniques and in certain styles, be more exotic. Certain Japanese styles have a Front Kick generally used as a stop-kick where the blade of the foot is used to connect, like for a side kick (The Foot Blade Front Kick). The heel is often used straight (Mae Kakato Geri) or with the foot tilted (Tilted Heel Front Kick), especially in stop-kicks, close kicks or high front kicks. Japanese Nin-Jitsu has variations using the straightened and hardened <b>toes.</b> Front <b>Kicks</b> to the groin (Kin Geri) like the lift kick or the upward front kick (Mae Geri Keage), use {{the top of the}} foot. The phantom Groin Kick uses the whole of the in-side of the foot to connect very effectively. Stop Kicks often use the whole plant of the foot to push away the opponent.|$|R

Fifteen male elite Taekwondo players were selected to perform three different styles of the axe kick, i. e., front, in-out, and out-in axe kick five times each for a total of 45 kicks. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences between the novel and existing chest protector conditions for vertical height of the <b>toe,</b> downward <b>kicking</b> foot speed, hip flexion angle and ipsilateral shoulder flexion extension range of motion (ROM) (p 0. 05).

500|$|The [...] "b-boys" [...] and [...] "b-girls" [...] {{were the}} dancers to Herc's breaks, who were {{described}} as [...] "breaking". Herc has noted that [...] "breaking" [...] was also street slang of the time meaning [...] "getting excited", [...] "acting energetically," [...] or [...] "causing a disturbance". Herc coined the terms [...] "b-boy", [...] "b-girl," [...] and [...] "breaking" [...] which {{became part of the}} lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows: [...] " ... verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center.

[...] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as [...] "b-boys," [...] a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} tried to find {{countermeasures}} against musculoskeletal de-conditioning during bed rest, {{but none of them}} yielded decisive results. We hypothesised that resistive vibration exercise (RVE) might be a suitable training modality. We have therefore carried out a bed-rest study to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy during 56 days of bed-rest Twenty healthy male volunteers aged 24 to 43 years were recruited and, after medical check-ups, randomised to a non-exercising control (Ctrl) group or a group that performed RVE 11 times per week. Strict bed-rest was controlled by video surveillance. The diet was controlled. RVE was performed in supine position, with a static force component of about twice the body weight and a smaller dynamic force component. RVE comprised four different units (squats, heel raises, <b>toe</b> raises, <b>kicks),</b> each of which lasted 60 - 100 seconds. Pre and post exercise levels of lactate were measured once weekly. Body weight was measured daily on a bed scale. Pain questionnaires were obtained in regular intervals during and after the bed-rest. Vibration frequency was set to 19 Hz at the beginning and progressed to 25. 9 Hz (SD 1. 9) {{at the end of the}} study, suggesting that the dynamic force component increased by 90 %. The maximum sustainable exercise time for squat exercise increased from 86 s (SD 21) on day 11 of the BR to 176 s (SD 73) on day 53 (p = 0. 006). On the same days, post-exercise lactate levels increased from 6. 9 mmol/l (SD 2. 3) to 9. 2 mmol/l (SD 3. 5, p = 0. 01). On average, body weight was unchanged in both groups during bed-rest, but single individuals in both groups depicted significant weight changes ranging from - 10 % to + 10 % (p < 0. 001). Lower limb pain was more frequent during bed-rest in the RVE subjects than in Ctrl (p = 0. 035). During early recovery, subjects of both groups suffered from muscle pain to a comparable extent, but foot pain was more common in Ctrl than in RVE (p = 0. 013 for plantar pain, p = 0. 074 for dorsal foot pain). Our results indicate that RVE is feasible twice daily during bed-rest in young healthy males, provided that one afternoon and one entire day per week are free. Exercise progression, mainly by progression of vibration frequency, yielded increases in maximum sustainable exercise time and blood lactate. In conclusion, RVE as performed in this study, appears to be safe. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG...|$|R
