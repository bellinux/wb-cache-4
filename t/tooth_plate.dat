40|$|A {{new species}} of dipnoan, Chirodipterus potteri, is described, based {{on a series of}} {{juvenile}} <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> with attached bone from two localities in New South Wales, Australia. Most of the material comes From the Upper Devonian (Fammenian) Coffee Hill Member of the Catombal Range, west of Orange. and some from the Upper Devonian (Frasnian) Paling Yard Formation, at Gap Creek. The new taxon provides additional insights into the fine structure and the development of chirodipterid <b>tooth</b> <b>plates,</b> and includes some anomalous specimens. <b>Tooth</b> <b>plates</b> are based on a form of interdenteonal dentine with irregular denteons containing circumpulpar dentine, surrounded by mantle dentine and enamel. and ankylosed to the underlying jaw bones. Analysis of the material indicates that the <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> of chirodipterid lungfish are not members of the dentine plated clade, but have <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> that are based, as in most other dipnoan species, on the fusion of radiating rows of initially separate cusps in the young juvenile to form a crushing or grinding structure in the adult...|$|R

40|$|Eggs of the polystome monogenean, Concinnocotyla australensis, {{were found}} {{attached}} to the crushing surface and sides of the <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> of the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri, from the Brisbane River and Enoggera Creek in south-east Queensland, Australia. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the crushing surface of the <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> of infected hosts can bear an extensive, carpet-like cover comprising enormous numbers of eggs. The eggs are attached firmly by eggshell material at the distal tip of the abopercular appendage. Our {{studies suggest that the}} eggs are laid singly soon after manufacture, embryonate while {{attached to the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>plates,</b> and hatch in situ to release an unciliated oncomiracidium. Attachment of eggs to the host by C. australensis, a rare strategy among monogeneans, achieves some of the advantages, and avoids some of the disadvantages, of ovoviviparity and full egg-embryonation before laying. Emergence of unciliated oncomiracidia permits auto-infection. However, a transfer of larvae or adults from host to host might occur, possibly during spawning, when male and female lungfish intertwine. Attachment of eggs to the <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> may reflect the suitability of their hard, non-secretory surface...|$|R
50|$|Psarolepis had teeth at {{the very}} front of the snout with large fangs on the <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b> Outstanding feature are the 'parasymphysical tooth whorls' which place {{the fish in the}} order of onychodontida. The premaxilla and the dentary had large inner teeth and {{irregular}} array of tiny outer teeth.|$|E
50|$|This species counts with 25 to 30 anal soft rays. Its dorsum is a dull grey colour with a {{pale green}} iridescence. Its maxillary band of teeth forms a {{continuous}} row, and its snout protrudes with upper jaw tooth bands which are somewhat exposed when the animal's mouth is closed; it possesses a large median vomerine <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although the 3 genera {{of living}} {{lungfish}} have different-shaped adult <b>tooth</b> <b>plates,</b> their larval stages have similar patterns of development. The sequence {{in the pattern}} of initiation of teeth and their modification through ontogeny in Neoceratodus hatchlings provides a developmental model for fossil hatchling <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> (smallest 1 – 2 mm) recovered as 3 -dimensional dentitions from Andreyevichthys. This Late Devonian lungfish demonstrates that these also have a similar dentition pattern and suggests strongly conserved developmental processes. We postulate that a specific pattern of development, derived within lungfish, has been conserved in extant forms through evolution from the earliest known lungfish. The most basal early dipnoan, Diabolepis speratus, is also known from juveniles with <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> formed in this pattern...|$|R

50|$|E. snyderi was {{described}}, like E. meltoni, by Richard Lund. It {{was described}} in 1988 based on juvenile specimens, all with a body length under 90mm.

50|$|Gecatogomphius {{is known}} from the holotype PIN 1156/1, a three-dimensionally {{preserved}} nearly complete lower jaw found {{on the bank of}} the Vyatka River near the town of Gorki in the Kirov Oblast, and from PIN 4310/1 a single maxillary <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> from Berezovye Polyanki in Tatarstan. The preserved part of the jawbone fragment has a length of 80 millimeters and is posteriorly expanded to form a very broad shelf that bears five rows of bulbous teeth.|$|E
50|$|It {{is likely}} that Oenosaurus led a durophagous {{lifestyle}} {{as indicated by the}} broad <b>tooth</b> <b>plates.</b> It is unknown if this animal was aquatic or terrestrial.|$|R
50|$|Materpiscis {{would have}} been about 11 in long and had {{powerful}} crushing <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> to grind up its prey, possibly hard shelled invertebrates like clams or corals.|$|R
5000|$|The head of Edaphosaurus was short, {{relatively}} broad, triangular in outline, and remarkably {{small compared}} to its body size. The deep lower jaw likely had powerful muscles and the marginal teeth along the front and sides of its jaws had serrated tips, helping Edaphosaurus to crop bite-sized pieces from tough terrestrial plants. Back parts of {{the roof of the}} mouth and the inside of the lower jaw held dense batteries of peglike teeth, forming a broad crushing and grinding surface on each side above and below. Its jaw movements were propalinal (front to back). Early descriptions suggested that Edaphosaurus fed on invertebrates such as mollusks, which it would have crushed with its <b>tooth</b> <b>plates.</b> However, paleontologists now think that Edaphosaurus ate plants, although tooth-on-tooth wear between its upper and lower <b>tooth</b> <b>plates,</b> indicates only [...] "limited processing of food" [...] compared to other early plant-eaters such as Diadectes, a large non-amniote reptiliomorph (Diadectidae) that lived at the same time. Early members of the Edaphosauridae such as Ianthasaurus lacked <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> and ate insects.|$|R
50|$|Of the Labidosaurikos fossil {{collection}} the largest adult skull specimen was 280mm {{making it the}} second largest captorhinid compared to Moradisaurus gandis, a fellow member of the multiple rowed <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> captorhinid subfamily Moradisaurinae. Labidosaurikos skull has broadly flared posterior cheeks that are seen in all other multitoothed taxa {{as well as its}} Labidosaurus name sake. The foramens present on the skull include a pineal foramen on dorsal plane and the orbits and external naires that are elliptical in appearance.|$|E
5000|$|Several unique {{characters}} {{found in}} Eosalmo separate the genus from extant salmonids. The subopercle exhibits an anetrodorsal process which meets {{the edge of}} the subopercle at approximately a 60° angle. Also unique is the basihyal <b>tooth</b> <b>plate,</b> which is broad, flat, thin, and lacking any teeth along the edges. Modern salonids possess stout teeth along {{the edge of the}} basiyal. [...] The morphology suggests Eosalmo represents an intermediate between the modern Salmoninae and Thymallinae subfamilies and evolved from a grayling like ancestor.|$|E
5000|$|Ptychodus {{was about}} 10 m long and was {{unearthed}} in Kansas, United States. It {{was covered in}} placoid scales like other members of Hybodontoidea, reinforced with a large cartilaginous skeleton, and was a bearer of large serrated spines along the dorsal fin. [...] Unlike the colossal nektonic planktivores Rhincodon (whale sharks) and Cetorhinus (basking sharks) which relied upon gill rakers to acquire their food, the Ptychodus had a massive arrangement crushing plate teeth. A Ptychodus jaw contains many teeth, up to 550 teeth, 220 of which are on the lower jaw and 260 in the upper jaw. These teeth were very large as well. Paleontologists believe that the largest <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> measured 55 centimeters in length and 45 centimeters in width. There are two distinct formations of <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> between the genus; one being juxtaposed, non-overlapping tooth rows and another being imbricated tooth rows. It is believed that the shape coincides with the diet of the species and their geographic locations, but the time it lived has a big part as well. Ptychodus marginalis teeth differ from Ptychodus polygyrus. P marginalis was in the Middle Cenomanian to Middle Turonian deposits in the English Chalk, while P. polygyrus were in the Late Santonian-Early Campanian deposits.|$|E
50|$|Campbellodus {{has very}} short spinal plates, and {{is unusual in}} having a high dorsal spine formed by three median dorsal <b>plates.</b> The <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> are very robust and the upper plate has a high {{anterior}} spine.|$|R
50|$|The {{teeth are}} {{arranged}} in the lower and upper jaw in flat <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> called pavement <b>teeth,</b> each consisting of about 7 series of plates. Said mouth plates are useful to crush clam shells and crustaceans.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{most other}} chimaeriformes, Edaphodon is known mainly from poorly {{preserved}} specimens; this because Edaphodon belongs to Chondrichthyes class, whose skeletons {{are made of}} cartilage. So, in most cases, only <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> and fin spines are preserved.|$|R
50|$|This river stingray's oval disc {{is longer}} than wide (disc length between 102 and 131% of the disc width). The total length of the species is up to 75.5 cm, the disc length up to 47.5 cm and the disc width up to 36.2 cm. The mouth is small, opening relativeley {{straight}} across, and has two lateral and three central papillae. One of the central papillae {{is closer to the}} lower jaw <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b> The teeth are relatively small, with 36-46 rows in the upper jaw and 33‑45 in the lower jaw.|$|E
5000|$|The anteroventrally {{directed}} premaxillae {{which contain}} five long premaxillary teeth that decrease in size posteriorly {{as is the}} case in other captorhinids. The maxilla is greatly enlarged medially this constricts the palate and forms a <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> that accommodates the 6 parallel rows of teeth. Teeth that occur in the maxilla have been considered isodonts. The lateral surface of the maxilla presents a lateral flexion that is a characteristic cheek swelling seen in the single rowed Labidosaurus, Captorhinus aguti [...] and other multi rowed genus. In addition the septomaxilla is characteristic of the family group, however it sports a sculptured postero-dorsal process extending onto the skull roof to insert between lacrimal and nasal.|$|E
5000|$|Morphology of the {{dentition}} {{shows the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> teeth {{are relatively small}} isodonts and have wear facets usually characteristic of grinding. Mandibular tooth rows rest between the maxillary tooth rows and have multiple contact points that could in motion pass one another [...] which is necessary characteristic to shred fibrous plant material. However this would require propalinal jaw motion. Striations on the wear facets of the teeth can normally {{be used to determine}} jaw motion however they are not present on Labidosaurikos was secondary non-dental evidence is required. The ability of the quadrate to slide antero-posteriorly over the articular propaliny however the holotype skull provided by Stovall had damaged the articulating surface. Propaliny is evident two other captorhinids, one called Moradisaurus shares membership in the subfamily Moradisaurinae with Labidosaurikos. The morphology of the articular for Moradisaurus does indicate Labidosaurikos may have been capable of propaliny because articular fragments show great similarity to Moradisaurus than more basal captorhinids.|$|E
50|$|The {{teeth were}} unusual; {{those in the}} maxilla and palate were {{modified}} into broad <b>tooth</b> <b>plates.</b> The hind feet were equipped with massive claws, presumably for digging up roots and tubers by backwards scratching of the hind limbs.|$|R
40|$|The holotype {{and only}} known {{specimen}} of Sorbitorhynchus deleaskitus, a large Devonian lungfish from Guangxi, China, is abnormal {{in the structure}} of the snout and lower jaw. The <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> show marked asymmetry and do not occlude when the jaws are placed in normal articulation. There is a large hemispherical depression with sinus tracts in the bone between the lower <b>tooth</b> <b>plates.</b> Both snout and lower jaw are abnormal in shape and only traces remain of ossified sensory tubules within the bone of the snout and mandible. The lower jaw of S. deleaskitus may have included a dentigerous cyst that developed from a persistent juvenile symphyseal tooth and grew large enough to distort the symphysis and cause malocclusion between the <b>tooth</b> <b>plates.</b> The cyst may have become infected, forming an abscess with sinus tracts in the bone below, and hyperplastic or neoplastic cells from the cyst may have spread to destroy normal sensory structures in the snout and lower jaw. If this interpretation is correct, the unusual structures in the holotype of S. deleaskitus are unlikely to have any significance for taxonomic or phylogenetic analysis...|$|R
40|$|Environmentally-related wear {{conditions}} and pathologies affecting the dentition of fossil lungfish from freshwater deposits in Australia have been analysed and compared with similar {{changes in the}} dentition of the living Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri. Fossil populations from the Namba, Etadunna, Wipajiri and Katipiri formations in central Australia, and the Carl Creek Limestone and the Camfield beds in northern Australia were assessed. <b>Tooth</b> <b>plates</b> from populations of living lungfish from the Brisbane River and Enoggera Reservoir in southeast Queensland were analysed for comparison. <b>Tooth</b> <b>plates</b> were measured to determine the numbers of different age groups in each population. They were assessed for abrasion, attrition, spur and step wear, erosion and caries, and for trauma and pathological conditions such as malocclusion, hyperplasia, abscesses, osteopenia and parasitic damage. All of these conditions {{are related to the}} environment where the fish lived, are found in living members of the group, and can be compared directly with those of fossil relatives. The results suggest that some of the fossil populations were at risk before climatic changes late in the Cainozoic destroyed their habitats. Some fossil lungfish populations, such as those of the Wipajiri Formation, exhibit active spawning and recruitment, good growth rates and a low incidence of disease and environmentally related damage to the <b>tooth</b> <b>plates.</b> Others, like those of the Katipiri and Namba Formations, include no young, and the adult fish were ageing and show environmentally-related damage to the dentition. Etadunna lungfish had active recruitment, but the <b>tooth</b> <b>plates</b> show a high incidence of attrition and caries. Riversleigh lungfish were actively spawning but did not grow large. <b>Tooth</b> <b>plates</b> from this latter deposit have a high incidence of pathological conditions. Fish from the Camfield Beds, where food was severely limiting, had little serious pathology but high levels of caries. Pathologies among living lungfish are common, but fossil fish were comparatively healthy, with few serious dental problems. Information from studies of fossil lungfish confirms that conservation of the few living species of lungfish depends on the maintenance of clean environments that provide adequate supplies of food and suitable sites for spawning and for the growth of young fish...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tooth</b> <b>plate</b> {{formation}} in the Queensland lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri, Krefft begins with simple groups of isolated cusps, three in each <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b> The cusps fuse in ridges radiating from a point situated posterolingually. During growth, cusps {{are added to the}} labial ends of the ridges, and more ridges are added posteriorly, giving a total of seven in each <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b> Each tooth grows in thickness by the addition of layers of material, in line with the new cusps, beneath the <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> grows outwards and is resorbed from the inner angle at the same time. The crushing surface is formed by the growth of cusps between the ridges. Angles between the ridges become progressively smaller, and angles between more posterior ridges are consistently less than between more anterior ridges. Similar but less pronounced changes in angles between ridges occur in a fossil genus, Sagenodus inaequalis, examined for comparison. Vomerine teeth grow in the same way, by fusion of isolated cusps and the addition of new cusps to one end (labial) of the <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b> Layers of material are also added beneath the <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b> The vomerine tooth plates are initially low-based with long cusps but develop into high-based low cusped incisiform tooth plates in fully grown adults. The labial dentition of the lower jaw starts to develop like the vomerine teeth, but degenerates by stage (vi) of tooth development. The single medial tooth is resorbed even earlier. The pattern of <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> formation described in this paper is consistent with illustrations published by Semon (1901) and Greil (1908, 1913) but the inferred developmental processes are different. Implications of the results for the Zahnreihe hypothesis of Edmund and for the phylogeny of Dipnoi are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{whole process}} of {{clamping}} offshore well double metal composite pipe was established, Reviewing the problems that in {{the oil and gas}} wells the double metal composite pipes frequently get plastic damage or even fracture failure when the power slips hold fast to the double metal composite pipe, the effect Eq. of contact area to <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> and double metal composite pipe was deduced, and based on the elastoplastic contact analysis theory, the theoretical Eq. was verified. For the double metal composite pipe stress, displacement and stress of drill <b>tooth</b> <b>plate,</b> influence of slip teeth plate on the double metal composite pipe damage was analyzed, The plastic damage law of the double metal composite pipe was obtained with the influence factor of the contact surface and the influence factor of the tooth crown width. the analysis showed that, The double metal composite pipe can be clamped and the contact area value of the <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> with the minimum damage are fixed. Several sets of teeth were produced, and then used to carry out experiments, indoor and field experiments have fully proved the accuracy of the result, The research work provides a better theoretical basis for optimal design of slip <b>tooth</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The extant lungfish, {{including}} three genera, the Australian, South American and African lungfishes, retain a dentition that appeared {{first in the}} Devonian, {{in some of the}} oldest members of this group. The dentition consists of permanent tooth plates with persistent cusps that appear early in development of the fish. The cusps, separate early in development, form ridges that are arranged in a radiating pattern, and fusion of the cusps {{to each other and to}} the underlying jaw bone produces a <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b> The lungfish dentition is based on a template of mantle dentine that surrounds bone trabeculae enclosed in the <b>tooth</b> <b>plate.</b> The mantle layer is covered by enamel. In most derived dipnoans, this framework encloses two further forms of dentine, known as interdenteonal and circumdenteonal dentines. The tooth plates grow in area and in depth without evidence of macroscopic resorption of dentines or of enamel. Increase in size and changes in shape of lungfish tooth plates is actually achieved by a process involving microscopic remodelling of the bone contained within the margin of each <b>tooth</b> <b>plate,</b> and the later addition of new dentines and enamel within and around the bone. This is accomplished without creating weakness in the structural integrity of the <b>tooth</b> <b>plate</b> and bone complex, and proceeds in line with growth and remodelling of the jaw bones attached to the tooth plates...|$|E
50|$|Defining {{the limits}} so that Arius can form a natural {{grouping}} {{has always been}} a problem.
