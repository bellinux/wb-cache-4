40|$|Seat test {{standards}} require {{human subjects}} {{to be used}} for measuring the vibration isolation of vehicle seats. Anthropodynamic dummies, based on passive mass–spring– damper systems, have been developed for testing seats but their performance has been limited at low excitation magnitudes by non-linear phenomena, such as friction in the mechanical components that provide damping. The use of an electrodynamic actuator to generate damping forces, controlled by feedback from acceleration and force transducers, may help to overcome these limitations and provide additional benefits. The <b>transmissibilities</b> of five foam cushions have been measured using an actively controlled anthropodynamic dummy, in which damping and spring forces were supplied by an electrodynamic actuator. The dummy could be set up to approximate alternative single-degree-of-freedom and two-degree-of-freedom apparent mass models of the seated human body by varying motion feedback parameters. Cushion <b>transmissibilities</b> were also measured with nine human subjects, having an average seated weight similar to the dummy. At frequencies greater than 4 Hz, mean cushion <b>transmissibilities</b> measured with subjects were in closer agreement with the <b>transmissibilities</b> obtained with a two degree-of-freedom dummy than with a single degree-of-freedom dummy. However, at frequencies between 2 and 4 Hz, cushion <b>transmissibilities</b> obtained with the two-degree-of-freedom dummy showed consistently larger differences from mean <b>transmissibilities</b> with subjects than single-degree-of-freedom dummies, indicating a need for further development of human apparent mass models to account for the effects of magnitude and spectral content of the input motion. Vertical vibration isolation efficiencies (SEAT values) of the five foams were measured with four input motions, including three motions measured in a car. The SEAT values obtained using the active dummy were highly correlated with the median SEAT values obtained with the nine human subjects, with the two-degree-of-freedom apparent mass dummy giving the highest agreement...|$|R

25|$|One {{specific}} research {{topic of}} interest is how microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated Pseudomonas binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response. One way to alleviate hypoxia {{is to increase the}} amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen <b>transmissibility,</b> they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft CLs. A recent study showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermis adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone hydrogel CLs than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 20 times stronger than that of Staphylococcus epidermidis. This might partly explain why Pseudomonas infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel CLs showed that worn silicone CLs were less prone to Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses.|$|E

40|$|The {{transmission}} of vibration to people through seats was studied {{with the final}} objective {{of being able to}} predict the dynamic performance of seats. It was necessary to investigate both the dynamic response and the subjective response of a person sitting on a seat, in addition to the dynamic response of the seat itself. Initial experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of variables, such as the magnitude of the vibration and the posture of the body, on the {{transmission of}} vibration through a seat. Seat <b>transmissibilities</b> measured in a laboratory with vertical-only vibration were shown to be similar to those measured in a vehicle with multiple vibration. Frequency response functions were determined for the transmission of multiple axis translational vehicle vibration to the cushion and the backrest of a seat. The apparent mass of the seated body was measured as a pre-requisite for the prediction of seat <b>transmissibilities.</b> It was found that the resonance frequency of the body decreased when the magnitude of the vibration was increased. Increased muscle tension tended to have the opposite effect. The apparent masses of sixty people - men, women and children - were very similar once they were normalised to remove the effect of the different static weights on the seat. Some correlations with the body characteristics were significant - such as that between the normalised apparent mass at resonance and total body mass. A method of measuring the dynamic stiffness of a seat using a rigid indenter instead of a person to load the seat was developed. The results, in conjunction with measurements of the apparent mass of the body, were used to predict seat <b>transmissibilities.</b> Predicted seat <b>transmissibilities</b> were shown to be similar to <b>transmissibilities</b> that were measured with a person sitting on the seat.

2500|$|There is some {{evidence}} from comparative phylogenetic analysis and epidemic simulations that HIV adapts {{at the level of}} the population to maximize transmission potential between hosts. This adaptation is towards intermediate virulence levels, which balances the productive lifetime of the host (time until AIDS) with the transmission probability per act. A useful proxy for virulence is the set-point viral load (SPVL), which is correlated with the time until AIDS. SPVL is the quasi-equilibrium titer of viral particles in the blood during chronic infection. For adaptation towards intermediate virulence to be possible, SPVL needs to be heritable and a trade-off between viral <b>transmissibility</b> and the lifespan of the host needs to exist. [...] SPVL has been shown to be correlated between HIV donor and recipients in transmission pairs, thereby providing evidence that SPVL is at least partly heritable. The transmission probability of HIV per sexual act is positively correlated with viral load, thereby providing evidence of the trade-off between <b>transmissibility</b> and virulence. It is therefore theoretically possible that HIV evolves to maximize its transmission potential. Epidemiological simulation and comparative phylogenetic studies have shown that adaptation of HIV towards optimum SPVL could be expected over 100–150 years. These results depend on empirical estimates for the <b>transmissibility</b> of HIV and the lifespan of hosts as a function of SPVL.|$|E

Using a multiple input/single output model, this study investigated the effects of single- and combined-axis vibration in the fore-and-aft (X), lateral (Y), and vertical (Z) directions on vibration transmission to the human chest. Frequency response functions (<b>transmissibilities)</b> were estimated and compared for the back-on and back-off postures. Methods A rigid seat with seat back was mounted onto the Six Degree-of-Freedom Motion Simulator (SIXMODE). A flat acceleration vibration signal was generated between 2 and 40 Hz at 1. 0 ms- 2 rms in the single and combined X, Y, Z, XY, XZ, YZ, and XYZ axes. The signals were shifted in time so that the combined inputs were not fully correlated. Lightweight triaxial accelerometers were used to measure accelerations at the seat base (input) and at the bony manubrium of the chest (output). The maximum of nine frequency response functions (H(?)) or <b>transmissibilities</b> were estimated from the auto- and cross-spectra. The system transfer matrix for the XYZ inputs and chest Z output is [] where PxZ, PyZ, and PzZ are the cross-spectra between the three inputs at the seat base and the Z output at the chest, respectively, and Pxx, Pxy, 22 ̆ 0 ac 6 zz are the auto- and cross-spectra between the input signals (? not shown in Eq. 1).

The transmission of vertical (z axis) vibration from the base of this seat to the seat surface, to the back-rest and to the backs and heads of seat occupants has been measured. Measurements were made with the seat back fixed, to prevent vertical motion relative to the seat frame, and with the seat back free to move.
