40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the performance of}} well freezers, chest freezers, frozen and chilled <b>door</b> <b>cabinets</b> (solid or glass door) and open fronted chilled cabinets under EN 441 test conditions demonstrated that maximum temperatures in cabinets were generally in the most exposed (to ambient) areas and that minimum temperatures were located in the least exposed areas. Detailed positions of maximum and minimum temperature varied between cabinet types. In chest freezers 95 % of the maximum temperature positions were located in the top layer and 95 % of the minimum temperature positions were located in the middle layer of the <b>cabinets.</b> In full <b>door</b> frozen <b>cabinets</b> the maximum temperature position was in the majority of cases on the top shelf (64 %) with most maximum packs being {{at the front of the}} top shelf (53 %). In the chilled full <b>door</b> <b>cabinets</b> 94 % of the maximum temperature packs were situated at the front of the cabinet. In open fronted cabinets the majority of maximum temperature packs (97 %) were located at the front of the cabinet, the largest number (60 %) being at the front of the base of the cabinet. In well cabinets the majority of maximum temperature packs (81 %) were located in the top layer of the cabinet and the majority (91 %) of minimum temperature packs were located in the bottom of the cabinet. Large differences in energy consumed by cabinets of similar size and temperature performance were found indicating that large reductions in energy and CO 2 emissions could be achieved by selection of the most efficient cabinets. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 61 - 62). The work in Access: Pending {{investigated the}} way a door moves through a cabinet, and how this seemingly simple act can be suggestive of how people interact with each other. This exploration stemmed from a fascination with the way people negotiate relationships with others. This deep-seated interest in interpersonal relationships came from watching my divorced parents navigate their new and very different interactions with one another {{as well as with}} their new spouses. Growing up is hard sometimes; especially when we navigate relationships we feel strongly about and have no experience in dealing with the emotional rollercoaster that inevitably comes with them. Having a person in my inner circle like my stepmother, a psychologist, has been especially helpful with regard to understanding my own sensitivity to relationships with others. This keen awareness of interpersonal relationships dovetailed with my interest in furniture making in a very productive way. Gaining access to the interior space of a cabinet and how we do so is analogous to how we gain access or acquire familiarity with ourselves as well as with another person. When I make furniture I often include a technical challenge I have never attempted before, and in this work I experimented {{with the use of the}} <b>tambour</b> <b>door.</b> This method has a long history, first being used in the 1760 s, but has since become more rare in furniture. The <b>tambour</b> <b>door</b> is made of a series of slats that travel along a track, and is distinctive because its track can curve. It is prominent in my thesis work because of the potential it has to convey meaning. This unique door travels through interior space like a train down a railroad track or a river across a landscape. This reaction to a path is similar to the way we react emotionally to the world as we move through it. In the piece titled Rollercoaster for example, the rise and fall of the door as the user pushes it up to where it then free-falls is inspired by emotional highs and lows of praise and criticism. We meet people and negotiate situations all the time, and by thinking about these doors in this way, I began to explore how they could act as metaphors for aspects of relationships we all have with one another and ourselves. Access: Pending represents my exploration of these ideas over the past year. The seven pieces that made up Access: Pending were exhibited in the Everett Gee Jackson Gallery at San Diego State University from April 21 through April 25, 2012...|$|R

The attic of this home also had a good example of a portable desk.|$|R

A thermal imaging camera was used to ascertain boundary conditions for a CFD model which then predicted a reduction in the core temperature of the test pack above the heat pipe by 0. 5 K The reason for the limited benefit of the heat pipe measured and predicted was that the temperature of the shelf below the front pack was only slightly higher than the heat pipe cooling it. Using the thermal imaging camera and the CFD model, the predictions were extended to an open fronted cabinet. The heat pipe was predicted to reduce the core temperature of the test pack above it by 1. 7 K Heat pipes were shown to be of more benefit in open fronted than glass <b>door</b> <b>cabinets...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Door Mounting. For both face-frame and {{frameless}} kitchen cabinets, it is conventional for <b>cabinet</b> <b>doors</b> {{to overlay}} the cabinet carcase. Face-frame cabinets allow for various door mounting options. Traditional overlay doors do not abut, allowing a partial {{view of the}} face frames when the doors are closed. Full overlay <b>cabinet</b> <b>doors</b> fit closely so that they obscure the face frame when closed. A third and less conventional option for face-frame cabinets is to inset doors into, and flush with, the face frame (see below). Since frameless (see below) <b>cabinet</b> <b>doors</b> also fully overlay their carcases, the two types (frameless and full-overlay face-frame cabinets) have a similar installed appearance (when doors are closed), both may use European cup hinges, and both tend to use decorative door and drawer pulls (since {{there is no room}} for fingers at the door or drawer edge when installed).|$|R

40|$|Robots {{operating}} in domestic environments generally need {{to interact with}} articulated objects, such as <b>doors,</b> <b>cabinets,</b> dishwashers or fridges. In this work, we present a novel, probabilistic framework for modeling articulated objects as kinematic graphs. Vertices in this graph correspond to object parts, while edges between them model their kinematic relationship. In particular, we present a set of parametric and non-parametric edge models {{and how they can}} robustly be estimated from noisy pose observations. We furthermore describe how to estimate the kinematic structure and how to use the learned kinematic models for pose prediction and for robotic manipulation tasks. We finally present how the learned models can be generalized to new and previously unseen objects. In various experiments using real robots with different camera systems as well as in simulation, we show that our approach is valid, accurate and efficient. Further, we demonstrate that our approach has a broad set of applications, in particular for the emerging fields of mobile manipulation and service robotics. 1...|$|R
