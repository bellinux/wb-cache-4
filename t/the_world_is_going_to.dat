2500|$|In January 2009, on a {{broadcast}} of The 700 Club, Robertson {{stated that he}} is [...] "adamantly opposed" [...] to the division of Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians. He also stated that Armageddon is [...] "not going to be fought at Megiddo" [...] but will be the [...] "battle of Jerusalem," [...] when [...] "the forces of all nations come together and try to take Jerusalem away from the Jews.

[...] Robertson added that Jerusalem is a [...] "spiritual symbol that must not be given away" [...] because [...] "Jesus Christ the Messiah will come down to the part of Jerusalem that the Arabs want," [...] and that's [...] "not good." ...|$|E

Royce confessed: [...] "Marshall is the studio right now, laying the most awesome lyrics in the world.

6000|$|... "There will {{be plenty}} of time for you, Ralph," [...] his mother said smiling. [...] "Peace has been patched up once or twice, but it never lasts long; and after {{fighting}} for the last twenty years it is hardly probable that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> grow peaceful all at once.

6000|$|... "Oh! God {{bless you}} for that, my dear! God bless you for that! But for pity's sake turn your dear {{eyes away from}} me or I vow I shall go crazy with joy.

6000|$|So that I {{think that}} even if the creeds, from the {{so-called}} [...] "Apostles'" [...] to the so-called [...] "Athanasian," [...] were swept into oblivion; and even if the human race should arrive at the conclusion that, whether a bishop washes a cup or leaves it unwashed, {{is not a matter of}} the least consequence, it will get on very well. The causes which have led to the development of morality in mankind, which have guided or {456} impelled us all the way from the savage to the civilised state, will not cease to operate because a number of ecclesiastical hypotheses turn out to be baseless. And, even if the absurd notion that morality is more the child of speculation than of practical necessity and inherited instinct, had any foundation; if all <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> thieve, murder, and otherwise misconduct itself as soon as it discovers that certain portions of ancient history are mythical; what is the relevance of such arguments to any one who holds by the Agnostic principle? ...|$|E
6000|$|On that evening, at Wharton, Emily {{still wore}} her {{mourning}} dress. No one, indeed, dared {{to speak to}} her on the subject, and Mary was even afraid lest she might appear in black on the following day. We all know in what condition is a house {{on the eve of a}} marriage,--how the bride feels that all <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be changed, and that therefore everything is for the moment disjointed; and how the rest of the household, including the servants, are led to share the feeling. Everett was of course away. He was over at Longbarns with the Fletchers, and was to be brought to Wharton Church on the following morning. Old Mrs. Fletcher was at Wharton Hall,--and the bishop, whose services had been happily secured. He was formally introduced to Mrs. Lopez, the use of the name for the occasion being absolutely necessary, and with all the smiling urbanity which as a bishop he was bound to possess, he was hardly able not to be funereal as he looked at her and remembered her story. Before the evening was over Mrs. Fletcher did venture to give a hint. [...] "We are so glad you have come, my dear." ...|$|E
60|$|First {{among these}} is the habit of {{allowing}} ourselves to be bound {{not only by the}} truths of the Christian religion but by the excesses and extravagances which the Christian movement acquired in its earlier days as a violent reaction against what it still calls paganism. By far the most dangerous of these, because it is a blasphemy against life, and, to put it in Christian terms, an accusation of indecency against God, is the notion that sex, with all its operations, is in itself absolutely an obscene thing, and that an immaculate conception is a miracle. So unwholesome an absurdity could only have gained ground under two conditions: one, a reaction against a society in which sensual luxury had been carried to revolting extremes, and, two, a belief that the world was coming to an end, and that therefore sex was no longer a necessity. Christianity, because it began under these conditions, made sexlessness and Communism the two main practical articles of its propaganda; and it has never quite lost its original bias in these directions. In spite of the putting off of the Second Coming from the lifetime of the apostles to the millennium, and of the great disappointment of the year 1000 A.D., in which multitudes of Christians seriously prepared {{for the end of the}} world, the prophet who announces that the end is at hand is still popular. Many of the people who ridicule his demonstrations that the fantastic monsters of the book of Revelation are among us in the persons of our own political contemporaries, and who proceed sanely in all their affairs on the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> last, really do believe that there will be a Judgment Day, and that it MIGHT even be in their own time. A thunderstorm, an eclipse, or any very unusual weather will make them apprehensive and uncomfortable.|$|E
