40|$|We explore downsampling {{of optical}} {{frequency}} combs {{by way of}} pulse gating for efficient spectral broadening and f- 2 f interferometry. We downsample a 250 MHz repetition-rate comb to 25 MHz, thereby enabling detection of <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> carrier-envelope offset frequency. Pulse gating can both increase timing jitter of <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> pulse train and induce spurious frequency offsets of <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> spectrum. To investigate these effects, we characterize the phase-noise spectrum of <b>the</b> downsampled <b>comb,</b> determine <b>the</b> effects of timing jitter deliberately imposed on the pulse gate, and demonstrate the null frequency shift of <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> optical spectrum {{to the level of}} several microhertz...|$|R

5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>comb</b> rows of most planktonic ctenophores {{produce a}} rainbow effect, {{which is not}} caused by {{bioluminescence}} but by the scattering of light as the combs move. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness. However some significant groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia, are incapable of bioluminescence.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{primitive}} order and members do not extrude their stomach when feeding, lack an anus {{and have no}} suckers on their tube feet.

There is no brachiolaria stage in their larval development. <b>The</b> <b>comb</b> starfish (Astropecten polyacanthus) {{is a member of}} this order.|$|E
40|$|During {{the years}} 2006 - 2010 Gotland University {{conducted}} seminars excavations in Västergarn parish on Gotland.

The questions concern the dating and chronology of <b>the</b> <b>combs,</b> and also how analyzing <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> can provide additional information to Västergarn. The method used is a comparative material - and literature study. The result of the analyze is that <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> are from <b>the</b> transitional period of the Viking - Medieval age, 900 - 1100 th century. A variety of nine different types could be distinguished. I believe that through an osteological –, and contextual spatial analysis and a comparative material study of <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> more information on the site can be presented...|$|R

5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb of {{treeshrews}} is {{like the}} lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> tines, but only two of its three pairs of lower incisors {{are included in the}} toothcomb and the canines are also excluded. The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger. In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb. In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors and a pair of canines.|$|E
5|$|Lobates {{have eight}} comb-rows, {{originating}} at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond {{the body to}} the lobes; in species with (four) auricles, the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> rows. Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water, using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion, although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion. Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly. Unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, yet combs on the same row beat in the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids. This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg-like.|$|E

25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|E

40|$|The {{orientation}} of {{cells in the}} natural honey bee <b>combs</b> attached to <b>the</b> horizontal and sloped surfaces was investigated. 263 samples of newly constructed natural <b>combs</b> were obtained. <b>The</b> {{orientation of}} cells was measured with 1 ° accuracy and every comb was classified as having horizontal, vertical or intermediate type of cell orientation. No statistical difference {{was found in the}} occurrence of three orientation modes for combs with bee cells. A small (10 – 20 %) ad-vantage of vertical orientation in <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> with drone cells was observed. The distribution of cell orientation modes in <b>the</b> naturally-built <b>combs</b> was independent of cell orientation in <b>the</b> neighbouring <b>combs.</b> Most of <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> attached to sloped bars had an intermediate orientation of cells, but an evaluation of their orientation according to the top bar demonstrated that <b>the</b> ma-jority of <b>combs</b> had a “vertical ” orientation with rows of cells parallel to the sloped bar. The regular cell pattern appeared to depend on the starting position on the top bar, not on gravity.

50|$|Inspection of <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> can {{be carried}} out with far less {{disturbance}} to the bees than is the case with multi-storey hives, since only a small amount of the hive is exposed at any one time.

25|$|The nest is {{composed}} of a paper-pulp mixture created by female workers chewing up dead bark, trees, or plant matter from nearby surroundings and mixing it with their saliva. To build the actual comb, saliva {{is used as a}} cement to piece together organic and inorganic materials that are readily available to the colony. This cement not only holds together <b>the</b> <b>comb,</b> but also protects <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> from being damaged by water. It provides a protective barrier to help protect the colony from wind or other harsh weather conditions. Available resources, location, and amount of mastication affect the final nest's appearance, so much variation is seen among the nests of V. crabro.|$|E

25|$|Another {{behavior}} {{observed in}} D. media workers is gastral vibration. This is observed in workers of many Dolichovespula and Vespula species. Workers tap their gaster rapidly {{up and down}} onto <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> of the nest and this is associated with feeding of larvae. The behavior typically occurs while wasps are walking on <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> and ceases after feeding each larvae {{a small amount of}} flesh and then resumes before feeding the next larvae. A behavior that appears to be homologous to this is observed in the foundresses queen and is called tapping. Queens have been observed tapping mid or hind legs on <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> after returning with prey. These taps can last a few seconds to a couple minutes and are loud enough to be heard outside of the nest. This signal is believed to function {{in the same way as}} gastral vibration in workers and is to signal to the larvae when it is time to feed. Sometimes this tapping or vibration occurs even when there is no pellet to feed the larvae and it is speculated that this corresponds to the feeding of liquids, but this has not been confirmed. Tapping continues in the queen even after she has ceased foraging when she feeding larvae pellets that she receives from the workers. This supports the idea that it is involved in signaling larvae during feeding.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{peculiar}} {{characteristics of}} wool fibres, open-end rotor spinning {{system is not}} employed in wool spinning as in cotton.
