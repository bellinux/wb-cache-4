Several independent 6 DOF <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> can be used simultaneously to accomplish the interaction requirements for a given application. The control unit for <b>tracking</b> <b>systems,</b> processing measurements with optional properties as time stamps and quality values is described as well as procedures for the coordinate system alignment of different <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> and the configuration of such a hybrid system. Considerations on the way accuracy errors might increase or decrease by combining <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> are included.

5|$|Bond and Amasova examine Stromberg's {{underwater}} Atlantis {{base from}} an American submarine, and confirm {{that he is}} operating the stolen <b>tracking</b> <b>system.</b> The Liparus captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from British and Soviet submarines to destroy Moscow and New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in Atlantis, and subsequently a new civilisation would be established underwater. He leaves for Atlantis with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian and American sailors and they battle the Liparuss crew. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire missiles at each other, saving Moscow and New York City. The victorious submariners escape the sinking Liparus on the American submarine.|$|E

The plans for a highly advanced submarine <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> are being offered in Egypt. There, he encounters Major Anya Amasova—KGB agent Triple X—his rival to recover the microfilm plans. They travel across Egypt together, encountering Jaws – a tall assassin with razor sharp steel teeth – along the way.

40|$|Abstract. Multi-surface environments {{integrate}} a {{wide variety}} of different devices such as mobile phones, tablets, digital tabletops and large wall displays into a single interactive environment. The interactions in these environments are extremely diverse and should utilize the spatial layout of the room, capabilities of the device, or both. For practical multi-surface environments, using low-cost instrumentation is essential to reduce entry barriers. When building multi-surface environments and interactions based on lower-end <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> (such as the Microsoft Kinect) as opposed to higher-end <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> (such as the Vicon Motion <b>Tracking</b> <b>systems),</b> both developer and hardware issues emerge. Issues such as time and ease to build a multi-surface environment, limited range of lowcost <b>tracking</b> <b>systems,</b> are reasons we created MSE-API. In this paper, we present MSE-API, its flexibility with low-cost <b>tracking</b> <b>systems,</b> and industry-based usage scenarios...|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the RP-77D made {{extensive}} use of glass-polyester plastic materials. The drone was launched using a rocket-assisted take-off system consisting of four Loki rockets, and was fitted with a radio control apparatus that, {{with the assistance of}} radar tracking, allowed the drone to be operated at a considerable distance from its launching point. In addition to equipment typically carried by target drones, the RP-77D could be equipped with reconnaissance or meteorological sensors, or with air sampling equipment. The RP-77D utilised the RPTA <b>tracking</b> <b>system,</b> developed by Radioplane, using audio frequency tones for control.

5|$|The {{novelisation}} and the screenplay, {{although both}} written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the novelisation, SMERSH is still active and after James Bond. Their role begins during the pre-title. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for {{the whereabouts of}} the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts {{with a number of}} Bond stories, including the film The Living Daylights (1987), in which a character remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH {{is said to have been}} put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelisation include Amasova and her lover Sergei Borzov as well as Colonel-General Niktin, a character from Fleming's novel From Russia, with Love who has since become the head of SMERSH. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws into the water.|$|E
5|$|Hitler invited Riefenstahl to {{film the}} 1936 Summer Olympics {{scheduled}} {{to be held in}} Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the International Olympic Committee. She visited Greece to take footage of the route of the inaugural torch relay and the games' original site at Olympia, where she was aided by Greek photographer Nelly's. This material became Olympia, a hugely successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements. She {{was one of the first}} filmmakers to use tracking shots in a documentary, placing a camera on rails to follow the athletes' movement. The film is also noted for its slow motion shots. Riefenstahl played with the idea of slow motion, underwater diving shots, extremely high and low shooting angles, panoramic aerial shots, and <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> shots for allowing fast action. Many of these shots were relatively unheard of at the time, but Leni’s use and augmentation of them set a standard, and is the reason why they are still used to this day. Riefenstahl's work on Olympia has been cited as a major influence in modern sports photography. Riefenstahl filmed competitors of all races, including African-American Jesse Owens in what later became famous footage.|$|E
5|$|The International Air Transport Association (IATA)—an {{industry}} trade organisation representing over 240 airlines (representing 84% of global air traffic)—and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)—the United Nations' civil aviation body—began working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time. The IATA created {{a task force}} (which included several outside stakeholders) to define a minimal set of requirements that any <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> must meet, allowing airlines to decide the best solution to track their aircraft. The IATA's task force planned {{to come up with}} several short-, medium-, and long-term solutions to ensure that information is provided in a timely manner to support search, rescue, and recovery activities in the wake of an aircraft accident. The task force was expected to provide a report to the ICAO on 30 September 2014, but on that day said that the report would be delayed, citing the need for further clarification on some issues. In December 2014, the IATA task force recommended that, within 12 months, airlines track commercial aircraft in no longer than 15-minute intervals, although it still has not released its report and full details of proposed changes. The IATA itself did not support the deadline, which it believes cannot be met by all airlines, but the proposed standard has the support of the ICAO. Although the ICAO can set standards, it has no legal authority and such standards must be adopted by member states.|$|E
