40|$|Side {{effects of}} {{prescribed}} medications {{are a common}} occurrence. Electronic healthcare databases present the opportunity to identify new side effects efficiently but currently the methods are limited due to confounding (i. e. when an association between two variables is identified due to them both being associated to a third variable). In this {{paper we propose a}} proof of concept method that learns common associations and uses this knowledge to automatically refine side effect signals (i. e. exposure-outcome associations) by removing instances of the exposure-outcome associations that are caused by confounding. This leaves the signal instances that are most likely to correspond to <b>true</b> <b>side</b> effect occurrences. We then calculate a novel measure termed the confounding-adjusted risk value, a more accurate absolute risk value of a patient experiencing the outcome within 60 days of the exposure. Tentative results suggest that the method works. For the four signals (i. e. exposure-outcome associations) investigated we are able to correctly filter the majority of exposure-outcome instances that were unlikely to correspond to <b>true</b> <b>side</b> effects. The method is likely to improve when tuning the association rule mining parameters for specific health outcomes. This paper shows that {{it may be possible to}} filter signals at a patient level based on association rules learned from considering patients' medical histories. However, additional work is required to develop a way to automate the tuning of the method's parameters.

30|$|As {{potential}} {{scenarios are}} numerous, the authors generated different wave-phenomena {{that can be}} linked to a peak rainfall or a dam break from the upstream landslides. For the scenario “series 1 ” (Fig.  6), the short-peak release (effectively a second at peak only) shows that the water diverges from the main channel on the right side and flows into another channel about the center of the fan. Another scenario with a slightly larger amount of water (series 2) shows that no spill happens on the <b>true</b> left <b>side</b> of the channel on the fan, but on the <b>true</b> right <b>side,</b> the flow is not constrained in a channel anymore and runs as a sheet-flow over {{a large portion of the}} fan.

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{surfaces}} {{and the way}} they interact with each other during sliding contact can have a direct bearing on the performance of a microelectromechanical (MEMS) device. Therefore, a study was undertaken to characterize the surfaces of LIGA fabricated Ni and Cu components. Sidewall and planar surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Surface roughness was quantified using the AFM. Post-processing (e. g. lapping, removal of polymer film) can profoundly influence the morphology of LIGA components. Edge rounding and smearing of ductile materials during lapping can result in undesirable sidewall morphologies. By judicious selection of AFM scan sizes, the native roughness ({approximately} 10 nm RMS) can be distinguished from that arising due to post processing, e. g. scratches, debris, polymer films. While certain processing effects on morphology such as those due to lapping or release etch can be controlled, the <b>true</b> <b>side</b> wall morphology appears to be governed by the morphology of the polymer mold or by the electroforming process itself, and may be much less amenable to modification...|$|R

And there is more to be said than this. As M. Charles Comte has expressed it: If the strength with which we resent injury were not in the ratio of the personal risk that we run, we should hardly have the means of self-preservation; and if the acts which injure the whole of humanity gave us pain equal to that of acts that injure us directly, we should be of all beings the most miserable, for we should be incessantly tormented by conduct that we should be powerless to turn aside. And again, if the benefits of which we are personally the object did not inspire in us a more lively gratitude than those which we spread over all mankind, we should probably experience few preferences, and extend few preferences to others, and in that case egoism would grow to its most overwhelming proportions.[121] ...|$|R
40|$|Adverse events {{following}} immunisation (AEFI) in the Dutch National Vaccination Programme (RVP) {{have been}} monitored by RIVM since 1962 through an enhanced passive surveillance system. From 1984 onwards evaluation {{is done in}} collaboration with the National Health Council. Reports from health care workers are received mainly by telephone through the operating vaccine information and advisory service. Further data are obtained if necessary from parents, general practitioners, pediatricians etc. After supplementation and verification of data a (working) diagnosis is made and causality assessed. In this report on 1994 an overview of all received AEFI is presented with classification according to case definitions and causality. Reporting bias, background rates of specific events and possible pathophysiology of symptoms are discussed. On a total of approximately 2 million vaccinations 712 AEFI were submitted. Of these 2 %(16) was unclassifiable because of missing information. In 85 %(590) of the classifiable events a possible causal relation with vaccination was established and in 15 %(106) the events were judged to be coincidental.

Thorough evaluation revealed no increase of <b>true</b> <b>side</b> effects after implementation of Hib vaccination in the Netherlands.
