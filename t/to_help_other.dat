5|$|Business school rankings are {{important}} to the various business schools because they are an important marketing tool used to recruit top students, and lure recruiters from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the course of their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>other</b> students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school, and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>other</b> characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> <b>Other</b> companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E

5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> <b>Other</b> conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E

40|$|Individuals prefer helping {{some people}} more that others {{when it comes}} to finding a mate, and these {{preferences}} depend on whether long- or short-term mates are considered. Study 1 (N = 108) examined three theoretical frameworks (inclusive fitness, reciprocal altruism, and parental investment) for understanding why individuals would be more willing <b>to</b> <b>help</b> some individuals find mates instead of others. College participants reported how willing they were <b>to</b> <b>help</b> different types of individuals (e. g., sister, stranger) find a mate. When considering willingness <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>others</b> find a long-term mate, people preferred kin over nonkin, supporting an inclusive fitness model. However, when considering willingness <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>others</b> find short-term mates, people preferred helping people their own age, supporting a reciprocal altruism model. Study 2 (N = 143) replicated this age-cohort effect. Although rates of willingness <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>others</b> find mates were generally low, people were more likely <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>others</b> find a long-term mate than a short-term one...|$|R

25|$|On 9 June 1995, Mr Dixon, aged 47, and {{his wife}} were {{passengers}} on Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 when the aircraft crashed in the Tararua Ranges near Palmerston North. Mr Dixon escaped from the wreckage with fractures. However, despite his injuries, he returned to the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>other</b> passengers trapped in the wreckage. As a result of this selfless action, he was critically burned when a flash fire broke out on the left wing of the aircraft near a hole in the fuselage from which he was helping passengers escape. He was hospitalised and underwent surgery and skin grafts. Mr Dixon remained in a coma, and although he made some initial improvement, his condition worsened and he died two weeks later, the fourth victim of the crash. The situation in which Mr Dixon found himself was extremely dangerous and he displayed great bravery in returning to the aircraft, although injured, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>other</b> passengers which subsequently resulted in the loss of his own life.
