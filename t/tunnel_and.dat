5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it recommended a <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> a central station. However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo <b>Tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E

5|$|The tunnel {{was officially}} opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications Ronald Bye and officially taken into use on 1 June. The tunnel, {{including}} Nationaltheatret, cost NOK 625 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK170 million. At first, the <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Nationaltheatret {{was used by}} commuter trains from Lillestrøm to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and Årnes used the <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> turned at Skøyen. On 27 May 1989, OsloV was closed and all traffic started running via Nationaltheatret.|$|E

5000|$|The Second District {{is known}} as the [...] "Rathole" [...] due the steep grades, 27 <b>tunnels,</b> <b>and</b> {{numerous}} curves which were once this line's signature. While several projects over the span of 60 years eliminated several problem areas, the Southern Railway's line improvement project between 1961 and 1963 is the best known. This project saw numerous cuts and line relocations to bypass <b>tunnels</b> <b>and</b> reduce the steep grades and tight curves. Only <b>Tunnels</b> #22 <b>and</b> #24 at Nemo, Tennessee <b>and</b> <b>Tunnels</b> #25 <b>and</b> #26 at Oakdale remain on the line; all but #25 were built brand-new in the 1960s.|$|R

5|$|In March 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey {{implemented}} a discount on regular toll fees during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an EZ Pass issued in New York State.

5|$|In May 1922, John Hylan {{launched}} a new plan for the freight and passenger <b>tunnel,</b> <b>and</b> the Board of Estimate recommended that $4,080,000 be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority {{refused to accept the}} plan, as they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than the original plan. The original plan would have had the tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a freight yard to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a trunk line would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised plan would only cover the Narrows <b>Tunnel,</b> <b>and</b> a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard.|$|E
