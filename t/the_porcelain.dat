Commensals of this species include certain mollusks, mainly slipper shells (Crepidula spp.) <b>The</b> <b>porcelain</b> crab Porcellana sayana is also {{known to be a}} commensal and a small cardinalfish, known as the conch fish (Astrapogon stellatus), sometimes shelters in the conch's mantle for protection.|$|E

They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as <b>the</b> <b>porcelain</b> crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as mantis shrimps, are carnivores.|$|E

Rose had trained at <b>the</b> Caughley <b>porcelain</b> manufactory in Shropshire and had been making pottery on his own account nearby at Jackfield, a mile upstream across the River Severn from Coalbrookdale, since about 1780. His rapid success enabled him to buy the Caughley manufactory in 1799, <b>the</b> Nantgarw <b>porcelain</b> manufactory in 1819 and <b>the</b> Swansea <b>porcelain</b> manufactory, with their repertory of moulds. He employed William Billingsley, formerly at Nantgarw, as chief painter, and Billingsley's chemist, Walker, who initiated at Coalport a maroon glaze and brought the Nantgarw technical recipes to Rose at Coalport.|$|R
5|$|Rodin's {{relationship}} with Turquet was rewarding: through him, {{he won the}} 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin {{a new level of}} artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at <b>the</b> <b>porcelain</b> factory; his income came from private commissions.|$|E
5|$|A {{meeting was}} held {{after the service}} and a {{detailed}} restoration plan was announced at the meeting along with a list for those wishing to donate to the work. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and the Marquess of Bute were among those who pledged donations sufficient to allow the restoration work to continue immediately. The cathedral was extensively restored, the tower rebuilt and a spire added. Much of the restoration work was completed by local architect John Prichard between 1843 and 1869. A triptych by Dante Gabriel Rossetti was designed {{for use as a}} reredos, and a new stained glass window, Shipwreck of St Paul, was designed by Ford Madox Brown.

5000|$|<b>The</b> Viennese <b>Porcelain</b> Manufactory (German: Kaiserlich privilegierte Porcellain Fabrique) was a {{porcelain}} {{manufacturer in}} Alsergrund in Vienna, Austria.

5000|$|<b>The</b> first soft-paste <b>porcelain</b> of France, and {{specifically}} frit porcelain, was produced at Rouen in 1673, {{in order to}} mimic [...] "la véritable porcelaine de Chine" [...] ("The true <b>porcelain</b> of China"). <b>The</b> new soft-paste <b>porcelain</b> material was invented by the potter Louis Poterat. <b>The</b> soft <b>porcelain</b> used blue designs of the type already used in the faiences of the period.|$|R

25|$|Some {{years later}} <b>the</b> <b>porcelain</b> {{industry}} started to develop, favoured {{by the presence}} of kaolinite which was discovered near Limoges in 1768 (near St Yrieix, south-west of Limoges). Many of the inhabitants became employed in the new sector or in connected activities (including the lumbering of wood needed for firing <b>the</b> <b>porcelain)</b> in manufacture and exporting needed for European distribution of Limoges Boxes, dinnerware, and other porcelain wares. Because the Limousin region has had a long history of breeding (Baronet sheep and Limousine cows), the leather industry also settled in and around Limoges {{along the banks of the}} Vienne–the river providing the necessary water and power. Factories in Limoges and St Junien still produce luxury leather shoes, gloves, and bags.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD), {{porcelain}} wares were being exported to Europe. Some of the most well-known Chinese porcelain art styles arrived in Europe during this era, such as the coveted blue-and-white wares. The Ming Dynasty controlled much of <b>the</b> <b>porcelain</b> trade, which was expanded to Asia, Africa and Europe via the Silk Road. In 1517, Portuguese merchants began direct trade by sea with the Ming Dynasty, and in 1598, Dutch merchants followed.|$|E

25|$|Although Renoir {{displayed}} {{a talent for}} his work, he frequently tired {{of the subject matter}} and sought refuge in the galleries of the Louvre. The owner of the factory recognized his apprentice’s talent and communicated this to Renoir’s family. Following this, Renoir started taking lessons to prepare for entry into Ecole des Beaux Arts. When <b>the</b> <b>porcelain</b> factory adopted mechanical reproduction processes in 1858, Renoir was forced to find other means to support his learning. Before he enrolled in art school, he also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century Limoges saw strong {{construction}} activity, {{which included}} the destruction and rebuilding {{of much of the}} city centre. The unsafe conditions of the poorer population is highlighted by the outbreak of several riots, including that of July–November 1830; April 1848. In early 1905 strikes began in another local industry, shoe factories soon followed in <b>the</b> <b>porcelain</b> factories. Barricades were built, the army intervened. There would be two casualties: a horse and a young porcelain worker, Camille Vardelle. The first French confederation of workers, Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) (General Confederation of Labour), was created in Limoges in 1895.|$|E
25|$|During the Enlightenment era, the {{economic}} situation of Valenciennes was in decline until the discovery of coal. The first pit was dug in Fresnes in 1718 and the discovery of burnable coal in 1734 at the porte d'Anzin {{led to the formation}} of the Compagnie des mines d'Anzin. In the eighteenth century, the city was equally renowned for its porcelain — indeed, it was <b>the</b> <b>porcelain</b> furnaces' demand for coal that led to the mining enterprises. Despite their quality of production, the company failed to be sustainable. Valenciennes, rich in artistic talent, became known as the Athens of the North (i.e. North of France), underlining its artistic influence.|$|E
