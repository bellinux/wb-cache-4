5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related <b>to</b> <b>Idle</b> Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification {{of one of the}} traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E
5|$|On {{an early}} test run the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum power {{output of the}} Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, and the inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E
5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity <b>to</b> <b>idle.</b> Turning the quantity theory on its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E

In addition, rotation transmission was almost prevented by large positioning error.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane {{did not respond to}} his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to the}} left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser. The pilots' comments suggest that the spoilers did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{natural gas}} {{conforms}} to the conditions of environmental protection and renewable energy, which {{plays a significant role}} in the future development of mankind. It has made some progress in applying natural gas to the automotive industry. As we all know that the source power of automobile comes from engine, therefore, based on the study on the control algorithm of gas engine, this paper aims to provide theoretical basis for further application of gas en-gine. This paper analyzed PID control algorithm, fuzzy control algorithm and fuzzy PID control algorithm, designed cor-responding controllers based on the algorithm principles, applied these three algorithms <b>to</b> the <b>idle</b> control process of the automobile gas engine. This paper concluded that the fuzzy PID control algorithm is of higher superiority through con-trastive analysis on the control effects of theses three algorithm in the process of cooling high idle start, switching high <b>idle</b> <b>to</b> low <b>idle</b> and switching low <b>idle</b> <b>to</b> high <b>idle...</b>|$|R

25|$|American Airlines Flight 96, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, on 12 June 1972. The {{failure of}} the rear cargo door caused an {{explosive}} decompression, which in turn caused the rear main cabin floor to collapse and severed flight controls. The pilots had only limited ailerons and elevators; the rudder was jammed. The number two engine also ran down <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> {{at the time of}} decompression. The aircraft landed safely at Detroit-Metropolitan Airport.|$|E
25|$|Executed {{just above}} the runway, the flare arrests the aircraft's descent just prior to touchdown. By raising the aircraft's nose (pitching up) lift {{momentarily}} increases, reducing the descent rate, and allows the main wheels to gently contact the runway. During the flare, pilots retard the throttles <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> to reduce engine thrust. A squat switch in the main landing gear detects the touchdown and automatically deploys the spoilers, if armed. This destroys any remaining lift and helps the aircraft slow down.|$|E
25|$|The {{crash was}} caused {{primarily}} by the aircraft's automated reaction which was triggered by a faulty radio altimeter. This caused the autothrottle to decrease the engine power <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> during approach. The crew noticed this too late to take appropriate action to increase the thrust and recover the aircraft before it stalled and crashed. Boeing has since issued a bulletin to remind pilots of all 737 series and BBJ aircraft {{of the importance of}} monitoring airspeed and altitude, advising against the use of autopilot or autothrottle while landing in cases of radio altimeter discrepancies.|$|E

It was determined that a faulty radar altimeter caused the aircraft to throttle the engines back <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> and that the crew subsequently failed to react properly which resulted in an unrecoverable stall and the subsequent crash. Of the 135 people on board, nine people, including the three pilots, were killed. Eighty-six more people were transported to local hospitals.|$|E
25|$|The {{impacts of}} trust and {{availability}} on performance and development difficulty can influence the choice of whether to deploy onto a dedicated cluster, <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> machines internal to the developing organization, or to an open external network of volunteers or contractors. In many cases, the participating nodes must trust the central system not to abuse the access that is being granted, by interfering with the operation of other programs, mangling stored information, transmitting private data, or creating new security holes. Other systems employ measures {{to reduce the amount}} of trust “client” nodes must place in the central system such as placing applications in virtual machines.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch Safety Board {{stated that}} the {{approach}} was not stabilized so the crew should have initiated a go around. The autopilot followed the glide slope while the autothrottle reduced thrust <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> due to a faulty radio altimeter showing an incorrect height. This caused the airspeed to drop and the pitch attitude to increase all unnoticed by the crew until the stick shaker activated. Prior to this, air traffic control caused the crew to intercept the glide slope from above and this obscured the erroneous autothrottle mode and increased the crew’s workload. The subsequent approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.|$|E
40|$|Long-haul diesel trucks {{carry the}} lion’s share of all shipped {{goods in the}} United States. The drivers of these trucks often live in these trucks for days, {{sometimes}} weeks, at a time as they deliver these goods. When stopped overnight, many of these drivers leave their engines <b>idling</b> <b>to</b> heat or air-condition their cabs and produce power for the amenities they need to carry on their lives while on the road. To {{address the problem of}} environmental degradation due <b>to</b> <b>idling</b> trucks, the EPA and other interested parties are funding the Interstate 5 Idle-Free Corridor project, which is researching ways <b>to</b> reduce truck <b>idling.</b> 	This paper details the Oregon portion of the Interstate 5 Idle-Free Corridor project and the problems related <b>to</b> truck <b>idling</b> along Interstate 5 in Oregon. Interviews with truck owner-operators and fleets uncovered reasons why truckers idle and what they are doing <b>to</b> reduce <b>idling,</b> as well as their views on several idle-reduction technologies. It became clear that many truckers are hesitant to buy in to the place-based technologies that the I- 5 project is supporting because of initial costs and their skepticism that it will be available when and where they need it. The project revealed that most of our respondents preferred on-board technologies that were available at all times, wherever the truck was stopped. 	Analysis and interpretation of the data gathered suggests that policy created <b>to</b> address the <b>idling</b> issue should be flexible enough to allow truckers to use a variety of solutions to reach their goals for idle reduction...|$|R

25|$|Rieve was {{committed}} to organizing new members in the hosiery industry. In November 1930, Rieve authorized a strike among hosiery workers in the mills around Reading, Pennsylvania. The strike collapsed after heavy employer opposition. Rieve then tried a new tactic: The union agreed to a 30 percent wage cut in the expectation that non-union mills would lower their wages below the new union level. This would trigger a massive strike, enabling the AFHW to move in and organize the workers. Roughly 3,000 workers, or {{about a third of}} the total number in the industry, struck. Rieve purposefully withheld strike aid to the workers in an attempt to increase the radicalism of the workers and raise the demand for a union. But employers were content <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> plants in the depths of the Great Depression, and the strike lingered for nearly a year. Admitting defeat, Rieve signed a new contract in September 1932.|$|E
25|$|Born Albert Léon Gleizes {{and raised}} in Paris, {{he was the son}} of a fabric {{designer}} who ran a large industrial design workshop. He was also the nephew of Léon Comerre, a successful portrait painter who won the 1875 Prix de Rome. The young Albert Gleizes did not like school and often skipped classes <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> away the time writing poetry and wandering through the nearby Montmartre cemetery. Finally, after completing his secondary schooling, Gleizes spent four years in the 72nd Infantry Regiment of the French army (Abbeville, Picardie) then began pursuing a career as a painter. Gleizes began to paint self-taught around 1901 in the Impressionist tradition. His first landscapes from around Courbevoie appear particularly inspired by Alfred Sisley or Camille Pissarro. Although clearly related to Pissarro in technique, Gleizes' particular view-points as well as the composition and conception of early works represent a clear departure from the style of late Impressionism. The density with which these works are painted and their solid framework suggest affinities with Divisionism which were often noted by early critics.|$|E
500|$|When not driving, {{truck drivers}} need <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> their engines to {{maintain}} climate control within the truck cab (interior), {{as well as}} provide electricity for appliances. Engine idling is inefficient and only adds to the problem of air pollution. This unnecessary idling can be remedied with shore power (which is a term and idea borrowed from the shipping industry), or Truck Stop Electrification. When ships are docked in a port, they connect to a land-based power supply to provide electricity and eliminate the need <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> their engines. The idea of shore power was transferred to the trucking industry, and now there are companies such as IdleAire and Shorepower which provide electricity to diesel trucks, which eliminates the need for the driver <b>to</b> <b>idle</b> the engine. IdleAire also provides access to the Internet, cable television, and land line phone services. IdleAire promises to eliminate one-eighth of nitrogen oxide pollution through [...] "electrified parking", however, particulate pollution may increase in those areas where the electricity is provided by coal burning power plants. Some drivers are also experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells, which provide clean and silent power for appliances when trucks are not running.|$|E
