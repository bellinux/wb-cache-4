5|$|The Language Movement catalysed <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> Bengali {{national}} identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan, {{and became a}} forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the 6-Point Movement and subsequently the Bangladesh Liberation War and Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. In Bangladesh, 21 February is observed as Language Movement Day, a national holiday. The Shaheed Minar monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College {{in memory of the}} movement and its victims.|$|E
5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E
25|$|Reasons {{for these}} crimes mainly {{revolved}} around the humiliation and <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> dominance over victims rather than the sexual satisfaction of the perpetrators.|$|E

30|$|Let us couple <b>the</b> <b>assertions</b> <b>of</b> Lemmas  5 - 7 by the {{following}} corollary.|$|R
25|$|The {{requirements}} for establishing an aboriginal {{title to the}} land vary across countries, but generally speaking, the aboriginal claimant must establish (exclusive) occupation (or possession) from a long time ago, generally before <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty, and continuity to the present day.|$|E
25|$|The Xhosa did not {{initially}} offer violent resistance against this annexation, {{and they were}} mainly left alone as the governor had other serious matters to contend with, including <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> British authority over the Boers beyond the Orange River, {{and the establishment of}} amicable relations with the Transvaal Boers.|$|E
25|$|SETI {{has also}} {{occasionally}} {{been the target}} of criticism by those who suggest that it is a form of pseudoscience. In particular, critics allege that no observed phenomena suggest the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence, and furthermore that <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence has no good Popperian criteria for falsifiability.|$|E

25|$|In August 2006 Somali {{refugees}} {{appealed for}} protection after 21 Somali traders {{were killed in}} July of that year and 26 more in August. The immigrants believed the murders to be motivated by xenophobia, although police rejected <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> a concerted campaign to drive Somali traders out of townships in the Western Cape.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> the {{privilege}} is not lightly entertained, {{and there are}} multiple administrative hurdles which have to be overcome once it is chosen to be asserted. There are multiple internal reviews, and the court has the final oversight. Still, the Executive Branch is given the utmost deference, and the courts cannot get {{into the business of}} second-guessing national security and foreign policy questions.|$|E
25|$|The {{preservation}} of the wood bison in northern Canada was implied by the strict federal control of traditional Aboriginal hunting practices {{through the creation of}} a wildlife sanctuary. The federal government proposed large scale ranching and breeding plans for bison herds. Preservationist approaches to the bison in the north implied <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> federal power over the bison which had been under the control of Aboriginal hunters for generations. There was no role for the human use of nature.|$|E

25|$|Before Irenaeus, Christians {{differed}} as {{to which}} gospel they preferred. The Christians of Asia Minor preferred the Gospel of John. The Gospel of Matthew {{was the most popular}} overall. Irenaeus asserted that four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were canonical scripture. Thus Irenaeus provides the earliest witness to <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> the four canonical Gospels, possibly in reaction to Marcion's edited version of the Gospel of Luke, which Marcion asserted was the one and only true gospel.|$|E
25|$|Pullen often {{polarized}} {{critics and}} suffered from two undeserved allegations: the first (despite his grounding {{in the church}} and blues) that he was purely a free jazz player and thus unemployable in any other context; the second that he had been heavily influenced by Cecil Taylor or was a clone of Taylor, to whose playing Pullen's own bore a superficial resemblance. Pullen strenuously denied that he had any link with Taylor, stating that his own style had been developed in isolation before he ever heard of Taylor. But <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> Taylor's influence continued to haunt Pullen to the end of Pullen's life, and persists even to this day.|$|E
25|$|According to Nawaz, {{nationalism}} hinders {{the fight}} against Islamist extremism, and democratic states must adopt a transnational outlook to combat this challenge. He also termed nationalism a corrosive ideology that led to two World Wars, and advocates a citizenship model for states {{which is based on}} allegiance, instead of race or religion. Nawaz is also a critic of far-right movements that have emerged in Europe, and accuses them of harbouring disdain for ordinary Muslims. According to him, far-right xenophobes and Islamists agree upon one thing: the impossibility of Muslim and non-Muslim cohabitation in Europe. As a solution, he proposes <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> liberalism which can shine through the fogs of these extremes.|$|E

25|$|The Democrats reconvened in Columbia for the nominating {{convention}} held on August 15 through August 17. Since the Republicans {{had yet to}} meet, the candidacy of Governor Chamberlain was uncertain, {{which also}} undermined the Fusionists. Straightouts had been rallied by <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> white supremacy by white paramilitary groups of Red Shirts, who killed seven blacks in Hamburg, five of them murdered outright while held as prisoner by whites. One white died in the confrontation. The first test of Straightout strength in the Democratic Party was {{the election of the}} President of the Convention. By a vote of 80 to 66, the Straightout candidate was elected and after a secret session, the nomination process began.|$|E
25|$|Reid was criticised, {{partly for}} his {{critique}} of Hume, by Kant and J. S. Mill, who {{were two of the}} most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> a priori knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.|$|E
25|$|In {{continental}} Europe, {{the revival}} {{and preservation of}} national styles was an important motive of Arts and Crafts designers; for example, in Germany, after unification in 1871 under the encouragement of the Bund für Heimatschutz (1897) and the Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk founded in 1898 by Karl Schmidt; and in Hungary Károly Kós revived the vernacular style of Transylvanian building. In central Europe, where several diverse nationalities lived under powerful empires (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), {{the discovery of the}} vernacular was associated with <b>the</b> <b>assertion</b> <b>of</b> national pride and the striving for independence, and, whereas for Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain the ideal style was {{to be found in the}} medieval, in central Europe it was sought in remote peasant villages.|$|E
