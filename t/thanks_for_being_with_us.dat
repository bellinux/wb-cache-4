Holding hands, they look into each other's eyes and then with less than a second left, Castle yanks all the wires out, miraculously defusing the bomb as the timer hits 0:00. Relieved, he and Beckett hug. At the end of the day, Castle walks to the elevator, leaving Beckett and Josh to themselves. As Beckett is hugging Josh, she looks on at Castle until he's in the elevator.

I created a program that takes both geometrical information from images, and semantic information from texts and outputs classification of relations for each object in the images. The baseline of only using geometrical features is improved on by using bag-of-words features based on the articles, and further enhanced by utilizing predicate information.

5000|$|The European ex voto {{tradition}} was introduced {{shortly after the}} Conquest with the earliest known to exist dating from the 1590s.

As in Europe, the tradition began with wealthy families having depictions of saints painted with the narrative version coming shortly thereafter. In a number of respects, the Mexican Catholic ex voto tradition is a blending of the European and Mesoamerican traditions, especially in the early colonial period. Many ex votos are dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe, who is often considered to be a transfiguration of the mother goddess Tonantzin. On some depictions of saints from this time can be seen fangs, which are associated with Quetzalcoatl [...] [...] Since the establishment of the Mexican Catholic ex voto, the tradition has remained intact to the present day with relatively little change.|$|R
