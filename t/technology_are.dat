Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes.
