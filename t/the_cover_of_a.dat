5|$|After parting {{with former}} label Capitol Records, {{the album was}} the first of two Megadeth studio albums to be {{released}} by Sanctuary. It was the last of two studio albums to feature drummer Jimmy DeGrasso and the only one to feature Al Pitrelli on lead guitar. Furthermore, The World Needs a Hero was the last album with original bassist David Ellefson until his return to Megadeth in 2010. Additionally, mascot Vic Rattlehead appears on <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Megadeth album {{for the first time since}} Rust in Peace (1990).|$|E
5|$|At Nhu's request, Tung was {{reported}} to have been planning an operation under <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> government-organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy, Saigon. In this plan, Tung's men would assassinate ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. and other key officials among the confusion. Another target was the Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang, who had been given asylum in the embassy after being targeted in the pagoda raids. According to the plan, Tung's men would then burn down the embassy.|$|E

5|$|Images of Norman {{have been}} used to attract {{attention}} by some outside of the Unarius Academy of Science. In 1996, an MTV executive viewed a picture of Norman and decided to use her image in an advertising campaign for the MTV Music Video Awards. The network contacted the Unarius Academy of Science and received permission to use a look-alike in their promotions. In 2000, Norman was featured on <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> , <b>a</b> book about personalities with fringe beliefs.|$|E

40|$|Fibonacci strings {{turn out}} to {{constitute}} worst cases for <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> computer algorithms which find generic patterns in strings. Examples of such patterns are repetitions, Abelian squares, and "covers".

5|$|Taylor re-emerged {{into the}} public eye in July 2006, after {{appearing}} on <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Sports Illustrated issue dedicated to former athletes and sport figures. In the magazine, Taylor credited his hobby of golf with helping him get over his previous hard-partying ways and drug filled lifestyle. He co-founded eXfuze, a network marketing company based in West Palm Beach, Florida. Along with former NFL players, such as Eric Dickerson and Seth Joyner, he was a spokesman for Seven+, the flagship multi-botanical drink produced by the company. His son Brandon signed a national letter {{to play with the}} Purdue Boilermakers. Taylor was a contestant on the 8th season of Dancing with the Stars, partnered with Edyta Śliwińska. He was eliminated in the seventh week on the April 21, 2009 show.|$|E

Kenny returns as a zombie again, but a statue lands on him, followed by an airplane.|$|E
5|$|The ramparts of Le Quesnoy clearly made {{a frontal}} attack {{undesirable}} and artillery {{could not be}} used on the town, due to the presence of the civilian population. Instead, it was intended that under <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smokescreen, the town be enveloped from the north and south, thereby encircling it. Two New Zealand brigades were to be involved; Hart's Rifle Brigade was tasked with the capture of the town, while the 1st Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier General Charles Melvill, was to push into the Mormal Forest. The division's flanks were held by the 62nd Division and the 37th Division, on the left and right respectively and these formations were to make corresponding movements forward.|$|E
40|$|This note corrects {{an error}} in a paper {{recently}} published in this journal (An optimal algorithm to compute all <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> string, Inform. Process. Lett. 50 (5) (1994) 239 – 246). The correction consists primarily <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new subalgorithm which is called by COMPUTE-COVERS, the main algorithm presented in the paper referenced. It {{turns out that the}} new subalgorithm is itself sufficient to solve the original problem — that is, to compute all <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given string in time linear in the string length — and so it is presented here as a self-contained algorithm in its own right...|$|R

5|$|Throughout 8 April, the Australians were {{subjected}} to heavy shellfire from German forces. At approximately 22:00, the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack under <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> barrage of bombs and trench mortars against A Company's position at the mill. They had some initial success and entered the forward posts of the mill, which were occupied by a platoon of Newland's men {{under the command of}} Sergeant John Whittle. Newland, bringing up a platoon from the battalion's reserve company, charged the attackers and re-established the lost ground with Whittle's assistance. The 12th Battalion was relieved by the 11th Battalion on 10 April, having succeeded in capturing Boursies at the cost of 240 casualties, of which 70 were killed or missing.|$|E
5|$|An attack {{had been}} planned for 18 September but was {{postponed}} due to the poor weather. On 25 September, the attack went ahead. It was intended to extend the front to high ground that was known as Factory Corner. The high ground was undefended, and the 1st Brigade easily captured it under <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> creeping barrage. Two days later, Factory Corner formed the launchpad for a further attack by the brigade and the neighbouring 55th Division on two more trenchlines, designated Gird Trench and Gird Support. This time, the attack was not as straightforward and it took an extra day before the entire objective was in New Zealand hands. On 1 October, as a preliminary to the Battle of Le Transloy, 2nd Brigade's Otago and Canterbury battalions captured strongpoints near Eaucourt L'Abbaye, which fell to the 47th Division two days later.|$|E
5|$|As Karlsruhe steamed to Barbados on {{the night}} of 4 November, a {{spontaneous}} internal explosion destroyed the ship. The hull was split in half; the bow section quickly sank and took with it Köhler and most of the crew. The stern remained afloat long enough for 140 of the ship's crew to escape onto the attending colliers. Commander Studt, the senior surviving officer, took charge and placed all of his men aboard the liner Rio Negro. He scuttled the second collier and steamed north for Iceland. The ship used <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major storm to slip through the British blockade of the North Sea, and put in at Ålesund, Norway. Rio Negro then returned to Germany by early December. The Admiralstab, unaware of the loss of Karlsruhe, coincidentally radioed the ship to order her to return to Germany. Germany kept the loss of the ship a secret, and the British continued searching for her until they learned of her fate in March 1915. Köhler's widow christened the cruiser Karlsruhe, the third to bear the name, at her launching in August 1927.|$|E
50|$|In the evening, under <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intense cannonade, <b>the</b> ships' boats went ashore and {{captured}} the castle against little resistance. The Spanish prisoners {{were put on}} board HMS Flamborough and taken away to Edinburgh.|$|R

5|$|At Rahul Arora's (Samir Soni) fashion show, Meghna meets supermodel Shonali Gujral (Kangana Ranaut) and is {{ridiculed}} by the show's choreographer, Christine, {{and told}} to have her portfolio photographed by Kartik (Rohit Roy). To afford Kartik's fees, Meghna shoots a lingerie advertisement; she is mentored by another aspiring model, Janet (Mugdha Godse). Meghna's lingerie photos appear on <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> magazine; her relatives in Mumbai see the cover and ask her to leave the house. She moves into an apartment with Maanav. Meghna is noticed by Anisha Roy (Kitu Gidwani), an executive at Panache, a major modeling agency. Anisha introduces her to her superior, Abhijit Sarin (Arbaaz Khan), who is impressed by Meghna's ambition and confidence. Panache's top model is Shonali, but her drug abuse becomes problematic. Abhijit includes Meghna in a fashion show organised by Vinay Khosla, but is replaced after a misunderstanding. Abhijit consoles her, and decides to replace Shonali with Meghna as Panache's new top model.|$|E
5|$|In 1271, Niccolò, Maffeo and Marco Polo {{embarked}} on their voyage to fulfil Kublai's request. They sailed to Acre, and then rode on camels to the Persian port of Hormuz. The Polos wanted to sail straight into China, but the ships {{there were not}} seaworthy, so they continued overland through the Silk Road, until reaching Kublai's summer palace in Shangdu, near present-day Zhangjiakou. In one instance during their trip, the Polos joined a caravan of travelling merchants whom they crossed paths with. Unfortunately, the party was soon attacked by bandits, who used <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sandstorm to ambush them. The Polos managed to fight and escape through a nearby town, but {{many members of the}} caravan were killed or enslaved. Three and a half years after leaving Venice, when Marco was about 21 years old, the Polos were welcomed by Kublai into his palace. The exact date of their arrival is unknown, but scholars estimate it to be between 1271 and 1275. On reaching the Yuan court, the Polos presented the sacred oil from Jerusalem and the papal letters to their patron.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 July the Japanese {{attacked}} the main position Kokoda. There were only 80 men from 'B' Company left at that time, and armed only with small arms and a few Bren light machine guns, they were {{no match for the}} assaulting Japanese. Casualties on both sides were high as the Australians resorted to hand-to-hand combat, and the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, who had flown in to take over the battalion following Templeton's death, was killed while organising the withdrawal. It became clear that Kokoda was lost and the following morning, under <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dense mist, with the PIB's commanding officer, Major William Watson, assuming temporary command, the survivors abandoned the position and fell back towards the village of Deniki, a mile or so back along the Kokoda Track towards Isurava.|$|E

5|$|Other {{options were}} explored, {{including}} the Kalmyk Project, a Soviet plan {{to launch a}} surprise attack on the north-west frontier of India via Tibet and other Himalayan buffer states such as Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Thailand, and Burma through the Buddhist Kalmyk people. The intention was to use these places as a staging ground for revolution in India, as they offered the shortest route to the revolutionary heartland of Bengal. Historians suggest that the plan may have been prompted by Mahendra Pratap's efforts and advice to the Soviet leadership in 1919 when—along with other Indian revolutionaries—he pressed for a joint Soviet-Afghan campaign into India. Under <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scientific expedition to Tibet headed by Indologist Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, {{the plan was to}} arm the indigenous people in the North-East Indian region with modern weaponry. The project had the approval of Lenin.|$|E
