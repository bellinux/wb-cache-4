5|$|A {{few days}} {{after the end of the}} Battle of Vukovar, there were 2,000 detainees in <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> Detainees usually spent several days in <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> during which some of them were interrogated, beaten and killed. Up to 10,000 detainees passed through <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> before it was closed in March 1992, when the United Nations Protection Force {{deployed}} to the area. Anywhere between 15 and 800 inmates may have been killed at <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> though the latter figure includes approximately 700 people who are missing and presumed dead. The events in <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> formed part of three indictments issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. , two of the trials are ongoing, while the trial of Slobodan Milošević was terminated following his death.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> at which point many of the Persian army fled from <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|During {{her stay}} at <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> she would alert the prisoners to the {{approach}} of the Japanese guards and also if other animals such as snakes or scorpions were around. She also made excursions from <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> looking for food, and would bring back rats and snakes to Williams. Judy had another group of puppies, of which five survived. One of them was given to <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> Commandant as promised and another puppy was smuggled into the women's camp along with any food that the men could spare. A further puppy was given to the Red Cross in Medan, one more was beaten to death by a drunken guard, and the final one remained in <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> after Judy and Williams left.|$|E
25|$|From 1930 to 1931 {{during the}} Pacification, 12,000 Cyrenaicans were {{executed}} {{and all the}} nomadic peoples of northern Cyrenaica were forcefully removed from the region and relocated to huge concentration <b>camps</b> in <b>the</b> Cyrenaican lowlands. Propaganda by the Fascist regime declared <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> to be oases of modern civilization that were hygienic and efficiently run - however in reality <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> had poor sanitary conditions as <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> {{had an average of}} about 20,000 Beduoins together with their camels and other animals, crowded into an area of one square kilometre. <b>The</b> <b>camps</b> held only rudimentary medical services, with <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> of Soluch and Sisi Ahmed el Magrun with an estimated 33,000 internees having only one doctor between them. Typhus and other diseases spread rapidly in <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> as <b>the</b> people were physically weakened by meagre food rations provided to them and forced labour. By <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> closed in September 1933, 40,000 of the 100,000 total internees had died in <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b>|$|R

50|$|After {{carrying}} Adidas sponsorship {{during its}} early years, the company switched to Nike sponsorship in 1994, and now about 70 percent of <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> carry <b>the</b> Nike name.

5|$|In {{the course}} of the war, <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> was staffed by 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), {{approximately}} 12 percent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> and their failure to bomb <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> or its railways remains controversial. One hundred forty-four prisoners are known to have escaped from Auschwitz successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units—prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers—launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>camp</b> {{included}} {{dining and}} recreation facilities, such as dance halls and sports fields. During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> {{was subject to}} a short military occupation when it served as a Naval training base, reverting to being a holiday camp in 1946. Over the past 75 years <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> has seen continuous use and development, in the mid-1980s {{and again in the}} late 1990s being subject to substantial investment and redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|The camp's director, Mr. Black, has {{licensed}} Krusty's {{name from}} the comedian. The campers find out that <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> is a dystopia.

50|$|The Army {{had three}} {{reasons for the}} {{establishment}} of <b>the</b> two <b>camps.</b> <b>The</b> first was to help escort wagon trains south into Indian Territory, where Indians loyal to the Confederacy attacked Union wagon trains. A second use for <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> was to be a place to send tired cavalry horses. The area west of <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> had much grass. The soldiers from <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> were needed to guard the horses.|$|R
500|$|A. Yes, that as well, I {{must say}} that, too.

50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of <b>the</b> <b>Camping</b> Area and <b>the</b> local weather {{conditions}} there are frequently total fire bans in <b>the</b> <b>camping</b> area.|$|R
5|$|The local Partisans {{had been}} advised of the {{presence}} of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and the children, probably by Branko Davila, a doctor who had worked at the pre-existing children's home on <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> site. At dawn on 26August 1942, the Partisan 4th Kordun Brigade attacked <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and dispersed the Ustaše guard force. The children heard the shooting and began shouting that the Partisans had arrived. Despite attempts by the nuns to hide the children, Partisan troops broke into the buildings and rescued many children. Some of the fighters even found a brother or sister within <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> The Partisans gave what food they had to the children, and led away from <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> all the children that could walk.|$|E
5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|According to Fumić, {{the weaker}} and ill {{children}} were lodged with compassionate local peasants, but 350 {{of the strongest}} children were taken away by the fighters. According to Lukić, a total of 727 children were liberated from <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> but at the first rest stop at Svetojanska, medical examinations by Davila identified about 400 weak and sick children who could no longer walk, and they were returned to Jastrebarsko. Davila estimates {{the number of children}} actually liberated from <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> at around 400.|$|E

5000|$|As of late 2012, <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> held an {{estimated}} 108,000 refugees. In September 2012, a Hepatitis E outbreak {{was reported in}} <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} the Lost Boys and Girls to <b>the</b> refugee <b>camps</b> in Ethiopia and Kenya was welcomed to various degrees. Providing {{sufficient}} food to <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> as hundreds of Boys would arrive together {{on a regular basis}} was extremely difficult, and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and involved non-governmental organizations were often constrained {{to meet the needs of}} the population. A problem unique to the story of the Lost Boys is how the age and family structure dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> changed with <b>the</b> influx of young people. The Lost Boys came to <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> without guardians or adult supervision. They immediately required housing and schooling, which changed the allocation of resources in <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> With some of the Boys arriving in <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> at ages as young as 6 or 7, many of the Boys spent the majority of their childhood and adolescence being raised in <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b>|$|R
5|$|According {{to a local}} atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in shape, with avenues {{radiating}} out {{towards the}} sides. An open space for worshiping was on <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> meeting site, and it was surrounded by more tents. When this area was filled up, more people would set up tents along the avenues that radiated outward from <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|E
5|$|As American forces {{continued}} to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan camp, over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October1944, leaving over 500sick, weak, or disabled POWs. On January6, 1945, {{all of the}} guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone. The guards had previously told prisoner leaders {{that they should not}} attempt to escape, or else they would be killed. When the guards left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all. Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food. Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in twocarabaos to slaughter. The meat from the animals, along with the food secured from the Japanese side of <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> helped many of the POWs to regain their strength, weight, and stamina. In mid-January, a large group of Japanese troops entered <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and returned the prisoners to their side of <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> The prisoners, fueled by rumors, speculated that they would soon be executed by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|As Soviet troops {{approached}} Auschwitz in January 1945, most of {{its population}} was sent west on a death march. The prisoners remaining at <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> were liberated on 27 January 1945, a day now commemorated as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the following decades, survivors, such as Primo Levi, Viktor Frankl, and Elie Wiesel, wrote memoirs of their experiences in Auschwitz, and <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947, Poland founded the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum {{on the site of}} Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979, it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.|$|E

50|$|On 19 April {{units of}} the 15th Panzergrenadier Division {{positioned}} tanks and artillery next to <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> <b>The</b> remaining prisoners responded {{to the threat of}} a pitched battle on their doorstep by digging slit trenches. The artillery fired from the positions next to <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> but fortunately had moved away by the time the British Guards Armoured Division liberated <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> on 27 April 1945.|$|R
50|$|A lengthy {{analysis}} {{published on}} 26 May by Human Rights Watch reported {{the presence of}} leading government officials at <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> while detainees were being tortured.

5|$|At 07:00 on {{the morning}} of 25 November, the Portuguese {{garrison}} at Ngomano received word from a British intelligence officer that an attack was about to commence. Nevertheless, when the attack came they were unprepared. In order to distract Pinto and his men, the Germans shelled <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> from across the river with high explosive rounds. While the artillery attacked <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> the Germans moved their forces upstream and crossed the Rovuma safely out sight of Pinto and his men. The Portuguese did not resist von Lettow-Vorbeck's forces when they crossed the river and remained encamped at Ngomano. The Germans were easily able to flank the Portuguese positions and completely envelop them with six companies of German infantry attacking <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> from the south, south-east and west.|$|E
5|$|At its peak, <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> held 8,000American {{soldiers}} (along with a {{small number}} of soldiers and civilians from other nations including the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands), making it the largest POW camp in the Philippines. This number dropped significantly as able-bodied soldiers were shipped to other areas in the Philippines, Japan, Japanese-occupied Taiwan, and Manchukuo to work in slave labor camps. As Japan had not yet ratified the Geneva Convention, the POWs were transported out of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and forced to work in factories to build Japanese weaponry, unload ships, and repair airfields.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} the reorganized Lithuanians {{returned}} to the battle, attacking von Jungingen from the rear. The Teutonic forces were by then becoming outnumbered by the mass of Polish knights and advancing Lithuanian cavalry. As von Jungingen attempted {{to break through the}} Lithuanian lines, he was killed. According to Cronica conflictus, Dobiesław of Oleśnica thrust a lance through the Grand Master's neck, while Długosz presented Mszczuj of Skrzynno as the killer. Surrounded and leaderless, the Teutonic Knights began to retreat. Part of the routed units retreated towards their camp. This move backfired when <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> followers turned against their masters and joined the manhunt. The knights attempted to build a wagon fort: <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> was surrounded by wagons serving as an improvised fortification. However, the defense was soon broken and <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> was ravaged. According to Cronica conflictus, more Knights died there than on the battlefield. The battle lasted for about ten hours.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>camps</b> on <b>the</b> hills {{at night}} swarmed {{with men in}} hot debate.

5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips to and from <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it {{had picked up the}} final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|E
5|$|Baden-Powell invited {{boys from}} {{different}} social backgrounds to <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> a revolutionary idea during the class-conscious Edwardian era. Eleven {{came from the}} well-to-do private boarding schools of Eton and Harrow, mostly sons of Baden-Powell's friends. Seven came from the Boys' Brigade at Bournemouth, and three came from the Brigade at Poole & Hamworthy. Baden-Powell's nine-year-old nephew Donald Baden-Powell also attended. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> fee was dependent on means: one pound for the public school boys, and three shillings and sixpence for the others.|$|E
