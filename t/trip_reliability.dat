In addition, {{the conversion of the}} Suncoast Parkway to AET will occur concurrent with the expansion into Citrus County, thereby providing enhanced benefits to drivers using the entire Toll 589 corridor. The project introduces Express Lanes (also known as Managed Lanes) to the region. A congestion management tool (which is already in place along parts of I-95 and I-595 in Miami), Express Lanes offer motorists a choice that provides an opportunity for a faster through-trip, with greater <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> and safety. All-Electronic tolling is being implemented in segments while the widening project continues. This latter process began in June, 2014.|$|E
5000|$|A {{limitation}} of implementing a reversible flow design {{is that it}} cannot serve congestion that may {{be present in the}} off-peak traffic direction. If such is the case, then some users, such as deadheading transit buses that need <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> to make a second peak direction run during the commute period, will be adversely impacted. All freeway reversible lanes must be separated by [...] "Jersey" [...] barriers in a high-speed roadway setting (which is not the case on arterial treatments). They are typically constructed in the median of freeway facilities and may be one, two or more lanes wide. These characteristics have several associated advantages and disadvantages. A facility that changes direction to serve morning and afternoon traffic can be an efficient solution since it allocates capacity specifically to the most congested direction of travel. Reversible lanes offer a much higher guaranteed level of service for transit since side friction from adjacent traffic is removed. Some locales, notably Houston, implemented reversible lanes to address the peak direction alone since width was not available to address both directions of travel. Adapting a reversible flow lane or roadway into a freeway typically requires rebuilding most bridges with center columns. A disadvantage of reversible lanes is the ongoing cost of daily surveillance and lane/ramp reversal activities. These treatments must be designed to prevent wrong way movements, requiring extensive and redundant ITS and traffic control device treatments for each opening, plus a staff compliment who must visually inspect the roadway prior to each opening period. Tolling and enforcement is made easier by the barrier environment in which a single field location can be identified to monitor and/or toll all traffic flow.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of the {{benefits}} of government modernization initiatives for airports or air traffic control are conducted using complex software models that simulate up to 60, 000 flights per day. These flight-centric simulations do not model passenger flows and therefore do not account for passenger trip delays due to cancelled flights and missed connections, which account for up to 60 % of the total passenger trip delays. This paper describes a closed-form model for estimating passenger <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> metrics from flight delay data from system-wide simulations. The outputs of the model, (i) percent passengers disrupted, (ii) average passenger trip delay, and (iii) total passenger trip delays, are derived from the probability of delayed flights and network structure parameters. The model highlights the role of network structure, in addition to flight on-time performance, on passenger <b>trip</b> <b>reliability.</b> These results have implications for government and industry initiatives to improve flight on-time performance through modernization, consumer protection, and the conduct of benefits analysis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{developed}} {{an approach to}} model network performance when its link capacities are subject to stochastic degradations, as {{in the form of}} day-to-day traffic incidents, which cause travel time variability. We postulate that drivers would select routes to lower their travel time variability, just as they would to lower their mean travel time. Over time, commuters learn the routes' travel time variability based on past experiences, factor such variability into their route choice considerations, and settle into a long-term equilibrium pattern, We characterize this route choice behavior in the face of uncertain travel times with the notion of probabilistic user equilibrium (PUE). This study then defined and formulated PUE with a reliability approach. We developed a pair of network analysis and design models to consider <b>trip</b> time <b>reliability</b> in a network with stochastic link capacities. The final result is nonlinear mathematical programs that relate the <b>trip</b> time <b>reliability</b> measure to travel demand and stochastic link capacity degradations.

50|$|The most {{important}} prerequisite condition necessary for managed lane demand to materialize {{is the presence}} of recurring traffic congestion. Managed lanes are by definition a congestion management strategy and have benefits that are only fully realized in the context of frequent traffic congestion that causes significant travel time delays and uncertainty over <b>trip</b> time <b>reliability.</b> Although there is no broadly accepted definition of what constitutes traffic congestion, congestion is generally identified as a breakdown in the flow of traffic and a reduction in vehicle speeds caused by traffic demand approaching or exceeding available roadway capacity. These situations generally correspond to a level of service of D or worse (on a scale A-F, with A being highest) and average travel speeds of 30 mph or less, although {{this does not mean that}} other scenarios are not suitable for managed lane strategies.|$|R
30|$|Transportation {{networks}} are a critical infrastructure {{with an enormous}} impact on local, national, and international economies [1, 2]. At the micro-level, the commuting time impacts the economy and the shape of cities [3], directly influencing our life style and choices [4]. At the macro-level the travel time regulates trade and stimulates economic activities [5]. Railroads, when correctly developed, foster interregional trades within the country, and increase income levels within the city boundaries [6]. Whether we are traveling in crowded coaches of the commuters rail during rush hours or in the long-medium high speed train <b>trips,</b> the <b>reliability</b> of the transportation system is a key factor in determining travel behavior [7]. The travel time unreliability in rail service can have substantial consequences for its users [8] and the growth of cities [9]. Delays are one of the causes that corrupt the travel time reliability of the transportation systems. To address delay propagation, traditional approaches apply either stochastic models [10] or use propagation algorithms on a timed event graph representation of a scheduled railway system [11]. Complex equations describing delay were obtained and solved by means of iterative refinement algorithms to predict positive delays in urban trains [12], while traffic control models were proposed to manage the safety of timetables after perturbations occur [13].|$|R

Under HOT lane operational scheme, a Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV) can pay to access HOT lanes in exchange of travel time saving or enhanced <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> when excess HOT lane capacity is available. Compared with regular freeway facilities, HOT lane systems demonstrate unique characteristics in facility capacity, driver behavior, travel pattern, demand modeling, and <b>trip</b> <b>reliability.</b> This study aims at conducting a comprehensive performance analysis on two representative HOT lane systems of State Route 167 in Washington and I- 394 MnPass in Minnesota based on the field data collected from traffic sensors and transponder toll tags. Performance measurements are proposed to quantify the quality of service for HOT lane operations. Three critical issues are addressed in this study: 1) the speed-flow relationships in HOT lane systems, 2) quantified system-wide travel time savings and travel time reliability achieved, 3) SOVs tolling incentives. Based on the empirical analysis and evaluation results for the SR 167 and I- 394 MnPass HOT lane systems, operational problems and challenges are also identified. Although the HOT lane system preserves favorable travel reliability, under-utilized HOT lane capacities were observed. The existing tolling strategies may be modified for better SOV allocation for HOT lane usages and further optimize the overall HOT system operations. The research findings greatly advance our understanding on HOT lane system operation mechanisms and are complementary to the freeway facility performance analysis provided by Highway Capacity Manual 2000...|$|E

30|$|From {{the results}} calculated, {{we can see}} that the entire RPS {{reliability}} is 0.215. Reactor <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> is 0.33, which is higher than the ESF Reliability 0.10. The low reliability of node B 5 causes low reliability of ESF, which led to a lower reliability of RPS. In engineering practice, if we want to improve the reliability of RPS, increasing the reliability of the node B 5 is particularly important. If we improve the reliability of the node B 5 to 0.90 by means, the ESF calculated reliability will be 0.325, compared with 0.10 before optimization significantly improved. Therefore, this method can not only calculate the reliability of RPS but also apply to work in the engineering aspects for fault diagnosis.|$|E

It {{is based on}} an underlying MIT study commissioned by members of the short line railroading industry, including the American Short Line Rail Road Association, and RaiLinc Corporation, a company that provides many railroad-related services. The data for this thesis is provided by several short lines through RaiLinc Corporation, which gathers and releases the data. Data from a 90 -day window is gathered for 39 shipping lanes spread amongst several short line railroads, with a total of 6, 747 movements analyzed. In addition, two shipping lanes of 69 total movements that were provided for preliminary analysis are presented in greater detail. Two short lines have also provided their own multiyear data on car movements. The significant result of this thesis is that there is an average time from shipper to customer of 8. 3 days per load, {{with a standard deviation of}} 4. 3 days. There is an average 2 -day percentage, or highest percentage of loads to arrive in any 2 -day window, of 44. 7 %.

S., Computer Science) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009 Hundreds of {{landslides}} are mobilized along highway corridors {{that can}} affect public safety {{as well as the}} <b>trip</b> quality, <b>reliability</b> and maintenance cost of the transportation network. Caltrans GeoResearch Group pioneered the project to identify the landslides along California State Highways. 187 out of 1200 miles of identified landslide-prone corridors were mapped between 1999 and 2006 by Caltrans GeoResearch Group with the help of California Geological Survey. These landslides were captured in ESRI Shape file that can be viewed in ArcMap Viewer or other common GIS Software. The task is to convert 3 out of 7 shape file generated from prior study into a web-base tool using Google Maps. This web-based system will map all 1200 miles of Landslide prone State wide Highways with detailed information of subset of 187 miles of these corridors. Landslides will be displayed in the map as polygons in different colors based on their type and activity {{so that they can be}} easily identified. Information about each landslide including links to relevant reports will be presented to the user through Google Maps Info-Window. The web-based system will also have the capability to generate reports summarizing landslide information in tables and map, based on different user defined criteria. The system will also have a photo placemark capability, allowing a user to view photo image files relevant to the particular landslide.

40|$|Transportation {{modeling}} frameworks {{assume that}} travelers are economically rational; they choose the lowest cost alternative {{to complete a}} desired <b>trip.</b> <b>Reliability</b> of travel time is of critical importance to travelers. Being able to quantify reliability allows planners to estimate more accurately how system performance influences local travel behavior and to evaluate more appropriately potential investments in transportation system infrastructure. In this paper, we present a methodology that makes use of automatic vehicle location (AVL) data from the Regional Municipality of Waterloo to estimate the reliability of transit service. Based on these data, we quantify the impacts of unreliable service on generalized transit user costs through a simulation model of bus arrivals and passengers ’ desired arrival times. We show that increasing reliability of arrivals at a station can decrease transit users generalized costs significantly, {{by as much as}} 15 % in a reasonably reliable network. We further posit that including uncertainty in the calculation of generalized costs may provide better estimates for mode split in travel forecasting models. We conclude by describing future applications of the model. Casello, Nour and Hellinga...|$|E
40|$|On-demand {{mobility}} (ODM) through aviation {{refers to}} the ability to quickly and easily move people or equivalent cargo without delays introduced by lack of, or infrequently, scheduled service. A necessary attribute of ODM is that it be easy to use, requiring a minimum of special training, skills, or workload. Fully-autonomous vehicles would provide the ultimate in ease-of-use (EU) but are currently unproven for safety-critical applications outside of a few, situationally constrained applications (e. g. automated trains operating in segregated systems). Applied to aviation, the current and near-future state of the art of full-autonomy, may entail undesirable trade-offs such as very conservative operational margins resulting in reduced <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> and transportation utility. Furthermore, acceptance by potential users and regulatory authorities will be challenging without confidence in autonomous systems in developed in less critical, but still challenging applications. A question for the aviation community is how we can best develop practical ease-of-use for aircraft that are sized to carry a small number of passengers (e. g. 1 - 9) or equivalent cargo. Such development is unlikely to be a single event, but rather a managed, evolutionary process where responsibility and authority transitions from human to automation agents as operational experience is gained with increasingly intelligent systems.

40|$|High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes {{have been}} in {{existence}} for over 30 years. As a congestion management strategy, HOV lanes have been widely applied in the U. S. to preserve mobility, maintain <b>trip</b> <b>reliability,</b> and improve the person moving capability within a corridor or metropolitan area. While there are many examples of successful HOV lanes that carry large numbers of commuters and buses, criticism has been levied toward HOV lanes in some metropolitan areas. A lack of information and data as to the benefits of HOV lanes, the nationwide trend toward lower carpool utilization, and the closure of two projects in New Jersey in 1998 has resulted in some metropolitan areas or agencies re-assessing the purpose, role, and benefits of HOV lanes. This has lead some to postulate that the HOV lane concept {{may no longer be}} viable. In response to these perceptions, this paper reviews available data and provides some perspectives on the recent past and possible future of HOV lanes, particularly those treatments applied on urban freeways that represent the majority of such applications. This paper presents a summary of recent experiences, growth, type, and changes that have occurred with HOV lane operational policies. Many of these trends {{have been in}}fluenced by federal legislation over the past 15 years, specifically the Clean Air Act and operational policies related to the development of HOV lanes as a congestion management strategy.

This paper explores a method for estimating travel time distributions for corridors that contain multiple bottlenecks. A set of analytical equations are {{used to calculate the}} number of queued vehicles ahead of a probe vehicle and further capture many important factors affecting travel times: the prevailing congestion level, queue discharge rates at the bottlenecks, and flow rates associated with merges and diverges. Based on multiple random scenarios and a vector of arrival times, the lane-by-lane delay at each bottleneck along the corridor is recursively estimated to produce a route-level travel time distribution. The model incorporates stochastic variations of bottleneck capacity and demand and explains the travel time correlations between sequential links. Its data needs are the entering and exiting flow rates and a sense of the lane-by-lane distribution of traffic at each bottleneck. A detailed vehicle trajectory data-set from the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) project has been used to verify that the estimated distributions are valid, and the sources of estimation error are examined...|$|R
40|$|To be {{beneficial}} to management, productivity concepts must be translated into terms that are meaningful to managers {{at all levels of}} the organization. Productivity per se is not nearly as important to these people as service quality and financial performance, especially since measured productivity can improve while profits or service levels decline. Productivity must, therefore, be related to an integrated set of performance measures that reflect costs, revenues, <b>trip</b> times and <b>reliability,</b> equipment availability and other matters of continuing concern to transportation companies. Planning and control are critical components of any program to improve productivity. The techniques required to measure and understand productivity are precisely those used in planning and in developing control systems. Furthermore, productivity is conceptually very close to cost analysis, which is a major focus of planning and control. Any transportation company has access to the data needed to develop a vast array of performance measures, including many productivity measures. This paper will illustrate the way that railroads can integrate productivity concepts within more global performance measurement systems. Specific attention will be given to terminal control systems, costing systems for origin-to-destination movements and life-cycle costing techniques for track maintenance planning. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} and reliable transportation {{system is essential}} to the economy of a nation or region because it provides accessibility and promotes the safe and efficient movement of people and goods. Also, a reliable network plays an important role for the maintenance and repair of other lifeline systems. Thus, it is necessary and important to study the reliability of a road traffic network. Travel time reliability and capacity reliability are considered to be two useful measures of the performance of a road traffic network. The former is concerned with the probability that a trip between a given origin-destination pair can be made successfully within a specified interval of time for a given level of traffic demand in the network; while the latter is given as the probability that the network can accommodate a certain traffic demand at a required level of service. Determination of both reliabilities requires accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. The first part of the thesis analyses the comprehensive integration of both travel time and capacity reliability and discusses the practical use of this study. The second part of the thesis provides a day-to-day analysis of the reliability of commuting time and trip scheduling under the Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS). An analysis of travel cost reliability, which is considered as how likely the road users or commuters will be satisfied with their resultant individual travel costs, is carried out in this part to assess the network performance. A simple network with parallel routes and bottleneck congestion is taken into consideration to simulate the departure time and the route choice decisions of commuters to minimize total travel time and scheduling delay cost. There are two major factors influencing the decisions of drivers in their departure time and route choices: their accumulated travel experience and information provided by ATIS. A simple experiment has been carried out for investigating <b>trip</b> scheduling <b>reliability</b> of this network system...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} we have seen {{important}} extensions of logit models in behavioural research such as incorporation of preference and scale heterogeneity, attribute processing heuristics, and estimation of willingness to pay (WTP) in WTP space. With rare exception, however, a non-linear treatment of the parameter set to allow for behavioural reality, such as embedded risk attitude and perceptual conditioning of occurrence probabilities attached to specific attributes, is absent. This is especially relevant to the recent focus in travel behaviour research on identifying the willingness to pay for reduced travel time variability, which {{is the source of}} estimates of the value of <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> that has been shown to take on an increasingly important role in project appraisal. This paper incorporates, in a generalised non-linear (in parameters) logit model, alternative functional forms for perceptual conditioning (known as probability weighting) and risk attitude in the utility function to account for travel time variability, and then derives an empirical estimate of the willingness to pay for trip time variability-embedded travel time savings as an alternative to separate estimates of time savings and trip time reliability. We illustrate the richness of the approach using a stated choice data set for commuter choice between unlabelled attribute packages. Statistically significant risk attitude parameters and parameters underlying decision weights are estimated for multinomial logit and mixed multinomial logit models, along with values of expected travel time savings.

40|$|Drivers using {{information}} from an Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) could potentially make better travel decisions to reduce travel time and increase <b>trip</b> <b>reliability,</b> thereby benefiting both guided drivers {{as well as}} those without such access. However, market penetration of ATIS can have dramatic effects on the performance of the transportation system in terms of overall benefits conferred as well as the distributional effects between guided and unguided drivers. Because market penetration will be determined both by private market structure and public policies, the effective deployment of ATIS depends critically on the private and public organizations that will provide these services. An understanding of the relationship between transportation system performance and ATIS market penetration provides important insights into a sustaining market structure for the ATIS industry. This thesis provides an empirical study of the impact of ATIS on transportation network quality of service using an application of DynaMIT (Dynamic network assignment for the Management of Information to Travelers). An analysis of the simulation results serves to inform the public and private stakeholder positions {{in the creation of a}} better market for ATIS. The main results are that the provision of dynamic route guidance can simultaneously benefit the individual performance of drivers, both guided and unguided, as well as the system performance of existing transportation infrastructure.

40|$|High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes are {{employed}} in many cities as a traffic congestion mitigation technique. These lanes are intended to provide a travel time benefit to carpools and buses, thus providing an incentive to form carpools or take transit. The time and frustration involved in finding and using HOV lane access points may act {{as a deterrent to}} HOV lane use. Thus, proper planning of HOV lane access may be able to improve convenience for potential users, increasing HOV lane utilization. By optimizing HOV lane volumes, high levels of service and <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> are ensured for those who carpool. Congestion is also reduced on General Purpose Lanes (GPLs) due to the diverted traffic. Public approval is tied to HOV lane utilization, which may be affected by access. Thus, HOV lane success may be determined in part by accessibility. This research investigated the possible relationship between the time required to access the HOV lane and travelers' choice of HOV lane as their mode. Additionally, the distance to HOV lane access points and the type of access point used were examined for their influence on HOV lane use rates. It was concluded that neither the type of HOV lane access point, nor the added time necessary to access the HOV lane were significant factors in HOV lane use rates. Instead, the convenience of carpool formation and the convenience of HOV lane access to traveler's origins and destinations were found {{to be the most important}} factors in HOV lane use rates.

40|$|Ridership is a {{key element}} in the transit industry. Conventional travel {{analysis}} focuses on two types of transit users: captive and choice riders. Captive riders are typically those who lack an alternative to transit; they therefore use it as their primary mode of transportation to reach their destination. Choice riders are those who have realistic alternatives (e. g., driving) but choose to use transit for various <b>trips.</b> Service <b>reliability</b> and availability affects the ridership of both populations. However, substantial increases in ridership are usually assumed to be derived only from choice riders. Populations not using transit may be further considered as two distinct populations: auto captives and potential riders. Auto captives are mainly auto users who don’t have transit as a potential mode of transportation or would not even realistically consider using transit. Potential riders are currently not using transit for certain reasons and/or concerns, but may consider the idea of using transit based on certain criteria. This research analyzes results from two surveys conducted in the Twin Cities metropolitan region: one of existing riders and the other of non-riders. The aim is to understand the characteristics of both captive and choice riders, with an eye toward the factors that can increase ridership of the latter population. This research classifies riders and non-riders differently from previous research. In addition to the captivity of modes, the classification considers regularity of commuting. Accordingly, transit riders are classified as one of four categories: captive riders with regular commuting habits, captive riders with irregular commuting habits, choice riders with regular commuting habits, and choice riders with irregular commuting habits. Similarly, there are four types of non-riders: auto captives with regular commuting habits, auto captives with irregular commuting habits, potential riders with regular commuting habits, and potential riders with irregular commuting habits. Using the survey data to uncover such population, this research then comments on how using advanced forms of technology could increase the ridership from various populations.

The present study aimed to examine {{the reliability and validity of}} different self-report exposure measures and to provide recommendations on best practice self-report riding exposure questions. Methods: The reliability and validity of different self-report exposure measures were examined amongst novice motorcyclists through t-tests, Bland Altman plots, coefficients of variation, and correlations. Results: The most valid and reliable data was provided when riding exposure was asked for the current average week rather than earlier and longer periods, and in units of time rather than distance or number of <b>trips.</b> The greater <b>reliability</b> of riding exposure found amongst commuting and rural riders compared to recreational and metropolitan riders respectively and at the second interview compared to the first suggests that factors such as riding purposes, geographical locations, and riding experience can contribute to measurement error.

It is recommended that self-report riding exposure questions ask about the hours of riding for the current average week, and data on riding purposes, locations, and experience are also collected. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Public transit {{agencies}} often {{struggle with}} service reliability issues; when a bus or train does not arrive on time, passengers become frustrated {{and may be}} less likely to choose transit for future <b>trips.</b> To address <b>reliability</b> problems, transit authorities increasingly provide real-time vehicle location and arrival information to riders via web-enabled and mobile devices. Although prior studies have found several benefits of offering this information to passengers, researchers have had difficulty determining if real-time information affects ridership levels. Therefore, the objective of this dissertation is to quantify the impact of real-time information on public transit ridership. 	Statistical and econometric methods were used to analyze passenger behavior in three American cities that share a common real-time information platform: New York City, Tampa, and Atlanta. New York City was the setting for a natural experiment in which real-time bus information was gradually launched on a borough-by-borough basis over a three year period. Panel regression techniques were used to evaluate route-level bus ridership while controlling for changes in transit service, fares, local socioeconomic conditions, weather, and other factors. In Tampa, a behavioral experiment was performed with a before-after control group design in which access to real-time bus information was the treatment variable and web-based surveys measured behavior changes over a three month period. In Atlanta, a methodology to combine smart card fare collection data with web-based survey responses was developed to quantify changes in transit travel of individual riders in a before-after study. In summary, each study utilized different data sources and quantitative methods to assess changes in transit ridership. 	The results varied between cities and suggest that the impact of real-time information on transit travel is greatest in locations that have high levels of transit service. These findings have immediate implications for decision-makers at transit agencies, who often face pressure to increase ridership with limited resources. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} With tremendous {{economic and}} population growth, the Southeast needs a comprehensive, multi-modal transportation system. High speed rail service will provide business and leisure travelers with a competitive and affordable alternative to air and automobile travel for trips of 100 – 500 miles. High speed rail in the Southeast will mean top speeds of 110 mph, using advanced energy efficient diesel locomotives, with average trip speeds of 85 – 87 mph. Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia have {{joined forces with}} their business communities to form a four-state coalition to develop a high speed rail network connecting their states with Washington, DC, and the Northeast. This rail network will be developed incrementally, upgrading mainly existing rail rights-of-way and requiring few new right-of-way acquisitions. Environmental, planning, and engineering work is further along in the Washington–Richmond–Raleigh–Charlotte section of SEHSR, where local track and infrastructure upgrading is already taking place, shortening travel times and providing greater capacity and <b>trip</b> <b>reliability.</b> Tiered environmental process North Carolina and Virginia, working with FHWA and FRA, completed the Tier I EIS for the Washington–Charlotte portion of SEHSR in October 2002.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{population}} and increase of travelling requirements in metropolitan areas, public transit has been recognized as a promising remedy and is playing an ever more important role in sustainable transportation systems. However, {{the development of the}} public transit system has not received enough attention until the recent emergence of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). In the conventional public transit system, little to no communication passes between transit vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, such as traffic signals and loop detectors. But now, thanks to advancements in automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems and wireless communication, real-time and high-resolution information of the movement of transit vehicles has become available, which may potentially facilitate the development of more advanced traffic control and management systems. This dissertation introduces a novel adaptive traffic signal control system, which utilizes the real-time location information of transit vehicles. By predicting the movement of the transit vehicle based on continuous detection of the vehicle motion by the on-board AVL system and estimating the measures of effectiveness (MOE) of other motor vehicles based on the surveillance of traffic conditions, optimal signal timings can be obtained by solving the proposed traffic signal optimization models. Both numerical analysis and simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed system improves a transit vehicle's operation as well as minimizes its negative impacts on other motor vehicles in the traffic system. In summary, there are three major contributions of this dissertation: a) development of a novel AVL-based adaptive traffic signal control system; b) modeling of the associated traffic signal timing optimization problem, which is the key component of the proposed system; c) applications of the proposed system to two real world cases. After presenting background knowledge on two major types of transit operations, i. e., preemption and priority, traffic signal control and AVL systems, the architecture of the proposed adaptive signal control system and the associated algorithm are presented. The proposed system includes a data-base, fleet equipped with surveillance system, traffic signal controllers, a transit movement predictor, a traffic signal timing optimizer and a request server. The mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) and nonlinear programming (NP) are used to formulate signal timing optimization problems. Then the proposed system and algorithm are applied to two real-world case studies. The first case study concerns the SPRINTER rail transit service. The proposed adaptive signal control (ASC) system is developed to relieve the traffic congestion and to clear the accumulated vehicle queues at the isolated signal around the grade crossing, based on the location information on SPRINTER from PATH-developed cellular GPS trackers. The second case study involves the San Diego trolley system. With the information provided by the AVL system, the proposed ASC system predicts the arrival times of the instrumented trolley at signals and provides the corresponding optimal signal timings to improve the schedule adherence, thus reducing the delays at intersections and enhancing the <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> for the trolley travelling along a signalized corridor in the downtown area under the priority operation. The negative impact (e. g., delay increase) on other traffic is minimized simultaneously. Both numerical analysis and simulation tests in the microscopic environment are conducted using the PARAMICS software to validate the proposed system for the aforementioned applications. The results present a promising future for further field operational testing...|$|E
40|$|Reliability is {{becoming}} a more and more important performance characteristic of road networks and transport services. Travel time reliability {{was found to be}} one of the most important factors for route choices of travelers. Drivers often complain that it is the unpredictability of travel time that they dislike most of a journey in a congested city or area. Network design and some traffic control measure or ITS, such as Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) and Incident Management (IM) have been proposed to improve road network reliability. Road pricing has been advocated as a potentially powertlil travel demand management (TDM) strategy capable of significantly influencing travel demand characteristics through the network. Generally, the policy objecfives of road pricing could be summarized as follows: managing demand, optimizing congestion level, reducing environmental impacts, maximizing social welfare gains, raising revenues to recoup maintenance cost and construction cost, etc. To our best knowledge, no researchers have advocated improving network travel time reliability as an objective of road pricing. Some researchers suggested evaluating road pricing from a network reliability view. These suggestions give some incentives that road pricing could make contributions to network reliability. This study investigates road pricing as an instrument to improve network travel time reliability, which is induced by link capacity variations and short-term origin-destination demand fluctuations. The network reliability is specified as a function of standard deviations of route travel times. It is assumed in this study that the road authority aims to optimize network reliability by setting tolls in a network design problem. Travelers are influenced by these tolls and make route and trip decisions by considering travel times and tolls (not taking the <b>trip</b> <b>reliability</b> into account). Theoretical analyses using static models with elastic demand are performed to analyze the influence of road pricing on road network reliability. In the theoretical analyses, capacity variation is assumed as the major influencing factor on the network travel time unreliability. An important assumption is made in the theoretical analyses, being that travelers make their route choices based on the average travel cost. Travel time and link capacity are stochastic variables, while route flow is deterministic for each charge level. The theoretical analyses start with the analysis on a single route network. Then a tworoute network with one link charged is analyzed using deterministic user-equilibrium (DUE) and stochastic assignment. Finally theoretical analyses on a general network are performed and a formula to calculate route travel time unreliability is derived based on oiu- assumptions mentioned previously. This formula is utilized in an application on a hypothetical five-link three-route network to investigate the impacts of road pricing on network reliability. The theoretical analyses show that road pricing may improve network reliability and that network reliability depends heavily on charge levels. Theoretical analysis shows that decreased OD demand and route flow switches, caused by implementing tolls, influence network reliability. Depending on the combination of the effects of decreased OD demand and route shifts, network reliability in case of elastic demand can either be improved when the effect of OD demand decreases is stronger than the effects of route shifts, or becomes worse when the influence of the route shifts is stronger than the influence of decreased OD demand. Whereas the theoretical analyses are performed using static models and some assumptions had to be made, a dynamic simulation-based method using the dynamic model INDY for the five-link network is utilized to investigate the influence of road pricing on network reliability more appropriately. Using the dynamic simulation-based approach, capacity variations and short-term origin-destination demand fluctuations are considered as the most important factors affecting travel time variability. Fixed OD demand and elastic OD demand are taken into account respectively. Four cases are analyzed in the simulation-based analyses; the fixed demand case with capacity variations, the fixed demand case with demand fluctuations, the elastic demand case with capacity variations and the elastic demand case with demand fluctuations. With fixed demand, route shift is the major causal factor of the variability of network travel time reliability with respect to charge levels. The results from the simulafion-based method show that in the fixed demand cases with the increase of the charge levels, route flow switches become less and less. Network reliability can be improved with tolls. With elastic demand, both decreased OD demand and route shifts play an important role in network reliability. Decreased OD demand leads to positive effects on network reliability. Frequent route shifts is the essential cause of network travel time unreliability for the networks with tolling systems, and network reliability will be improved i f there are less route flow switches. Combining the effects of decreased OD demand and route shifts, network reliability may either be improved or becomes worse, depending on the charge levels. The optimal charge from road authority's view can be determined, aiming to optimize network reliability. With the optimal charge, people take longer but more reliable routes. It turns out that there is a trade-off between the average route travel time and the route travel time reliability. In a normal situation (without tolls), both capacity variations and demand fluctuations have great influence on travel time variability, since these two factors lead to stochastic route flow shifts. Demand fluctuations have greater influence on travel time variability than capacity variation does. Because demand fluctuations have direct influence on route flows, which leads to direct travel time variability. The objective of optimizing network travel time reliability proposed in this study can contribute to the charging system design, which is a bi-Ievel optimization problem. Road authority, as the leader, tries to optimize network reliability by setting tolls. Travelers, as the followers, try to minimize their own travel cost, which is the sum of travel time and tolls. The objective function can be used to optimize charge levels or search optimal links for charging for fixed charging systems and for variable charging systems. Only a small hypothetical network with a single OD pair has been analyzed in this study. For this small network, we conclude that road pricing can improve network travel time reliability. For more general networks, the objective of optimizing network reliability can be employed to determine the optimal charge level and to optimize the charging system design.

40|$|Developing a {{schedule}} for high-frequency bus routes involves balancing {{the costs to}} the passengers in terms of passenger waiting time and in-vehicle time and {{the cost to the}} transit agency. Passengers are interested in short travel times and in short and reliable waiting times. In order to assess the trade-off between <b>trip</b> speed and <b>reliability,</b> transit planners need to follow a clear scheduling process; i. e., a series of steps the scheduler follows to create {{a schedule}}. This thesis develops a scheduling process based on a model which explicitly projects and evaluates the tradeoffs between overall travel time and reliability. The model uses Automatic Vehicle Location and Automatic Passenger Count data and is based on two critical hypotheses: (i) consecutive bus vehicle trips are independent and (ii) consecutive segment running times for a particular bus trips are independent. These two hypotheses will not be true in all cases but were shown to be true on the two CTA bus routes analyzed, 95 E and 85. By simulating the running time distributions and headway variability of any proposed schedule, the model estimates the cost of the schedule for waiting passengers, onboard passengers and the transit agency. (cont.) The scheduling process involves finding the time point schedule which minimizes the total cost {{with the help of the}} model. The scheduling process is applied to two CTA bus routes; Route 95 E and 85. For each route, the schedule which minimizes the total passenger cost was determined. The operating cost of the proposed schedule on each route is the same as for the current schedule because the same number of buses is used. The schedules obtained with the generalized cost minimization approach showed improved reliability and overall passenger service quality compared to the current schedule in both routes as well as compared to traditional approaches. A sensitivity analysis showed that in most cases the generalized cost minimization schedule can significantly improve reliability and overall passenger service quality over traditional approaches. by Grâce Fattouche.

30|$|There {{are also}} {{examples}} of CA applications specifically on PT. Perhaps the earliest application of CA on PT was in 1982 by Noble, who used CA on the PT system of Hong Kong {{and found that}} of four attributes chosen for investigation, travel time {{was by far the}} most important, followed by travel cost, the characteristics of the mode, and the amount of walk time [23]. In 1996, de Ruyter and Wetzels presented a complementary approach to measuring service quality, based on CA, in the context of service encounters in PT in the Netherlands [24]. In 2007, Gatta and Marcucci used CA to analyze customer preferences, estimate the passengers’ evaluation of different service features, and calculate a robust specification of a service quality index from the customers’ point of view [25]. In 2011, Liu, Deng, and Zhang studied the passenger’s preference of the bus service in Nanjing, China, with the use of CA and found that bus reliability was passengers’ first concern, which was followed by in-bus environment, walking time, and frequency [26]. In 2013, Mokonyama and Venter, based on a South African case study, estimated a service quality conjoint model to evaluate the effect of different PT service packages on passenger satisfaction and confirmed the need to classify service attributes in terms of their relative impact on passenger satisfaction at the service design stages, where performance in respect of some attributes has a disproportionate impact on satisfaction, especially where PT is competing directly with private transport [27]. In 2015, Liu and Guo used CA and found that on the commuter <b>trip,</b> passengers value <b>reliability</b> the most, which is followed by waiting time and walking time, while in-bus environment, price, and station environment’s weights are small; while on the non-commuter trip, the weights in a higher order to lower order are the first for reliability, the second for in-bus environment, the third for walking time, the fourth for station environment, and the last for ticket price [28]. In 2017, Nesheli, Ceder, and Brissaud used CA, combined with cluster analysis, to evaluate PT service quality in relation to four definitive factors: performance, information, operational tactics, and travel time, in two case studies, one at a major terminal in Auckland, New Zealand, and the other in Lyon, France [29].|$|R
