More and more people begin to study the <b>tubular</b> <b>turbine</b> in depth with the development of hydraulic power recourses in the direction of low head and large capacity. With the unique structural features and adaptive head range of <b>tubular</b> <b>turbine,</b> its development is very fast in recent years. The strength analysis of a <b>tubular</b> <b>turbine</b> is an important research aspect with the increasing of its capacity. Bulb turbine {{is one of the main}} types of tubular turbines. This paper uses CATIA software and finite element analysis to analyze and calculate the strength and deformation of key components of a bulb turbine, so as to ensure the bulb turbine's safe and reliable operation...|$|E
40|$|An S-type <b>tubular</b> <b>turbine</b> is {{used for}} a low-head {{hydraulic}} turbine. The S-type draft tube {{plays an important role}} in the S-type <b>tubular</b> <b>turbine.</b> The S draft tube has two bend portions, first and second bends. Separation occurs here. The pressure recovery becomes low because of the separation. The paper proposes a new-type S draft tube which has the highest pressure recovery coefficient. One of the characteristics of the new draft tube is a twisted portion in the middle of the S draft tube. Asymmetrical secondary flow is generated in the twisted portion of the new S draft tube. The pressure recovery coefficient Cpo is largely improved because such asymmetrical secondary flow prevents the separation on the bend portion of the S draft tube. Such phenomena are assured by measuring the velocity distribution in the draft tube...|$|E
40|$|The shaft <b>tubular</b> <b>turbine</b> {{is a form}} of {{tidal power}} station which can provide {{bidirectional}} power. Efficiency is an important turbine performance indicator. To study the influence of runner design parameters on efficiency, a complete 3 D flow-channel model of a shaft <b>tubular</b> <b>turbine</b> was developed, which contains the turbine runner, guide vanes, and flow passage and was integrated with hybrid grids calculated by steady-state calculation methods. Three aspects of the core component (turbine runner) were optimized by numerical simulation. All the results were then verified by experiments. It was shown that curved-edge blades are much better than straight-edge blades; the optimal blade twist angle is 7 °, and the optimal distance between the runner and the blades is 0. 75 – 1. 25 times the diameter of the runner. Moreover, the numerical simulation results matched the experimental data very well, which also verified the correctness of the optimal results...|$|E

A large bulb is centered in the water pipe which holds the generator, wicket gate and runner. <b>Tubular</b> <b>turbines</b> are a fully axial design, whereas Kaplan turbines have a radial wicket gate.|$|R
40|$|AbstractConcern over {{global climate}} change has led policy makers to accept the {{importance}} of reducing Greenhouse gas emissions. A tidal barrage utilizes the potential energy of the tide and {{has proven to be}} very successful, despite opposition from environmental groups. Tidal barrages make use of the potential energy of the tides. A tidal barrage is typically a dam, built across a bay or estuary that experiences a tidal range in excess of 5 m. Electricity generation from tidal barrages employs the same principles as hydroelectric generation, except that tidal currents ﬂow in both directions. A typical tidal barrage consists of turbines, sluice gates, embankments and ship locks. The turbines that are used in tidal barrages are either unidirectional or bi-directional, and include bulb turbines, straﬂo or rim <b>turbines</b> and <b>tubular</b> <b>turbines.</b> Tidal barrages can be broken into two types: single-basin systems and double-basin systems. This paper discussed about the tidal barrage, wave energy, environmental impacts and special conditions in there proces...|$|R

To that effect, artificial wind load time histories are first obtained using the public domain aero-elastic code FAST. Finite element models that have been previously validated by means of comparison with experimental results, are then used to carry out fully nonlinear dynamic analyses and compare strength and overall structural performanc...|$|R
40|$|The {{major reasons}} {{that cause the}} damage of damper bars in the leeward side are found in this paper. It {{provides}} a route for the structure optimization design of a hydro generator. Firstly, capacity of a 24 MW bulb <b>tubular</b> <b>turbine</b> generator is taken as an example in this paper. The transient electromagnetic field model is established, and the correctness of the model is verified by the comparison of experimental results and simulation data. Secondly, when the generator is operated at rated condition, the eddy current density distributions of damper bars are studied. And the asymmetric phenomenon of the eddy current density on damper bars is discovered. The change laws of the eddy currents in damper bars are determined through further analysis. Thirdly, through the study of eddy current distributions under different conditions, {{it is confirmed that}} the stator slots and armature reaction are the main factors to affect the asymmetric distribution of the eddy current in damper bars. Finally, the studies of the magnetic density distribution and theoretical analysis revealed the asymmetric distribution mechanism of eddy current density...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{bidirectional}} power {{performance of a}} tidal unit, two designs were investigated. The use of unilateral or double guide vanes in a tubular tidal unit influences {{the performance of the}} hydraulic unit. Based on the N-S equations and the RNG k-ε turbulence model, the SIMPLEC algorithm was used for 3 D steady-state numerical simulation of the entire turbine flow passage with unilateral and double guide vanes. The internal flow condition under positive and reverse power generation conditions was also analyzed. At the same time, the turbine, with a runner 1. 6 m in diameter, was scaled down to 0. 35 m diameter for model tests. The model tests were based on a multifunction hydromechanical test bench at Hohai University. The water head, discharge, and torque of the <b>tubular</b> <b>turbine</b> were, respectively, tested using a pressure difference sensor, electromagnetic flow meter, and torque meter under different guide-vane openings. The results show that turbine efficiency in the model test is slightly lower than that predicted by numerical simulation under the same conditions. However, the difference is not large. With double side guide vanes, although the efficiency of positive power generation decreased, the efficiency of reverse power generation is greatly improved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the article}} {{based on the}} {{geometric}} characteristics of the tower and force characteristics, the author designs the concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) 3 limbs column tower, and establishes finite element model of the tower. We carry on time history analysis of the concrete-filled steel <b>tubular</b> wind <b>turbine</b> tower based on finite element method when the earthquake wave is different. Under rare earthquake, the majority bars of the concrete-filled steel tube 3 limbs column tower are in the elastic stage, {{only a small number}} of bars in the top and the bottom are into the plastic phase. The post-seismic displacement at the top of tower is 1. 1 m which is slightly less than the tower height of 1 / 50 (1. 26 m) and meets the seismic requirements of the region. The analytical result may provide the foundational test data and advice for the design of the CFST wind turbine tower...|$|R
40|$|In {{the thesis}} the {{structural}} response of steel <b>tubular</b> wind <b>turbine</b> towers with various design configurations is analysed using FEM modelling. First, a structural response simulation model was validated {{by comparison with}} the existing experimental data. This was then followed with a mesh density sensitivity analysis to obtain the optimum element size. Based on this outcome, towers of various heights between 50 - 250 m are considered and investigated with three different design options as follows: (i) thick walled tower with internal horizontal stiffening rings, (ii) thick walled tower without stiffening rings and (iii) thin walled tower with stiffening rings. Based on this analysis, weight reduction ratios are examined {{in relation to the}} horizontal sway and von Mises stress increase ratios in order to identify a more efficient design approach between reducing the wall thickness and adopting internal stiffeners. All studied design solutions satisfy the strength and serviceability requirements as specified by the design codes of practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} new design of low head turbines, as {{feasible}} solutions {{to solve the}} lack of energy in rural and remote areas, or to provide energy from urban water pipe systems. Propeller turbines are then {{the subject of this}} research because they are suitable for small heads, discharges with little variability, easy to manufacture and with low costs associated. Hence, the aims are the design of quite simple <b>tubular</b> propeller <b>turbines</b> and the analysis of hydrodynamic behaviour for different number and configuration of blades, based on CFD analyses and experimental tests development. An advanced hydrodynamic code based on the finite volume method, as well as blades configuration and mesh specific models are used for the impeller and the turbine design. The blade geometry is optimized using mathematical formulations and experimental results, concerning the possible range of operation under best efficiency conditions. Performance curves are obtained for typical characteristic parameters allowing comparisons between CFD and experimental results. Based on the similarity theory applied to turbomachines it is possible to evaluate the hydrodynamic behaviour through a tubular propeller for different sizes, in a scale model application...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} in {{designing}} the wind turbine is ensuring structural safety and optimal operational performance. Key aspects to be addressed are: long design life, sensitivity of structure to vibration and resonance, non-deterministic wind loads with significant time variations and micro-location dependence. In order to achieve these goals, a simple dynamic lumped-mass model of a conic <b>tubular</b> steel wind <b>turbine</b> tower has been developed in this paper. The tower stiffness matrix is determined by considering the stiffness of a cantilever beam with variable cross-section, and lumped masses for each conical segment are determined {{in such a way}} that the centres of gravity of conical segments match their actual position in the structure. There is a very good agreement between the measured field data and the results obtained by the developed simple numerical model...|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} oxide/oxide ceramic {{matrix composite}} (CMC) materials are described. Design concepts for the attachment of the CMC component {{to the metal}} structure of the gas turbine are developed in a first work stream focused on the combustion chamber and the turbine seal segment. Issues like environmental barrier coating (EBC) /thermal barrier coatings (TBC), application and volatilization, allowance for the different thermal expansion and the mechanical fixation are addressed. The design work is accompanied by CFD and FEM simulations. A variation of the microstructural design of the three oxide/oxide CMC materials in terms of different fiber architecture and processing of matrix are considered. Also, mechanical properties of these variations are evaluated. The CMCs are tested in various loading modes (tension, compression, shear, off-axis loading) from room temperature to maximum application temperature. By modification of the matrix and the fiber-matrix interface as well as EBC coatings, the high temperature stability and the insulation performance are enhanced. An outline of the “High Performance Oxide Ceramic“- program HiPOC is given, including manufacturing of a high-pressure <b>tubular</b> combustor and <b>turbine</b> seal segments from the improved materials as technology samples, for which validation testing up to technology readiness level 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{offshore}} wind power is an attractive renewable energy resource. To improve the wind power generation capacity, {{there is a strong}} desire for {{offshore wind}} turbine to go to deep waters. For offshore fixed wind turbine, stronger foundation like jacket structure has a good applicability for deeper water depth. A 70 -meters jacket substructure for offshore wind turbine is designed. This thesis focuses on the dynamic structural response analysis of this jacket substructure, with a particular focus on hot spot stress of critical points on tubular joints. Three types of models are applied for analyses in this thesis. For eigen-value analysis the entire modal including the wind <b>turbine,</b> <b>tubular</b> tower and jacket supporting structure is used in the program USFOS-VPOne. For hydrodynamic analysis the refined substructure model with complete jacket structure and tubular tower is applied in USFOS. The equivalent monopile model is constructed in HAWC 2 to predict wind loads. Eigen value analysis is performed to check the validity of decoupled method for dynamic response analysis. The first eigen period is about 2. 9 s, far less than the main wave input periods, which implies the wave loads are mainly quasi-static, therefore the simplified decoupled analysis method can be applied. The global modes, the blade modes and the modes related to jacket braces are identified. Hydrodynamic analysis is performed to compare wave loads with different regular wave theories, including: Extrapolated Airy theory, Stretched Wave theory, Stoke’s 5 th order wave theory and Stream Function theory. It is proved that for extreme wave conditions, higher order wave theories such as Stoke’s 5 thorder wave theory and Stream Function theory should be applied since linear wave theories will under-estimate the structural reactions. Dynamic structural response analysis is performed in time domain with decoupled analysis method. The effect of misalignment of wind and wave on hot spot stress at joints is studied. It is observed that wave propagation directions has more significant effects on structural response than wind directions, while wind force has more significant influence on dynamic structural response rather than wave forces no matter in which directions they are propagating. </p...|$|R
