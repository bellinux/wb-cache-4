40|$|Hides and skins {{have a wide}} {{importance}} {{mainly as}} a source of foreign currency of the leather industry to the country. The consumption of these products is low for reasons of low quality and market imperfection. Measures to solve the problem in the area were limited because of little research and consideration. The objectives of the study were to identify the roles of the major actors and market channels, analyze strengths and weakness of the marketing system, and estimate the potential demand of the hides and skins. A survey was conducted in which data and information were collected from 15 local collectors 5 butcheries and 6 hides and skins traders using structured questionnaire. Secondary data including prices, marketing, and purchase and sales of the raw material were collected from government bodies and private organizations. In addition, the production and quality of hides and skins were studied by selecting 121 sample rural household heads from 4 villages of the wereda using two stage random sampling. Formal and informal data collection tools of both primary and secondary data were also used. In analyzing <b>the</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>conditions</b> of the raw materials, descriptive statistics and SCP paradigm were used. Results indicate that 66 % of rural households sell hides and skins to local collector in rural areas, while 34 % supplied to the wereda wholesalers. Buying process was done without following the grading standards of hides and skins, by simple sorting based on visible defects. The concentration analysis indicated that the market was highly oligopolistic with narrow range of market concentration. The marketing margin and marketing cost analysis showed transport charges, income and municipality tax, labour cost, preservation material cost and store rent were costs that influenced the marketing margin. High market concentration, barriers to entry in terms of capital and credit, and high marketing margin in the study area reveal that hides and skins marketing was inefficient. Therefore, to improve marketing system, correcting malpractices, implementation of standard grades and provision of market information, capacity building for all actors in the chain, strengthening the extension service on the product handling and management to farmers were recommended.

40|$|O trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a qualidade pós-colheita de três cultivares de uvas de mesa sem semente submetidas ao processamento mínimo e armazenadas sob refrigeração e à temperatura ambiente. Para tanto, foram utilizadas uvas das cultivares BRS Clara, BRS Linda e BRS Morena, produzidas na Embrapa Uva e Vinho/Estação Experimental de Viticultura Tropical, em Jales-SP. Os cachos, depois de higienizados e imersos em água clorada a 200 mg de cloro. L- 1 por 5 minutos, foram mantidos em câmara fria, a 12 ºC, por 12 h. As bagas foram degranadas e lavadas em solução de álcool a 70 %, por 5 segundos. Depois de escorrido o excesso da solução alcoólica, as bagas foram acondicionadas em bandejas de tereftalato de polietileno (PET) transparente com tampa e com capacidade para 500 mL. Cada unidade, contendo 200 g de bagas, foi armazenada a 12 ± 1, 8 ºC e 24 ± 0, 8 ºC, por 12 dias. Avaliaram-se, a cada três dias, a perda de massa fresca, a aparência, a coloração e os teores de sólidos solúveis (SS) e de acidez titulável (AT). A temperatura de 12 ºC manteve a turgidez, a coloração, as qualidades organoléptica (relação SS/AT) e {{comercial}} das bagas das três cultivares testadas, por nove dias, enquanto no armazenamento à temperatura ambiente (24 ºC), ocorre perda da qualidade comercial das bagas aos três dias para as cvs. BRS Clara e BRS Linda, e aos seis dias para a cv.

The {{objective of}} this research was to evaluate the postharvest quality of three apirenic (seedless) table grapes cultivars submitted to minimally processed and stored under refrigeration and room temperature. It was used the cultivars BRS Clara, BRS Linda and BRS Morena produced at Embrapa Grapes and Wine/Tropical Viticulture of Experimental Station, in Jales, state of São Paulo. The clusters were immersed in a solution of sodium hypochlorite (200 mg Cl. L- 1) for 5 minutes before being stored at 12 ºC for 12 hours. The berries were removed and rinsed with alcohol solution (70 %) per 5 seconds. After drained the water excess, the berries were conditioned in 500 mL capacity trays of transparent tereftalato of polyethylene (PET) with lid. Each unit with 200 g of berries was stored at 12 ± 1. 8 ºC and 24 ± 0. 8 ºC during 12 days. Every three days, the loss of weight, appearance, color, soluble solids (SS) and titratable acidity (TA) were evaluated.

40|$|Currently, {{the general}} {{rules for the}} {{marketing}} of feed are spread over several Directives according {{to the type of}} feed concerned. There is Directive 79 / 373 /EEC on compound feed covering also pet food where the rules for the circulation of this feed in the EU are laid down (e. g. labelling requirements). Directive 93 / 74 /EEC lays down the principles for feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes (dietetic feeds). Directive 96 / 25 /EC contains the general rules for the circulation and use of feed materials. Directive 82 / 471 /EEC lays down <b>the</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>conditions</b> for certain products, belonging to the category feed materials, used in animal nutrition (bio-proteins). Thus, the current rules are found in old Directives and some 50 amending or implementing acts. This has made existing legislation extremely scattered with many cross references and difficult to understand and implement in a uniform way. Feed legislation sets the rules for the different categories as of feed materials, dietetic feed, feed additives and medicated feed, differentiating between food producing animals and pets. Though horses might not be used for food production in all cases, feed legislation has to consider them as food producing animals because they enter to a significant extent the food chain. The main improvement of the proposal will be achieved by setting modern rules under one Regulation resulting in more legal clarity and a more homogenous market. In particular, the grey zone between feed materials, feed additives and veterinary drugs would be cleared. Further, the use of claims will be better regulated and thus enforceable for the control authorities. On feed intended for particular nutritional purposes, the current system will be more or less retained. The proposal introduces a broad definition of labelling. Consequently, the required truthfulness of the information attributed to a product is not only limited to the sack label but as well to all other material supporting the sale. Additionally, it is highlighted that sales via the internet are covered by the marketing rules. Furthermore, proposal increases the accuracy of the indication of feed materials incorporated in compound feed for food producing animals by requiring the indication in descending order of weight. The exact percentage has to be indicated for raw materials in compound feed that are highlighted on the label. The proposal follows the philosophy that information needed by the feed user for an informed choice and safety relevant information must be provided unequivocally and in a harmonised way throughout the Community. Further labelling particulars can be given on a voluntary basis to fulfil special interest of customers, but then these have to be accurate and understandable for each target group, and the industry could label all details voluntarily. Stakeholders will be encouraged to develop EU codes for good labelling practice in the context of voluntary labelling provisions. The proposal is now in negotiation in the Council of the EU and the European Parliament for adoption. vo...|$|E

Methods of data analysis consisted of analysis of some of the document or forms are used, analysis of credit sales system, billing system analysis of receivables, and analysis of the internal system of credit sales.

Based on above conclusions, the author provides several suggestions, among others, after receiving orders from customers, the marketing should immediately submit a form to be taken immediately so that the Surveyor feasibility analysis, separation of duties between the accounting with the administration and the stock Surveyor with the need to allow was so happens internal check (a clear division of tasks), and the company also needs to add some form, such form of the survey plus 3 pieces, stock request form to make as much as 2 pieces, the delivery of 4 sheets, 1 sheet form billing schedule, 3 sheets receipt ransom, and the form letter 3 sheet path of law and the letter of agreement between the company with the customer (SKPC) 2 pieces of work to prevent the customer from trying to avoid the problem receivables.
