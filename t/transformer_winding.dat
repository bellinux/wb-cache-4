2500|$|Drain {{efficiency}} is {{the ratio of}} output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of a field-effect transistor. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because RF signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a <b>transformer</b> <b>winding.</b> [...] In this case the RF zero level is near the DC rail and will swing both {{above and below the}} rail during operation.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and design of}} co-axial <b>winding</b> <b>transformers</b> is presented. The design equations are derived and the different design approaches are discussed. One {{of the most important}} features of co-axial <b>winding</b> <b>transformers</b> {{is the fact that the}} leakage inductance is well controlled and can be made low. This is not the case in conventional <b>winding</b> <b>transformers.</b> In addition, the power density of co-axial <b>winding</b> <b>transformers</b> is higher than conventional ones. Hence, using co-axial <b>winding</b> <b>transformers</b> in a certain converter topology improves the power density of the converter. The design methodology used in meeting the proposed specifications of the co-axial <b>winding</b> <b>transformer</b> specifications are presented and discussed. The final transformer design was constructed in the lab. Co-axial <b>winding</b> <b>transformers</b> proved to be a good choice for high power density and high frequency applications. They have a more predictable performance compared with conventional transformers. In addition, the leakage inductance of the transformer can be controlled easily to suit a specific application. For space applications, one major concern is the extraction of heat from power apparatus to prevent excessive heating and hence damaging of these units. Because of the vacuum environment, the only way to extract heat is by using a cold plate. One advantage of co-axial <b>winding</b> <b>transformers</b> is that the surface area available to extract heat from is very large compared to conventional transformers. This stems from the unique structure of the co-axial transformer where the whole core surface area is exposed and can be utilized for cooling effectively. This is a crucial issue here since most of the losses are core losses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTransient overvoltages {{appearing}} at line terminal of power transformer HV windings can cause failure of winding insulation. The failure can be from winding to ground or between turns or sections of winding. In {{most of the}} cases, failure from winding to ground can be detected by changes in the wave shape of surge voltage {{appearing at}} line terminal. However, detection of insulation failure between turns may be difficult due to intricacies involved in identifications of faults. In this paper, simulation investigations carried out on a power <b>transformer</b> model <b>winding</b> for identifying faults between turns of winding has been reported.

50|$|This is a {{relatively}} recent development which uses thyristors both to switch the <b>transformer</b> <b>winding</b> taps and to pass the load current in the steady state.

This power consumption {{can add up to}} a few kilowatts which appears as heat and causes a reduction in overall efficiency of the transformer; however, it results in a more compact design that reduces the size and weight of the tap changer device.

5000|$|Many {{types of}} {{parasitic}} oscillation {{are caused by}} small interelectrode capacitances (parasitic capacitance) or mutual inductance between adjacent wires or electronic components on the circuit board, which create an inadvertent feedback path. However these usually cause oscillations of high frequency, at {{the upper end of}} or above the passband of the equipment. This is because the phase shift of the small reactances in the feedback path, which increases with frequency, only become significant at high frequencies. Low frequency oscillations like motorboating indicate that some device or circuit with a large time constant is involved, such as the interstage coupling capacitors [...] or transformers, or the filter capacitors and supply <b>transformer</b> <b>winding.</b>|$|E

50|$|In guitar amplifiers, this {{flashover}} problem sometimes occurs if the amplifier {{is operated}} without the speakers connected, causing the self inductance of the output <b>transformer</b> primary <b>winding</b> to generate high voltages {{when the current}} changes due to the applied signal. For this reason the speaker terminals of 6L6 tube amplifiers are sometimes short-circuited by a switching 6.3 mm jack when the speakers are disconnected.|$|R
25|$|However, in {{the typical}} circuit, the spark gap's short circuiting action {{prevents}} high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply <b>transformer's</b> <b>winding.</b> This can induce corona discharges between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal leakage inductance. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high leakage inductance to limit their short circuit current to a safe level.|$|R
