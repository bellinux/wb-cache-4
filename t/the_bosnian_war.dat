5|$|The Split Agreement was {{a turning}} point in <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War</b> as well as an {{important}} factor in the Croatian War of Independence. It led to a large-scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the capture of strategic positions in Operation Summer '95. This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin, the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and the lifting of the siege of Bihać soon thereafter, during Operation Storm. Subsequent HV offensives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supported by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), as well as NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, shifted the military balance in <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War,</b> contributing to the start of peace talks, leading to the Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} achieved its objectives, {{and significantly}} contributed, along with Operations Sana and Maestral 2 to forcing the Bosnian Serb leadership to serious peace negotiations. A country-wide ceasefire came into effect on 12 October, {{one day after}} the offensive ended, and was soon followed by negotiations which produced the Dayton Agreement, ending <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2000–2001 {{several hundred}} {{soldiers}} of the brigade were deployed to Bosnia in support of NATO forces seeking to stabilize {{the country in the}} wake of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War.</b> Soldiers of the brigade were among the first National Guard units to see front-line patrolling duty in the conflict, a job held exclusively by active duty units until that time.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 NATO {{bombing of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina {{targeted}} the Bosnian Serb Army and together with international pressure {{led to the}} resolution of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War</b> and {{the signing of the}} Dayton Agreement in 1995.

5|$|On 10 and 11 April 1994, during <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War,</b> the United Nations Protection Force {{called in}} air strikes {{to protect the}} Goražde safe area, {{resulting}} in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction. This resulted in the taking of 150U.N. personnel hostage on 14April. On 16April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces. A two-week NATO bombing campaign, Operation Deliberate Force, began in August 1995 against the Army of the Republika Srpska, after the Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 347 was a {{scheduled}} domestic flight which, on 3 November 1994, was hijacked shortly after take-off.

The hijacker was Haris Keč, a Bosnian living in Norway, who made demands that Norwegian authorities help to stop the humanitarian suffering in his home country caused by <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War.</b> No one was injured in the incident.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> term <b>Bosnian</b> {{genocide}} is used {{to refer}} either to the killings committed by Serb forces in Srebrenica in 1995, or to ethnic cleansing that took place elsewhere during <b>the</b> 1992–1995 <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Battle of Kupres was {{the first}} {{concrete}} result of the renewed BosniakCroat alliance in <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War,</b> and the advance to Kupres {{was the first}} military effort coordinated between the ARBiH and the HVO since the Washington Agreement. Following the victory, morale of the ARBiH and the HVO soared. Further advantages for them were the recapture of initiative from the VRS and full control of the Split–Livno–Kupres–Bugojno road, allowing improved logistics of the ARBiH and the HVO in the area, as well as greater volume of transport of arms and ammunition, especially after the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1994. The move in effect allowed the HV to supply itself as the arms shipments flowed through Croatia. Finally, {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Kupres secured the right flank of the Livanjsko field, which became especially significant later that month when Operation Winter '94 was launched by the HV and the HVO northwest of Livno in order to draw off a part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent capture of Bihać by the VRS. The battle {{is considered to be a}} significant contribution to subsequent success of the HV in the Croatian War of Independence and <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War</b> {{began in}} 1992, {{as a result}} of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating {{situation}} led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9October 1992, ordering a no-fly zone over central Bosnia and Herzegovina, which NATO began enforcing on 12April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Ploče {{recorded}} a steady {{growth and development}} from 1945, but suffered a sharp decline between 1991 and 1996 due to the Croatian War of Independence and <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War.</b> In the late 2000s, Luka Ploče d.d., the primary concessionaire of the Port of Ploče, embarked on an ambitious investment plan, aiming for {{a substantial increase in}} the volume of port operations.

5|$|The Tornado {{was used}} by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Italian Air Force and RSAF during the 1991 Gulf War, in which the Tornado {{conducted}} many low-altitude penetrating strike missions. The Tornados of various operators were also used in conflicts in the former Yugoslavia during <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War</b> and Kosovo War, the Iraq War, Libya during the Libyan civil war, as well as smaller roles in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. Including all variants, 992 aircraft were built.|$|E
5|$|The offensive, {{together}} with Operation Sana, caused controversy among military analysts regarding {{the issue of}} whether NATO airstrikes or the two ground offensives contributed more towards the resolution of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War,</b> and to what extent ARBiH, HVO and HV advances were helped by, or conversely the VRS hampered by, NATO bombing. In 2011, five former Croatian military personnel were convicted of war crimes for the summary execution of five Bosnian Serb soldiers and an unknown civilian during the offensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} commenced {{during a}} NATO bombing {{campaign against the}} VRS, codenamed Operation Deliberate Force, which targeted Bosnian Serb air defences, artillery and storage facilities initially {{in the area of}} Sarajevo, but also elsewhere in the country. Operation Sana, alongside concurrent HV and HVO offensives, sparked debate among military analysts as to whether the ground assaults or NATO's airstrikes were more responsible for ending <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War.</b> Also in question was to what extent the advances of the ARBiH, HVO and HV were assisted by the airstrikes, and conversely, to what extent they hampered the VRS.|$|E

5|$|The {{operations}} of Deny Flight spanned {{more than two}} years of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War</b> and {{played an important role in}} the course of that conflict.

5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} {{the implementation of}} the Vance plan, it was reorganised into a new Bosnian Serb army. This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration was later cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for <b>the</b> <b>Bosnian</b> <b>War.</b> Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. On 27 March, Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) 108th Brigade in response.|$|E

At this point, the CIA was aware of Mihdhar, and he was photographed in Malaysia with another al-Qaeda member who was involved in the USS Cole bombing. The CIA did not inform the FBI when it learned that Mihdhar and Hazmi had entered the United States, and Mihdhar was not placed on any watchlists until late August 2001.|$|E
