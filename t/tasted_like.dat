500|$|Despite professing to be a guide of {{reliable}} information about {{every aspect of}} running a house for the aspirant middle classes, the original edition devotes 23 pages to household management, then discusses cooking for {{almost all of the}} other 900. Even with the emphasis on food, some of her cooking advice is so odd as to suggest that she had little experience preparing meals. For example, the book recommends boiling pasta for an hour and forty-five minutes. Like many other British people of her social class and generation, Mrs Beeton adopted a distaste for unfamiliar foods, saying that mangoes <b>tasted</b> <b>like</b> turpentine, lobsters were indigestible, garlic was offensive, potatoes were [...] "suspicious; a great many are narcotic, and many are deleterious", cheese could only be consumed by sedentary people, and tomatoes were either good or bad for a range of reasons.|$|E

[...] "It didn't taste like Gatorade," [...] Cade said in a 1988 interview with Florida Trend magazine. In fact, according to Cade, when Gators lineman Larry Gagner first tried it, he spat it out and strongly suggested that the original experimental formula tasted more like bodily waste. Dana Shires remembered that [...] "it sort of <b>tasted</b> <b>like</b> toilet bowl cleaner." [...] To make it more palatable, at the suggestion of Cade's wife, the researchers added lemon juice and cyclamate to the original formula of water, salt, sodium citrate, fructose and monopotassium phosphate.|$|E

2500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, manna is {{described}} twice: once in [...] {{with the full}} narrative surrounding it, and once again in [...] {{as a part of}} a separate narrative. In the description in the Book of Exodus, manna {{is described}} as being [...] "a fine, flake-like thing" [...] like the frost on the ground. It is described in the Book of Numbers as arriving with the dew during the night. Exodus adds that manna was comparable to hoarfrost in size, similarly had to be collected before it was melted by the heat of the sun, and was like a coriander seed that is white. Numbers describes it as having the appearance of bdellium, adding that the Israelites ground it and pounded it into cakes, which were then baked, resulting in something that <b>tasted</b> <b>like</b> cakes baked with oil. Exodus states that raw manna <b>tasted</b> <b>like</b> wafers that had been made with honey. The Israelites were instructed to eat only the manna they had gathered for each day. Stored manna [...] "bred worms and stank": the exception being that stored the day before the Sabbath (Preparation Day), when twice the amount of manna was gathered. This manna did not spoil overnight, because, Exodus 16:23-24 states:This is what the Lord commanded: [...] "Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning." [...] So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.In the Bread of Life Discourse in John's Gospel, the evangelist refers three times to the manna which the Jews' ancestors ate in the desert: the Jews refer to the manna given to them by Moses as a sign of God's promised covenant, and Jesus asserts that the manna was from God and not from Moses, and that the people who ate it were nourished on their journey but ultimately died. In contrast, according to the gospel, Jesus offered living bread, and whoever ate this bread would never die.|$|E

The Gemara {{concluded that the}} manna fell in different forms for different classes of people: For the righteous, it fell as bread; for average folk, it fell as cakes that required baking; and for the wicked, it fell as kernels that required grinding. The Gemara asked how one could reconcile [...] which reported that [...] "the taste of it was like wafers made with honey," [...] with [...] which reported that [...] "the taste of it was as the taste of a cake baked with oil."

Then he'd just roll over and lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, you have to learn how to kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around. He enjoyed them, but they <b>tasted</b> <b>like</b> old rubber tires to me!" ...|$|E
