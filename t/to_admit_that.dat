5|$|Pandarus {{offers to}} act as a go-between, even though he is Cressida's {{relative}} and should be guarding her honour. Pandarus convinces Cressida <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> she returns Troilus' love and, with Pandarus's help, the two are able to consummate their feelings for each other.|$|E
5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I {{want you to know}} how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and will be the first <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> your form has not been good.|$|E
5|$|Under Ridgway's command, the Eighth Army pressed north {{again in}} January. He inflicted heavy {{casualties}} on the Chinese, recaptured Seoul in March 1951, and pushed {{on to the}} 38th Parallel. With the improved military situation, Truman now saw the opportunity to offer a negotiated peace but, on 24 March, MacArthur called upon China <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> it had been defeated, simultaneously challenging both the Chinese and his own superiors. Truman's proposed announcement was shelved.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy, thus {{suddenly}} appealed <b>to,</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>that,</b> in his lordship's place, {{he might}} have experienced a momentary temptation to do something of the kind.|$|R
50|$|Leo Tolstoy enjoyed Live Not As You Would Like <b>To,</b> <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> his own The Power of Darkness {{has been}} written under the {{influence}} of Ostrovsky's play.|$|R
6000|$|Gillie, {{not having}} the {{smallest}} idea what the Captain referred <b>to,</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "wery bad indeed," [...] but suggested that [...] "it might be wuss." ...|$|R
5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|Davos Seaworth confronts Melisandre about Shireen's death. Melisandre {{admits to}} burning Shireen alive, but {{points out that}} she did it for the Lord of Light. Davos rebuts by saying that Stannis was {{defeated}} anyway and that Melisandre's actions were all for naught, forcing her <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> she was wrong. Davos requests permission from Jon Snow to execute Melisandre, but she counters {{that she will be}} useful in the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon exiles Melisandre from the North and threatens to execute her if she ever returns. Later, Jon and Sansa Stark discuss who will lead the united Stark forces, with each deferring to the other.|$|E
5|$|Dunder Mifflin's {{tech support}} employee, Sadiq (Omi Vaidya), {{arrives at the}} Scranton branch {{to set up a}} system that allows Michael Scott (Steve Carell) to monitor his employees' emails. When {{everyone}} in the office finds out, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) worries that Michael will discover the party he is throwing that night, to which Michael is not invited. Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing is happening. In order to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from exposing the party, Jim tells him that it is a surprise party for Michael.|$|E
60|$|The good lady thus appealed <b>to</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> it was {{a serious}} matter, but urged that as Oliver did the thing in ignorance and out of gratitude, {{he ought to be}} forgiven.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right, Sey," [...] my {{brother-in-law}} said, growing almost friendly. [...] "I will do you the justice <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that's</b> the nearest {{thing we have}} yet struck out to an idea for tracking him." ...|$|R
50|$|Photography {{for this}} album {{was done by}} Hong Kong actor Chapman To, who is a {{photography}} enthusiast and a longtime fan of Liew. <b>To</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> {{this is the first}} time he was hired as a paid professional photographer.|$|R
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of}} the performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Conroy {{settled at}} his {{family home in}} Arborfield Hall near Reading, Berkshire and became a gentleman farmer, winning prizes for his pig breeding. He founded the Montgomery Regiment of Militia in 1849. Despite his {{pensions}} and ownership of properties and lead mines in Wales, Conroy was in substantial debt when he died on 2 March 1854 at Arborfield. His eldest son Edward succeeded him to the baronetcy. After his death, the Duchess of Kent finally agreed to open her financial accounts and acknowledged that significant funds were missing. She was moved <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> Conroy had swindled her {{while at the same}} time hurting her relationship with Victoria for his own benefit. A rapprochement followed between mother and daughter.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{personally}} cross-examined the witnesses, getting White <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he {{had once}} been in love with her; the same day, one juror (who had been frequently napping during the trial) was replaced with an alternate. During the retrial, the defendants repeatedly left or were thrown out of the courtroom. Both defendants were acquitted in the retrial; six jurors interviewed after the trial stated that they did not believe the two key prosecution witnesses. Shakur was immediately returned to Morristown, New Jersey, under a heavy guard following the trial. Louis Chesimard (Shakur's ex-husband) and Paul Stewart, the other two alleged robbers, had been acquitted in June.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a written}} {{statement}} published in 1997, Hall came very close <b>to</b> <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> the accusations against him were true, although obliquely, saying that in the immediate postwar years, he felt strongly that [...] "an American monopoly" [...] on nuclear weapons [...] "was dangerous and should be avoided": ...|$|R

5|$|The Forensic Science Service email was {{translated}} into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, if she were <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, {{and that she had}} hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> {{neither he nor}} anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the {{experiment}} {{seems to me to}} render the adoption of Fresnel's hypothesis necessary, or at least the law which he found for the expression of the alteration of the velocity of light by the effect of motion of a body; for although that law being found true may be a very strong proof in favour of the hypothesis of which it is only a consequence, perhaps the conception of Fresnel may appear so extraordinary, and in some respects so difficult, <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> <b>that</b> other proofs and a profound examination on the part of geometricians will still be necessary before adopting it as an expression of the real facts of the case.|$|E
6000|$|... "A friend's," [...] said Maitland, and then, {{beginning}} <b>to</b> hesitate, <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> {{the garment}} only belonged to [...] "a man {{he knew something}} about." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{the winding}} up, Desai vehemently defended his action in Parliament. He, however, had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> later <b>that</b> the reasons earlier stated were not correct.|$|R
50|$|He {{then went}} to Alexandria, where he {{developed}} his doctrine, a modified Marcionism, which (according <b>to</b> Tertullian) <b>admitted</b> <b>that</b> Christ possessed true human flesh but continued to deny the nativity.|$|R
5|$|When Andy tells Nate she {{is going}} to Paris, he is angered by her refusal <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> she's become what she once ridiculed, and they break up. Once there, Miranda, without makeup, opens up to Andy about the effect Miranda's {{impending}} divorce will have on her daughters. Later that night, Nigel tells Andy that he has accepted a job as Creative Director with rising fashion star James Holt at Miranda's recommendation. Andy finally succumbs to Christian's charms and, after spending the night with him, learns from him about a plan to replace Miranda with Jacqueline Follet as editor of Runway. Despite the suffering she has endured at her boss's behest, she attempts to warn Miranda.|$|E
5|$|Galileo had alienated one of {{his biggest}} and most {{powerful}} supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that,</b> contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
50|$|As Halloween {{comes to}} a close, Ignacio finally comes clean <b>to</b> Betty, <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> he came <b>to</b> the United States illegally, and leaving Betty shocked and stunned by his confession.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fifth day}} of strikes caused the French {{government}} <b>to</b> publicly <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport was rapidly {{running out of}} fuel, though it did advise people [...] "not to panic".|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I will," [...] murmured Dick. He had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> himself <b>that</b> Minnie {{was very}} cordial {{and that she}} was by no means bad looking. He did not wonder why Flockley and Koswell were so anxious to call upon her.|$|R
5|$|In January 2016, Phil calls Sal, wanting Louise's (now {{played by}} Tilly Keeper) address, {{and when he}} goes to her house, Peggy is there, having {{returned}} a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he has cirrhosis of liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try and make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> the situation had become desperate.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peattie's {{landlord}} sneaks {{into his}} apartment for pain medication and finds Lynette's body in his bed. Immediately, she contracts a flesh-eating disease. After {{hearing about the}} incident on the news, Mulder goes to Peattie's apartment and finds the body, now headless. Peattie finds the Wieder family, whom Scully is protecting, and makes a poppet with Scully's hair and photo inside. He places nails in the doll's eyes and Scully promptly goes blind. Peattie breaks into the house, takes Scully's gun and stabs a poppet of Wieder, causing the doctor to collapse in pain. Wieder gets Peattie <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he's taking out his own guilt {{about not being able}} to save Lynette by blaming him instead. Mulder shows up, finds Scully's doll and removes the nails from it, allowing her to regain her vision and shoot Peattie. He is placed in a coma and Lynnette's body is shipped back to her home in West Virginia.|$|E

60|$|Although {{he treated}} {{the idea of}} being frightened with {{something}} of contempt, he was constrained <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> himself <b>that</b> he was powerfully surprised when he stepped suddenly into a chamber heated to an extent that seemed equal to a baker's oven.|$|R
