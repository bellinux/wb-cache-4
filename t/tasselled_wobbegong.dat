5|$|Morphological {{studies have}} been {{inconclusive}} about the evolutionary relationships of the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> but overall have gauged it {{to be among the}} more derived wobbegong (Orectolobidae) species. A 2009 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found otherwise, that this species was in fact basal to all other wobbegongs except the northern wobbegong (O. wardi). This result supports the synonymization of Eucrossorhinus with Orectolobus. Molecular clock estimation placed the speciation of the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> at 11–6 Ma, coinciding with a period of significant geological rearrangement and the formation of coral reef habitats in the region.|$|E
5|$|During the day, {{the solitary}} <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> can {{generally}} be found lying inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled. Individual sharks tend to remain within a local area and have favored resting spots. While resting, it opportunistically ambushes nearby fishes and invertebrates, and also lures in prey by waving its tail {{to mimic the}} appearance of a small fish. At night, it emerges and actively forages for food. This species is aplacental viviparous, though little is known of its life history. The <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> has been reported to bite and kill humans unprovoked; attacks may result from people accidentally disturbing the shark or being misperceived as prey. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as outside of Australia it is threatened by fisheries and habitat degradation.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker originally {{described the}} <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> in an 1867 volume of Archives Néerlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles. His account {{was based on}} two Indonesian specimens, one caught off Waigeo and the other off Aru. He gave it the name dasypogon, from the Greek dasys ("hairy") and pogon ("beard"), and assigned it to the genus Crossorhinus (a synonym of Orectolobus). In 1908, Charles Tate Regan created the new genus Eucrossorhinus for this species, derived from the Greek eu ("good"), krossoi ("tassel") and rhinos ("nose"). Regan subsequently reconsidered the main trait he used to separate Eucrossorhinus (the spacing of {{the fourth and fifth}} gill slits) and synonymized it with Orectolobus. Later authors have placed the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> either in its own genus or in Orectolobus. Other common names for this species are bearded wobbegong and Ogilby's wobbegong.|$|E
50|$|The final exhibit, a 285,000 gal L {{saltwater}} {{tank with}} a 38 ft viewing window, displays six shark species (sandtiger sharks, sandbar sharks, blacktip sharks, nurse sharks, zebra sharks and <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegongs),</b> tarpon, barracudas, stingrays, large schooling fish, moray eels and three species of sea turtles (loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and hawksbill). Every day divers enter the tank to do daily chores like feeding and cleaning.|$|R
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong's</b> ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|R
50|$|The species-level {{taxonomy}} in this genus {{has changed}} significantly in recent years, with one species described in 2006, three species described in 2008, {{and one in}} 2010, while O. halei generally was considered a junior synonym of O. ornatus until 2006. The <b>tasselled</b> and cobbler <b>wobbegongs</b> {{have been included in}} this genus, but today they are placed in Eucrossorhinus and Sutorectus, respectively.|$|R
5|$|The <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> {{has little}} {{economic}} value, though its attractive skin is occasionally used for leather. In Australian waters, {{it is not}} fished and faces minimal threats. However, elsewhere in its range it may be negatively affected by extensive fishery activity and habitat degradation from pollution, blast fishing, and coral removal. Because of these concerns, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|Several turtle {{species and}} the frogmouth catfish have tongue {{extensions}} that lure prey {{to a position}} where they become an easy catch. In caudal luring the predator uses tail movements to attract prey. This form of mimicry is used by several snake and lizard species, as well by as the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> shark.|$|E
500|$|With several {{records of}} {{apparently}} unprovoked attacks on people, the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> {{has a reputation}} beyond other wobbegongs for aggressive behavior. Gilbert Whitley even wrote in 1940 that it [...] "attacks and generally kills the natives" [...] of Papua New Guinea. Though Whitley's claim is questionable, this species is certainly capable of inflicting severe wounds. Conversely, the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> is also an ecotourism attraction and many divers have approached it without incident. Given this shark's cryptic appearance and poor vision, humans should exercise caution to avoid accidentally harassing it or causing it to mistake a hand or foot for prey. This species adapts well to captivity and is occasionally found in the home aquarium trade.|$|E
500|$|The {{range of}} the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> {{encompasses}} the continental shelf of northern Australia from Ningaloo Reef {{in the west to}} Bundaberg in the east, as well as New Guinea, Waigeo, and the Aru Islands. Additional records from Malaysia are unconfirmed. This common bottom-dweller inhabits coral reefs, perhaps exclusively, in both inshore and offshore waters from the intertidal zone to around [...] deep. It is most often encountered in reef channels and faces, or atop coral heads.|$|E
500|$|The {{tapeworm}} Parachristianella monomegacantha is a known parasite of the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong.</b> This {{species has}} been observed being attended by cleaner shrimp (Leander urocaridella, Stenopus hispidus) and bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus). Reproduction is presumably aplacental viviparous like other wobbegongs, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk. There is a report of mating being observed inside a cave at night. Newborns measure approximately [...] long. Size at sexual maturity is uncertain; one recorded male {{was found to be}} adult at [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> (Eucrossorhinus dasypogon) is {{a species}} of carpet shark in the family Orectolobidae and {{the only member of}} its genus. It inhabits shallow coral reefs off {{northern}} Australia, New Guinea, and adjacent islands. Reaching [...] in length, this species has a broad and flattened body and head. Its most distinctive trait is a fringe of branching dermal flaps around its head, which extends onto its chin. The fringe, along with its complex color pattern of small blotches and reticulations, enable it to camouflage itself against the reef environment.|$|E
500|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins {{are large}} and rounded. The dorsal fins are short-based and fairly tall; the first is slightly larger than the second and originates over the latter quarter of the pelvic fin bases. Behind the pelvic fins, the body rapidly tapers to the short caudal peduncle. The anal fin originates behind {{the midpoint of the}} second dorsal fin and is no more than half its size. The caudal fin is short, with no lower lobe and an upper lobe bearing a strong ventral notch near the tip. This species has a mosaic-like dorsal color pattern consisting of numerous small, dark blotches and lines on a gray- or yellow-brown background; there may also be darker bands. The pattern extends to the underside of the tail and the ventral pectoral and pelvic fin margins. The ventral surface is otherwise white. The <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> is reliably known to reach a length of [...] Most authors consider an older record of a [...] long individual to be erroneous.|$|E
500|$|The <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> {{feeds on}} bony and {{cartilaginous}} fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. Its capacious mouth allows sizeable prey to be swallowed, with one documented {{case of a}} [...] long individual consuming a [...] long brownbanded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum). During daytime, this species is an opportunistic ambush predator. It preys upon schooling nocturnal fishes such as squirrelfishes, soldierfishes, and sweepers that often shelter in the same cave. Tiny fishes and crustaceans have been seen settling atop the resting wobbegong's head, attracting larger fishes that are in turn attacked by the wobbegong. Observations in captivity have further revealed that this species seems to engage in active luring behavior. When it perceives food nearby, it begins to slowly wave its tail back and forth; its caudal fin resembles a small fish, complete with a dark eyespot at the base. The shark typically rests with its head elevated, which places it {{within striking distance of}} any prey drawn by its tail.|$|E
500|$|The <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> {{is a very}} broad, {{moderately}} flattened shark.

The nostrils bear long, branching barbels, and have grooves surrounding them and connecting them to the mouth. There are tubercles above the eyes but not elsewhere, and behind the eyes are larger spiracles. The large mouth is positioned ahead of the eyes, almost {{at the end of the}} head. There are furrows on the lower jaw extending from the mouth corners and along the jaw median. There are 23–26 upper and 19 lower tooth rows; each tooth has a single slender, pointed cusp. The three upper and two lower rows of symphysial (central) teeth are especially long and fang-like. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E

5000|$|Although most {{wobbegong}} {{species are}} unsuitable for home aquaria {{due to their}} large adult size, this has not stopped {{some of the larger}} species from being sold in the aquarium trade. Small wobbegong species, such as the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong</b> and Ward's wobbegong, are [...] "ideal" [...] sharks for home aquarists to keep because they are an appropriate size and are lethargic, enabling them to be accommodated within the limited space of home aquaria, although they will consume tankmates, even quite large ones. Some aquarists, by contrast, see the lack of activity to be a drawback to keeping wobbegongs and prefer more active sharks. Wobbegongs are largely nocturnal and, due to their slow metabolism, {{do not have to be}} fed as often as other sharks. Most do well on two feedings weekly. Underfed wobbegongs can be recognised by visibly atrophied dorsal musculature.|$|E

50|$|Caudal luring {{is a form}} of mimicry {{classified}} formally {{as aggressive}} mimicry, but perhaps better described by the term feeding mimicry. It is also an example of deception in animals. The behaviour is employed by a number of snake species and allegedly by two lizards, though other interpretations (e.g., distraction) seem more plausible for the lizards. Caudal luring also occurs in a shark, the <b>tasselled</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> Eucrossorinus dasypogon and very likely in the pelican eels, Eurypharynx, which possess a bioluminescent tail tip. The behavior is associated with sedentary predators whose diets include animals susceptible to a worm-like (or fish-like, in the case of Eucrossorinus and perhaps Eurypharynx) luring appendage. Snakes generally lure small ectotherms (e.g., frogs and lizards), although luring of birds has been demonstrated (Spider-tailed horned viper) and luring of insectivorous mammals is suspected. Caudal luring occurs most often in juvenile snakes and is most prevalent in vipers and pitvipers, but it also occurs in boas, pythons, tropidophiids, colubrids, and elapids of the genus Acanthophis.|$|E
