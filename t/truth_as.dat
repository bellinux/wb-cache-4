5|$|The 1896 {{establishment}} of the Gympie Truth, a newspaper {{that he was to}} partly own, was part of his response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie <b>Truth</b> <b>as</b> being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it. In that year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the <b>truth</b> <b>as</b> they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the <b>truth,</b> <b>as</b> Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding <b>truth</b> <b>as</b> a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E
5|$|The balcony is {{topped by}} a niche {{consisting}} of allegorical figures of Justice and <b>Truth,</b> <b>as</b> well as triumphal sculptures of a winged female figure and a putto. Some parts of the sculptures, such as the scales held by Lady Justice, are now missing. The empty spaces between these figures contained Pinto's bust and coat of arms, but they were removed during the French occupation of Malta or in the early 19th century. It is not known how the bust of Pinto looked like, however {{it may have been}} either sculpted similar to the bust on the façade of Auberge de Castille or an original work. In either case it was probably made of bronze, and stood on a marble plinth which is still there. Similar to other busts of the time, {{it may have been the}} work of Jacques Saly. The triumphal figures are similar to those found on the 17th century funerary monument of Nicolas Cotoner sculpted by Domenico Guidi, but it is unknown who worked on the replica of the Castellania.|$|E
50|$|Nāgārjuna's {{explication}} of {{the theory}} of anātman as śūnyatā (emptiness) in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā was part of his restatement of the Buddha's Four Noble <b>Truths</b> <b>as</b> well as a rejection of the philosophies of the early Buddhist schools of the Sarvastivadins and the Sautrāntika.|$|R

25|$|The maxim is {{intended}} to help fruitfully clarify confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make formal but not practical differences. Traditionally one analyzes an idea into parts (his example: a definition of <b>truth</b> <b>as</b> a sign's correspondence to its object). To that needful but confined step, the maxim adds a further and practice-oriented step (his example: a definition of <b>truth</b> <b>as</b> sufficient investigation's destined end).|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the pragmatic}} theories, {{such as those}} by Charles Peirce and William James, {{included}} aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories. Crispin Wright argued in his 1992 book Truth and Objectivity that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, {{the role of the}} truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility. Michael Lynch, in a 2009 book <b>Truth</b> <b>as</b> One and Many, argued that we should see <b>truth</b> <b>as</b> a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.|$|E

That is a unique element of Schiller's pragmatism.|$|E

2500|$|The {{presentation}} of the four <b>truths</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the most}} important teachings of the Buddha [...] "has been [...] to reduce the four noble truths to a teaching that is accessible, pliable, and therefore readily appropriated by non-Buddhists." [...] There is a great variety of teachings in the Buddhist literature, which may be bewildering for those who are unaware of this variety. The four truths are easily accessible in this regard, and are [...] "readily [...] by those outside the Buddhist traditions." [...] For example Walpola Rahula's What the Buddha Taught, a widely used introductory text for non-Buddhists, uses the four <b>truths</b> <b>as</b> a framework to present an overview of the Buddhist teachings.|$|R
25|$|More recently, Walter Truett Anderson {{described}} postmodernism {{as belonging}} to one of four typological world views, which he identifies as either (a) Postmodern-ironist, which sees <b>truth</b> <b>as</b> socially constructed, (b) Scientific-rational, in which truth is found through methodical, disciplined inquiry, (c) Social-traditional, in which truth {{is found in the}} heritage of American and Western civilization, or (d) Neo-Romantic, in which truth is found through attaining harmony with nature and/or spiritual exploration of the inner self.|$|E
25|$|Other {{philosophers}} {{take this}} common meaning to be secondary and derivative. According to Martin Heidegger, the original meaning and essence {{of truth in}} Ancient Greece was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, {{as indicated by the}} original Greek term for truth, aletheia. On this view, the conception of <b>truth</b> <b>as</b> correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the Latin term veritas.|$|E
25|$|Mathematics {{always played}} a special role in {{scientific}} thought, serving since ancient {{times as a}} model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry, and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences (especially physics).
