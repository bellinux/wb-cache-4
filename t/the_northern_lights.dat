The 1,420-millimeter Export pipeline was 4,451 kilometers long. It crossed the Ural and Carpathian Mountains and almost 600 rivers, including the Ob', Volga, Don, and Dnepr. It had 41 compressor stations and a yearly capacity of 32 billion cubic meters of natural gas.|$|E
5|$|The next {{trip was}} up to Anchorage, for <b>the</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Lights</b> Invitational, a three-day, eight-team tournament.

The Ladies won handily, 105–81, leading {{by as much as}} 25. Texas A's 81 points would end up being the most a team would score on Tennessee that season. The {{championship}} game was against Wisconsin, a team ranked in the top 10, but this ranking did not mean much, as the team ended 1997 with an 87–66 victory.

25|$|Gazprom {{stated that}} if an {{agreement}} was not signed until 2004, it would increase gas prices from $30/m to $50 per 1,000cubic meters. Belarus refused, and on 1 January 2004, Gazprom stopped shipping gas via <b>the</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>lights</b> pipeline. Belarus was able to compensate by purchasing gas from non-Gazprom exporters such as Itera and TransNafta on short-term contracts. This continued until 18 February, when the companies refused to sign further short-term supply contracts. Since Belarus was dependent on gas {{for most of its}} heat and electricity production, the situation in the country during cold winter started to become critical. After deliveries stopped, Belarus started to siphon gas meant for transit to Europe from the Yamal-Europe pipeline, without Gazprom's approval. As a result, at 18:00 Moscow time on 18 February, Gazprom completely cut off supplies to the Belarusian network. Germany experienced only minor shortfalls in deliveries because of extensive storages of gas and due to most of imports coming through Ukraine; however, Poland reported more severe disruption. Supplies to Kaliningrad Oblast were also affected. Belarus managed to sign a new short-term contract with TransNafta at the price of $46.68 per 1,000cubic meters, which resulted in Gazprom resuming supplies before midnight of 19 February. Similar contracts supplied Belarus until June, when Belarus finally agreed a new contract with Gazprom for delivering gas for the rest of 2004 with the price of $46.68 per 1,000cubic meters.|$|E
