5000|$|For baking cookies, brownies, bars, etc., combine 1 Tbsp ground flax seeds with 3 Tbsp {{warm water}} and let sit {{for a few minutes}} to let thicken before {{stirring}} into the recipe. The flax seed must be freshly ground, or refrigerated; commercial ground flax loses the essential oils that make this work. 1 Tbsp flax seed is equivalent to one egg; simply multiply as needed. The flax seed thickens and acts as a binding agent in the recipe. Chef In You advises that adding ¼ <b>tsp</b> <b>baking</b> powder will serve as a leavening agent, as well.|$|E
