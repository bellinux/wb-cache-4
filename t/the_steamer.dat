5|$|As his {{businesses}} grew, {{he added}} to his fleet of ships, big ones to ship salmon to San Francisco and smaller ones for shallow waters and for towing larger ships {{in and out of}} the Rogue mouth. In 1879 he bought <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> Varuna and the tug Mary Hume and started a shipyard at Ellensburg. In 1880 he added the steam schooner Mary D. Hume, the tug Pelican in 1883, the schooner Berwick in 1887, <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> Thistle in 1888, and replacement craft in subsequent years. Returning ships brought goods for Hume's general store.|$|E
5|$|With Baker {{guarding}} the crossing at San Felipe de Austin, and Martin {{guarding the}} Morton Ferry crossing at Ford Bend, Santa Anna opted on April 12 {{to cross the}} Brazos halfway between at Thompson's Ferry, with Sesma's men and artillery crossing over the next day. The Mexican army attacked <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> numerous times {{in an attempt to}} capture it, but Ross successfully used cotton bales to protect <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> and its cargo, and was able to keep the Yellowstone away from Mexican control. Houston released the steamboat from service on April 14, and it continued to Galveston.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Scranton/Wilkes-Barre <b>Steamers</b> were a Premier Basketball League {{team who}} played during the 2012 season.

5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. <b>The</b> <b>steamer</b> Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
5000|$|... 2012 was {{a disappointing}} year for <b>the</b> <b>Steamers</b> {{as they would}} win three from ten matches and {{narrowly}} survive relegation to the championship. The highlight of <b>the</b> <b>Steamers</b> season was defeating Auckland 37-16 in Rotorua to win the new John Drake Memorial Trophy, since its existence from 2009, celebrating the late life of rugby great John Drake. It was Bay of Plenty's first win over Auckland in eight years and <b>the</b> <b>Steamers</b> biggest win against Auckland.|$|R

5|$|On {{the same}} day as the {{formation}} of the Anglo-French hunter groups, Admiral Graf Spee captured <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> Newton Beech. Two days later, she encountered and sank the merchant ship Ashlea. On 8 October, the following day, she sank Newton Beech, which Langsdorff had been using to house prisoners. Newton Beech was too slow to keep up with Admiral Graf Spee, and so the prisoners were transferred to the cruiser. On 10 October, she captured <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> Huntsman, the captain of which had not sent a distress signal until the last minute, as he had mistakenly identified Admiral Graf Spee as a French warship. Unable to accommodate the crew from Huntsman, Admiral Graf Spee sent the ship to a rendezvous location with a prize crew. On 15 October, Admiral Graf Spee rendezvoused with Altmark to refuel and transfer prisoners; the following morning, the prize Huntsman joined the two ships. The prisoners aboard Huntsman were transferred to Altmark and Langsdorff then sank Huntsman on the night of 17 October.|$|E

50|$|Eastern {{assigned}} <b>the</b> <b>steamers</b> Camden, Belfast and North Land to the Metropolitan Line from 1918 to 1925. In 1924 <b>the</b> <b>steamers</b> Boston and New York {{were built}} for the service; they were joined at peak periods by the North Land. Sailings on the Metropolitan Line had always been summer-only, but Eastern assigned <b>the</b> <b>steamers</b> George Washington and Robert E. Lee to the route in the off season from 1927 to 1932. When <b>the</b> <b>steamers</b> Saint John and Acadia were built in 1932, Saint John {{was assigned to the}} Boston-Saint John, New Brunswick route in the summer, with the Acadia on a new route between New York and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.

5|$|The other port lifeboat, {{with four}} crew on board, {{was picked up}} by <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> Leichhardt at an island at the {{entrance}} to Whitsunday Passage two days after the disaster. <b>The</b> <b>steamer</b> immediately reversed course back towards the wreck, which she reached at approximately 3.30pm on Friday, 26 February. Gothenburg was a complete wreck; the funnel was gone and she had sunk to the eyes of the lower rigging. Leichhardts Chief Officer and four hands went alongside, but nothing other than her masts could be seen above the water except for the body of a naked man floating nearby. They assumed the other victims had been taken by sharks. Leichhardt searched for survivors until last light and then made way for Bowen where the alarm was raised.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, <b>the</b> St. Louis <b>Steamers</b> of <b>the</b> Major Indoor Soccer League signed Davis {{away from}} the Cosmos.

He played one more season with <b>the</b> <b>Steamers</b> before moving to the New York Express, an MISL expansion team heavily staffed by former Cosmos players.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>steamers</b> {{had been}} {{operated}} by the North British Steam Packet Company, and <b>the</b> <b>steamers</b> in service were Prince of Wales (built 1858), Prince Consort (built 1862), and Empress (built 1888). The two older vessels were due for replacement, but a disagreement about the specification for their replacements resulted in a delay until 1899, when Prince George and Princess May entered service. <b>The</b> <b>steamers</b> were lavish {{and there was an}} excellent service to points on Loch Lomond, with good connections to the trains at Balloch Pier.|$|R

5|$|The {{submarine}} {{was used}} in filming the 1950 film, Morning Departure, a naval film directed by Roy Ward Baker. During the course of filming, the submarine depot ship HMS Maidstone {{was used as a}} mother ship for Tiptoe. In 1952 a further cinematic link was made when ballet dancer Moira Shearer presented a pair of size 3.5 satin ballet shoes to Tiptoe that she had worn in the 1948 film The Red Shoes. These are now at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum. Whilst in Tromsø harbour on 18 July 1955 Tiptoe was damaged when a coastal steamer collided with her. <b>The</b> <b>steamer,</b> a 2,162 tonne vessel called Nordlys, was entering the harbour when she collided with the British destroyer HMS Chevron. <b>The</b> <b>steamer</b> bounced off the destroyer and collided with Tiptoe, snapping her moorings as she was pushed halfway under a wooden quay.|$|E
5|$|As {{the revolutionary}} {{disturbances}} in, and friction between, Haiti and the Dominican Republic continued apace, De Soto {{returned to the}} West Indies in June, arriving at Port-au-Prince on the 19th. <b>The</b> <b>steamer</b> also patrolled in the Gulf of Mexico, {{with an eye on}} the unsettled conditions in Mexico, where a guerrilla war raged against the French occupation of the country.

At a site away from downtown Fairbanks, it features pioneer cabins, historic exhibits, and <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> SS Nenana, one of the steamboats that traveled Interior Alaska rivers during the gold rush era. The summer exposition that opened the park in July 1967 was attended by U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey but was plagued by rain, financial problems, and low attendance.|$|E

5|$|In March 1854, <b>the</b> <b>steamer</b> Black Warrior {{stopped at}} the Cuban port of Havana on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile, Alabama. When it failed to provide a cargo manifest, Cuban {{officials}} seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress {{as a violation of}} American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition for nearly a year. While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this initial mishap, De Sotos first capture did not take long, as she and a bluejacket-crewed lugger took {{schooner}} Major Barbour off Isles Dernières, Louisiana on 28 January 1862. Cmdr. Walker's crew discovered 8 barrels of gunpowder and 198 cases of gunpowder, nitrates, sulfur, and percussion caps in the blockade runner.
