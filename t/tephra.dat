5|$|After {{the major}} {{collapse}} approximately 5,000years ago, subsequent eruptions of lava and <b>tephra</b> built up the modern summit cone until about {{as recently as}} 1,000years ago. As many as 11 Holocene <b>tephra</b> layers have been found.|$|E
5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 years ago, {{explosive}} activity {{occurred at}} Ciomadul. That timespan {{coincides with the}} deposition of <b>tephra</b> from volcanoes in Italy in Europe; {{it is possible that}} <b>tephra</b> also came from Ciomadul. Indeed, the age of Ciomadul's last eruption overlaps with the age of the Campanian Ignimbrite. Some <b>tephra</b> layers found in two drilling cores of the Black Sea may have originated at Ciomadul.|$|E
5|$|Paleomagnetic orientations from beds of <b>tephra</b> (volcanic ash) {{that lie}} between {{the layers of}} the Touchet Formation show secular variation, which {{indicates}} that the beds must have been formed by many floods. The purity of the <b>tephra</b> suggests subaerial deposition (the <b>tephra</b> could be mixed with the surrounding sediment if it was deposited in moving water), which indicates a dry period during the ash falls (and hence a hiatus between floods).|$|E
30|$|Some <b>tephras</b> contain {{specific}} minerals {{that can}} be used for absolute age determination. For example, alkaline <b>tephras</b> derived from the Ulleung and Baegdosan volcanoes contain alkaline feldspar, while several Plio–Pleistocene <b>tephras,</b> such as the Znp-Ohta (3.95  Ma) and Omine (or Omine-SK 110 : 1.65  Ma) <b>tephras</b> (Tamura et al. 2008), contain biotite phenocrysts. Both are target minerals for Ar–r and K–Ar dating. Zircon and apatite minerals are also suitable for fission track dating (e.g., Iwano and Danhara 1998; Danhara and Iwano 2001). Therefore, depending on the mineralogy, <b>tephras</b> themselves can provide absolute ages.|$|R
40|$|Quaternary marine <b>tephras</b> in the Izu-Bonin Arc offer {{significant}} {{information about}} explosive volcanic {{activities of the}} arc. Visual core descriptions, petrographic examinations, and chemical and grain-size analyses were conducted on <b>tephras</b> of backarc, arc, and forearc origin. <b>Tephras</b> are {{black and white and}} occur in simple and multiple modes with mixed and nonmixed ashes of black and white glass shards. The grain size distributions of the <b>tephras</b> are classified into three categories: coarse, white pumiceous, and fine white and black well-sorted types. The frequency of occurrence of the white and black <b>tephras</b> differs within the tectonic settings of the arc. Chemically, the Quaternary <b>tephras</b> in this region belong to low-alkali tholeiitic series with lower K 2 O and TiO 2 than normal ordinary arc volcanic materials. Several <b>tephras</b> from different sites along the forearc correlate {{with each other and with}} <b>tephras</b> in the Shikoku Basin site and with Aogashima volcanics. These volcanic ashes resemble those in other backarc rifting areas, such as in the Fiji, Okinawa (Ryukyu), and Mariana regions...|$|R
30|$|Based on the geochemical {{composition}} of the sampled <b>tephras</b> at C 0018 and comparison with on-land <b>tephras,</b> {{the ages of the}} <b>tephras</b> were determined (Fig.  6; Table  3). <b>Tephras</b> Ata-Th (0.238  Ma; Kuwae et al. 2002; Nagahashi et al. 2004), Aso- 1 (0.249  Ma; Kuwae et al. 2002; Nagahashi et al. 2004), BT 72 (0.349  Ma; Kuwae et al. 2002; Nagahashi et al. 2004), and Hkd-Ku (0.76  Ma; Nagahashi et al. 2015; Suzuki et al. 2005) occur at depths of 24.9, 29.2, 57.1, and 114.3  m, respectively, (22.02, 26.4, 46.9, and 77.9  mf MTD corrected depth, respectively).|$|R
5|$|<b>Tephra</b> {{analysis}} has yielded evidence for many eruptions during the Pleistocene and Holocene, including two large explosive eruptions {{during the early}} and mid-Holocene. These eruptions deposited significant <b>tephra</b> layers over Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} at Mentolat has been ongoing since the Pleistocene, with the earliest explosive eruptions occurring over 17,340 years ago. An eruption {{during the late}} Glacial formed the MENo <b>tephra.</b> The volcanic activity has been inferred from <b>tephra</b> layers in lakes and outcrops.|$|E
5|$|From 600,000 to 400,000years ago, eruptions built a large conical {{stratovolcano}} called Mount Tehama (also called Brokeoff Volcano) {{in what is}} now {{the southwest}} corner of the park. It was made of roughly alternating layers of andesitic lavas and <b>tephra</b> (volcanic ash, breccia, and pumice) with increasing amounts of <b>tephra</b> with elevation.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the rocks ranges from basaltic andesite to andesite. Phenocrysts contained in Mentolat's rocks include: clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Mentolat <b>tephras</b> have noticeably lower potassium contents than the <b>tephras</b> of other volcanoes in the region.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} meant to {{investigate}} the climatic and volcanic signals within the sedimentary filling of sebkha Mhabeul through a thermomagnetic study of a 37 [*]cm length core. Values of the magnetic susceptibility at ambient temperature show that the core encompasses four climatic stages: the Warming Present (WP), the Little Ice Age (Late LIA), Early Little Ice Age (ELIA), and the Medieval Climate Anomalies (MCA). Added to the subcycles, the spectral analysis shows the individualization of an 888 [*]yr cycle probably related to solar activity. The heating at 250 °C is good-for-nothing since it was useful neither for climatic investigation nor for <b>tephras</b> layers detection. Heating at 700 °C generated {{the complete loss of}} the climatic signal. On the other hand, it allowed the detection of the previously identified <b>tephras</b> layers. Further, it highlighted the presence of other <b>tephras</b> layers. The extraction by the bromoform confirms the presence of these <b>tephras.</b> The use of the same methodology may allow the detection of <b>tephras</b> layers within other sebkhas...|$|R
40|$|Altered basaltic <b>tephras</b> from tuff {{rings and}} tuff cones across the Basin and Range were {{examined}} using visible and NIR (Vis/IR) reflectance spectrometry {{and a variety}} of other techniques. It was found that Vis/IR spectrometry is sensitive to subtle changes in the hydration and oxidation state of these <b>tephras.</b> In the tuffs examined, ferrous and ferric iron minerals produce one composite absorption feature rather than two resolvable bands. Different styles of alteration were noted between thinly bedded tuff ring deposits emplaced by high energy, largely dry, pyroclastic surge and massively bedded tuff cone deposits emplaced by wetter, lower energy pyroclastic flow. The former class of <b>tephras</b> become hydrated and only moderately oxidized with some limited development of dioctehedral smectite clay minerals and minimal palagomitization. The latter class of <b>tephras</b> are highly palagonitized which implies a high degree of hydration and oxidation. In the most of highly altered <b>tephras,</b> all the Fe(2 +) that is initially in the volcanic glass is converted to Fe(3 +) within nanophase and bulk ferric oxide phases in the palagonite. There is also more extensive development in tuff cone beds of zeolite and phyllosilicate minerals. The differences in reflectance spectra of altered basaltic <b>tephras</b> can be traced to initial differences in the water/magma ratio extant at the volcanic vent...|$|R
5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose <b>tephra,</b> easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped by hard lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose <b>tephra</b> within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.|$|E
5|$|Strombolian eruptions eject {{volcanic}} {{bombs and}} lapilli fragments that travel in parabolic paths before landing around their source vent. The steady accumulation of small fragments builds cinder cones composed completely of basaltic pyroclasts. This form of accumulation tends {{to result in}} well-ordered rings of <b>tephra.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of eruptions in terms of activity, {{explosive}} eruptions and effusive eruptions. Explosive eruptions are characterized by gas-driven explosions that propels magma and <b>tephra.</b> Effusive eruptions, meanwhile, are characterized by the outpouring of lava without significant explosive eruption.|$|E
40|$|Of {{the various}} races of {{white-eyes}} that inhabit the central {{group of the}} Solomon Islands, the race from the island of Rendova {{was the first to}} become known to science. Tristram (1882) recorded this race, which he indentified with <b>Tephras</b> olivaceus Ramsay, described the previous year from the "Solomon Islands", without an exact indication of its type-locality (Ramsay, 1881). Tristram (l. c.) stated that the species was a typical member of the genus Zosterops, and that, consequently, <b>Tephras</b> olivaceus Ramsay became preoccupied by Zosterops olivacea auct. (Certhia olivacea L.) from Réunion. Therefore he proposed the new name Zosterops rendovae, his comment being as follows : "This bird has already been described by Mr. Ramsay [...] . as <b>Tephras</b> olivaceus, sp. nov. Whether the characteristics of the genus <b>Tephras,</b> as laid down by Hartlaub, are sufficient to separate it from Zosterops may be open to doubt; but this bird agrees with Zosterops and not with <b>Tephras</b> [...] . There being already a Z. olivacea, I have felt it necessary to substitute another name for this very interesting species Only a few months later Salvadori (1882) remarked that the species that Tristram had before him when he gave the name Zosterops rendovae, was distinct from <b>Tephras</b> olivaceus Ramsay; but instead of naming the birds recorded by Tristram, he was apparently of the opinion that Z. rendovae could be used for those, whereas he proceeded to give another new name to <b>Tephras</b> olivaceus Ramsay : Zosterops ramsayi Salvadori. It is not to the purpose to follow up the unfortunate series of new names given to <b>Tephras</b> olivaceus Ramsay, but it must be remarked that the use of the name Z. rendovae by Salvadori and many subsequent author...|$|R

All these <b>tephras</b> are of rhyolitic to rhyodacitic composition and the eruptions that generated them have an estimated volcanic explosivity index of 3.|$|R
5|$|Until 17,800 {{years before}} present, the region {{southeast}} of Hudson {{was covered by}} the glaciers of the last ice age. Their retreat left a series of lakes that caught <b>tephra</b> deposited by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the eruption, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 340th Bombardment Group was based at Pompeii Airfield near Terzigno, Italy, just a few {{kilometres}} from the eastern base of the volcano. The <b>tephra</b> and hot ash damaged the fabric control surfaces, the engines, the Plexiglas windscreens and the gun turrets of the 340th's B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. Estimates ranged from 78 to 88 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Explosive eruptions may {{decrease}} and {{be followed}} by the eruption of viscous lava to form a lava dome in the newly formed crater. Precipitation would frequently trigger lahars and these would continuously create problems in the Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. If the lava dome continues to grow, it would eventually rise above the crater rim. The lava would be cooling and expanding then may produce landslides to create a massive zone of blocky talus in the Squamish river valley. While the dome of lava grows, it would frequently subside to create large pyroclastic flows that would again travel down the adjacent Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. <b>Tephra</b> swept away from the pyroclastic flows would create ash columns with elevations of at least , repeatedly depositing <b>tephra</b> on the communities of Whistler and Pemberton and again disrupting regional air traffic. Lava of the unstable dome may occasionally create minor pyroclastic flows, explosions and eruption columns. The community of Squamish would be abandoned, Highway 99 {{would be out of}} service and destroyed, and traffic adjacent to Vancouver, Pemberton and Whistler would remain forced to travel along a route to the east that is more lengthy than Highway 99.|$|E
25|$|The Finlay <b>tephras</b> {{are largely}} {{composed}} of elements most {{similar to those}} of Hoodoo Mountain, a flat-topped volcano that formed subglacially at least 100,000years ago. Two phonolitic lava flows on its south flank were erupted between 10,000and 9,000years ago and remain unglaciated. They have a similar chemistry to the glass composition of the Finlay <b>tephras.</b> However, no <b>tephras</b> or pyroclastic rocks have been found at Hoodoo Mountain that were erupted the same time as these lava flows. Therefore, other possible sources have been proposed. At the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, basalts of probable Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene age have been found, but their exact ages and chemical compositions are not well known. Because Heart Peaks and nearby Level Mountain have been poorly studied and it is unknown if they contain Holocene age volcanic rocks, they are also possible sources for the Finlay <b>tephras.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1929 Gareloi Volcano {{underwent}} a major explosive eruption where it generated four lava flows, andesitic tuff, volcanic glass, and scoria of red tone.

5|$|Large {{explosive}} eruptions in {{the southern}} segment of the Southern Volcanic Zone occur on average every 725 years, and tephras from volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone have been transported over large distances.

5|$|Magmatic eruptions have {{produced}} <b>tephra,</b> pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow cinder cone.

40|$|Abstract: Microscopic {{studies of}} late-Quaternary <b>tephras</b> from Iceland yield a {{detailed}} tephrochronology in deposits of the British Isles, where the quantities of volcanic glass employed {{are much less}} than those used to construct almost any other late-Quatemary tephrochronology. We summarize improved methods of isolating extremely sparse glass shards for light microscope and electron microprobe analysis and provide major element geochemistry for 20 volcanic glass layers detected in Ireland, including those which comprise an outline historic tephrochronology for Ireland. The paper highlights possible limitations of chronology construction when attempting to separate dated <b>tephras</b> whose major element geochemistries are almost identical. <b>Tephras</b> {{in other parts of}} the British Isles and Europe are used, with those in Ireland, to demonstrate further applications of A tephrochronology, especially for dating deposits where other dating methods (e. g., radiocarbon) have proved HOLOCENE difficult.

40|$|Tephrochronology {{is the use}} of primary, {{characterized}} <b>tephras</b> or cryptotephras as chronostratigraphic marker beds {{to connect}} and synchronize geological, paleoenvironmental, or archaeological sequences or events, or soils/paleosols, and, uniquely, to transfer relative or numerical ages or dates to them using stratigraphic and age information together with mineralogical and geochemical compositional data, especially from individual glass-shard analyses, obtained for the tephra/cryptotephra deposits. To function as an age-equivalent correlation and chronostratigraphic dating tool, tephrochronology may be undertaken in three steps: (i) mapping and describing <b>tephras</b> and determining their stratigraphic relationships, (ii) characterizing <b>tephras</b> or cryptotephras in the laboratory, and (iii) dating them using a wide range of geochronological methods. Tephrochronology is also an important tool in volcanology, informing studies on volcanic petrology, volcano eruption histories and hazards, and volcano-climate forcing.

5|$|Of {{the five}} major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions {{in the past}} 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes {{generate}} magma of dacitic origin, the viscous magma builds up since it cannot flow through the eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating in an explosion that ejects materials such as <b>tephra,</b> which in its simplest form, is ash.|$|E
5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards pose {{a significant}} threat {{to human life}} near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of volcanic ash, also known as <b>tephra,</b> creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions—during which lava, <b>tephra</b> (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure—have been distinguished by volcanologists.

30|$|Both {{surface water}} {{circulation}} and water ventilation in the Japan Sea have oscillated over orbital and millennial time scales during the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene, reflecting glacio-eustatic sea level and East Asian monsoon fluctuations (Oba et al. 1991; Tada et al. 1999 : Itaki et al. 2004; Watanabe et al. 2007; Usami et al. 2013).
