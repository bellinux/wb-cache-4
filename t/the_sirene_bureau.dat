50|$|Mr. Tab - <b>the</b> <b>Sirenes</b> Purser - {{would prove}} {{invaluable}} at this point. With {{the help of}} the local Chaplain, he managed to get a letter through, and soon the brothers were free.|$|R
5000|$|The Naïades were expensive, due {{to their}} Roma-bronze construction; each unit cost Fr.365,000 (approx. £14,510) some three-fifths (...) of <b>the</b> <b>Sirène</b> classs unit cost of £24,700, despite being {{less than half the}} size by displacement.|$|R
50|$|Not all of Outerbridge's {{adventures in}} the Civil War {{would be as}} pleasant, as he would be twice {{captured}} by the North. On one of these occasions, he was serving on <b>the</b> steamer <b>Sirene.</b> Originally owned by the British government and used as the Dockyard duty boat, the ship was mothballed and sold to Mr. Fininsey, the popular Confederate Consul in Bermuda. Fininsey deployed <b>the</b> <b>Sirene</b> to Wilmington with a crew, to bring back another steamship, the Cape of Good Hope, {{to act as a}} cotton freighter. At the time, the Cape of Good Hope was a passenger boat between Wilmington and Smithfield, a role that <b>the</b> <b>Sirene</b> would then fulfill. Captain Jeremiah Peniston was selected as the ship's Master, with Outerbridge's brother, Eldon, as first officer and Outerbridge himself as second officer. A Virginian {{man by the name of}} Mr. Tab was the ship's Purser.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sirène</b> was a 40-gun Coquille class frigate of the French Navy. She {{took part}} in a number of campaigns and actions before she was badly damaged in a battle on 22 March 1808. Refloated after being beached to avoid capture, she was hulked. Sirène was broken up in 1825.|$|R
30|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} SIRENE’s design and implementation. A review of related research publications and projects is initially presented. An overview of the SDI architecture and the different modules and services then are described. A hypothetical use case of <b>the</b> <b>SIRENE</b> SDI follows. Discussion and ongoing activities conclude the article.|$|R
50|$|A week out of Bermuda, <b>the</b> rather slow <b>Sirene</b> reached <b>the</b> American {{coastline}} off Bowford, North Carolina. She head southwards towards Cape Fear under sail, {{hoping that}} it would deceive the Blockade fleet. Only an hour later, the Man-of-War Key Stone State (which was later purchased by a Mr. Webb of New York, renamed the San Francisco and used as a mail ship to, ironically, Bermuda) intercepted <b>the</b> <b>Sirene</b> and towed it into Bowford, with the crew having a merry laugh at the blockade runners' pitiful craft.|$|R
40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. Based on our {{experience}} gained {{in the development}} of <b>the</b> <b>SIRENE</b> 2 system, we present the different aspects of the ongoing work concerning speech analysis and feature extraction, automatic guidance of a trainee, and performance assessment. Emphasis is given to the importance of acoustic-phonetic analysis at different abstraction levels. These points are illustrated with practical examples...|$|R
50|$|The Sirène-class {{submarines}} were a sub-class of the 600 Series {{built for}} the French Navy prior to World War II. There were four vessels in the class, built to a Loire-Simonot design. They were ordered in 1925 and completed by 1927. The four boats of <b>the</b> <b>Sirène</b> class saw action during the Second World War, from September 1939 until the French armistice in June 1940.|$|R
2500|$|Most of the Allied ships, however, {{were still}} veteran Napoleonic-era warhorses (e.g. HMS Albion).

25|$|The scene {{changes to}} Israel in 1956, and shows Rachel meeting {{her husband and}} their two children, and walking back into Kibbutz Stein, which a sign at the gate announces was funded with the {{recovered}} money stolen from Jews killed during the war. In the final scene the tranquility of Rachel and her family is interrupted by explosions heard in <b>the</b> distance; <b>the</b> <b>sirene</b> announces an air attack and the Israeli soldiers poistion themselves {{at the front of}} the kibbutz. It is October 1956 and the Suez crisis has begun.|$|R
25|$|On 20 October 1827, as {{the weather}} got worse, the British, Russian and French fleets entered the Bay of Navarino in {{peaceful}} formation to shelter themselves {{and to make sure}} that the Egyptian-Turkish fleet did not slip off and attack Hydra. When a British frigate sent a boat to request the Egyptians to move their fire ships, the officer on board was shot by the Egyptians. The frigate responded with musket fire in retaliation and an Egyptian ship fired a cannon shot at the French flagship, <b>the</b> <b>Sirene,</b> which returned fire.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sirènes</b> had a {{displacement}} of 609 t surfaced and 757 t submerged. They had an endurance of [...] at 7.5 kn, {{with a maximum}} surface speed of 13.5 kn, and a submerged speed of 7.5 kn. Their armament was seven torpedo tubes (3 forward, 2 midships, and 2 aft) with an outfit of 13 torpedoes. As with all French submarines of this period, the midships torpedo tubes were fitted externally in trainable mounts. They had a single 75 mm and two 8 mm machine guns, and were manned by crews of 41 men.|$|R

5000|$|On 20 October 1827, {{she took}} part in the Battle of Navarino, under Pierre Bernard Milius, sailing behind <b>the</b> <b>Sirène</b> in <b>the</b> line. At the {{outbreak}} of the battle, Scipion narrowly escaped destruction by a fireship which became jammed under her bowsprit; her fore sails caught fire and the fire spread into the upper gun-deck, but was eventually put out by the crew. Trident succeeded in attaching a tow-line to the fireship and, with the assistance of [...] and two other British boats, pulling it clear. Sirène, Trident and Scipion then proceeded to silence the batteries of the fort of Navarino.|$|R

30|$|For {{decision}} support of environmental domains, a review is proposed by Sokolova et al. (2011) {{in areas of}} complex system analysis and decision making by means of intelligent tools, including agent-based systems. The article also compares existing agent-oriented methodologies and frameworks for {{decision support}}. Although multiple efforts, created for theoretic research and practical implementation of information systems, resulted in many successful applications, many successful efforts still lack a systemic view and cannot offer a coordinated and controlled approach that links methods together into a coherent methodology. Such partially successful DSSs focus excessively on a specific aspect of environmental management {{in contrast with the}} comprehensive nature of <b>the</b> <b>SIRENE</b> DSS, which is a workflow support tool for all the emergency management phases needed for all kinds of risk.|$|R

50|$|Singer Tim Freeman {{released}} a third album billed as Frazier Chorus (Wide Awake), {{which did not}} reach the UK Albums Chart, although it was released years after Ray on a small independent record label, while Kate Holmes moved into electronica via <b>the</b> bands <b>Sirenes,</b> Technique, and Client.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of SIRENE is {{to simulate the}} response to neutrino events of any type of high energy neutrino telescope. Additionally, it implements different geometries for a neutrino detector and different configurations and characteristics of photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs) inside the optical modules of the detector through a library of C+ + classes. This {{could be considered a}} massive statistical analysis of photo-electrons. Aim of this work is the development of a multithreaded version of <b>the</b> <b>SIRENE</b> detector simulation software for high energy neutrinos. This approach allows utilization of multiple CPU cores leading to a potentially significant decrease in the required execution time compared to the sequential code. We are making use of the OpenMP framework for the production of multithreaded code running on the CPU. Finally, we analyze the feasibility of a GPU-accelerated implementation...|$|R
