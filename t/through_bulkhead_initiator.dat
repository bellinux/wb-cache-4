40|$|This report {{describes}} {{recent work}} done to demonstrate feasibility of a fail-safe <b>Through</b> <b>Bulkhead</b> <b>Initiator</b> with minimum dimensions and {{suitable for use}} in cyclical thermal environments. Much of the ground work for a fail-safe TBI was previously done by A. C. Schwartz. 1 This study is an expansion of Schwartz’s work to evaluate devices with bulkheads of 304 stainless steel and Inconel 718; explosive donors of PETN, BNCP, and a 0. 005 inch thick steel flying plate donor traveling at 2. 6 mm/s; and explosive acceptors of PETN and BNCP. Bulkhead thickness were evaluated {{in the range of}} 0. 040 to 0. 180 inch. The explosive acceptors initiated a small HMX pellet to drive a 0. 005 inch thick steel flying plate, and VISAR histories of the HMX-driven flying plates were the measure of acceptable performance. A companion set of samples used a PMMA acceptor to measure the particle velocities at the bulkhead/PMMA interface with VISAR. These data were used to compute the input pressure to the acceptor explosives in an attempt to measure initiation threshold. Unfortunately, the range of bulkhead thicknesses tested did not give any failures, thus the threshold was not determined. It was found that either explosive or the flying plate would perform as a TBI in the bulkhead thickness range tested. The optimum TBI is abou...|$|E
40|$|A report {{presents}} {{a proposal to}} reduce the risk of accidental ignition of certain upper-stage rocket motors or other high energy hazardous systems. At present, mechanically in-line initiators are used for initiation of many rocket motors and/or other high-energy hazardous systems. Electrical shorts and/or mechanical barriers, which are the basic safety devices in such systems, are typically removed as part of final arming or pad preparations while personnel are present. At this time, static discharge, test equipment malfunction, or incorrect arming techniques can cause premature firing. The proposal calls for a modular out-of-line ignition system incorporating detonating-cord elements, identified as the donor and the acceptor, separated by an air gap. In the safe configuration, the gap would be sealed with two shields, which would prevent an accidental firing of the donor from igniting the system. The shields would be removed to enable normal firing, in which shrapnel generated by the donor would reliably ignite the acceptor to continue the ordnance train. The acceptor would then ignite a <b>through</b> <b>bulkhead</b> <b>initiator</b> (or other similar device), which would ignite the motor or high-energy system. One shield would be remotely operated and would be moved to the armed position when a launch was imminent or conversely returned to the safe position if the launch were postponed. In the event of failure of the remotely operated shield, the other shield could be inserted manually to safe the system...|$|E

50|$|The {{doors that}} allow passage <b>through</b> <b>bulkheads</b> between {{compartments}} inside a ship can be closed during emergencies to seal off one compartment from another, thus sequestering water leaks, fires, or waves of air pressure and {{preventing them from}} compromising {{the rest of the}} ship's interior. The objects that are wedged against the door to hold it closed against the water or air pressure are an example of dogs.

50|$|In {{architecture}} {{the term}} is frequently used to denote any boxed in beam or other downstand from a ceiling and by extension even the vertical downstand face of an area of lower ceiling beyond. This usage presumably derives from experience on boats where to maintain the structural function personnel openings <b>through</b> <b>bulkheads</b> always retain {{a portion of the}} bulkhead crossing the head of the opening. Head strikes on these downstand elements are commonplace hence in architecture any overhead downstand element comes to be referred to as a bulkhead.|$|R

50|$|On 7 April 1989, {{while under}} the command of Captain 1st Rank Evgeny Vanin and running {{submerged}} at a depth of 335 m about 180 km southwest of Bear Island (Norway), fire broke out in the engine room due to a short-circuit, and even though watertight doors were shut, the resulting fire spread <b>through</b> <b>bulkhead</b> cable penetrations. The reactor scrammed and propulsion was lost. Electrical problems spread as cables burned through, and control of the boat was threatened. An emergency ballast tank blow was performed and the submarine surfaced eleven minutes after the fire began. Distress calls were made, and most of the crew abandoned ship.|$|R

Although an optical network onboard an aircraft will be relatively short, with lengths up to hundreds of metres rather than kilometres, the backbone loss can still be high. There may be many interconnections <b>through</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> for installation and maintenance with high losses over the operating environment. Also, slip-rings, wavelength filters and splitters are other sources of attenuation. In many cases, amplification will be required to overcome these losses. Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOAs) provide a cost effective means for this amplification over a wavelength range of between 850 nm and 1600 nm [1]...|$|R
500|$|A Royal Navy {{review board}} judged that a {{contributory}} {{factor in the}} loss was that Audacious was not at action stations, with water-tight doors locked and damage control teams ready. Attempts were made to use the engine circulating pumps as additional bilge pumps, but the rapid rise of water prevented this. Although hatches were open {{at the time of}} the explosion, it was claimed that all were closed before rising water reached them.

40|$|Understanding {{thermally}} driven coupled hydrological, mechanical, and chemical processes in unsaturated fractured tuff {{is essential for}} evaluating {{the performance of the}} potential radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The Drift Scale Test (DST), intended for acquiring such an understanding of these processes, has generated a huge volume of temperature and moisture redistribution data. Sophisticated thermal hydrological (TH) conceptual models have yielded a good fit between simulation results and those measured data. However, some uncertainties in understanding the TH processes associated with the DST still exist. This paper evaluates these uncertainties and provides quantitative estimates of the range of these uncertainties. Of particular interest for the DST are the uncertainties resulting from the unmonitored loss of vapor <b>through</b> an open <b>bulkhead</b> of the test. There was concern that the outcome from the test might have been significantly altered by these losses. Using alternative conceptual models, we illustrate that predicted mean temperatures from the DST are within 1 degree C of the measured mean temperatures through {{the first two years of}} heating. The simulated spatial and temporal evolution of drying and condensation fronts is found to be qualitatively consistent with measured saturation data. Energy and mass balance computation shows that no more than 13 percent of the input energy is lost because of vapor leaving the test domain <b>through</b> the <b>bulkhead.</b> The change in average saturation in fractures is also relatively small. For a hypothetical situation in which no vapor is allowed to exit <b>through</b> the <b>bulkhead,</b> the simulated average fracture saturation is not qualitatively different enough to be discerned by measured moisture redistribution data. This leads us to conclude that the DST, despite the uncertainties associated with open field testing, has provided an excellent understanding of the TH processes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAircraft {{design and}} {{development}} is a continuous process over the decades. In many design objectives drive airplane development. One main driver is the aircraft's bulkhead design, while retaining safety, function and performance. As extensive measurement campaigns have revealed, bulkhead can be saved in existing but having big holes for passing the bundle of wires is main drawback. If any problem with electrical systems constitutes a serious fire hazard and also may cause the destruction of electric wiring and damage to units of electrical equipment when we are allowing that bundle of wires passing <b>through</b> <b>bulkhead</b> holes. Secondly, losing strength of bulkheads. In other hand aircraft's electrical system plays more essential role in aircraft. Certain requirements have been established for the electrical systems of both civil and military aircraft. Electrical systems must be free of hazards in themselves, in their method of operation, and in their effects of {{other parts of the}} aircraft; and they must be installed in such a manner but in existing that they are adequately unprotected from damage by making holes over bulkheads and allowing n number of bundles through it, that may affect both bulkhead design as well as neighborhood systems.
