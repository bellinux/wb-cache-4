5|$|In the 2013, the perturbational {{complexity}} index (PCI) was proposed, {{a measure}} of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state, making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.|$|E
5|$|Other {{techniques}} {{may be used}} {{to confirm}} a particular diagnosis. X-rays are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. Electroencephalography and <b>transcranial</b> doppler may also be used. The most sensitive physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG, which has documented an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain-injured subjects.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive <b>transcranial</b> {{magnetic}} stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its {{usefulness in}} PD {{is an open}} research topic, Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on <b>transcranial</b> doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Other novel {{non-invasive}} rehabilitation {{methods are}} currently being developed to augment physical therapy to improve motor function of stroke patients, such as <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation (TMS) and <b>transcranial</b> direct-current stimulation (tDCS) and robotic therapies.|$|E

25|$|If the {{examination}} reveals a bruit (sound due to turbulent blood flow), imaging studies such as <b>transcranial</b> doppler (TCD) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) should be performed.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} with <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation {{has been shown}} to give the same hallucination results in the laboratory (termed magnetophosphenes), and these conditions have been shown to occur in nature near lightning strikes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcranial</b> {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) {{is a form}} of neurostimulation that uses constant, low direct current delivered via electrodes on the head; it can be contrasted with cranial electrotherapy stimulation which generally uses alternating current the same way.|$|E
25|$|Compared with <b>transcranial</b> {{magnetic}} stimulation {{for people}} with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, ECT relieves depression about twice as well, reducing the score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression by about 15 points, while TMS reduced it by 9 points.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcranial</b> {{magnetic}} stimulation, {{which is}} a somewhat well established treatment for depression, has been proposed, and used, {{as a treatment for}} autism. A review published in 2013 found insufficient evidence to support its widespread use for autism spectrum disorders. A 2015 review found tentative but insufficient evidence to justify its use outside of clinical studies.|$|E
25|$|Using a {{completely}} different kind of intervention—application of <b>Transcranial</b> Magnetic Stimulation in daily sessions over five days—changes were observedin and near the TMS target areas {{as well as in}} the basal ganglia of volunteers in their mid-twenties, compared to a control group that had received placeboic TMS treatment. It is possible, though, that these changes simply reflect vascularization effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{adverse effects}} {{associated}} with tDCS {{appear to be}} mostly limited to headaches and itchiness and redness {{at the site of}} stimulation. When applied following established safety protocols, <b>transcranial</b> direct current stimulation is widely regarded as a safe method of brain stimulation. Safety protocols limit the current, duration, and frequency of stimulation, thereby limiting the effects and risk.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of sound}} therapy by either hearing aids or {{tinnitus}} maskers helps the brain ignore the specific tinnitus frequency.

25|$|Haemodynamic {{problems}} {{have been found in}} the blood flow of MS patients using Doppler, initially using <b>transcranial</b> color-coded duplex sonography (TCCS), pointing to a relationship with a vascular disease called chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI).

25|$|Newer, {{non-invasive}} techniques {{now include}} brain imaging by {{positron emission tomography}} (PET); {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI); event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG); and <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation (TMS). Brain imaging techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy). Each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in psycholinguistics.|$|E
25|$|American Psychiatric Association {{treatment}} guidelines {{recommend that}} initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors that include severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice {{in people with}} mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and {{should be given to}} all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to combine fMRI signal {{acquisition}} with tracking of participants' responses and reaction times. Physiological measures such heart rate, breathing, skin conductance (rate of sweating), and eye movements are sometimes captured simultaneously with fMRI. The method can also be combined with other brain-imaging techniques such as <b>transcranial</b> stimulation, direct cortical stimulation and, especially, EEG. The fMRI procedure can also be combined with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to have supplementary information about both oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping (CSM) {{is considered}} {{the gold standard for}} mapping functional regions of the brain to create a presurgical plan that maximizes the patient's functional outcome. The history of beneficial outcomes and the amount of information already established about the CSM technique makes it advantageous in clinical and research applications. However, because it has the drawback of being an intraoperative technique, there is growing debate about its status as the preferred method. Instead, <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation (TMS), a new procedure that does not carry the same amount of surgical risk, is being considered.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of research concerns brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music perception and performance. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy, psychology, music theory, computer science, and other allied fields, and use such techniques as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET).|$|E
25|$|Blood transfusions {{are often}} used in the {{management}} of sickle-cell disease in acute cases and to prevent complications by decreasing the number of red blood cells (RBC) that can sickle by adding normal red blood cells. In children preventative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy has been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} first stroke or silent stroke when <b>transcranial</b> Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography shows abnormal cerebral blood flow. In those who have sustained a prior stroke event it also reduces the risk of recurrent stroke and additional silent strokes.|$|E
25|$|Case studies aside, modern {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} the relation between brain and mind {{is much more than}} simple correlation. By damaging, or manipulating, specific areas of the brain repeatedly under controlled conditions (e.g. in monkeys) and reliably obtaining the same results in measures of mental state and abilities, neuroscientists have shown that the relation between damage to the brain and mental deterioration is likely causal. This conclusion is further supported by data from the effects of neuro-active chemicals (such as those affecting neurotransmitters) on mental functions, but also from research on neurostimulation (direct electrical stimulation of the brain, including <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation).|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that TMS {{can be used to}} manipulate the perception of authorship of a specific choice. Experiments showed that neurostimulation could affect which hands people move, even though the experience of free will was intact. An early TMS study revealed that activation of one side of the neocortex could be used to bias the selection of one's opposite side hand in a forced-choice decision task. Ammon and Gandevia found {{that it was possible to}} influence which hand people move by stimulating frontal regions that are involved in movement planning using <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.|$|E
25|$|In neurologically normal subjects, Blanke {{and colleagues}} then {{showed that the}} {{conscious}} experience {{of the self and}} body being in the same location depends on multisensory integration in the TPJ. Using event-related potentials, Blanke and colleagues showed the selective activation of the TPJ 330–400 ms after stimulus onset when healthy volunteers imagined themselves in the position and visual perspective that generally are reported by people experiencing spontaneous OBEs. <b>Transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation in the same subjects impaired mental transformation of the participant's own body. No such effects were found with stimulation of another site or for imagined spatial transformations of external objects, suggesting the selective implication of the TPJ in mental imagery of one's own body.|$|E
25|$|Right-handed {{people would}} {{normally}} choose {{to move their}} right hand 60% of the time, but when the right hemisphere was stimulated they would instead choose their left hand 80% of the time (recall that the right hemisphere of the brain {{is responsible for the}} left side of the body, and the left hemisphere for the right). Despite the external influence on their decision-making, the subjects continued to report that they believed their choice of hand had been made freely. In a follow-up experiment, Alvaro Pascual-Leone and colleagues found similar results, but also noted that the <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation must occur within 200 milliseconds, consistent with the time-course derived from the Libet experiments.|$|E
25|$|Lau et al. {{set up an}} {{experiment}} where subjects would look at an analogue-style clock, and a red dot would move around the screen. Subjects were told to click the mouse button whenever they felt the intention to do so. One group was given a <b>transcranial</b> magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, {{and the other was}} given a sham TMS. Subjects in the intention condition were told to move the cursor to where it was when they felt the inclination to press the button. In the movement condition, subjects moved their cursor to where it was when they physically pressed the button. Results showed the TMS was able to shift the perceived intention forward by 16ms, and shifted back the 14ms for the movement condition. Perceived intention could be manipulated up to 200ms after the execution of the spontaneous action, indicating that the perception of intention occurred after the executive motor movements. Often it is thought that free will were to exist, it would require intention to be the causal source of behavior. These results show that intention may not be the causal source of all behavior.|$|E
500|$|Vasospasm, {{in which}} the blood vessels constrict and thus {{restrict}} blood flow, is a serious complication of SAH. It can cause ischemic brain injury (referred to as [...] "delayed ischemia") and permanent brain damage {{due to lack of}} oxygen in parts of the brain. It can be fatal if severe. Delayed ischemia is characterized by new neurological symptoms, and can be confirmed by <b>transcranial</b> Doppler or cerebral angiography. About one third of all people admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage will have delayed ischemia, and half of those have permanent damage as a result. It is possible to screen for the development of vasospasm with <b>transcranial</b> Doppler every 24–48hours. A blood flow velocity of more than 120centimeters per second is suggestive of vasospasm.|$|E
500|$|<b>Transcranial</b> {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS), a new noninvasive {{technique for}} studying brain activity, uses powerful magnetic fields that {{are applied to}} the brain from outside the head. [...] It is a method of exciting or interrupting brain activity in a specific and controlled location, and thus is able to imitate aphasic symptoms while giving the researcher more control over exactly which {{parts of the brain}} will be examined. [...] As such, it is a less invasive alternative to direct cortical stimulation, which can be used for similar types of research but requires that the subject's scalp be removed, and is thus only used on individuals who are already undergoing a major brain operation (such as individuals undergoing surgery for epilepsy). [...] The logic behind TMS and direct cortical stimulation is similar to the logic behind aphasiology: if a particular language function is impaired when a specific region of the brain is knocked out, then that region must be somehow implicated in that language function. [...] Few neurolinguistic studies to date have used TMS; direct cortical stimulation and cortical recording (recording brain activity using electrodes placed directly on the brain) have been used with macaque monkeys to make predictions about the behavior of human brains.|$|E

[...] Of these emerging treatment options, the most studied intervention is prism adaptation and there is evidence of relatively long-term functional gains from comparatively short-term usage. [...] However, all of these treatment interventions (particularly the stimulation techniques) are relatively new and randomised, controlled trial evidence is still limited.
