Now at the beach house, Peter and Walter search for and retrieve a device that can seal shut the doorway into the other universe. Walter explains to Peter <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> lost something very dear to him {{and that he had}} to go and bring it back from another reality; the device was created to prevent something from following him.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{proposed}} to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again assume {{command of the}} provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue {{the appearance of a}} still-functional constitution. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was also}} notable {{in his time}} for his extravagant lifestyle. The deaths {{of his father and}} elder brother while he was still a young man {{provided}} Harvey with a considerable fortune, much of which he squandered gambling in London. Harvey's exploits at the gaming tables became legendary, one story claiming <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> bet £100,000 on a single game of chance and lost, only to win most of it back on the following throw. Despite his dissolute lifestyle, Harvey was married and had numerous children; he was survived by six daughters and had three sons who predeceased him.|$|E

5|$|Hygeberht had {{resigned}} his see before Lichfield was demoted {{back to a}} bishopric. He was still named as archbishop in 799, but evidence suggests {{that he no longer}} controlled all of the suffragan bishops <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> had. Possibly, he was replaced at Lichfield; his successor Ealdwulf attended a council in 801, and was named bishop in the council's records. By the time that Æthelhard held another council at Clovesho in 803, Hygeberht was no longer even named as a bishop, and appears at that council as an abbot. Which abbey he was abbot of, and his exact date of death, are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1315 or in 1316, Harclay {{was taken}} captive by the Scots, who demanded 2000 marks in ransom. His {{meteoric}} rise {{over the previous}} years had made him some enemies in local society, who now {{took the opportunity to}} spread slanderous rumours about him at court. The king nevertheless helped raise the necessary money to secure Harclay's freedom, but {{for the next few years}} he seems to have been out of royal favour. It was not until 1319 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> more was appointed sheriff, and at the same time made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles, and Warden of the West Marches. In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament.|$|E
5|$|Quadruple-doubles {{have only}} been {{possible}} since the 1973–74 season, when the NBA started recording both blocked shots and steals. It is often speculated by observers that other all-time greats, namely Oscar Robertson (all time triple-doubles leader with 181), Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Jerry West could conceivably have had quadruple-doubles. West's biography at NBA.com claims <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> recorded an unofficial quadruple-double with 44points, 12rebounds, 10assists and 10blocks. A biography of Wilt Chamberlain claims that he also recorded an unofficial quadruple-double in Game1 of the 1967 Eastern Division Finals against the Boston Celtics, when he had 24points, 32rebounds, 13assists and 12blocks.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} set after Kratos' {{defeat of the}} former God of War, Ares. Now the new God of War, Kratos is on a quest to destroy the legendary Ambrosia of Asclepius, an elixir with magical healing {{properties}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> found {{when he was a}} soldier in Sparta. During his quest, Kratos has flashbacks to this period, as he searches for the Ambrosia to save his newly-born daughter, Calliope, who is suffering from the plague. Given until the next full moon, General Kratos travels with a host of Spartans to find the Ambrosia. During this period, he takes counsel from Captain Nikos, his superior in the Spartan army who instructs him about the Spartan code of honor.|$|E
5|$|At Jason's behest, the demigods {{travel to}} Split {{to visit the}} tomb of Diocletian, {{retrieve}} his powerful scepter, and leave a note for Reyna (who has been asked by Annabeth to find the Greek demigods). The god Cupid, guardian of the scepter, refuses to relinquish it until Nico admits <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> {{had a crush on}} Percy Jackson. Sailing through the Adriatic Sea, the ship is attacked by Khione and the Boreads and is only narrowly defended by Piper's newly powerful charmspeaking skills; Piper is still disappointed in her performance and resolves to train in swordsmanship. During the attack, Leo is transported to Ogygia, where he falls in love with Calypso. Although he leaves the island, Leo promises to return for her. While Leo is detained, {{the rest of the crew}} meets with Notus, who helps Jason to realize that he has chosen to be a Greek rather than a Roman demigod, thus settling an internal conflict within himself. Jason later gives up his praetorship to Frank in accordance with this decision.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} a divisional commander, with {{the rank of}} temporary major general, on 19 October 1914, and took command of the newly raised 20th (Light) Division {{at some point in}} September–October. This made him the first New Zealand officer to command a division in the war. On 18 February 1915, he was formally transferred to the British Army, and promoted to major general. The 20th Division moved to France in July 1915, and he commanded it during a minor operation in September, but handed over command on 8 March 1916 due to ill-health. He {{was appointed}} to command a reserve centre at Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, where the arrival of elements of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade in September 1917 meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again had the opportunity to command his own countrymen. He was relieved of command by General Robert Wanless O'Gowan in March 1918, and on 9 May 1918, after a prolonged period of physical and mental ill health, he committed suicide at the Special Neurological Hospital for Officers, Kensington.|$|E

5|$|Moreno González {{was born}} in the ranchería of Guanajuatillo in Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexico at around 5:00a.m. on 8 March 1970. There are few details of Moreno González's upbringing, but {{religion}} may have {{played an important role in}} his early life. His parents had 13 children (including Moreno González). His father Manuel Moreno was reportedly an alcoholic and had several mistresses, and one day he left his family when Moreno González was still very young, forcing his mother to singlehandedly raise the whole family. With their father gone, Moreno González and his siblings lived under the strict discipline of their mother. According to his autobiography, Moreno González had a love-hate relationship with his mother; as a child, he was beaten by his mother for being troublesome and getting into fights. In one occasion, he recalled that his mother once forced him to make his way back to his house by walking on his knees while keeping his arms stretched like a cross throughout the whole day for stealing an animal. Such treatments helped him develop resentment as to partially explain his violent behavior as an adult, he argued. He admitted, however, that he often got into fist fights with other kids from Guanajuatillo and the surrounding rancherías. Moreno González recalled that he would not always win and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> got into 10 fights in a single day. His violent reputation as a child helped him earn the nickname El Más Loco ("The Craziest One")—which he held onto for the rest of his life—among his siblings and other kids from the area where he grew up.|$|E
5|$|Paavo Nurmi Marathon, held {{annually}} since 1969, is {{the oldest}} marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest. In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957. Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi. A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987. The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively. The Nurmi bill {{was replaced by a}} new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993. In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the Paavo Nurmi Stadium. Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek's record on the 10,000 m. In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel Marathon Man as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi. The opera on Nurmi, Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream., written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000. In a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, Mr. Burns brags <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years ago}} the {{government}} built sluice gates for the silt fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not as thick as what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally the government got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which he says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the sluice gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor {{pointed out that the}} river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the sluice gates, it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period there were government fields and sluice gates {{on both sides of the}} river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.|$|E
