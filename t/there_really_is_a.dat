5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E
500|$|Bradman's game evolved with experience. He {{temporarily}} adapted {{his technique}} during the Bodyline series, deliberately {{moving around the}} crease {{in an attempt to}} score from the short-pitched deliveries. At his peak, in the mid-1930s, he had the ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as the occasion demanded. After the Second World War, he adjusted to bat within the limitations set by his age, becoming a steady [...] "accumulator" [...] of runs. However, Bradman never truly mastered batting on sticky wickets. Wisden commented, [...] "f <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> blemish on his amazing record it is... the absence of a significant innings on one of those 'sticky dogs' of old".|$|E

He hires a chef to prepare her a luxurious meal at their house, but must keep Gloria away while the chef is setting up. [...] Jay takes Gloria {{to a great}} restaurant that she loves, {{with the intent to}} leave after pretending to find that his secretary had forgotten to make a reservation. Unfortunately his plan goes awry; at the restaurant <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reservation for two under the name Pritchett, so they have to stay much to Gloria's delight and Jay's flabbergasted anguish. Later, the reservation turns out to have been for Cameron and Mitchell, so that relieved and elated Jay and furious Gloria have to leave again.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ubiquitous}} rubric [...] "criticism of Israel", however, {{has also}} come to designate another kind of discourse—one that has almost become a politico-rhetorical genre unto itself, with its own identifiable vocabulary, narrative conventions, and predictable outcomes. At its ideational core is what the British scholar Bernard Harrison calls a [...] "dialectical scam". It goes something like this: (1) Spot an Israeli action that can serve as the ground of [...] "criticism of Israel" [...] (e.g., Israel's military incursion into the area near Jenin in April 2002 in response to Palestinian terrorist massacres); (2) Then [...] "dissent" [...] in the strongest possible terms, for instance by likening the [...] "razing of Jenin" [...] {{to the destruction of}} the Warsaw Ghetto, while anticipating that [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "repressive" [...] Jewish institutions will try to [...] "silence" [...] the critics by calling them anti-Semites; (3) When taken to task by more sober-minded critics who find that, contrary to your charge, {{there was no such thing}} as [...] "the razing of Jenin" [...] and that the IDF has nothing in common with the SS, cry [...] "foul" [...] and claim their censure perfectly illustrates the point that <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Jewish organizational conspiracy to silence [...] "criticism of Israel" [...] by branding the authors of such criticism [...] "antisemites".|$|E

6000|$|Arran rode to his father's {{house of}} Kinneil, where, either {{because he was}} insane, or because <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Bothwell-Hamilton plot, he was {{locked up in a}} room high above the ground. He let himself down from the window, reached Halyards (a place of Kirkcaldy of Grange), and was thence taken by Mar (whom Knox appears to have warned) to the Queen at Falkland.

60|$|But the {{difficulty}} {{in the case of}} the cat is nothing compared to {{the difficulty}} in the case of human beings. When human beings speak--that is, when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas, and simultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face--it is very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression of a thought, as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds. Of course similar things happen in dreams, where we are mistaken as to the existence of other people. But dreams are more or less suggested by what we call waking life, and are capable of being more or less accounted for on scientific principles if we assume that <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> physical world. Thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural view, that there really are objects other than ourselves and our sense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving them.|$|E

60|$|I am {{told that}} it is a maxim among the {{improvers}} of cattle that you may breed to any degree of nicety you please, and they found this maxim upon another, which {{is that some of the}} offspring will possess the desirable qualities of the parents in a greater degree. In the famous Leicestershire breed of sheep, the object is to procure them with small heads and small legs. Proceeding upon these breeding maxims, it is evident that we might go on till the heads and legs were evanescent quantities, but this is so palpable an absurdity that we may be quite sure that the premises are not just and that <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> limit, though we cannot see it or say exactly where it is. In this case, the point of the greatest degree of improvement, or the smallest size of the head and legs, may be said to be undefined, but this is very different from unlimited, or from indefinite, in Mr Condorcet's acceptation of the term. Though I may not be able in the present instance to mark the limit at which further improvement will stop, I can very easily mention a point at which it will not arrive. I should not scruple to assert that were the breeding to continue for ever, the head and legs of these sheep would never be so small as the head and legs of a rat.|$|E
60|$|I have {{alluded to}} an unmeaning phrase {{to the effect}} that such and such a creed cannot be {{believed}} in our age. Of course, anything can be believed in any age. But, oddly enough, <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sense in which a creed, if it is believed at all, can be believed more fixedly in a complex society than in a simple one. If a man finds Christianity true in Birmingham, he has actually clearer reasons for faith than if he had found it true in Mercia. For the more complicated seems the coincidence, the less it can be a coincidence. If snowflakes fell in the shape, say, of the heart of Midlothian, it might be an accident. But if snowflakes fell in the exact shape of the maze at Hampton Court, I think one might call it a miracle. It is exactly as of such a miracle that I have since come to feel of the philosophy of Christianity. The complication of our modern world proves the truth of the creed more perfectly than any of the plain problems of the ages of faith. It was in Notting Hill and Battersea that I began to see that Christianity was true. This is why the faith has that elaboration of doctrines and details which so much distresses those who admire Christianity without believing in it. When once one believes in a creed, one is proud of its complexity, as scientists are proud of the complexity of science. It shows how rich it is in discoveries. If it is right at all, it is a compliment to say that it's elaborately right. A stick might fit a hole or a stone a hollow by accident. But a key and a lock are both complex. And if a key fits a lock, you know it is the right key.|$|E
6000|$|These {{alphabetical}} Indices will, however, be {{of little}} use, unless another, {{and a very}} different kind of Index, be arranged in the mind of the reader; an Index explanatory of the principal purposes and contents of the various parts of this essay. It is difficult to analyze the nature of the reluctance with which either a writer or painter takes it upon him to explain the meaning of his own work, even in cases where, without such explanation, it must in a measure remain always disputable: but I am persuaded that this reluctance is, in most instances, carried too far; and that, wherever <b>there</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> serious purpose in a book or a picture, the author does wrong who, either in modesty or vanity (both feelings have their share in producing the dislike of personal interpretation), trusts entirely to the patience and intelligence of the readers or spectators to penetrate into their significance. At all events, I will, as far as possible, spare such trouble with respect to these volumes, by stating here, finally and clearly, both what they intend and what they contain; and this the rather because I have lately noticed, with some surprise, certain reviewers announcing as a discovery, what I thought had lain palpably on the surface of the book, namely, that [...] "if Mr. Ruskin be right, all the architects, and all the architectural teaching of the last three hundred years, must have been wrong." [...] That is indeed precisely the fact; and the very thing I meant to say, which indeed I thought I had said over and over again. I believe the architects of the last three centuries to have been wrong; wrong without exception; wrong totally, and from the foundation. This is exactly the point I have been endeavoring to prove, from the beginning of this work to the end of it. But as it seems not yet to have been stated clearly enough, I will here try to put my entire theorem into an unmistakable form.|$|E
