40|$|This paper studies {{empirical}} {{linkages between}} cycles and trends in freight transportation activity and real economic activity in Sweden. We find that cycles in freight transportation are highly contemporaneously correlated with cycles in economic variables over both {{the short run}} and the medium run. The pattern of long run growth in freight transportation activity coincides with growth in economic variables during long periods, {{but there are also}} periods with substantial differences. Furthermore, we observe and explain a large decline in trend growth in <b>tonne-kilometres</b> <b>by</b> <b>road</b> from the mid-nineties and onwards. freight transportation; business cycles; trend growth; decoupling; efficiency...|$|R
50|$|The road {{transport}} industry grew strongly {{after the war}} and the sophistication and size of trucks increased. By the end of the 1960s, large articulated trucks accounted for 56% of all <b>tonne-kilometres</b> performed <b>by</b> <b>road</b> transport. <b>By</b> this time waves of takeovers had reorganised the industry with small local firms being taken over by large national transport companies. By 1966 five conglomerates dominated the industry - Ansett, TNT, Mayne Nickless, Brambles and Alltrans/Comet. This rationalisation meant that the union also had to reorganise itself into a strong federal body, capable of operating in a nationally coordinated way.|$|R
5000|$|The 2016 {{annual report}} on NAPE, {{submitted}} to the EU on 28 April 2016, presented the major legislative and non-legislative energy efficiency measures adopted in the previous year. These include the Energy Efficiency Network Initiative aimed at companies, new obligations on non-SMEs to carry out regular energy audits, increased funding for energy efficient commercial renovation and new-build, and a new Energy Efficiency Strategy for Buildings (ESG) that may result in an [...] "almost climate-neutral building stock". In addition, the government {{is in the process}} of developing a scheme to promote heating optimization, an energy efficiency program for waste heat, programs to increase the energy efficiency in municipalities, and measures to improve the use of energy in rail transport. The report also noted that final energy consumption in the transport sector rose by 3.9PJ between 2013 and 2014, as a result of the increase in passenger-kilometres by around 2.0% and <b>tonne-kilometres</b> <b>by</b> around 1.3%, despite improvements in the final energy consumption per kilometre.|$|R
