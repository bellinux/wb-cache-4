40|$|Abstract Background To help {{conservation}} {{programs of the}} endangered spur-thighed tortoise and to gain better insight into its systematics, genetic variation and evolution in the tortoise species <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> (Testudines: Testudinidae) was investigated by sequence analysis of a 394 -nucleotide fragment of the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA gene for 158 tortoise specimens belonging to the subspecies <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> <b>graeca,</b> <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> ibera, <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> terrestris, and a newly recognized subspecies <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> whitei. A 411 -nucleotide fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop was additionally sequenced for a subset of 22 T. graeca, chosen because of their 12 S gene haplotype and/or geographical origin. Results Haplotype networks generated by maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining analyses of both the separate and the combined sequence data sets suggested the existence of two main clades of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca,</b> comprising <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> from northern Africa and <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> from the Turkey and the Middle East, respectively. Conclusion Mitochondrial DNA haplotyping suggests that the tortoise subspecies of T. g. graeca and T. g. ibera are genetically distinct, with a calculated divergence time in the early or middle Pleistocene. Other proposed subspecies could not clearly be recognized based upon their mt haplotypes and phylogenetic position, and were either part of the T. g. graeca or of the T. g. ibera clade, suggesting that genetic evidence {{for the existence of}} most of the 15 proposed subspecies of T. graeca is weak. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The Armenian {{tortoise}} (<b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> armeniaca) or Araxes tortoise is a subspecies of the spur-thighed tortoise.|$|R
50|$|The Greek {{tortoise}} (<b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> ibera) {{is often}} confused with Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni). However, notable differences {{enable them to}} be distinguished.|$|R
40|$|The {{tracheal}} epithelium of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> and Pseudemys scripta elegans was {{studied by}} means of light and electron microscopy, histochemistry and immunocytochemistry. Three cell types were detected by conventional light microscopy: mucous, ciliated and basal. The Grimelius silver argyrophil technique was positive in a population of tracheal cells. By immunocytochemistry, serotonin-containing cells were identified. The mucous cells of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> contained sialomucins and sulphomucins; however, only sialomucins were detected in Pseudemys scripta elegans. By electron microscopy four cell types were observed: mucous, ciliated, basal and endocrine. Plasma cells were also found. The differences between the species studied lay mainly in the ultrastructure of the ciliated cells, the mucous granules {{and the presence of}} a special type of basal cell called 'clear basal cells' in non-hibernating specimens of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca.</b> During hibernation, the tracheal epithelium of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> showed the following changes: (1) Myelin bodies were present in the cytoplasm. (2) The intercellular spaces were remarkably widened. (3) No 'clear basal cells' were present. In conclusion, the tracheal epithelium of the reptiles studied showed a pattern similar to that described in mammals but some differences from reptiles previously studied were found...|$|R
50|$|Species uncertainly {{recorded}} {{include a}} further 8: Eryx jaculus, Eirenis modestus, Malpolon monspessulanus, Natrix tessellata, Vipera xanthina, Chamaeleo chamaeleon, <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> and <b>Testudo</b> hermanni.|$|R
50|$|Testudo marginata is also {{closely related}} to the Greek or spur-thighed {{tortoise}} (<b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca).</b> Both have very similar bodily characteristics—oblong carapaces, large scales on the front legs, large coverings for the head and cone-like scales on the upper thighs, undivided tail coverings, moveable stomach plates, and lack of tail spikes. Presumably, Testudo marginata diverged from ancestral <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> as a population more suited for life in the mountainous regions. Evidence in favor of this is the wide geographical region and the extremely large number of subspecies of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca,</b> including a subspecies in Turkey with strongly bent carapace tiles, like the marginated tortoise. Testudo marginata on the other hand, despite the two subspecies, presents a much more unified appearance, which points toward an earlier appearance in evolutionary history. In captivity, the two species often cross-breed, but this should be avoided.|$|R
5000|$|The Tunisian spur-thighed {{tortoise}} or Nabeul tortoise (<b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> nabeulensis) is a subspecies of {{spur-thighed tortoise}}s. It was originally {{described as a}} new species in 1990, and even placed in a distinct genus. The spur-thighed or [...] "Greek" [...] tortoises are usually collectively referred to as <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca,</b> but this covers {{a wide variety of}} subspecies that have very different ecological and morphological characteristics and appear to comprise at least three phylogenetic lineages. As its name implies, it is found in Tunisia and nearby Algeria.|$|R

40|$|The {{excessive}} {{collection and}} destruction of their natural biotope are the dominant cause of decrease in free nature occurance, therefore the majority of tortoises were classified in the CITES convention. This theses evalued the trade with madagascan and sub-Saharan tortoises from the Testudinidae family between years 1978 and 2012. The CITES Trade databasis was the main sources of datas. The most imported species were Stigmochelys pardalis, <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> and Kinixys homeana. These species were the most imported for comercial purposes and as specimens bred in captivity. The most exported species were Stigmochelys pardalis, <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> and Kinixys homeana again for the comercial purposes and as specimens bred in captivity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAccurate {{information}} on density, structure and vulnerability of wild populations occupies a central place in conservation biology. A mark-recapture study {{was carried out}} during the 2003 activity season in a population of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> in the Central Jbilets (Morocco). Juveniles were poorly represented in our data set, suggesting that juvenile numbers are actually low in our population and/or that tortoises are easier to capture after the behavioural shift of the acquisition of sexual maturity. Although the studied population was localised in a severely overgrazed area, the estimated adult and sub-adult population density, six individuals/ ha, was relatively high comparatively to available estimates in other places. However, within three months of fieldwork, {{it was possible to}} capture most of the adults (60 %), suggesting that <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> graeca populations are very sensitive to illegal and repeated harvesting. Long-term monitoring of the population is required to better appreciate the demographic trend of this population...|$|R
50|$|The genetic {{richness}} of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> is also shown in their crossbreeding. Tortoises of different form groups often mate, producing offspring with widely differing shapes and color. Perhaps {{the best means}} of identification {{for the future is}} simply the place of origin.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Spur-thighed {{tortoise}} is {{a vulnerable}} species. The local declines of populations {{led to an}} imperative need for conservation. <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> reaches its northern range limit in Dobrogea region, Romania. We studied a population from this region, which occupies an enclosed area of 32 ha within Histria Archaeological Complex. Based on a capture-mark-recapture study we estimated the population size of 221 ± 12. 2 individuals. The observed density was 5. 1 individuals/ha. The predicted population size suggests a relatively high density {{in relation to the}} area thus raising attention for a future conservation strategy. The population structure shows reduced sexual dimorphism and an unbiased sex ratio, implying a young population structure. We suggest correlating the future archaeological studies with conservation requirements of tortoises. Key words: <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca,</b> estimating population size, density, Romania...|$|R

50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, animals from northeastern Turkey are very robust, such as Hermann's tortoise. The largest {{specimens}} come from Bulgaria. Specimens of 7 kg have been reported. In comparison, the Tunisian tortoise has a maximum weight of 0.7 kg (1.5 lb). <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> is also {{closely related to}} the marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata). The two species can interbreed, producing offspring capable of reproduction.|$|R
5000|$|The spur-thighed {{tortoise}} (or Greek tortoise) (<b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca)</b> {{is one of}} five species of Mediterranean tortoise (genus Testudo, family Testudinidae). The other four species are the Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii), Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni), and marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata). The {{spur-thighed tortoise}} is a very long lived animal, achieving a lifespan of upwards of 125 years, with some unverified reports of up to 200 years.|$|R
50|$|Some {{tortoises}} in {{the genus}} Testudo also bear spurs, though these {{form on the}} femur rather than the foot. Unlike other spurs, they serve no obvious function. In the spur-thighed tortoise (<b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca),</b> {{both males and females}} have spurs. In a related tortoise, Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), neither the male or female have thigh spurs but both have a spur on the tip of the tail which is larger in the male.|$|R
5000|$|Goravan State Reservation also {{supports}} about 36 species of vertebrate animals from 33 genera and 27 families (Tadevosyan, 2001), {{as well as}} various invertebrates.

40|$|The lung of the tortoise, <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> (Chelonia) was {{studied by}} means of light and {{electron}} microscopy, histochemistry and immunocytochemistry. The lung showed the typical faviform structure of the reptilian lung. Three orders of trabeculae were observed. The epithelium of primary and secondary trabeculae was composed of ciliated, mucous, basal and endocrine cells. Mucous cells contained sialo- and sulpho-mucins and were reactive to the lectins Con-A, WGA, DBA, PNA and SBA. Endocrine cells were observed as solitary cells or forming neuroepithelial bodies. By means of immunocytochemistry, endocrine cells were demonstrated to contain serotonin. In the gas-exchange area Types I and II pneumonocytes and undifferentiated cells were observed. Free macrophages were detected in the faveolar lumen. The lung interstitium contained smooth muscle cells, fibrocytes, pigment cells, myelinated and unmyelinated nerves and intrapulmonary ganglia. Nerve terminals containing clear and dense-cored vesicles were observed in the adventitia of the blood vesicles and interspersed between the smooth muscle bands. The lung of the hibernating specimens showed a marked vacuolisation of pneumonocytes. In conclusion, the lung of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> showed a complex histological organisation. Marked differences from mammalian lung were found...|$|R

40|$|We studied plastron-shaped {{asymmetry}} of the Eurasian Spur-Thighed Tortoise, <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> ibera, {{as related}} to life stage, gender, and distribution. Our analyses of 523 individuals showed that fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in plastron shape varied with gender (males exhibited higher levels of FA than did females) and across populations, whereas life stage had no significant effect. Although we could not identify the potential sources of variation responsible for the observed patterns of developmental instability, our study shows the value of FA as a method for studies of developmental instability in turtles...|$|R
50|$|This {{incomplete}} listing {{shows the}} problems in division into subspecies. The differences in form are primarily in size and weight, as well as coloration, which ranges from dark brown to bright yellow, {{and the types of}} flecks, ranging from solid colors to many spots. Also, the bending-up of the edges of the carapace ranges from minimal to pronounced. So as not to become lost in the number of subspecies, recently a few tortoises previously classified as <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> have been assigned to different species, or even different genera.|$|R
50|$|A {{concentration}} of 0.5 - 2.0 tortoises per hectare were {{registered in the}} Ijevan region. The approximate population in Armenia is a few thousand. <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> armeniaca is threatened with complete disappearance in the medium term; the harvest and the conquest of human habitats are real threats to its future. Nevertheless, it enjoys a protected area in the Khosrov State Reserve in Armenia. Specimens are kept in a number zoos of the world, in the Institute of Zoology of Armenia, and in the Center for Conservation of Biodiversity of the Institute of Botany of Armenia.

40|$|Cryptosporidiosis is {{a disease}} caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium, which affect the {{gastrointestinal}} tract of humans and animals worldwide. In the present study, Cryptosporidium isolates from captive European tortoises (<b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca,</b> <b>Testudo</b> hermanni and Testudo marginata) in Italy were genetically characterised using gene/s encoding Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and/or the hypervariable segment internal to the SSU rDNA. Six isolates from T. graeca, T. hermanni and T. marginata revealed 100 % sequence identity with the zoonotic Cryptosporidium pestis (Cryptosporidium parvum 'bovine genotype'), while a sequence from one T. marginata was a unique uncharacterised genotype (Cryptosporidium sp. ex T. marginata). The new genotype is phylogenetically characterised as belonging to the intestinal cryptosporidial lineage. The present study indicates that tortoises may disseminate Cryptosporidium oocysts in the captive environment. The identification of the zoonotic genotype in the faeces of captive European tortoises indicates a potential risk for humans within the household...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the dynamics of}} a population of spur-thighed tortoises, <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca,</b> placed under long-term protection from human interference. We estimated demographic parameters and constructed vertical life tables based on age structures for two different study periods separated by a 12 -yr interval. Average age at maturity was 6. 9 yr for males and 8. 5 yr for females. Clutch size varied with female size, but tended to be constant among years. Average annual female fecundity over 9 yr was 8. 4 eggs and decreased significantly in years of high rainfall. Females seemed to reproduce yearly, but with a constantly low output, probably maximising both their long-term reproductive potential and the probability of producing offspring during favourable years for hatchling survival. Adult survival was high and constant between periods. Juvenile survivorship from egg to 6 yr and recruitment into the 5 - 8 -yr-old cohorts were significantly higher in the second period. Life tables indicated a predominantly negative demographic trend for the first period, with an average population increase rate of 0. 977, and an overall positive tendency for the second period, with an average increase rate of 1. 091. These figures suggest that the population experienced a variation that was closer to the maximum estimates for the first period, mediated mainly {{by an increase in}} juvenile recruitment. The data indicate that, besides high adult survival rates, occasional high juvenile recruitment bouts may have an important regulatory effect on the population dynamics of <b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A 22 -day-old dicephalic spur-thighed {{tortoise}} (<b>Testudo</b> <b>graeca</b> ibera) died following {{a history of}} lethargy, anorexia and absence of defecation. The two heads were anatomically similar with independent reaction to external stimuli. The carapace showed doubled first and extra second vertebral scutes. Radiography and transplastronal ultrasonography, performed when the animal was alive, revealed two symmetrical stomachs and two asynchronous hearts. These findings were confirmed by necropsy examination. Oesophagus, liver, gallbladder and trachea were also duplicated. Other malformations included pyloric valve atresia of the left stomach, focal stenosis of the transverse colon and liver hypoplasia.
