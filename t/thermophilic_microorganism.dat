50|$|Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22 is {{significant}} due it {{its ability to}} fix nitrogen and reduce it from N2 to NH3 in an optimum temperature of 92 °C. This is an extremely important discovery to the scientific community as this optimum Nitrogen reduction in 92 °C is a total of 28 °C higher than the previously recorded nitrogen reduction of the methanogen, Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus. Before the discovery of Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22, Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus was the most <b>thermophilic</b> <b>microorganism,</b> fixing nitrogen at 64 °C. This particular discovery has potential to reveal a much wider range of conditions for life not only, in the seafloor biosphere but also, other ecosystems that are nitrogen deficient. Looking further into this methanogen, {{it was found that}} the 16S rRNA gene of Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22, is 99% similar to that of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii DSM 2661. This odd 1% divergence between FS406-22 and M. jannaschii is due to a previous separation of ancestral genes. The revelation of a hyperthermophilic, diazotrophic, archaea (strain FS406-22) may be due to the evolutionary history of nitrogenous. The phylogenetic analysis of nitrogenous and chlorophyll iron proteins suggests that an ancestral iron protein duplicated and diverged into nifH and anfH genes. This divergence of genes is estimated to have happened before the separation of the Domains bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Strain FS406-22 contains a functional nifH gene which is able to encode dinitrogenase reductase whereas M. jannaschii does not possess this gene, explaining the 1% divergence between the two species.|$|E

AIB {{was taken up}} by the cells against a substantial concentration gradient (300 : 1) and was present there in a free and unchanged form. Various energy inhibitors and sulfhydryl reagents strongly inhibited the accumulation of AIB. AIB uptake obeyed saturation kinetics, and the Lineweaver-Burk plot is characterized by a biphasic curve. AIB most probably shares a common transport system(s) with alanine, serine, and glycine. A mutant defective in l-alanine uptake was isolated by using the suicide effect due to accumulation of the tritiated substrate. The mutant also exhibited impaired transport activity towards AIB, glycine, and l-serine, but not to phenylalanine or valine. The transport of AIB, glycine, l-alanine, and l-serine was induced by d-alanine (5 × 10 − 3 M) during growth in a succinate- and ammonia-containing medium.
