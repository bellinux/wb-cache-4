500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Eric Goldman {{praised the}} performances of John Slattery and Peyton List, and said the episode [...] "took three of the show's best characters and rocked their worlds in very different ways, telling three separate stories that were all utterly involving and moving, and delivering one of the show's best episodes ever in the process. This show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of...". Roger Friedman of Forbes called the LSD sequences with Jane and Roger to be [...] "so well-written <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> transcendent". Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others have made that the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, the real truth (if we’re telling it) is that older white guys like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E

[...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened.
