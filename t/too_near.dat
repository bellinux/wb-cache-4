5|$|Chrysippus of Cnidos wrote a {{treatise}} on cabbage, which Pliny knew, {{but it has}} not survived. The Greeks were convinced that cabbages and grapevines were inimical, and that cabbage planted <b>too</b> <b>near</b> the vine would impart its unwelcome odor to the grapes; this Mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today.|$|E
5|$|For torpedo {{training}} it {{was even}} more difficult. Shallow water was needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, but at the time, its location near Portsmouth was considered <b>too</b> <b>near</b> the English Channel and as a result Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command giving up the site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo Training Units (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in this regard enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E
5|$|The Spartan {{plan called}} for two armies, one under Lysander and the other under Pausanias, to {{rendezvous}} at and attack the Boeotian city of Haliartus. Lysander, arriving before Pausanias, successfully persuaded the city of Orchomenus to revolt from the Boeotian confederacy, and advanced to Haliartus with his troops and a force of Orchomenians. There, {{he was killed in}} the Battle of Haliartus after bringing his force <b>too</b> <b>near</b> the walls of the city; the battle ended inconclusively, with the Spartans suffering early losses but then defeating a group of Thebans who pursued the Spartans onto rough terrain where they were at a disadvantage. Pausanias, arriving a day later, took back the bodies of the Spartan dead under a truce, and returned to Sparta. There, he was put on trial for his life for failing to arrive and support Lysander at the designated time. He fled to Tegea before he could be convicted.|$|E

25|$|In July 2012 the USAF {{suspended}} {{flight operations}} following a {{flight control system}} failure.

The USAF spent $567 million on 21 C-27Js since 2007, with 16 delivered {{by the end of}} September 2013; 12 had been taken out of service while a further five were to be built by April 2014 as they were <b>too</b> <b>near</b> completion to be worth cancelling.

25|$|In 1972, Wong {{graduated}} from the school and was soon successfully enrolled at the University of Hong Kong studying social work.

Only when she became a social secretary of St John's College Students' Association in year three of study, she had the chance to move into St John's College. In the university, Wong was something of a student activist and in 1973 joined a university visit the mainland China. All these experiences influenced her deeply and she decided to commit herself to the field of social work upon graduation.|$|E
25|$|Candidate {{destinations}} included Guiana, {{where the}} Dutch had already established Essequibo, or {{somewhere near the}} existing Virginia settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because {{the presence of the}} older colony might offer better security and trade opportunities. It was thought, however, that they should not settle <b>too</b> <b>near,</b> since that might too closely duplicate the political environment back in England. The London Company administered a territory of considerable size in the region. The intended settlement location was {{at the mouth of the}} Hudson River. This made it possible to settle at a distance which allayed concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still provided the military and economic benefits of relative closeness to an established colony.|$|E

25|$|Wolves were {{generally}} revered by Aboriginal Canadians that survived by hunting, but were thought little of by those that survived through agriculture. Some Alaska Natives including the Nunamiut of both northern and northwestern Alaska respected the wolf's hunting skill {{and tried to}} emulate the wolf in order to hunt successfully. First Nations such as Naskapi as well as Squamish and Lil'wat view the wolf as a daytime hunting guide. The Naskapis believed that the caribou afterlife is guarded by giant wolves that kill careless hunters who venture <b>too</b> <b>near.</b> The Netsilik Inuit and Takanaluk-arnaluk believed that the sea-woman Nuliayuk's home was guarded by wolves. Wolves were feared by the Tsilhqot'in, who believed that contact with wolves would result in nervous illness or death. The Dena’ina believed wolves were once men, and viewed them as brothers.|$|E
25|$|Along western Java, Banten and the Dutch {{settlement}} in Batavia remained outside of Agung's control. In {{his effort to}} unite Java, Agung claimed Mataram as the successor state of Demak, which historically held Banten as a vassal state. However, the Banten Sultanate opposed Agung's claim, preferring to remain as a sovereign state. Agung therefore considered military conquest {{as a means to}} coerce Banten into Mataram's hegemony. However if Agung were march his armies to Banten, the port city of Batavia would stand as a potential opponent <b>too</b> <b>near</b> to the proximity of the Banten region. This did not deter Agung from pursuing his claim as he already perceived Dutch rule of Batavia {{as a threat to the}} Mataram hegemony, thereby inciting further reason to march upon Batavia whilst en-route to Banten.|$|E
25|$|On 4 January 1804 Raven sailed from Malta as escort to the {{merchant}} ship Dolphin, bound for Naples. She was following a course {{along the south}} coast of Sicily that would take her between the islands of Favignana and Marettimo. In {{the evening of the}} next day master's mate Robert Incledon had the watch and saw a light shape in the moonless night. He thought it was a sail {{but it turned out to}} be a tower on the cliffs near Mazari, on the south west coast of Sicily. At 11pm she ran aground. Despite efforts to lighten and free her, efforts that extended into the afternoon of 6 January, the pumps were unable to clear the water that was coming in and she had to be abandoned. Dolphin rescued her crew. The court martial on 10 February 1805 admonished the master for having steered <b>too</b> <b>near</b> the land.|$|E

25|$|The British plan to {{overcome}} the German deep battlefield, {{was based on a}} conventional attack in three stages but the artillery was able to arrange a fire plan which was far more sophisticated than in previous attacks. The creeping barrage preceded the infantry and in some places moved slowly enough for the infantry to keep up. New smoke shells were fired when the creeping barrage paused beyond each objective, which helped to obscure the British infantry from artillery observers and German machine-gunners far back in the German defensive zone who fired through the British artillery barrages. Around Langemarck, the British infantry formed up close the German positions, <b>too</b> <b>near</b> for the German artillery to fire on for fear of hitting their infantry, although British troops further back at the Steenbeek were severely bombarded. British platoons and sections were allotted objectives and engineers accompanied troops to bridge obstacles and attack strong points. In the 20th Division, each company was reduced to three platoons, two to advance using infiltration tactics and one to mop up areas where the forward platoons had by-passed resistance by attacking from the flanks and from behind.|$|E
500|$|Newton likely {{introduced}} her to the writings of William Wordsworth, and his gift to her of Ralph Waldo Emerson's first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, [...] "whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring". Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying {{that he would like}} to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw. Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862—"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality– but venturing <b>too</b> <b>near,</b> himself– he never returned"—refers to Newton.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} upon going to Hanover, the King {{became involved in}} a dispute with his niece. [...] Victoria, who had a strained relationship with her mother, the Duchess of Kent, {{wanted to give the}} Duchess accommodation near her, for the sake of appearances—but not <b>too</b> <b>near</b> her. [...] To that end, she asked the King to give up his apartments at St. James's Palace in favour of the Duchess. The King, wishing to retain apartments in London in anticipation of frequent visits to England, and reluctant to give way in favour of a woman who had frequently fought with his brother, King William, declined, and Victoria angrily rented a house for her mother. At a time when the young Queen was trying to pay off her father's debts, she saw this as unnecessary expense. Her ill-feeling towards the King increased when he refused, and advised his two surviving brothers to similarly refuse, to give precedence to her intended spouse, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. [...] Ernest argued that the standing of the various royal families had been settled at the Congress of Vienna, and the King of Hanover should not have to yield to one whom he described as a [...] "paper Royal Highness". The act which naturalised Albert as a British subject left the question of his precedence unresolved.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} {{was required to}} secure the road, rail and pontoon bridges over the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and hold them {{for two to three}} days until relieved by XXX Corps. From the beginning, however, Urquhart was severely restricted in how he could prepare and deploy his troops for the upcoming battle. The U.S. IX Troop Carrier Command were limited in their availability; with two more major drops taking place at the same time, there were insufficient carrier aircraft available to fly the entire division to the Netherlands in one lift. Additionally, Major General Williams—commander of IX Troop Carrier Command—decided that it would only be possible for one air lift per day, meaning it would take three days to deliver the entire Division and Polish Brigade to the area. A limited number of areas suitable for glider landings and a reluctance from troop command to fly <b>too</b> <b>near</b> to Arnhem, exposing them to flak from Deelen airfield after the drop, meant that Urquhart was forced to pick drop zones (DZ) and landing zones (LZ) up to [...] from Arnhem itself, {{on the north side of}} the river. With the need to secure the bridges, towns and drop zones for subsequent supply drops, the 1st Airborne would need to defend a perimeter of some [...] whilst waiting for XXX Corps.|$|E
500|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to foil Sephiroth's theft of the Black Materia, Aerith ventures alone into the Forgotten City. Cloud and his companions give chase, {{eventually}} finding her praying at an altar. As Aerith looks up to smile at Cloud, Sephiroth appears and kills her by impaling her through the torso. Cloud carries Aerith's body out into a lake in the Forgotten City, and releases {{her back to the}} Planet. Reeve Tuesti, the head of Shinra Urban and Development, brings the news of her death to Elmyra Gainsborough, Aerith's adoptive mother. The party later learns the reason for Aerith being in the Forgotten City; through her White Materia, Aerith was able to summon Holy, the only force capable of repelling the ultimate destructive magic, Meteor, which has been summoned by Sephiroth. Although Aerith successfully cast Holy before her death, it is held back by the power of Sephiroth's will. When Sephiroth is finally defeated and Holy is released, it appears that it is too late to function as effectively as it should, as Meteor has already come <b>too</b> <b>near</b> to the Planet's surface. While Holy clashes with Meteor, attempting to prevent its impact, the gravity of both Meteor and the Planet pulling on Holy in opposite directions weakens it. Aerith is seen praying with both hands interlocked whilst urging the lifestream to ultimately defend the planet. [...] The Planet's Lifestream then flows forth, intervening between Holy and Meteor, and acting as a battering ram while aiding in the destruction of Meteor.|$|E
