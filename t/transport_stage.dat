30|$|Allen (1982) {{pointed out}} that in air and water, {{transport}} processes differ due to the difference in viscosity and density of the medium. In the case of aeolian dunes, saltation {{is the most important}} mode (Bagnold 1941), whereas bedload transport is most important for subaqueous ripples (Allen 1968). Sand ripples can be generated by a shear stress that is just above the threshold for bedload transport (Bridge and Demicco 2008). In subaqueous environments, sliding and rolling are most prevalent at low <b>transport</b> <b>stages</b> (Allen 1982; Reid and Frostick 1994; Bridge and Demicco 2008), and therefore, instead of considering changes in saltation length, the subaqueous bedform at low <b>transport</b> <b>stages</b> should be explained by a model that considers grain movements that are in continuous contact with the bed. Although previous CA models for aeolian dunes have attributed the bedform generation to changes in the saltation length, in the present study, which employs a stochastic model, we consider changes of the migration speed of sand particles that are in continuous contact with the bed (i.e., sand that moves no faster than one cell per time step). Although {{there have been a few}} preliminary attempts to employ the CA model and explicitly include the continuous bed-contact load (e.g., Miyata and Iwasa 1997), the relation between sand flux and sand abundance was not considered.|$|R

30|$|First, we set {{the amount}} of {{increased}} demand in related industrial sectors using the total annual sales and related values for wood chips, as in the above four equations. We divided annual sales amount of each stage into three industrial sectors, forestry sector, pulp, paper, and wooden products sector, and transport sector, by two types of resource and delivery distance of each stage. Specifically, total sales in all stages of wood chip for fuel, which mainly uses logging residues as a resource, are classified into forestry sector. And total sales in all stages of wood chip for board, which mainly uses sawmill waste, are categorized into pulp, paper, and wooden products sector. For wood chip for paper, total sales in collecting stages using logging residues is classed as forestry sector, and total sales in <b>transport</b> <b>stage</b> using both resources is labeled as transport sector, while total sales in collecting stages using sawmill waste and in chipping stage using both resources are sorted into pulp, paper, and wooden products sector.|$|E
40|$|Sequences of {{openwork}} {{gravel and}} framework-supported cobble to boulder beds are noted at three locations, over a 20 km {{stretch of the}} Tweed Esker, Southern Ontario. Each sequence {{is characterized by a}} lower, massive, framework-supported cobble bed, succeeded by a graded bed of openwork cobbles to granules. This sequence is remarkably consistent in internal structure from site to site. There is a similar frequency of these beds and their stratigraphic position is consistently {{at the top of the}} esker sequence. A significant, down-esker fining of the coarsest component of the beds is also noted. These beds were probably deposited by flood events occurring after the primary phase of esker deposition. The massive basal unit is identified as a flood deposit. The normally graded openwork cobbles to granules moved as bedload during the late stage of their transport, following transport in suspension. Winnowing occurred at the bedload <b>transport</b> <b>stage.</b> These deposits indicate the presence of an extensive fluvio-glacial drainage focused on the Tweed Esker and provides indirect support for theories of regional ice stagnation, in the Late Wisconsinan, in this area of Ontario...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{solidification}} {{processes of}} large industrial castings and ingots, {{the transport of}} solid in the liquid has an important effect on the final grain structure and macrosegregation. Modeling is still challenging as complex interactions between heat and mass transfers at microscopic and macroscopic scales are highly coupled. This paper first presents a multi-scale numerical solidification model coupling nucleation, grain growth and solute diffusion at microscopic scales with heat and mass transfer, including transport of liquid and solid phases at macroscopic scales. The resolution consists of a splitting method, which considers the evolution and interaction of quantities during the process with a <b>transport</b> <b>stage</b> and a growth stage. This splitting reduces the nonlinear complexity of the set of considered equations and provides an efficient numerical implementation. It is inspired {{by the work of}} Založnik et al.

40|$|The FLASHForward {{facility}} will offer unique capabilities or plasma-wakefield acceleration experiments. It uses high-quality beams from the FLASH accelerator to excite plasma wakefields for the exploration and improvement of novel and existing injection mechanisms. The unique {{nature of the}} plasma environment creates several challenges {{with regard to the}} conservation of the beam quality, partially due to the strong focusing fields present in the blowout region following a driver beam in the highly nonlinear regime. The beta function of a beam needs to be matched into the wakefield in order to avoid severe growth of the beam emittance - a crucial quality parameter for beam <b>transport,</b> <b>staging</b> and applications. Since the matched beta function is usually at least an order of magnitude lower than easily accessible for conventional accelerator optics, multiple schemes have been proposed to mitigate severe emittance growth by tailoring the plasma profile to adiabatically reduce the beta function to match the plasma wakefield. We will focus on an introduction of these techniques, before presenting initial results from numerical and theoretical analyses for the typical FLASH beam parameter space...|$|R
