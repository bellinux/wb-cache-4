40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to gain an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> experience <b>of</b> everyday anxiety among adolescents during high school. An interpretative phenomenological approach as articulated by Merleau-Ponty (1962) and Van Manen (1998) was utilized for this study. A purposive sample of 8 adolescent males and females were interviewed. Data analysis was undertaken throughout the research study by utilizing a thematic analysis of text in which themes emerged to document and understand <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> experience <b>of</b> everyday anxiety among adolescents during high school. The study revealed themes reflective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> body in time, space and in relations with others. The three themes were 1. The embodied experience of anxiety with the subthemes of the body responds and the constant running mind of worry and fear; 2. Feeling uncomfortable in <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> space <b>of</b> school with <b>the</b> subthemes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> relations <b>of</b> bullying, <b>the</b> internal/external space of isolation, the constant pressure to perform well, and life will get better and; 3. Life at home with <b>the</b> subthemes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> space <b>of</b> home and <b>the</b> <b>lived</b> relations <b>of</b> pressure from parents. Conclusions from the study revealed areas of improvement for the healthcare and school systems, implications for nursing education, practice and future research...|$|R

5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> women in the ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> women in the classical world.|$|E
