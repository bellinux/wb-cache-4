5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E

25|$|Autotopagnosia {{typically}} occurs after left parietal lesions. Patients {{with this}} disorder make errors which result from confusion between adjacent body parts.

25|$|Indeed, in 1692 in Jürgensburg, Livonia, an {{area near}} the Baltic Sea, an old man named Theiss was tried for being a werewolf; his defense was that his spirit (and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>others)</b> {{transformed}} into werewolves in order to fight demons and prevent them from stealing grain from the village. Ginzburg has shown that his arguments, and his denial of belonging to a Satanic cult, corresponded to those used by the benandanti. On 10 October 1692, Theiss was sentenced to ten whip strikes on charges of superstition and idolatry.|$|E

25|$|Pauline Quirke {{was cast}} as secretive caravan {{resident}} Susan Wright. Chibnall {{had long been}} deeply impressed with her performance on the 1996 television series The Sculptress, and he wrote the role of Susan Wright with Quirke in mind, although the role was not written specifically for her. Although Quirke was a well-known veteran television actress, she auditioned along with many others for the role. Her audition, like <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> used scenes from the first two episodes. Chibnall says that the producers worried that such a big star might not wish {{to do justice to}} such small role, but found that Quirke delivered a superb performance.|$|E
25|$|Males may {{quite easily}} {{underestimate}} {{the size of}} their own penis relative to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> because of the foreshortening obtained from looking down, due to repeated observation of atypical penises in pornography, or because of the accumulation of fat {{at the base of the}} penis. A survey by sexologists showed that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises. Another study found sex education of standard penile measurements to be helpful and relieving for patients concerned about small penis size, most of whom had incorrect beliefs of what is considered medically normal. The perception of having a large penis is linked to higher self-esteem.|$|E
