25|$|Poirot {{receives}} {{a visit from}} Emery Power, a rich art collector of Irish birth. Ten years ago he purchased at auction a gold goblet which was supposedly made for Pope Alexander VI by Benvenuto Cellini, which the Borgia Pope used to poison his victims. The design of the goblet is a coiled serpent, surrounding a tree bearing apples represented by emeralds. Poirot is immediately interested {{at the mention of}} apples. Power paid a sum equal to thirty thousand pounds to buy it at auction in 1929, but {{on the night of the}} sale the goblet and other items were stolen from the home of the seller, the Marchese di San Veratrino. The police at the time were certain that a gang of three international thieves were responsible. Two of the men were captured and some of the stolen items recovered but the goblet was not among them. A third man, an Irish cat burglar called Patrick Casey, died soon afterwards when he fell from a building attempting another crime. Power has spent ten years and a lot of money trying to locate the goblet but without success. The Marchese has offered to refund his money but Power does not want to take advantage of this offer as he would no longer be the legal owner of the goblet should it be found. He had suspected that the real criminal was Sir Reuben Rosenthal, who was his rival bidder at the auction in 1929, but <b>they</b> <b>recently</b> become business allies and Power is now convinced Rosenthal is innocent.|$|E

500|$|In August 2007, an {{investigation}} by The Wall Street Journal revealed potential campaign finance irregularities involving Hsu, {{in his role as}} a [...] "bundler", and his long-time associates, the Paw family of Daly City, California. Specifically, members of the Paw family made donations of over $200,000 to Democratic candidates since 2005. These donations closely coordinated with those of Hsu in terms of timing, amounts and donees. In addition, the donations appeared to be much larger than would be expected given the Paw's modest income. According to records obtained for the investigation, the Paws own a gift shop and live in a [...] house that <b>they</b> <b>recently</b> refinanced for $270,000. William Paw, the 64-year-old head of the household, is a mail carrier with the U.S. Postal Service and earns approximately $49,000 a year. Other records linked Hsu to the Paws, including a campaign finance filing in which Hsu lists the Paw's home as his residence.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, the Holland Society of New York renewed {{its efforts}} to install a {{monument}} in a prominent location in New York City's Central Park. The proposal was initially accepted by city Parks Commissioner Francis Dawson Gallatin (1870-1933), but opposed by the city's Art Commission. [...] The Art Commission's assistant secretary H. R. Marshall recommended that the statue be donated to Rutgers College as <b>they</b> <b>recently</b> installed a new college president, John Martin Thomas, adding {{that it would be}} a [...] "nice new and very visible gift, tying the university to its Dutch legacy at the height of the fashion for colonial revivals". While Turck was having dinner with his close friend, railroad executive Leonor Fresnel Loree (1858–1940) discussed the Dutch roots of Rutgers University, his alma mater, and convinced Turck to donate the statue to the university. At the time, Loree was serving on the college's board of trustees. [...] Rutgers, chartered in 1766 as Queen's College was the eighth of nine colleges established before the American Revolution and had been founded by Dutch Reformed clergymen from New York and New Jersey. After its founding, the college was affiliated with the church through the early nineteenth century, and graduated many students of Dutch ancestry. Turck desired to donate the statue anonymously, and with Loree's assistance, arranged for the Holland Society to transfer the statue to Rutgers. Bergen, now a Rutgers trustee in addition to continuing his efforts as chairman of the Holland Society's statue committee, said that it was [...] "particularly fitting that the statue should stand on the grounds of the educational institution founded by descendants of the Netherlands." [...] The statue was delivered and installed at Rutgers at the western end of the Voorhees Mall. It was dedicated during a ceremony held on June 9, 1928.|$|E

Langan also designed the tower's foundation, which {{has to be able to}} support the tower despite the less than optimal subsurface conditions, such as soft rock and permeable coral, which could cause the piles to settle. Thornton Tomasetti has provided the structural engineering for two of the previous world's tallest building title holders, the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, and the Taipei 101 in Taiwan, as well as the under construction Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, which will be the second tallest building in China after completion. Saudi Binladin Group is the largest construction firm in the Middle East, with over 35,000 workers and hundreds of projects. <b>They</b> <b>recently</b> constructed the topped-out [...] Abraj Al-Bait Clock Tower in Mecca, which is the tallest building in Saudi Arabia and third tallest in the world, as well as the largest skyscraper in the world by floor area and volume. Aside from buildings, the firm has also constructed many major infrastructure projects, such as the King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport expansion and the [...] six lane Al Qassim Expressway through Saudi Arabia. Saudi Binladin Group is owned by the family of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As a result, it has sparked some minor media buzz. When asked his thoughts about this in an interview, Adrian Smith simply stated that they are the largest construction firm in the Middle East, most significant work in Saudi Arabia was done by them, and that it is a very large family that shouldn't be stereotyped by one of its members. Furthermore, in January 2012, New York City judge George B. Daniels ruled that no charges could be filed against SBG to repay the victims of 9/11 as there is no evidence of the construction firm financially supporting bin Laden after he was removed as a shareholder following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.|$|E
