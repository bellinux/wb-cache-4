5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E

The whole-cell patch, which enables low-resistance electrical access {{to the inside of}} a cell, has now largely replaced high-resistance microelectrode recording techniques to record currents across the entire cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacteria}} that penetrated the cells and remained alive are now released, {{and they are}} plated on solid medium plates. Counting the colonies formed on the plates on the next day, and knowing how many bacteria {{were used in the}} beginning of the assay, enables <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> calculate the percentage of {{bacteria that}} were able to invade the eukaryotic cells.|$|E
25|$|In psychology, {{qualitative}} research {{has come to}} be defined as research whose findings are not arrived at by statistical or other quantitative procedures. Qualitative research is often said to be naturalistic. That is, its goal is to understand behaviour in a natural setting. Two other goals attributed to {{qualitative research}} are understanding a phenomenon {{from the perspective of the}} research participant and understanding the meanings people give to their experience. It attempts to do this by using so-called naturalistic methods—interviewing, observation, ethnography, participant observation and focus groups. Each of these methods seeks to understand the perspective of the research participant within the context of their everyday life. This means that the researcher is concerned with asking broad questions that allow the respondent to answer in their own words. These methods allow <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> try to qualify their understanding during the research process through further probing questions. In addition, a method such as observation allows <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> observe people within natural settings—particularly those in public places. This has resulted in greater understanding of people's behaviours in, for example, lifts, public transport, and queues.|$|E

25|$|Aggregating impacts adds up {{the total}} impact {{of climate change}} across sectors and/or regions (IPCC, 2007a, p.76). In {{producing}} aggregate impacts, {{there are a number}} of difficulties, such as predicting the ability of societies to adapt climate change, and estimating how future economic and social development will progress (Smith et al., 2001, p.941). It is also necessary for <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> make subjective value judgements over the importance of impacts occurring in different economic sectors, in different regions, and at different times.|$|E
25|$|There {{is further}} {{complication}} in that restoration ecologists {{who want to}} collect large scale data on restoration projects can face enormous hurdles in obtaining the data. Managers vary in how much data they collect, and how many records they keep. Some agencies keep {{only a handful of}} physical copies of data that make it difficult for <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> access. Many restoration projects are limited by time and money, so data collection and record keeping are not always feasible. However, this limits the ability of scientists to analyze restoration projects and give recommendations based on empirical data.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, {{there was}} no {{publicly}} maintained list of nonsecurities class action settlements, although a securities class action database exists in the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse and several for-profit companies maintain lists of the securities settlements. One study of federal settlements required <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> manually search databases of lawsuits for the relevant records, although state class actions were not included due to the difficulty in gathering the information. Another source of data is U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics Civil Justice Survey of State Courts, which in 2009 was published with an overview of 2005 statistics.|$|E

25|$|Intramuscular {{electrical}} stimulation (IMES) of muscle tissue {{has been used}} in various experimental and clinical settings. The advantage to using an IMES system over a standard such as hypertonic saline is that IMES can be turned on and off. This allows <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> exert a much higher degree of control and precision in terms of the stimulus and the measurement of the response. The method is easier to carry out than the injection method as it does not require special training in how it should be used. The frequency of the electrical pulse can also be controlled. For most studies a frequency of about 10Hz is needed to stimulate both local and referred pain.|$|E
25|$|During 1977 and 1978, Hobart {{underwent}} a half-life modernisation, {{during which the}} propulsion system was converted from furnace oil to diesel fuel, and a Naval Combat Data System was installed. In July 1979, Hobart and the Antarctic Support Vessel Thala Dan were sent to Macquarie Island to retrieve a badly injured researcher and return him to Australia. In order to transfer <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> the ship, Hobarts personnel constructed a makeshift helipad, which was used by Thala Dans helicopter to deliver the injured man to the destroyer. Hobart remained in Australian waters during the early 1980s, {{with the exception of}} deployments to Hawaii for RIMPAC, to the North West Indian Ocean for 6 months in 1981 and participation in Kangaroo exercises. The destroyer underwent refit in 1984. In 1985, Hobart sailed to Canada to represent Australia at a naval review recognising the 75th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy's founding. During 1986, the ship was deployed to South-east Asia, which was repeated in 1987. During early 1988, the destroyer participated in activities celebrating Australia's Bicentenary, then later in the year sailed to join the RIMPAC exercise. In 1989, the destroyer's Ikara launchers were removed during a refit.|$|E
500|$|Researchers have {{investigated}} whether {{the reliability of}} the reward affects one's ability to delay gratification. Reliability of the reward refers to how well the reward received matches what the person was expecting or promised in terms of quality and quantity. For example, researchers told children that they would receive better art supplies if they waited. After the children successfully waited for the reward, better supplies could not be [...] "found" [...] and so they had to use the crayons and stickers that were in poor shape. Comparing these children to ones who received their promised rewards reliably revealed different results on subsequent Marshmallow tests measuring delayed gratification. Children who had learned that the researcher's promise was unreliable quickly succumbed to eating the marshmallow, waiting only an average of 3 minutes. Conversely, children who had learned that the researcher was reliable were able to wait an average of 12 minutes, with many of them waiting the full 15 minutes for <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> return in order to double the reward to two marshmallows.|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem of}} reverse {{causality}} between health and income means that any {{estimates of the}} impact of income on life expectancy could mistakenly reflect the influence of life expectancy (more generically, health) on income instead. As such, studies which do not account for this potential two-way causation may overestimate the importance of income for life expectancy. In economic research, this kind of problem has traditionally been dealt with through the use of instrumental variables which allow <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> separate out one effect from another. This strategy requires identification of an [...] "instrument"– i.e. a variable which correlates with per capita income but not with the error term in the linear regression. However, since any variable which is likely to correlate with income is also likely to correlate strongly with health and life expectancy this is a difficult task. Some research suggests that in low and middle-income countries, the causality does indeed go from income to health, while the opposite is true for rich countries.|$|E

50|$|The use of seatbelts in trains {{has been}} investigated. Concerns about {{survival}} space intrusion in train crashes and increased injuries to unrestrained or incorrectly restrained passengers led <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> discourage <b>the</b> use of seat belts in trains.|$|R
2500|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} {{is a powerful}} tool for analyzing [...] aspects of quantifiable systems. Not every factor, however, can be reduced to a number and inserted into a model. Rigid system boundaries make accounting for changes in the system difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the boundary critique to systems thinking. The accuracy and availability of data can also contribute to inaccuracy. For instance, data from generic processes may be based on averages, unrepresentative sampling, or outdated results. Additionally, social implications of products are generally lacking in LCAs. Comparative life-cycle analysis is often used to determine a better process or product to use. However, because of aspects like differing system boundaries, different statistical information, different product uses, etc., these studies can easily be swayed in favor of one product or process over another in one study and the opposite in another study based on varying parameters and different available data. There are guidelines to help reduce such conflicts in results but the method still provides {{a lot of room for}} <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> decide what is important, how the product is typically manufactured, and how it is typically used.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of focus group discussion is to get light into the respondents’ phenomenological world of experience, thinking, perceiving and feeling. These experiences, feelings, attitudes might be independent of a group or its cultural and social settings but {{are more likely to}} reveal itself in the interaction with other people in a group or another social setting. Focus group discussions help in elaborating the different viewpoints and emotional processes of each member within a group context. The individual interview is simpler for <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> control in comparison to a focus group discussion. A focus group discussion, in comparison to other methods helps the research to gain larger pool information in a much lesser amount of time. This observation depends on waiting for things to happen, whereas the researcher has to follow an interview guide in a focus group. In this aspect, focus group discussions are not natural but organized and planned. These discussions are especially helpful when there are differences related to power between its members, decision-makers or professionals, [...] when the culture and language of a specific group is of, and when the researcher or a member wants to understand and explore the level of consensus over a given theme or topic(Kreuger, 1993).|$|E
2500|$|Focus group {{discussion}} in qualitative method has gain huge popularity {{of this method}} across the social sciences over the past decade. Focus groups are now thoroughly assessable and familiar to the general public. Prior 1920’s and late 1970’s the focus groups were mainly used in marketing, tool, and studies {{in the field in}} the business. Aspects like including education, communication, media studies, feminist research, sociology and social psychology. Focused groups are also known as ‘group interviews’. The members are encouraged to interact and have discussions. The data collected by focused {{group discussion}} are seldom produced through interview and observation; it enlightens us with its power of knowledge. Focus group discussion also focuses on the process beyond the individual’s memory and desires. The richness and complexity of group dynamics should be considered. Focus group can also access to social interactional dynamics that produce particular memories, ideologies, and practices among the group members. It themselves becomes relevant, termed as units of analysis of our study. Questions, issues and topics process focus group. Through different dynamics multiple angles of vision {{can be seen in the}} new world in unexpected ways. Focus group helps us move towards constructing a ‘methodology of getting lost” and toward enacting “double practices” (lather, 2001). This seems a necessary step towards conducting qualitative research. Keeping norms and rules of groups in mind the researcher and research participants realize that interpretation of individual are situated, provisional, contingent, unstable thus it’s unchangeable. It is necessary for <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> have self-reflectivity that involves making the research transparent rhetorical and poetic work of the researcher in representing the object of the study. It is theoretically important to construct a mutual ground between the researcher and the research participants. The second sense of self-reflexivity is important to encourage refection on interpretive research as the dual practice of knowledge gathering and self transformation is done through self-reflection and mutual reflection. Allowing ourselves to dwell in the existing inevitable indeterminacies, we are leading ourselves in the best way of the qualitative research practice.|$|E
