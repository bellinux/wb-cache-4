5|$|Paula Kamen, {{author of}} Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution, placed the {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} Magic Wand as an influential factor in the sexual revolution which took place {{towards the end of}} the 20th century. Cathy Winks and Anne Semans, coauthors of The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex, recommended the Magic Wand for use both during foreplay and intercourse and noted couples could feel pleasure through the device together at the same time. Wendy Caster wrote in the 2003 edition of <b>The</b> <b>Lesbian</b> Sex Book that lesbians have enjoyed using the Magic Wand due to its ability to concentrate powerful vibration on the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} story, Nagisa is {{introduced}} {{to other students}} {{from each of the}} three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of Strawberry Panic! are <b>the</b> <b>lesbian</b> relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of astronomical star imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.|$|E

5|$|Political {{activism}} in American gay communities was {{transformed by the}} arrival of AIDS in the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring attention to a disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet silence from the government, some used direct action tactics. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed by Larry Kramer and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored the seriousness of AIDS in the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest the high price of AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of direct action groups Queer Nation, Pink Panthers and <b>the</b> <b>Lesbian</b> Avengers, that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection.|$|E

40|$|The central {{research}} {{question of the}} current study had to do with self - an stereotypically- gendered identities of <b>lesbians.</b> <b>The</b> purpose was to determine the nature and form of gender identity and gender stereotypes among women who self-identify as lesbians, and more specifically, {{to determine whether or not}} “gender” means <b>the</b> same to <b>lesbians</b> as it does to heterosexual women. Identity measures were Bern’s (1974) Sex-role Inventory (BSRI) and a butch-femme rating scale. The sample consisted of 65 women who self-identified as <b>lesbian.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lesbians</b> in <b>the</b> current sample did identify more strongly with masculine attributes (Masculinity scale mean = 5. 27) than with feminine attributes (Femininity scale means= 5. 07). Interestingly, the current sample’s mean Masculinity scores were higher than those of women (heterosexual orientation unknown, and lesbians) in prior research. The majority of butches and femmes identified as masculine and feminine, respectively. As indicated from prior research subjects, and even more strongly among <b>the</b> <b>lesbians</b> in this study, traits such as “cheerful,” “shy,” “flatterable,” “childlike,” “does not use harsh language,” and “lives children” may no longer be self-descriptions of lesbians or heterosexual women. <b>The</b> <b>lesbians</b> in this study described themselves as assertive and independent and also as nurturant and sensitive. It may be that the terms like “agency” and “emphatic” will in the future be more useful than the dichotomized masculine and feminine labels...|$|R
