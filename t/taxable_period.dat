40|$|This diploma thesis {{was aimed}} at {{analyzing}} the influence of tax incentives for {{the research and development}} on the tax duty of the taxpayers. Within the first section a term research and development was defined followed by the specification of possible forms of the tax incentives for the research and development. The calculation of the tax duty of the illustrative company which effected research and development activity (within two scenarios) was presented within the practial section. The illustrative company was constantly profitable in the first scenario and as such, it incurred higher savings from the application of the research and development tax deduction in comparison to the second scenario (where company incurred a tax loss in one <b>taxable</b> <b>period).</b> Based on the results, taxpayers who apply the research and development tax deduction may consider a tax optimisation in case they could possibly incur a tax loss...|$|E
40|$|Bachelors thesis {{deals with}} {{questions}} about maintenance expenses and reconstruction expenses concerning buildings. Its aim is to analyze the difference in income tax if business subjects account for a certain expense either as a maintenance expense or as a reconstruction expense. Analysis {{is based on the}} simplified assumption that for example analysed period is one <b>taxable</b> <b>period.</b> It was found out the diference in the tax duty could be very significant. The reason is particulary the long period of depreciation of buildings including reconstruction expenses and also the construction of depreciation calculation. When considering the influence it is particulary important the tax base amount of business subject and the selected way of depreciation. To account for problematic costs as reconstruction expenses could be advantageous for physical persons (entrepreneurs) that register costs as a percentage of income if the building is depreciated evenly and could be with the problematic expenses increase the building tax value...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} main {{principals}} of tax administration and tax law, their compliance or violating in particular situations. Presenting of their content and real meaning {{is provided by}} description and explanation of their (wrong) application under various circumstances. The Supreme Administrative Court´s case laws and jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court are significant sources of information in this part. Along with accompanying effects arising from violating the principles this thesis continues with analysis of Working pensioners affair, especially the case n. Pl. ÚS 31 / 13. Here the provision of § 35 ba art. 1 l. a) Income Tax Act has been contested according to which the tax of a taxpayer, who is a recipient of an old-age pension benefits from statutory pension insurance scheme or similar abroad one at 1 st January of the <b>taxable</b> <b>period,</b> shall not be reduced by the basic amount of 24 840 CZK. There are not omitted demographical, legal and economic aspects of the affair in this thesis as well as relevant regulatory development for the years 2000 to 2015. The thesis brings evaluation of compliance or violating {{of the principles of}} tax administration and tax law through the analysis of key elements in own review...|$|E
50|$|A double {{tax treaty}} was signed between Mexico and Belgium on November 24, 1992. It was {{published}} in the Diario Oficial de la Federación of January 6, 1997 in Mexico. The treaty entered into force on January 1, 1997. For withholding tax purposes, the treaty became effective on January 1, 1998. Concerning other taxes on income, the treaty will be effective for <b>taxable</b> <b>periods</b> ending on or after December 31, 1998.|$|R
5000|$|On September 1, 1994, {{the offices}} of Moncrief Oil were raided by the IRS, who seized {{more than one million}} documents. Moncrief was accused of owing the United States {{government}} between $100 million and $300 million. Following a two-year investigation, Moncrief pleaded [...] "no contest" [...] to one count of criminal tax fraud; this charge alleged that he had [...] "improperly deducted" [...] $900,000 in business expenses from his company Montex Drilling on his 1990 personal federal tax return. This agreement, although signed and sent to the United States Department of Justice, was never officially filed. On January 4, 1996, Moncrief and Montex settled with the IRS by agreeing to pay $23 million [...] "for deficiencies in income, excise and gift taxes for <b>taxable</b> <b>periods</b> from Jan. 1, 1989, through Aug. 31, 1994." [...] In 1998, Moncrief gave testimony before the Senate Finance Committee regarding the IRS raid on his offices: ...|$|R
40|$|Within a {{progressive}} income-tax system, Registered Retirement Saving Plans (RRSPs) generate a substitution effect that decreases saving. The key point made {{here is that}} when an RRSP is introduced to a system that taxes capital income, the {{rate of return on}} marginal saving within the RRSP is driven to equality with the rate of return on non-RRSP saving. Since RRSP contributions redistribute <b>taxable</b> income across <b>periods,</b> they also have the effect of increasing future marginal income-tax rates, which lowers the after-tax return to saving. This result stands in contrast to the conventional view from the public finance literature. ...|$|R
5000|$|Taxable income {{refers to}} the base upon which an income tax system imposes tax. [...] Generally, it {{includes}} some or all items of income and is reduced by expenses and other deductions. [...] The amounts included as income, expenses, and other deductions vary by country or system. Many systems provide that some types of income are not taxable and some expenditures not deductible in computing tax. [...] Some systems base tax on taxable income of the current period, and some on prior <b>periods.</b> <b>Taxable</b> income may refer to the income of any taxpayer, including individuals and corporations, as well as entities that themselves do not pay tax, such as partnerships.|$|R
50|$|The {{tax benefit}} {{is that on}} {{exercise}} the individual {{does not have to}} pay ordinary income tax (nor employment taxes) on the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares issued (however, the holder may have to pay U.S. alternative minimum tax instead). Instead, if the shares are held for 1 year from the date of exercise and 2 years from the date of grant, then the profit (if any) made on sale of the shares is taxed as long-term capital gain. Long-term capital gain is taxed in the U.S. at lower rates than ordinary income. Although ISOs have more favorable tax treatment than non-ISOs (a.k.a. non-statutory stock option (NSO) or non-qualified stock option (NQO or NQSO)), they also require the holder to take on more risk by having to hold onto the stock {{for a longer period of}} time if the holder is to receive optimal tax treatment. However, even if the holder disposes of the stock within a year, it is possible that there will still be marginal tax deferral value (as compared to NQOs) if the holding period, though less than a year, straddles the ending of the taxpayer's <b>taxable</b> reporting <b>period.</b>|$|R
40|$|The 1986 Tax Act in the U. S. {{gradually}} reduced {{corporate tax}} rates from 46 percent {{prior to the}} Act to 34 percent {{by the middle of}} 1988. This reduction gave firms an incentive, in 1986 and 1987, to shift taxable income to future years when tax rates would be lower. There are substantial impediments, however, to shifting <b>taxable</b> income across <b>periods</b> (notably, offsetting tax consequences to other contracting parties and a host of nontax costs), and it becomes an empirical question as to whether the benefits of shifting taxable income are sufficient to overcome the impediments. This paper examines whether firms deferred income recognition and/or accelerated expense recognition in anticipation of these declining tax rates. We find statistically significant evidence that firms shifted gross margin from the quarter immediately preceding and anticipated decrease in tax rates to the next quarter. We estimate that, on average, the 812 firms in our sample saved approximately five hundred thousand dollars in taxes by deferring sales. At a gross margin rate of one-third, this amounts to nearly twenty billion dollars of shifted sales for our sample firms. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{transaction}} {{may affect}} the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s federal tax liability for both the current period and subsequent periods. No difficulty arises if the taxpayer treats the transaction consistently over the periods. However, significant tax distortions are possible if the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s characterization of the transaction varies from period to period. A recharacterization may be particularly troublesome if {{the statute of limitations}} has expired, and the first period is not open to correction at the time the inconsistent representation is made. The duty of consistency was developed to address this problem. If the duty applies, the taxpayer is not permitted to shift his position in the subsequent period regardless of whether, as a matter of substantive tax law, the position taken in the prior period was correct. A hallmark of the duty is flexibility. It has been applied to prevent taxpayers from taking inconsistent positions in order to exclude from all tax periods income that clearly is <b>taxable</b> in some <b>period,</b> deduct the same expense in two or more periods, improperly inflate the basis of an asset, convert one type of income into a different, tax-favored type and profit from other sorts of tax abuses. There have been, however, differences among the courts in their perception of the duty of consistency. As Justice Frankfurter rightly observed, consistency decisions “disclose many views in various degrees of conflict. ” This article attempts to clarify this aspect of the procedural tax law. Section II sketches the emergence of the taxpayer duty of consistency, and describes current formulations. The remaining three sections address the major controversies surrounding the duty. Section III asks whether there should be an enforceable taxpayer duty of consistency, and resolves that question in the affirmative. In so doing, it proposes that the justification for the duty of consistency should be grounded in practical policy values fundamental to our tax system rather than the essentially moralistic basis of prior decisions. Section IV describes the proposed elements of the duty of consistency. Section V charts the relationships between the duty of consistency and other anticonsistency doctrines. The final section offers guidelines for determining when the duty of consistency should yield to other devices used to counter inconsistency and when the duty of consistency should preempt the other devices...|$|R
