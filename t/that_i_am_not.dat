But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E
25|$|I {{thank you}} heartily for the pamphlet, {{and for the}} {{authorities}} you give me for the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since: I know not how long, they have been my creed: I believe, before even my happiness in your acquaintance and friendship, tho' they have certainly been strengthen'd and confirm'd by your conversation and instruction—in support of these principles I trust I shall ever act, and I shall continue to attempt their general propagation;—whether by the best means, is matter of speculation: but by the best, according to my judgement—nothing can make me a disciple of Paine or Priestley, nor any thing induce me to proclaim, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> so, but in the mode I myself think the best to resist their mischief—private conversation and private insinuation may best suit the extent of my abilities, the turn of my temper, {{and the nature of}} my character...|$|E

25|$|One {{summer night}} in 1916, near Ploegsteert, Eden had {{to lead a}} small raid into an enemy trench to kill or capture enemy soldiers, so as to {{identify}} the enemy units opposite. He and his men were pinned down in No Man’s Land under enemy fire, his sergeant seriously wounded in the leg. Eden sent one man back to British lines to fetch another man and a stretcher, then he and three others carried the wounded sergeant back with, as he later {{put it in his}} memoirs, a “chilly feeling down our spines”, unsure whether the Germans had not seen them in the dark or were chivalrously declining to fire. He omitted to mention that he had been awarded the Military Cross for the incident, something of which he had made little mention in his political career. On 18 September 1916, after the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme), he wrote to his mother “I have seen things lately <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> likely to forget”. On 3 October, he was appointed an adjutant, with the rank of temporary lieutenant for the duration of that appointment. At the age of 19, he was the youngest adjutant on the Western Front.|$|E
500|$|A Confederate officer {{approached}} Capehart's 3rd Brigade {{on horseback}} under a flag of truce. Capehart and the officer rode down the column to General Custer, where the officer told the general that Lee and Grant were in correspondence concerning a surrender of Lee's Army. The Confederate officer also requested a truce until {{the results of}} the negotiation were known. Custer's response was [...] "Tell General Longstreet <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> in command of all the forces here, but that I am on his flank and rear with a large cavalry force, and that I will accept nothing but unconditional surrender." ...|$|E
500|$|In a February 2008 letter, Castro {{announced}} that he would not accept the positions of President of the Council of State and Commander in Chief at that month's National Assembly meetings, remarking, [...] "It would betray my conscience to take up a responsibility that requires mobility and total devotion, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> in a physical condition to offer". On February 24, 2008, the National Assembly of People's Power unanimously voted Raúl as president. Describing his brother as [...] "not substitutable", Raúl proposed that Fidel continue to be consulted on matters of great importance, a motion unanimously approved by the 597 National Assembly members.|$|E

500|$|In 1956, Keating {{joined a}} priest leading {{a group of}} {{concerned}} Catholics in Cincinnati who {{were concerned about the}} dangers of pornography, and he began giving talks on the subject to parents and other groups. In 1958, Keating testified before the House Judiciary Committee on mail-order pornography, saying that it was [...] "capable of poisoning any mind at any age and of perverting our entire younger generation", and that it was closely tied to juvenile delinquency, while also quoting a Senate Committee report that [...] "part of the Communist conspiracy was to print (obscene materials)". [...] Keating mentioned links between pornography and Communism at other times, but distanced himself from the more fervent anti-Communist groups of the early 1960s. He stated that 90 percent of obscene materials were produced for profit, not ideological reasons, and told Congress in 1960, [...] "I had better say [...] <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> blaming obscenity in America on the Communists." ...|$|E
500|$|While on tour Madonna {{participated in}} the Raising Malawi {{initiative}} by partially funding an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying {{that there were no}} written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she first met him. Banda's biological father, Yohane, commented, [...] "These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> aware of what I am doing ... They want me to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband." [...] The adoption was finalized in May 2008.|$|E
500|$|Filming of Nefarious {{was started}} in 2007, marking Nolot's film debut. The initial plan {{was to create a}} short film, but the project was {{expanded}} when Exodus Cry realized the scope of the issue they were documenting. Nolot, a leader in Mike Bickle's International House of Prayer, travelled to 19 countries to collect material for the film. These filming locations included countries in the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Asia. Nolot attested to having found it difficult to produce the film due to the subject matter; he stated that [...] "there is not a day that goes by <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> mindful of the horrific tragedies we uncovered." [...] He further said that he did not make the film for money or for fame but did so in order to rouse people to action against human trafficking, an issue that he feels to be of great importance. Nolot said {{that the purpose of the}} film is [...] "to draw people's attention to the issue, but also to inspire them in terms of what they can be doing … to take a stand against this injustice." [...] Steve Willis and Matthew Dickey were the film's cinematographers. Willis, founder of Underpin Photography, also served as photographer while Dickey filled the roles of associate producer and editor, also directing the re-enactment scenes. Actors in these re-enactment scenes included Bill Oberst Jr., Christian Simpson (as Christian J. Simpson), Allison Weissman, Sarah Agor, and Jess Allen. John Samuel Hanson composed the film score for Nefarious after having worked on such other projects as 16 Blocks, Constantine, The Book of Eli, and Lost. As of January 2012, Nolot was producing two sequels to Nefarious.|$|E

500|$|As the Japanese {{advanced}} in the South West Pacific during early 1942, the RAAF hurriedly established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, Nos.75, 76 and 77 Squadrons. Arthur was posted to No. 76 Squadron in April, flying P-40 Kittyhawks in New Guinea. His brother Norman {{was killed in}} action on 9 November 1942 while serving with the 2/31st Infantry Battalion in Papua. Promoted to squadron leader, in February 1943 Wilf succeeded Les Jackson as commanding officer of No.75 Squadron, based at Milne Bay {{under the control of}} No.9 Operational Group RAAF. [...] Arthur developed a reputation for diligence, courtesy, and concern for the welfare of his men. Despite the fact that, at 23, he was the youngest officer in his new squadron, he commanded the respect of his fellows because, he believed, [...] "they like that I work hard; they like <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> frightened of anything (i.e. Pretends not to be) and above those, they like that I don't boast". Having shot down a Mitsubishi G4M [...] "Betty" [...] bomber on 10March, Arthur was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his [...] "gallantry, matchless leadership and devotion to duty" [...] on 14April 1943. On this occasion, in spite of his guns jamming, he led 34 Allied aircraft, including Kittyhawks of Nos.75 and 77Squadrons and P-38 Lightnings of the USAAF, in [...] "a determined head-on attack" [...] to intercept 100 Japanese raiders, 14 of which were destroyed by the defenders. Arthur described the situation of being in combat but unable to shoot as [...] "sort of awkward. Fortunately nobody else would know except me." [...] To compensate for his lack of offensive weaponry, he repeatedly made as though attempting to ram one of the raiders, to try and force it down into the sea.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E

2500|$|In 1927, British philosopher Bertrand Russell {{stated in}} his lecture Why I Am Not a Christian that [...] "historically {{it is quite}} {{doubtful}} that Jesus existed, {{and if he did}} we do not know anything about him, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> concerned with the historical question, which is a very difficult one", though Russell did nothing to further develop the idea.|$|E

On 30 June 2003, he wrote to his line manager at the Ministry of Defence to report his contact with Gilligan though he added [...] "I am convinced <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> his primary source of information." ...|$|E
