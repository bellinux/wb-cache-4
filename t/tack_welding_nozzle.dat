40|$|A {{single-layer}} pulsed gas metal {{arc weld}} of structural steel S 355 J 2 +N with a thickness of 5 mm is experimentally and numerically investigated. Two <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> are considered in the numerical simulation into two different ways. First, the <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> are represented by elements belonging to the initial material. This implies that the "tack weld material" was not exposed to any thermal load or phase transformation before actual welding was performed. The weld seam is shortened {{and there is an}} influence on the stiffness of the whole structure affecting the calculation result. Secondly, the <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> were simulated as conducted in the experimental welding procedure. The cases considering <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> are compared to a simulation neglecting <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> and to the experimental results. The influence of <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> on the calculated welding-induced distortion is clarified and a contribution to an improved simulation-based prediction of welding-induced distortion is possible by modeling <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> according to the realistic fabrication procedure...|$|R

40|$|A small friction-stir-welding tool {{has been}} {{developed}} for use in <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> of aluminum-alloy workpieces. It is necessary to tack-weld the workpieces in order to hold them together during friction stir welding because (1) in operation, a full-size friction-stir-welding tool exerts a large force that tends to separate the workpieces and (2) clamping the workpieces {{is not sufficient to}} resist this force. It is possible to tack the pieces together by gas tungsten arc welding, but the process can be awkward and time-consuming and can cause sufficient damage to necessitate rework. Friction stir <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> does not entail these disadvantages. In addition, friction stir <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> can be accomplished by use of the same automated equipment (except for the welding tool) used in subsequent full friction stir welding. The tool for friction stir <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> resembles the tool for full friction stir welding, but has a narrower shoulder and a shorter pin. The shorter pin generates a smaller workpiece-separating force so that clamping suffices to keep the workpieces together. This tool produces a continuous or intermittent partial-penetration <b>tack</b> <b>weld.</b> The <b>tack</b> <b>weld</b> is subsequently consumed by action of the larger tool used in full friction stir welding tool...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a <b>welding</b> <b>nozzle</b> position manipulator. The manipulator consists of an angle support to which the remaining components of the device are attached either directly or indirectly. A pair of pivotal connections attach a <b>weld</b> <b>nozzle</b> holding link to the angle support and provide a two axis freedom of movement of the holding link {{with respect to the}} support angle. The manipulator is actuated by a pair of adjusting screws angularly mounted to the angle support.

A spring positioned between the upper portions of the support angle and the holding link provides a constant bias engagement between the friction surfaces of the holding link and the adjustment screws, so as to firmly hold the link in position and to eliminate any free play in the adjustment mechanism.

40|$|Abstract. Laser welding {{is known}} for its low heat input {{compared}} to arc welding methods. This could enable laser welding of sheet metals with lighter fastening solutions and less time-consuming <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> alternatives. A feasibility study was carried out to study four different corner joint types for 2 mm thick cold-rolled steel sheet by using filler-free laser welding. The aim of the research was to get more experimental knowledge about the laser welding of corner joints. Also possible benefits concerning faster manufacturing times and smaller costs by developing fastening applications for small batch laser welding was to be studied in practice. The 170 mm long joints were welded without air gap or pressing. All corner joint types proved to be weldable with a continuous wave Yb:YAG diode-pumped disk laser. It was also found during the experiment that laser welding enables the use of light and inexpensive fasteners such as magnetic holders instead of traditional clamps and fixturing. With some joint types, the insufficient fastening power of magnetic fasteners against distortions was compensated by making a spot-like laser <b>tack</b> <b>weld</b> {{at the end of the}} weld before welding the actual seam. This showed that it is possible to make precise and small <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> with a laser and to use laser-tacking in sheet metal assembly...|$|R

40|$|The local, {{nonuniform}} {{heating and}} subsequent cooling during the welding processes causes complex thermal stress/strain fields to develop that finally leads to residual stresses, distortions, and their adverse consequences. Residual stresses are of prime {{concern to the}} industries producing weld-integrated structures around the globe because of their obvious potential to cause dimensional instability in welded structures, contribute to premature fracture/failure, along with the significant reduction in fatigue strength and in-service performance of the welded structures. Arc welding with single or multiple weld runs is an appropriate and cost effective joining method to produce high-strength structures in these industries. A multifield interaction in arc welding process makes it a complex manufacturing process. A number of geometric and process parameters are contributing to significant stress levels in arc-welded structures. In the present analysis, parametric studies are conducted {{for the effects of}} a critical geometric parameter, that is, <b>tack</b> <b>weld</b> on the corresponding residual stress fields in circumferentially <b>welded</b> thin-walled cylinders. <b>Tack</b> <b>welds</b> offer a considerable resistance to the shrinkage and the orientation, and size of tacks can alter altogether the stress patterns within the weldments.

The assembly tolerances are very tight with a maximum alignment offset of 0. 7 mm. The company wants to investigate the possibility ofa complete or partial automation of this process. A test cell developed for studying the possibility of automating the {{assembly and}} <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> operations of TEC components is presented. The test cell assembles TEC components using a control algorithm that combines high accuracy sensor measurements with an iterative stepwise alignment process performed bya robot. This test cell has been physically implemented and used for verifying the developed methodology. The equipment used in the test cell is specified in the thesis. The test cell consists of two industrial robots, fixtures and a high accuracy laser sensor. The laser sensor is mounted on the tool flange of one robot; the other robot is fitted with a specially designed gripper for performing the adjustment operation. A modular fixture system has also been developed focusing on flexibility and simplicity. A developed control algorithm that coordinates the different operations performed by {{the elements of the}} test cell is presented. This control algorithm is implemented using the Python programming language; the implementation is described in detail. The test cell assembly operation is based on the alignment of certain points on the components such that the offset is within tolerances. The iterative stepwise alignment process is described, including an operation for orienting the sensor for minimizing the offset measurement error. Once the points are aligned, the test cell simulates the <b>tack</b> <b>welding</b> operation. Multiple tests have been performed in order to verify the test cell’s capability of aligning the components within tolerances.

It was shown that an increased shielding gas exit velocity increased the gas column’s stability and therefore its resistance to side draughts. Double helix geometry within the nozzle reduced the gas column’s stability by generating a fast moving wall of gas around a slow moving centre. A pierced internal plate initially increased the gas velocity, however, the nozzle was unable to maintain the velocity and the change produced gas columns of similar stability to a standard nozzle. A pierced end plate produced the best results, increasing the shielding gases exit velocity sufficiently to marginally outperform the standard 16 mm <b>welding</b> <b>nozzle...</b>|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding is an {{innovative}} weld process {{that continues to}} grow in use, in the commercial, defense, and space sectors. It produces high quality and high strength welds in aluminum alloys. The process consists of a rotating weld pin tool that plasticizes material through friction. The plasticized material is welded by applying a high weld forge force through the weld pin tool against the material during pin tool rotation. The high weld forge force is reacted against an anvil and a stout tool structure. A variation of friction stir welding currently being evaluated is self-reacting friction stir welding. Self-reacting friction stir welding incorporates two opposing shoulders on the crown and root sides of the weld joint. In self-reacting friction stir welding, the weld forge force is reacted against the crown shoulder portion of the weld pin tool by the root shoulder. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stout tooling structure to react the high weld forge force required in the typical friction stir weld process. Therefore, the self-reacting feature reduces tooling requirements and, therefore, process implementation costs. This makes the process attractive for aluminum alloy circumferential weld applications. To evaluate the application of self-reacting friction stir welding for aluminum alloy circumferential welding, a feasibility study was performed. The study consisted of performing a fourteen-foot diameter aluminum alloy circumferential demonstration weld using typical fusion weld tooling. To accomplish the demonstration <b>weld,</b> <b>weld</b> and <b>tack</b> <b>weld</b> development were performed and fourteen-foot diameter rings were fabricated.

40|$|During final {{preparations}} for {{start of the}} PDCF Inner Can (IC) qualification effort, welding was performed on an automated weld system known as the PICN. During the initial weld, using a pedigree canister and plug, a weld defect was observed. The defect resulted in {{a hole in the}} sidewall of the canister, and it was observed that the plug sidewall had not been consumed. This was a new type of failure not seen during development and production of legacy Bagless Transfer Cans (FB-Line/Hanford). Therefore, a team was assembled to determine the root cause and to determine if the process could be improved. After several brain storming sessions (MS and T, R and D Engineering, PDC Project), an evaluation matrix was established to direct this effort. The matrix identified numerous activities that could be taken and then prioritized those activities. This effort was limited by both time and resources (the number of canisters and plugs available for testing was limited). A discovery process was initiated to evaluate the Vendor's IC fabrication process relative to legacy processes. There were no significant findings, however, some information regarding forging/anneal processes could not be obtained. Evaluations were conducted to compare mechanical properties of the PDC canisters relative to the legacy canisters. Some differences were identified, but mechanical properties were determined to be consistent with legacy materials. A number of process changes were also evaluated. A heat treatment procedure was established that could reduce the magnetic characteristics to levels similar to the legacy materials. An in-situ arc annealing process was developed that resulted in improved weld characteristics for test articles. Also several <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> configurations were addressed, it was found that increasing the number of <b>tack</b> <b>welds</b> (and changing the sequence) resulted in decreased can to plug gaps and a more stable weld for test articles. Incorporating all of the process improvements for the actual can welding process, however, did not result in an improved weld geometry. Several possibilities for the lack of positive response exist, some of which are that (1) an insufficient number of test articles were welded under prototypic conditions, (2) the process was not optimized so that significant improvements were observable over the 'noise', and (3) the in-situ arc anneal closed the gap down too much so the can was unable to exhaust pressure ahead of the weld. Several operational and mechanical improvements were identified. The weld clamps were changed to a design consistent with those used in the legacy operations. A helium puff operation was eliminated; it is believed that this operation was the cause of the original weld defect. Also, timing of plug mast movement was found to correspond with weld irregularities. The timing of the movement was changed to occur during weld head travel between tacks. In the end a three sequential <b>tack</b> <b>weld</b> process followed by a pulse weld at the same current and travel speed as was used for the legacy processes was suggested for use during the IC qualification effort. Relative to legacy welds, the PDC IC weld demonstrates greater fluctuation in the region of the <b>weld</b> located between <b>tack</b> <b>welds.</b> However, canister weld response (canister to canister) is consistent and with the aid of the optical mapping system (for targeting the cut position) is considered adequate. DR measurements and METs show the PDC IC welds to have sufficient ligament length to ensure adequate canister pressure/impact capacity and to ensure adequate stub function. The PDC welding process has not been optimized {{as a result of this}} effort. Differences remain between the legacy BTC welds and the PDC IC weld, but these differences are not sufficient to prevent resumption of the current PDC IC qualification effort. During the PDC IC qualification effort, a total of 17 cans will be welded and a variety of tests/inspections will be performed. The extensive data collected during that qualification effort should be of a sufficient population to determine if additional weld process optimization is necessary prior to production release...|$|R
