Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand.

Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilian {{teeth are}} adapted for seizing and holding prey, and food is {{swallowed}} unchewed. The digestive tract is relatively short, as meat {{is a fairly}} simple substance to digest. The stomach {{is divided into two}} parts: a muscular gizzard that grinds food, and a digestive chamber where enzymes work on it. The stomach is more acidic than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths, which {{play a role in the}} mechanical breakdown of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures. Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently, low energy requirements. This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal, digesting the food slowly. They can withstand extended fasting, living on stored fat between meals. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their bodyweight during this time. An adult crocodile needs between a tenth and a fifth of the amount of food necessary for a lion of the same weight, and can live for half a year without eating.|$|E

Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.|$|E

5|$|In 1868, Janssen and Lockyer {{independently}} {{observed a}} yellow {{line in the}} solar spectrum that did not match <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> element.

André-Marie Ampère predicted an element analogous to chlorine obtainable from hydrofluoric acid, and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain it. Fluorine was eventually isolated by Moissan, in 1886. In 1894, Lord Rayleigh and Ramsay discovered argon by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by liquefaction from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means. It was the first noble gas to be isolated. In 1898, within {{a period of three}} weeks, Ramsay and Travers successively separated krypton, neon and xenon from liquid argon by their differences in boiling points.

50|$|Compounds of boron, silicon, arsenic and {{antimony}} {{have been}} used as flame retardants. Boron, in the form of borax, {{has been used as a}} textile flame retardant since at least the 18th century. Silicon compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials.Arsenic compounds such as sodium arsenite or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood but have been less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide has been used as a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s.

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours.

However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities {{and the time of}} dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper.

HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations {{that are similar to}} the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air.

Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as dark as asphalt and {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth.

40|$|Proper {{identification}} of Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia thailandensis {{is crucial in}} guiding clinical management of patients with suspected melioidosis, as more than 99 % of cases of melioidosis are caused by B. pseudomallei, whereas B. thailandensis is only responsible for causing less than 1 % of the cases. However, {{the difference between the}} 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of B. pseudomallei and <b>that</b> <b>of</b> B. thailandensis is only 1 %, and is therefore not discriminative enough for distinguishing the 2 species confidently. In this study, we amplified and sequenced the groEL genes of 7 strains of B. thailandensis and 6 strains of B. pseudomallei, and compared the sequences with 7 other groEL gene sequences of Burkholderia species. BLAST analysis revealed that the putative protein encoded by the groEL gene of B. thailandensis has 99. 6 %, 99. 5 %, 98. 4 %, 98. 5 %, and 96. 5 % amino acid identity with the groEL of B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, B. cepacia, B. vietnamiensis, and B. fungorum respectively. The amino acid sequences of GroEL of the strains of B. thailandensis and B. pseudomallei all showed > 99. 5 % amino acid identity with each other. The nucleotide sequence of the groEL gene <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the strains of B. thailandensis showed > 99. 8 % nucleotide identity with <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the <b>other</b> strains of B. thailandensis, and the nucleotide sequence of the groEL gene <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the strains of B. pseudomallei showed > 99. 5 % nucleotide identity with <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the <b>other</b> strains of B. pseudomallei. However, the nucleotide sequence <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the strains of B. thailandensis showed 96 % amino acid identity with each other. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of the groEL genes of the 2 strains of B. cepacia showed > 99. 5 % nucleotide identity with each other, and the nucleotide sequence of the groEL gene of B. mallei showed > 99. 5 % nucleotide identity with <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the strains of B. pseudomallei. The groEL gene sequence is therefore good for distinguishing between B. thailandensis and B. pseudomallei, and the GroEL amino acid and groEL nucleotide sequences of this single gene locus may potentially be useful for a 2 -tier hierarchical {{identification of}} medically important Burkholderia at the genus and species levels respectively. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.
