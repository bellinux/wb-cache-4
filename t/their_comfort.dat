5|$|MercyMe {{wanted to}} get out of <b>their</b> <b>comfort</b> zone with the overall sound of the album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala. Millard has said that he initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't think much about the overall length of the songs. MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by looking to the work of The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E

25|$|On November 30, 2005, Gordon made {{a verbal}} {{commitment}} {{to play basketball}} for Bruce Weber at the University of Illinois, selecting the Illini over overtures from Duke and Notre Dame. Gordon and his family cited <b>their</b> <b>comfort</b> with Bruce Weber, the relative distance to the Illinois campus from the Gordon's Indianapolis home, {{and the success of}} former Illini guards Deron Williams and Luther Head in the NBA as reasons for their decision.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for professional footballers (soccer) and road cyclists to remove leg hair {{for a number of}} reasons. In the case of a crash or tackle, the absence of the leg hair means the injuries (usually road rash or scarring) can be cleaned up more efficiently, and treatment is not impeded. Professional cyclists as well as professional footballers also receive regular leg massages, and the absence of hair reduces the friction and increases <b>their</b> <b>comfort</b> and effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Batzaria was a {{judge for}} a {{national}} Miss Romania beauty contest, organized by Realitatea Ilustrată magazine and journalist Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș (the other members of this panel being female activist Alexandrina Cantacuzino, actress Maria Giurgea, politician Alexandru Mavrodi, novelist Liviu Rebreanu and visual artists Jean Alexandru Steriadi and Friedrich Storck). As an Adevărul journalist, Batzaria nevertheless warned against politically militant feminism and women's suffrage, urging women to find <b>their</b> <b>comfort</b> in marriage. Speaking in 1930, he suggested {{that the idea of}} a feminist party in gender-biased Romania was absurd, arguing that women could either support their husbands' political activities or, at most, affiliate with the existing parties.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses {{are often}} {{categorized}} by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because {{they do not}} have to stand up to the wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving <b>their</b> <b>comfort.</b> Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.|$|E

25|$|Climatic determinism, {{otherwise}} {{referred to}} as the equatorial paradox, is an aspect of economic geography. According to this theory, about 70% of a country's economic development can be predicted by the distance between that country and the equator, and that the further from the equator a country is located, the more developed it tends to be. The theory is the central argument of Philip M. Parker's Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth, in which he argues that since humans originated as tropical mammals, those who relocated to colder climates attempt to restore their physiological homeostasis through wealth-creation. This act includes producing more food, better housing, heating, warm clothes, etc. Conversely, humans that remained in warmer climates are more physiologically comfortable simply due to temperature, and so have less incentive to work to increase <b>their</b> <b>comfort</b> levels. Therefore, according to Parker GDP is a direct product of the natural compensation of humans to their climate.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} dive {{planning}} {{is to ensure}} that divers do not exceed <b>their</b> <b>comfort</b> zone or skill level, or the safe capacity of their equipment, and includes scuba gas planning to ensure that the amount of breathing gas to be carried is sufficient to allow for any reasonably foreseeable contingencies. Before starting a dive both the diver and their buddy do equipment checks to ensure everything is in good working order and available. Recreational divers are responsible for planning their own dives, unless in training, when the instructor is responsible. Divemasters may provide useful information and suggestions to assist the divers, but are generally not responsible for the details unless specifically employed to do so. In professional diving teams all team members are usually expected to contribute to planning and to check the equipment they will use, but the overall responsibility {{for the safety of the}} team lies with the supervisor.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor is}} the level of privacy to which a person can be assured - for example, some parts of a home may be seen from the outside or there may be a {{possibility}} of others walking in. The expectation of privacy may be confined to the home and sometimes the backyard. Inside the home, it may be restricted to the bedroom or just the bathroom. If a person is not alone, <b>their</b> <b>comfort</b> in removing clothing in front of another person will generally depend on the nature of a relationship of those who jointly occupy the same private space, as well as the attitudes of others to nudity. Besides the nature of a relationship, attitudes and incidences of nudity will also depend on the level of inhibition that each person has, as well as the level of privacy to which that they can be assured. Sometimes a person may unintentionally intrude on a person who is in the nude, which may lead to embarrassment of {{one or both of the}} people. The nude person may seek to quickly cover their private parts, while the clothed person may turn away, but this also depends on cultural differences and the relationship of the people.|$|E

500|$|WTF?! {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews, with critics split {{over whether the}} album broke new ground compared to previous releases.

500|$|Mars {{explained}} the meaning behind the album's title {{by saying that}} {{it had become a}} [...] "soulful, experimental, electronic, hard-to-explain" [...] concept.

There was no fan-blown cold air (cold air was by ram-effect) nor an option for cool air to be directed to the face {{at the same time as}} warmth being directed into the footwells. According to Car [...] the ventilation [...] "fell down badly" [...] on account of its awkward controls. Oddment accommodation was [...] "disappointment".

5000|$|Insofar as humanitas {{corresponded to}} philanthrôpía and paideia, it was {{particularly}} applicable to guiding the proper {{exercise of power}} over others.

Matt Fowler, who reviewed the episode for IGN, gave it a score of 8/10, and maintained that it was still a solid effort that focused on shifting all the main characters out of <b>their</b> <b>comfort</b> zones. Tod VanDerWerff, from The A.V.
