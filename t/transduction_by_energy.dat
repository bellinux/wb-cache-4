The efficiency and persistence of AAV 2 -mediated gene expression in the human lung have yet to be determined, but it seems likely that readministration will be necessary over the lifetime of an individual. Unfortunately, we have found that <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> a second administration of an AAV 2 vector is blocked, presumably due to neutralizing antibodies generated in response to the primary vector exposure. Here, we have explored the use of AAV 2 vectors pseudotyped with capsid proteins from AAV serotypes 2, 3, and 6 for readministration in the mouse lung. We found that an AAV 6 vector transduced airway epithelial and alveolar cells in the lung at rates that were at least as high as those of AAV 2 pseudotype vectors, while <b>transduction</b> rates mediated <b>by</b> AAV 3 were much lower. AAV 6 pseudotype vector <b>transduction</b> was unaffected <b>by</b> prior administration of an AAV 2 or AAV 3 vector, and <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> an AAV 2 pseudotype vector was unaffected by prior AAV 6 vector administration, showing that cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against AAV 2 and AAV 6 are not generated in mice. Interestingly, while prior administration of an AAV 2 vector completely blocked <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> a second AAV 2 pseudotype vector, prior administration of an AAV 6 vector only partially inhibited <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> a second administration of an AAV 6 pseudotype vector. Analysis of sera obtained from mice and humans showed that AAV 6 is less immunogenic than AAV 2, which helps explain this finding.

40|$|Habitability can be {{formulated}} as {{a balance}} between the biological demand for energy and the corresponding potential for meeting that demand <b>by</b> <b>transduction</b> of <b>energy</b> from the en-vironment into biological process. The biological demand for energy is manifest in two re-quirements, analogous to the voltage and power requirements of an electrical device, which must both be met if life is to be supported. These requirements exhibit discrete (non-zero) minima whose magnitude is set by the biochemistry in question, and they are increased in quantifiable fashion by (i) deviations from biochemically optimal physical and chemical con-ditions and (ii) energy-expending solutions to problems of resource limitation. The possible rate of <b>energy</b> <b>transduction</b> is constrained <b>by</b> (i) the availability of usable free energy sources in the environment, (ii) limitations on transport of those sources into the cell, (iii) upper lim-its on the rate at which energy can be stored, transported, and subsequently liberated by bio-chemical mechanisms (e. g., enzyme saturation effects), and (iv) upper limits imposed by an inability to use “power ” and “voltage ” at levels that cause material breakdown. A system is habitable when the realized rate of energy transduction equals or exceeds the biological de-mand for energy. For systems in which water availability is considered a key aspect of hab-itability (e. g., Mars), the energy balance construct imposes additional, quantitative constraints that may help to prioritize targets in search-for-life missions. Because the biological need for energy is universal, the energy balance construct also helps to constrain habitability in sys-tems (e. g., those envisioned to use solvents other than water) for which little constraint cur...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{crossovers}} {{leading to}} the transduction of Escherichia coli W 3350 or one of its derivatives for the Gal+ marker by T 1 grown on donors lysogenic for λ must occur {{to the right of}} the galactose operon. The location of this crossover determined both the rate of transduction and the λ genes which control the <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> (λ-gal) T 1. When the crossover occurred either to the left of gene N or the right of the cI gene, it was affected in a positive fashion by the gene product of the N+ gene. When the crossover occurred either to the left of gene N or between N and gene Q, its efficiency was not significantly affected by the expression of Q+. However, crossovers to the right of gene Q were greatly stimulated by the presence of a functioning Q gene on the chromosome of (λ-gal) T 1 hybrid. The repressor made by the cI+ gene of λ blocked efficient transduction. Therefore, the control of efficient <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> (λ-gal) T 1 is the same as the control of transcription of λ.

40|$|The {{receptor}} for the {{myeloid cell}} growth factor colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF- 1) is a protein tyrosine kinase that {{is closely related}} to the PDGF receptor. Ligand binding results in kinase activation and autophosphorylation. Three autophosphorylation sites, Tyr 697, Tyr 706 and Tyr 721, have been mapped to the kinase insert domain. Deletion of the entire kinase insert domain completely abrogates signal <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> the CSF- 1 receptor expressed in Rat- 2 fibroblasts. To investigate the function of individual phosphorylation sites present in the CSF- 1 receptor kinase insert domain, a number of phosphorylation site mutants were expressed in Rat- 2 fibroblasts. Mutation of either Tyr 697 or Tyr 721 compromised signal <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> the CSF- 1 receptor. A mutant receptor, in which both Tyr 697 and Tyr 721 were replaced by phenylalanine, has lost all ability to induce changes in morphology or to increase cell growth rate in response to CSF- 1. Tyr 721 has been identified recently as the binding site for PI 3 -kinase. Here we report that GRB 2 associates with the CSF- 1 receptor upon ligand binding. The phosphorylation on tyrosine of SHC and several other GRB 2 -associated proteins increased upon stimulation with CSF- 1. Tyr 697 was identified as a binding site for GRB 2.

40|$|The {{cleavage}} {{model for}} signal <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> receptors of the LIN- 12 /Notch family posits that ligand binding leads to cleavage within the transmembrane domain, {{so that the}} intracellular domain is released to translocate to the nucleus and activate target gene expression. The familial Alzheimer's disease-associated protein Presenilin is required for LIN- 12 /Notch signaling, and several lines of evidence suggest that Presenilin mediates the transmembrane cleavage event that releases the LIN- 12 /Notch intracellular domain. However, doubt was cast on this possibility by a report that Presenilin is not required for the transducing activity of NECN, a constitutively active transmembrane form of Notch, in Drosophila. Here, we have reassessed this finding and show instead that Presenilin is required for activity of NECN for all cell fate decisions examined.

40|$|Evolution {{has created}} a class of {{proteins}} that {{have the ability to}} convert chemical energy into mechanical force. Some of these use the free energy of nucleotide hydrolysis as fuel, while others employ ion gradients. Some are “walking motors, ” others rotating engines. Some are reversible, others are unidirectional. Could there be any common principles amongst such diversity? The conversion of chemical energy into mechanical work {{is one of the main}} themes of modern biology. Biochemists characterize <b>energy</b> <b>transduction</b> schemes <b>by</b> free <b>energy</b> diagrams. But thermodynamics tells us only what cannot happen. Recent advances in laser trap and optical technology, along with advances in molecular structure determination can augment traditional biochemical kinetic and thermodynamic analyses to make possible a more mechanistic view of how protein motors function. The result of these advances has been data that yield load-velocity curves and motion statistics for single molecular motors. This sort of data enables a more detailed, mechanistic level of modeling. At Þrst, the mechanics of proteins may seem counterintuitive because their motions are dominated by Brownian motion, the name given to the frequent changes in velocity of a macromolecule as it is buffeted about by random thermal motions of surrounding water molecules. In addition to “smearing out ” deterministic trajectories, Brownian motion serves an effective “lubricant, ” allowing molecules to pass over high energy barriers that would arrest a deterministic system. More subtly, it makes possible “uphill” motions against an opposing force by “capturing ” occasional large thermal ßuctuations. In this chapter we will discuss protein motions on the molecular scale and derive a mathematical formalism to model such motions. To illustrate the formalism, in the next chapter, we will analyze (i) a “switch ” controlling the direction of the bacterial ßagellar motor, (ii) a polymerization ratchet, and (iii) a “toy ” model related to the F o This is page 32...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Retroviral {{transduction}} {{of cells}} is improved upon virus adsorption onto immobilized fibronectin (FN) fragments. Because HIV- 1 Tat possesses the same functional domains {{that lead to}} increased transduction efficiency in FN by colocalization of bound virus and cells, we hypothesized that Tat could enhance gene transfer by a similar mechanism. METHODS: Single-cycle replication retro- or lentivirus carrying green fluorescent protein or cloramphenicol acetyltransferase as reporter genes were added to wells coated with Tat or Tat peptides. Wells were extensively washed to remove unbound virus and levels of <b>transduction</b> were detected <b>by</b> measuring reporter gene expression. Virus adsorption to immobilized Tat was measured using a p 24 antigen capture assay. RESULTS: Immobilized Tat efficiently binds retro- and lentiviral particles and mediates virus transmission at virus input doses that were otherwise unable to transduce susceptible cells. Virus adsorption to Tat is not mediated by envelope glycoprotein (Env) because immobilized Tat binds and retains vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) pseudotypes as well as envelope-free particles. HIV- 1 Env or VSV-G are required for Tat-assisted transduction, which is abrogated by an antibody blocking the HIV- 1 Env-CD 4 interaction. Tat-assisted <b>transduction</b> is mediated <b>by</b> the cysteine-rich region of Tat, which {{is known to be}} essential for Tat transactivation activity. However, Tat transactivation is not required for Tat-assisted <b>transduction,</b> as indicated <b>by</b> the enhancement of <b>transduction</b> <b>by</b> transactivation-silent Tat mutants.

We further show {{that differences in}} natural IgM between BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice contribute to lower efficiency of Ad 5 gene transfer in BALB/c mice. When adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) vectors are injected intrave-nously (i. v.), their biodistribution is heavily influenced by blood proteins that bind to (opsonize) the vector (1).

We show here that dengue virus uses the cellular glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage pathway to express a GPI-anchored form of NS 1 and that GPI anchoring imparts a capacity for signal transduction in response to binding of NS 1 -specific antibody. This study is the first to identify GPI linkage of a virus-encoded protein. The GPI anchor addition signal for NS 1 was identified, by transfection of HeLa cells with dengue cDNA constructs, as a downstream hydrophobic domain in NS 2 A.
