[...] "I Have to Look Up Just to See Hell" [...] was described by The Quietus as a [...] "maggot-infested ride into the trough of melancholy." [...] The penultimate track, [...] "Into the Fire", portrays the vocalists' mental state on Christmas Day—wherein he unsuccessfully attempted to contact Wood 158 times, and cut himself on the hands or face with a razorblade for each corresponding attempt. It was the original album closer, with Manson describing it as a [...] "glorious epic <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> make Twiggy forever recognized as a guitar hero." [...] The album's final song, [...] "15", was completed on Manson's January 5 birthday. He called it [...] "the most important song that's been written by Marilyn Manson as an entity. It's the most unusual song I have ever heard. I thought that the album was done, [...] but {{what was happening in}} my life had not resolved itself. So on January 5, one five, I sang '15', and the lyrics tell the story of that day." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal {{holding the}} {{distribution}} rights to Hulk films {{may be an}} obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film, and reiterated this in October 2015, and July 2017. Marvel reacquired the film rights for the character, but Universal retained the distribution rights for The Incredible Hulk {{as well as the}} right of first refusal to distribute future Hulk films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount Pictures for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company Disney wants for its own theme parks. In December, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film. The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in , [...] and its untitled sequel, stating, [...] "we’ve worked a really interesting arc into Thor, Avengers and [...] for Banner <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> – when it’s all added up – will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie." ...|$|E

During the franchise's 25th anniversary, Konami revealed a demo for a new title in the Metal Gear series, [...] A social game for the GREE titled [...] was released on December 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Though Maud {{had very}} little {{knowledge}} about being on her own, she was not timid. When she entered the parlor of her dormitory on her first day there, she recognized a tune from the piano. Telling the girls around her that [...] "I dearly love dancing", Maud pretended to dance. A sophomore girl, Jessie Mary Boulton, who observed her {{wrote in a letter}} back home: [...] "There is one <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> make quite a stir. Her name is Gage and she is lively." [...] Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz remarked that [...] "ively may have seemed like a compliment of sorts but it was a code word for trouble". A girl characterized as [...] "lively" [...] would have a difficult time in college and was likely to produce gossip.|$|E
