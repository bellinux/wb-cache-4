5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of {{free markets and}} believed {{that they could be}} detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens to make <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisational}} {{ability of}} the government agencies charged with overseeing {{the integration of the}} refugees into society was frequently criticised by American officials. In many cases, the individual officials simply made <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> and the goal of resettling the northerners without disruption to the existing local economy or social structure was not achieved. In other cases, the northern Catholics formed their own committees and settled and built on areas as they saw fit. By the end of September, the shortage of funds and equipment had eased, but their distribution was not organised or coordinated effectively. At the same time, some Viet Minh cadres who stayed in the south after the partition pretended to be refugees and stirred up trouble inside the camps. Aside from disruption by communists, other non-communist movements such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng were strong in areas of central Vietnam, were opponents of Diem and some of them were military personnel. This sometimes caused hindrance in civilian-military cooperation in the resettlement program, as some of Diem's public servants were suspicious of the military's reliability as a working partner.|$|E

40|$|To {{what extent}} do {{business}} angels really understand <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decision</b> process? This paper {{is the first in}} business angel research literature to use conjoint analysis to capture decision makers’ actual decision policies and to compare these results with their stated decision policies. Although more than twenty papers discussing the decision criteria of business angels have been published, most of these studies rely on post hoc methodologies (e. g. interviews and surveys) to capture the decision process. Post hoc methods assume that business angels can accurately introspect about <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decision</b> processes, but studies from cognitive psychology suggest that decision makers are poor at introspecting. In addition, experiments in the venture capital industry have shown that venture capitalists are poor at introspecting and do not fully understand their decision processes. Taking cues from cognitive psychology, this paper starts with the hypothesis that, like venture capitalists, business angels do not fully understand <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decision</b> processes. To test this hypothesis, an experiment including twenty-four Belgian business angels and using conjoint analysis is performed. The findings suggest that business angels are not good at introspecting about <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decision</b> processes. Even within the confines of a controlled experiment, which greatly reduces the amount of information considered, business angels lacked strong understanding of how they made decisions. business angels; decision making; entrepreneurial finance; investment evaluation; conjoint analysis...|$|R

25|$|Autonomy {{can come}} into {{conflict}} with beneficence when patients disagree with recommendations that healthcare professionals believe are in the patient's best interest. When the patient's interests conflict with the patient's welfare, different societies settle the conflict {{in a wide range}} of manners. In general, Western medicine defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient to make <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions,</b> even in cases where the medical team believes that they are not acting in their own best interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy.|$|E

25|$|Regarding the ruling, Diane Duke, CEO of the Free Speech Coalition, stated,While this {{intermediate}} decision allows that condoms may be mandated, it doesn’t {{mean they}} should be. We {{have spent the}} last two years fighting for the rights of adult performers to make <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> about their bodies, and against the stigma against adult film performers embodied in the statute. Rather than protect adult performers, a condom mandate pushes a legal industry underground where workers are less safe. This is terrible policy that has been defeated in other legislative venues.|$|E

25|$|In April 2014, the United States Senate {{debated the}} Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress).

The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House.

25|$|Governance and {{decision}} making is conducted at a special meeting for worship—often called a meeting for worship with a concern for business or meeting for worship for church affairs at which all members can attend, as in a Congregational church. Quakers consider {{this to be a}} form of worship, conducted in the manner of meeting for worship. They believe this is the gathering of believers who wait upon the Lord to discover God's will, believing that they are not making <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions.</b> They seek to understand God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.|$|E
25|$|During the 2007–08 Shmita, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel {{attempted}} to avoid taking a potentially divisive {{position on the}} dispute between Haredi and Modern Orthodox views about the correctness of the heter mechirah leniency by ruling that local rabbis could make <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> {{about whether or not}} to accept this device as valid. The Israel Supreme Court, however, ordered the Chief Rabbinate to rescind its ruling and to devise a single national ruling. The Israel Supreme Court opined that divergent local rulings would be harmful to farmers and trade and could implicate competition. The issue of secular courts ordering the rabbinate to rule in particular ways on religious matters aroused a debate within the Knesset. Israeli wineries often address this issue by making separate batches of Shmita wine, labeled as such, and giving away bottles of Shmita wine as a free bonus to purchasers of non-Shmita wine.|$|E

25|$|Escaping {{into hiding}} with Sae's help, the protagonist convenes with his friends, Sae, and Sojiro; they {{determine}} that the conspiracy's leader is Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, the protagonist later recognizes Shido as the same man he encountered before his probation. The group infiltrates Shido's Palace, and there they face Akechi, revealed to be Shido's illegitimate son bent on revenge towards Shido for his years of neglect. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to allow the Phantom Thieves to reach Shido. Shido is defeated, and {{in the real world}} confesses to all his actions. The game then skips forward to just before Christmas; the general public has turned on the Phantom Thieves, and Sae's efforts to prosecute Shido are failing. The Phantom Thieves make a final heist to steal the Treasure of the Mementos, the people's Palace at the Metaverse's core. Inside they find the imprisoned Shadows of their targets and other Tokyo residents, who have chosen to give up making <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions.</b> The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure—a giant Holy Grail—and subsequently vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merging with reality.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} was mixed. Some critics {{praised the}} [...] "rich language" [...] {{used in the}} novel. [...] However, others disapproved of the open sexuality of the novel, and its explicit use of the words [...] "penis", [...] "vagina", [...] "orgasm" [...] and [...] "condoms" [...] was considered [...] "too much"; other controversial terms include [...] "rape me", [...] "I am still a virgin", and [...] "masturbation". [...] Utami's own mother refused to read the novel aloud to her nearly blind husband, stating that it is [...] "not meant for those of their generation".

500|$|Following his {{election}} as BNP leader, Griffin {{was invited to}} participate in debates at several universities. In November 2002, the Cambridge Union Society invited him {{to take part in a}} debate the following January. Titled [...] "This house believes that Islam is a threat to the west", the resolution was controversial; alongside more moderate speakers, one of those invited was Abu Hamza al-Masri, a fundamentalist Muslim cleric. Some participants threatened to withdraw, and several official bodies criticised the invitations. The two had met earlier in the year, in a debate chaired by Rod Liddle, then editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He was also invited by the Cambridge Forum to a debate on extremism in December 2002, with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik. The venue was changed twice after protests from property owners, but the threat of a violent confrontation between the Anti-Nazi League and BNP supporters forced the president of the Cambridge Forum, Chris Paley, to cancel the event. Paley called the decision an [...] "own goal" [...] for the values of free speech, and Öpik criticised it, emphasising his belief in [...] "people's right to make <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>decisions</b> in a democracy".|$|E
