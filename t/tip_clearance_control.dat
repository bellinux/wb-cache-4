40|$|Increases in {{compressor}} {{efficiency and}} pressure ratio {{can be achieved}} by controlling the blade tip-to-shroud clearance. The design and test results of a fail-safe active <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>control</b> system for a centrifugal compressor are presented. An electromagnetic actuator is used to pull the compressor impeller axially to reduce the tip clearance. The actuator acts against a preloaded Belleville spring. The controlled variable is an averaged, tip-to-shroud clearance which is measured with a capacitance displacement sensor and averaging electronics. A scheduled digital PI control law was used to account for the nonlinear effects of the electromagnet with electrical current and gap size. Closed-loop <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>control</b> is demonstrated over the clearance range from 0. 005 inches (0. 127 mm) to 0. 012 inches (0. 305 mm).

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of aircraft gas turbine engines {{is sensitive to}} {{the distance between the}} tips of its turbine blades and its shroud, which serves as its containment structure. Maintaining tighter clearance between these components has been shown to increase turbine efficiency, increase fuel efficiency, and reduce the turbine inlet temperature, and this correlates to a longer time-on-wing for the engine. Therefore, there is a desire to maintain a tight clearance in the turbine, which requires fast response active clearance control. Fast response active <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>control</b> will require an actuator to modify the physical or effective tip clearance in the turbine. This paper evaluates the requirements of a generic active turbine tip clearance actuator for a modern commercial aircraft engine using the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation 40 k (C-MAPSS 40 k) software that has previously been integrated with a dynamic tip clearance model. A parametric study was performed in an attempt to evaluate requirements for control actuators in terms of bandwidth, rate limits, saturation limits, and deadband. Constraints on the weight of the actuation system and some considerations as to the force which the actuator must be capable of exerting and maintaining are also investigated. From the results, the relevant range of the evaluated actuator parameters can be extracted.

40|$|The <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> flow of {{industrial}} axial compressor rotors {{has a significant}} impact on compressor performance. Most <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> flow research work has been undertaken in the earlier low-pressure transonic stages of compressors. The main differences between the earlier (low-pressure) and later (high-pressure) stages include blade profile, stagger angle, Mach number, blade length and <b>tip</b> <b>clearance.</b> The <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> in the later stages of an industrial axial compressor is relatively large due to mechanical constraints and short blading. The stagger angle is much lower and so the <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> flow is at a higher angle to the (negative) axial direction. In the present work, a computational method has been employed to investigate <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> flow from 1 % span to 10 % span for blading such as that found in the later stages. A pinch tip model is used to model the blade tip in a cascade with a stationary and moving end-wall. It has been found that the <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> flow rolls up into a vortex much later than in the earlier stages. The migration of the <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> vortex across the passage is much less than for the earlier stages and also the induced vortex is much weaker. Comparisons between a cascade with fixed and moving end-walls are made, the main difference being that the <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> flow is stronger with a moving end-wall.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the requirements of}} a control system for active turbine <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>control</b> in a generic commercial turbofan engine through design and analysis. The control objective is to articulate the shroud in the high pressure turbine section {{in order to maintain}} a certain clearance set point given several possible engine transient events. The system must also exhibit reasonable robustness to modeling uncertainties and reasonable noise rejection properties. Two actuators were chosen to fulfill such a requirement, both of which possess different levels of technological readiness: electrohydraulic servovalves and piezoelectric stacks. Identification of design constraints, desired actuator parameters, and actuator limitations are addressed in depth; all of which are intimately tied with the hardware and controller design process. Analytical demonstrations of the performance and robustness characteristics of the two axisymmetric LQG clearance control systems are presented. Takeoff simulation results show that both actuators are capable of maintaining the clearance within acceptable bounds and demonstrate robustness to parameter uncertainty.

The measurements of the total pressure loss coefficient are made at the cascade outlets by using a five-hole probe at exit Mach numbers of 0. 10, 0. 14 and 0. 19. At each exit Mach number, experiments are performed at the <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> heights of 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, 2. 0 %, 2. 5 % and 3. 0 % of the blade height.
