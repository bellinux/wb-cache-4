40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the paper is to {{research}} and evaluate the strategic development trends in <b>the</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> in <b>the</b> period 1996 – 2006. We aim to find that mergers and acquisitions prevail as a vital strategic development option in <b>the</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry.</b> <b>The</b> research examines the exploratory hypothesis that the intensive globalization process, increased competitiveness and changed structure of competitors, strongly influence the consolidation development trends in <b>the</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> which result in an increased number of mergers and acquisitions. The intensive consolidation of <b>the</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> is a market driven process and conditioned by several strategic issues, such as lack of brand new products, increased competitiveness, fast globalization process, intensive global marketing and sales activities, changed structure of competitors, fight for global market shares and customers’ loyalty.

The company he founded has since grown into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Using the wealth generated by the company, his son, J.

In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, there was an explosion at the plant. Pennock and two other workers were killed and the plant was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty test procedures.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> {{has changed}} tremendously {{in the last}} decade. Globalization {{processes}} reinforce a consolidation of <b>the</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry.</b> Mergers and acquisitions prevail {{more and more as}} a strategic orientation of numerous world pharmaceutical companies. In our research we found out that marketing management has been playing an increasingly important or even a crucial role in day-today activities and strategic business operations of <b>the</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> companies. We may point out that a rapid consolidation of <b>the</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> is definitely a market-driven process, one conditioned by typical strategic marketing management issues, such as a lack of brand new products, intense competitiveness, globalization processes, increased global marketing and sales activities, changing structure of global competitors as well as a furious fight for global market shares and customers’ loyalty. We estimate that marketing management is to play an even more important and, especially, the top priority strategic role in the future globalization and concentration processes of <b>the</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry.</b> Some experiences and lessons from the global perspective of <b>the</b> world <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> could also be useful to <b>the</b> management of <b>pharmaceutical</b> companies in <b>the</b> transition countries of the Central and Eastern European region. Taking into consideration the current market position of these companies, some marketing management guidelines for their marketing management policies and strategies could be suggested.

5|$|Indiana became {{politically}} {{influential and}} {{played an important}} role in the Union during the American Civil War. Indiana was the first western state to mobilize for the war, and its soldiers participated in almost every engagement during the war. Following the Civil War, Indiana remained politically important as it became a critical swing state in U.S. Presidential elections. It helped decide control of the presidency for three decades. During the Indiana Gas Boom of the late 19thcentury, industry began to develop rapidly in the state. The state's Golden Age of Literature began in the same time period, increasing its cultural influence. By the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state and attracted numerous immigrants and internal migrants to its industries. It experienced setbacks during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, expansion of the auto industry, urban development, and two wars contributed to the state's industrial growth. During the second half of the 20thcentury, Indiana became a leader in <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>industry</b> due to the innovations of companies such as Eli Lilly.|$|E
