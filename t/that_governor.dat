5|$|During the campaign, Taylor was {{attacked}} by Democratic opponents because of his party's support from black voters and its ties to big business, including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. They also charged <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Bradley had run a corrupt administration. Republicans answered with charges of factionalism and use of political machinery by Democrats. In particular, they derided the Goebel Election Law, which Taylor claimed subverted {{the will of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|As the {{population}} of the territory grew, so did the people's exercising of their freedoms. In 1809, the territory was granted permission to fully elect its own legislature for the first time. Before <b>that,</b> <b>Governor</b> Harrison appointed the legislature. Although Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance had prohibited slavery, it had existed in the region since French rule. In addition, settlers from the Upper South occupied areas along the Ohio River, bringing slaves with them. They wanted to have it be legal in the territory, but others from the northern states opposed the expansion of slavery into this region. The anti-slavery party won a strong majority in the first election. Governor Harrison was at odds with the new legislature, which proceeded to overturn the indenturing and pro-slavery laws he had enacted. Slavery remained the defining issue in the state for the decades to follow. In these early decades, although the legislature did not encourage free blacks to settle here, it extended suffrage to them.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the threat}} from Iselle, {{lieutenant}} governor candidate Warner Sutton requested <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Neil Abercrombie postpone the August9 primary. The governor declined the request, and the primary election occurred as scheduled. However, the storm damaged roads leading to two polling stations on the Big Island, prompting officials to decide the election by absentee ballot in those areas. After a close campaign between incumbent Senator Brian Schatz and Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa, the senate primary, held {{on the same day}} as the gubernatorial primary, was too close to call after Schatz led by only 1,635votes. As a result, the election hinged on the two closed polling stations, where more than 8,000people had the option to vote by mail. This was later changed to an in-person vote for August15, despite a challenge from the Hanabusa campaign with regards to storm damage, and Schatz ultimately won. The Hawaii American Civil Liberties Union later sued the state over how they handled the election.|$|E
5|$|In 1774, the {{government}} of Prince Edward Island passed the Quit Rent Act 1774 to force the proprietors to pay their dues to maintain civil infrastructure on the island. However, many proprietors continued to simply not pay their quitrent. In 1781, {{the government}}, led by Governor Walter Patterson, compulsorily acquired {{approximately half of the}} island using a process known as escheat. That same year, the government held a public auction to sell off the land that had been compulsorily acquired. However, following a concerted effort by the proprietors to get the Colonial Office to reverse the action, the Crown overturned the sales conducted at the auction in 1783. The proprietors requested <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Patterson be removed from his office, and the Colonial Office did so in 1786.|$|E
5|$|Learning that British {{troops were}} on the way, the Boston Town Meeting met on September 12, 1768 and {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Bernard convene the General Court. Bernard refused, so the town meeting called on the other Massachusetts towns to send representatives to meet at Faneuil Hall beginning on September 22. About 100 towns sent delegates to the convention, which was effectively an unofficial session of the Massachusetts House. The convention issued a letter which insisted that Boston was not a lawless town, using language more moderate than what Adams desired, and that the impending military occupation violated Bostonians' natural, constitutional, and charter rights. By {{the time that the}} convention adjourned, British troop transports had arrived in Boston Harbor. Two regiments disembarked in October 1768, followed by two more in November.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} a third jury consumed {{a year and}} a half. During the delay, Desha attempted suicide by cutting his throat and severed his windpipe. Doctors used a silver tube to repair his windpipe, and Desha survived. On {{the last day of the}} court's term in June 1827, the judge announced another continuance, since the court had not yet empaneled a jury. Governor Desha stood and produced a pardon for his son. Although legend holds <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Desha resigned immediately after issuing the pardon, records show that he served out the rest of his term. The pardon damaged the governor's reputation and that of the Relief Party, which lost a number of legislative seats in the subsequent elections.|$|E
5|$|The statehouse {{was built}} of blue limestone, two stories high. The {{governor}} and the Supreme Court occupied the lower floor, and the legislature occupied the upper floor, with each house in its own wing. The building {{was the site of}} many great events in its history, including a bier for Abraham Lincoln. The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen out of style, and the building was beginning to become decrepit. The building's limestone foundation began to fail, and many feared a general structural collapse of the building. In 1867 the ceiling in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed. A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found. By the time <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> James Williams was elected to office, the building was about to be condemned. It was finally demolished in 1877.|$|E
5|$|With {{the tunnel}} now {{designated}} exclusively for subway service, Mayor Hylan, a former Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) employee {{who was a}} known opponent of both the BMT and the IRT, supposedly stopped the project {{as part of an}} overall effort to cripple the two private subway companies and promote the plans for the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND). It was also reported <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Smith, who had a financial stake in the Pennsylvania Railroad company, tried to stall the project in order to prevent the expansion of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad operations farther into the city. The stoppage was also attributed to the political rivalry between Hylan and Smith, who were both members of Tammany Hall's Democratic Party.|$|E
50|$|In Missouri, during Governor Warren Hearnes' term, {{the rules}} were changed so <b>that</b> <b>governors</b> were allowed two {{back-to-back}} 4-year terms. By the 1972 race, Hearnes had served two terms and was term limited.|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} by Abney and Lauth concluded <b>that</b> <b>governors</b> were losing ground to legislatures {{in shaping the}} state budget. Goodman examined Abney and Lauth’s explanations for this change and found empirical support for some but not others. This article’s findings reveal <b>that</b> <b>governors,</b> as a group, have not declined in budgetary influence, although some have gained and others lost during recent decades. The longitudinal analysis arrives at two major conclusions: (1) executive–legislative influence changes that take place stem primarily from political rather than structural changes, and (2) budgetary influence is not unidimensional as governors and legislatures compete in a non-zero-sum game in pursuit of different budgetary outcomes...|$|R
5|$|With these changes, {{a special}} session of the {{legislature}} met August 5 until August 20 in Oregon City. On August 11, 1845 at the introduction of Jesse Applegate the body passed a law against dueling within a half hour <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Abernethy also signed within 30 minutes of the bill's introduction. A new legislature met beginning on December 2, with Robert Newell serving as {{the speaker of the}} body through December 10 and Henry A. G. Lee assuming the post until the conclusion of the session on December 19. Polk District was created during the session, with the bill passed on December 19. John E. Long served as the recorder and Theophilus R. Magruder as the sergeant at arms for the group. The same people who served in the summer session also served in the December session.|$|E
5|$|Following her election, Collins {{donated the}} surplus $242,000 from her {{campaign}} coffers {{to the state}} Democratic Party. When Collins' husband was named state treasurer for the party– at an annual salary of $59,900– the state press charged that the move was a plot to funnel Collins' campaign funds into her personal account. (The previous Democratic state treasurer had received no salary during his tenure.) Following the media criticism, Dr. Collins resigned his post as treasurer. All of the involved individuals insisted <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Collins had not been briefed {{on the details of}} her husband's appointment. The media's criticism of Collins continued as many of the appointments to her executive cabinet went to what they characterized as inexperienced personnel who had held key positions in her past campaigns. When newly appointed Insurance Commissioner Gilbert McCarty approved a 17% rate increase requested by Blue Cross Blue Shield– a request that his predecessor had denied a few days earlier– Collins quickly countermanded the approval pending a public hearing on the matter.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{states had}} already seceded when Breckinridge took his seat as a senator, leaving the {{remaining}} Southern senators more outnumbered in their defense of slavery. Seeking {{to find a}} compromise that would reunite the states under constitutional principles, he urged Lincoln to withdraw federal forces from the Confederate states in order to avert war. The congressional session ended on March 28, and in an April 2 address to the Kentucky General Assembly, he continued to advocate peaceful reconciliation of the states and proposed a conference of border states to seek a solution. On April 12, Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter, ending plans for the conference. Breckinridge recommended <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Beriah Magoffin call a sovereignty convention to determine whether Kentucky would side with the Union or the Confederacy. On May 10, he was chosen by the legislature as one of six delegates to a conference to decide the state's next action. The states' rights delegates were Breckinridge, Magoffin, and Richard Hawes; the Unionist delegates were Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and S.S. Nicholas. Unable to agree on substantial issues, the delegates recommended that Kentucky adopt a neutral stance in the Civil War and arm itself to prevent invasion by either federal or Confederate forces. Breckinridge did not support this recommendation, but he agreed to abide by it once it {{was approved by the}} legislature.|$|E
