5|$|The aphid {{that was}} the central source of the damage in France was first noted {{following}} the growing of the European vine Vitis vinifera by French colonists in Florida, in the 16th century. These plantations were a failure, and later experiments with related species of vine also failed, although the reason for these failures {{appears to have been}} a mystery to the French colonists. It is known <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a species of North American grape phylloxera that caused these early vineyards to fail; the venom injected by the Phylloxera causes a disease that is quickly fatal to the European varieties of vine. The aphids initially went unnoticed by the colonists, despite their great numbers, and the pressure to successfully start a vineyard in America at the time.|$|E
25|$|Anthropologists {{claim that}} many of the Dongba rituals show strong {{influences}} from the Bön religion, and are not native in origin. Bön lamas are believed to have settled among the Nashi as farmers, and to have begun to practise exorcisms as a way of earning a little money on the side; they were thus in competition with the native ritual specialists, locally known as Llü-bu, or Ssan-nyi. This is disputed, largely because the Bon religion is so adulterated by Tibetan Buddhism <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is difficult to find pure and authentic practitioners to use as a basis for comparison.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{discussion}} in Egyptology concerning whether Apepi also ruled Upper Egypt. There are indeed several objects with the king's name most likely coming from Thebes and Upper Egypt. These include a dagger {{with the name}} of the king bought on the art market in Luxor. There is an axe of unknown provenance where the king is called beloved of Sobek, lord of Sumenu. Sumenu is nowadays identified with Mahamid Qibli, about 24 kilometers south of Thebes and there is a fragment of a stone vessel found in a Theban tomb. For all these objects it is arguable that they were traded to Upper Egypt. More problematic is a block with the king's name found at Gebelein. The block had been taken as evidence for building activity of the king in Upper Egypt and, hence, seen as proof that the Hyksos also ruled in Upper Egypt. However, the block is not very big and many scholars argue <b>today,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might have reached Gebelein after the looting of the Hyksos capital and is no proof of a Hyksos reign in Upper Egypt.|$|E

500|$|All Sounds of Final Fantasy I•II was {{moderately}} {{well received}} by critics such as Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan, {{who felt that}} it had [...] "the same power <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had 18 years ago", although he also {{felt that it was}} much weaker than Uematsu's later works with many of the themes [...] "simplistic and undeveloped". Patrick Gann of RPGFan, on the other hand, praised the album for what he considered to be good music and the rush of nostalgia it brought with it, and was especially pleased with the two arranged tracks. Aaron Lau of Soundtrack Central agreed with the sentiments expressed by Gann, and stated that the arranged tracks alone were worth buying the album for. Romil Balibalita of Soundtrack Central, however, felt that while the soundtrack was good, it was [...] "only worth one or two listens" [...] and recommended it for fans of the original versions of video game music. Nick of Square Enix Music Online said that the album was [...] "an acquired taste" [...] and recommended it primarily to fans of Nobuo Uematsu interested in his earlier work.|$|E
