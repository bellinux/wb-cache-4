50|$|Aphonopelma hentzi, the <b>Texas</b> <b>brown</b> <b>{{tarantula}},</b> (also {{known as}} Oklahoma brown tarantula or Missouri tarantula), {{is one of}} the most common species of tarantula thriving in the southern-most United States today. Texas brown tarantulas can grow in excess of a four-inch leg span, and weigh more than 3 ounces as adults. The body is dark brown. Shades may vary between individual tarantulas and are more distinct after a moult.|$|E
50|$|When disturbed, {{like most}} other tarantulas, A. hentzi will {{maneuver}} itself to a stance {{on its hind legs}} and raise its front legs in a threatening manner. Also, Texas brown tarantulas have small coarse brown and/or black urticating hairs on their abdomen that they will kick in the direction of whatever they may feel threatened by. Bites from the <b>Texas</b> <b>brown</b> <b>tarantula</b> are generally not a serious harm to humans. Apply a cold compress to the area, and if swelling or a rash occurs, seek medical attention.|$|E
50|$|A. hentzi {{lives in}} North America {{throughout}} Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, southern Kansas, Missouri, northwestern Louisiana, and other adjoining {{areas in the}} U.S. and northeast Mexico. The spider {{can also be found}} in Colorado, and has been observed as far north as Denver. They are commonly found in grasslands, burrowed under ground; or using logs, stones, or other small animals' abandoned dens as their home and feeding grounds. <b>Texas</b> <b>brown</b> <b>tarantulas</b> will use their spinnerets to line the entrance of their shelter with webbing so as to detect passing prey. Tarantulas are often restricted to the ground but can climb.|$|R

40|$|A {{multilevel}} optimization {{approach is}} presented {{for determining the}} optimum management of the <b>Texas</b> <b>brown</b> shrimp fishery. Independent fisher groups harvest this open access resource in a hierarchical order without cooperation among themselves or with the management authority. The special structure {{of the problem is}} exploited to derive the fishers' optimum responses to any arbitrary specification of the policy variables (season and area closures). Empirical results indicate that significant losses of income and harvest value would occur if the fishery were unmanaged. The results also indicate that optimum closure policies vary significantly depending on the policy objective specification. Copyright 1996, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
