5|$|Certain {{patterns}} are only used in certain {{sections of the}} cloth. For example, a row of isosceles triangles, forming the pasung motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called dhlorong, are commonly used for the head. However, pasung and dhlorong are occasionally found in the body. Other motifs such as buketan (flower bouquet) and birds are commonly used in either <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>or</b> the body.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>or</b> thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E

Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 25–30 years.|$|E
5|$|Myoclonic {{seizures}} involve spasms {{of muscles}} {{in either a}} few areas or all over. Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>or</b> eye blinking. The person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends. Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second. This typically occurs {{on both sides of}} the body.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can avoid}} attacks from their opponents by dodging {{to the left}} or right or by ducking, but players cannot punch while dodging or ducking, nor can they duck body blows. They can also block attacks to either <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>or</b> the body, but they cannot block strong punches; strong punches must be avoided by dodging or ducking. Depending on the situation, the player must {{strategically}} block, dodge, or duck in order to avoid an opponent's attack. Players can capitalize on the opponent's attacks by launching counter-punches immediately after avoiding an attack.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>or</b> upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% on <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>or</b> neck. In {{some cases the}} same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

A threaded washer (20) has second threads (22) for disposition between <b>the</b> <b>head</b> (14 <b>or</b> 114) and the part (18). A torsion spring (24) reacts between <b>the</b> <b>head</b> (14 <b>or</b> 114) and the washer (20) for urging <b>the</b> <b>head</b> (14 <b>or</b> 114) and the washer (20) to rotate in opposite directions. The assembly {{is characterized by}} the first and second threads (22) being of different pitches and in the same helical direction whereby the torsion spring (24) continually rotates the washer (20) to maintain a pre-load on the shaft (12). To assemble the components, <b>the</b> hex <b>head</b> (14 <b>or</b> 114) is first torsionally loaded against the washer (20) utilizing the torsional spring (24) such that the components would rotate apart if the pre-load was removed. <b>The</b> hex <b>head</b> (14 <b>or</b> 114) and washer (20) are of the same polygonal (hexagonal) shape and are rotated together with a conventional socket type wrench disposed over both at the same time.

Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten.

5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings on <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>or</b> wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species {{take up to}} four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible. They feed by flying low over the water surface with the lower mandible skimming the water for small fish. Thirty-two species of Laridae have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E

Terns are in general medium-to-large birds, typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter-bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. In Tasmania, thirteen species of gulls and terns have been recorded, five of which are vagrants. The two groups have been considered separate families, but some findings that the noddies and white tern are offshoots to the combined group have led the two to be classified as a single family for the time being.|$|E
