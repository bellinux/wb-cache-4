40|$|<b>Take-all</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> {{is caused}} by a soil-borne fungus (Gaeumannomvces gramlnls var. trltld), which attacks the roots and {{develops}} in patches, It {{is one of the most}} cammon wheat diseases, notably affecting second and third crops of wheat, leading to major yield losses. Its development depends on numerous factors linked to crop sequences, cultivation techniques, climate and soil type. So far, growers have limited options to prevent the severity of damage caused by take-all to winter wheat crops. Chemical control methods exist, based on the treatment of seeds but have partial efficacy only. Some cultivation techniques are known to reduce take-all incidence and severity and limit its impact on yield but none of them constitutes an efficient method of control on itself. To achieve economically Significant control of this disease, there is thus a need for combining appropriate techniques (cropping practices, fungicide treatment), although with partial efficacy, but showing complementary effects in order to achieve efficient management strategies. Up to now, no decision making tool has been developed to define such management strategy leading to integrated control of <b>take-all</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> INRA scientists have used a database containing information from 2 S experiments where 2 to 24 cropping systems were tested between 1992 and 2003, to develop 16 models which could predict the incidence of the disease as a function of variables related to the cropping system, soil and climate. They finally chose only three of these models for practical use. These models were combined with a yield simulation module calculating yield loss as a function of the incidence of <b>take-all</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> The full models were then used to illustrate a series of applications aimed at answering practical questions which would be of interest to technical institutes and crop protection advisors, such as: the planning of fungicide treatments, comparison of the impact of different crop sequences or crop management on Incidence of the disease and yield losses. These models simulate the dynamics of the disease at the field scale and enable identification of the combinations of farming practices which could limit the effects of take-all, even in a situation favourable to the disease.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Microbiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Take-all is {{the name}} given to the disease caused by a soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis (Sacc.) von Arx and Olivier var. tritici Walker (Ggt), an ascomycete of the family Magnaportheaceae (Cook, 2003). This fungus is an {{aggressive}} soil-borne pathogen causing root rot <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> (primary host), barley and rye crops (secondary host). The flowering, seedling, and vegetative growth stages can {{be affected by the}} infection of the whole plant, leaves, roots, and stems. Infections of roots result in losses in crop yield and quality primarily due to a lowering in nutrient uptake. Take-all is most common in regions where wheat is cultivated without adequate crop rotation. Crop rotation allows time between the planting dates of susceptible crops, which causes a decrease in the inoculum potential of soilborne plant pathogens to levels below an economic threshold by resident antagonistic soil microbial communities. Soilborne disease suppressiveness is an inherent characteristic of the physical, chemical, and/or biological structure of a particular soil which might be induced by agricultural practices and activities such as the cultivation of crops, or the addition of organisms or nutritional amendments, causing a change in the microfloral environment. Disturbances of soil ecosystems that impact on the normal functioning of microbial communities are potentially detrimental to soil formation, energy transfers, nutrient cycling, and long-term stability. In this regard, an overview of soil properties and processes indicated that the use of microbiological and biochemical soil properties, such as microbial biomass, the analysis of microbial functional diversity and microbial structural diversity by the quantification of community level physiological profiles and signature lipid biomarkers are useful as indicators of soil ecological stress or restoration properties because they are more responsive to small changes than physical and chemical characteristics. In this study, the relationship between physico-chemical characteristics, and different biological indicators of soil quality of agricultural soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral with respect to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> as caused by the soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), were investigated using various techniques. The effect of crop rotation on the functional and structural diversity of soils conducive to take-all disease was also investigated. Through the integration of quantitative and qualitative biological data as well as the physico-chemical characteristics of the various soils, the functional and structural diversity of microbial IV communities in the soils during different stadia <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> were characterised. All results were evaluated statistically and the predominant physical and chemical characteristics that influenced the microbiological and biochemical properties of the agricultural soils during different stadia <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> were identified using multivariate analyses. Although no significant difference @ > 0. 05) could be observed between the various soils using conventional microbiological enumeration techniques, the incidence of Gliocladium spp. in suppressive soils was increased. Significant differences @ < 0. 05) were observed between agricultural soils during different stadia <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> Although no clear distinction could be made between soils suppressive and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> soils suppressive and conducive to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> differed substantially in their community level physiological profiles (CLPPs). Soils suppressive / neutral to take-all disease were characterised by enhanced utilisation of carboxylic acids, amino acids, and carbohydrates, while conducive soils were characterised by enhanced utilisation of carbohydrates. Shifts in the functional diversity of the associated microbial communities were possibly caused by the presence of Ggt and associated antagonistic fungal and bacterial populations in the various soils. It was evident that the relationships amongst the functionality of the microbial communities within the various soils had undergone changes through the different stages <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> thus implying different substrate utilisation capabilities of present soil microbial communities. Diversity indices were calculated as Shannon's diversity index (H') and substrate equitability (J) and were overall within the higher diversity range of 3. 6 and 0. 8, respectively, indicating the achievement of very high substrate diversity values in the various soils. A substantial percentage of the carbon sources were utilised, which contributed to the very high Shannon-Weaver substrate utilisation indices. Obtained substrate evenness (equitability) (J) indices indicated an existing high functional diversity. The functional diversity as observed during crop rotation, differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from each other, implying different substrate utilisation capabilities of present soil microbial communities, which could possibly be ascribed to the excretion of root exudates by sunflowers and soybeans. Using the Sorenson's index, a clear distinction could be made between the degrees of substrate utilisation between microbial populations in soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> as well as during crop rotation. Furthermore, the various soils could also be differentiated {{on the basis of the}} microbial community structure as determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from soils conducive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> implying a shift in relationships amongst the structural diversity of microbial communities within the various soils. A positive association was observed between the microbial phospholipid fatty acid profiles, and dominant environmental variables of soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> Soils conducive and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> were characterised by high concentrations of manganese, as well as elevated concentrations of monounsaturated fatty acids, terminally branched saturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids which were indicative of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and micro eukaryotes (primarily fungi), respectively. These soils were also characterised by low concentrations of phosphorous, potassium, percentage organic carbon, and percentage organic nitrogen, as well as low soil pH. Soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> was characterised by the elevated levels of estimated of biomass and elevated concentrations of normal saturated fatty acids, which is ubiquitous to micro-organisms. The concentration of normal saturated fatty acids in suppressive soils is indicative of a low structural diversity. This soil was also characterised by high concentrations of phosphorous, potassium, percentage organic carbon, and percentage organic nitrogen, as well as elevated soil pH. The relationship between PLFAs and agricultural soils was investigated using principal component analysis (PCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) and discriminant analysis (DA). Soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> differed significantly (p < 0. 05) from soils conducive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> implying a shift in relationships amongst the structural diversity of microbial communities within the various soils. A positive association was observed between the microbial phospholipid fatty acid profiles, and dominant environmental variables of soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> Hierarchical cluster analysis of the major phospholipid fatty acid groups indicated that the structural diversity differed significantly between soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. The results indicate that the microbial community functionality as well as the microbial community structure was significantly influenced by the presence <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, and that the characterisation of microbial functional and structural diversity by analysis of community level physiological profiles and phospholipid fatty acid analysis, respectively, could be successfully used as an assessment criteria for the evaluation of agricultural soils conducive, suppressive, and neutral to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> as well as in crop rotation systems. This methodology might be of significant value in assisting in the management and evaluation of agricultural soils subject to the prevalence of other soilborne diseases. Master...|$|R

The frequency of Phl- and PCA-producing fluorescent pseudomonads was determined on roots <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> grown in three soils suppressive to <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> and four soils conducive to take-all by colony hybridization followed by PCR.

40|$|Take-all is {{the most}} devastating root disease of wheat worldwide. The causal agent is Gaeumannomyces graminis (Sacc.) Arx & Olivier.

40|$|The role of {{antibiotics}} in biological control of soilborne pathogens, and more generally in microbial antagonism in natural disease-suppressive soils, often {{has been questioned}} because of the indirect nature of the supporting evidence. In this study, a protocol for high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry is described that allowed specific identification and quantitation of the antibiotic 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (Phl) produced by naturally occurring fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. on roots of wheat grown in a soil suppressive to <b>take-all</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> These results provide, for the first time, biochemical support for the conclusion of previous work that Phl-producing fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. are key components of the natural biological control that operates in take-all-suppressive soils in Washington State.

Disease aggregation within roots and plants was stronger in line and hill sowing than in broadcast sowing. Analysis of the disease gradient in the artificially infested plots showed that the disease intensified (local increase of disease level) more than it extensified (spatial spread of the disease), the effect of the introduced inoculum was reduced by 95 % at a distance of 15 cm away from the point of infestation.

40|$|International audienceSeasonality, or {{periodic}} host absence, is {{a central}} feature in plant epidemiology. In this respect, seasonal plant epidemic models {{take into account the}} way the parasite overwinters and generates new infections. These are termed primary infections. In the literature, one finds two classes of models: high-dimensional elaborate models and low-dimensional compact models, where primary infection dynamics are explicit and implicit, respectively. Investigating a compact model allowed previous authors to show the existence of a competitive exclusion principle. However, the way compact models derive from elaborate models has not been made explicit yet. This makes it unclear whether results such as competitive exclusion extend to elaborate models as well. Here, we show that assuming primary infection dynamics are fast in a standard elaborate model translates into a compact form. Yet, it is not that usually found in the literature. Moreover, we numerically show that coexistence is possible in this original compact form. Reversing the question, we show that the usual compact form approximates an alternate elaborate model, which differs from the earlier one in that primary infection dynamics are density dependent. We discuss to which extent these results shed light on coexistence within soil- and air-borne plant parasites, such as within the <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> and the grapevine powdery mildew cryptic species complexes, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aureofaciens 30 - 84 is a soilborne {{bacterium}} that colonizes {{the wheat}} rhizosphere. This strain produces three phenazine antibiotics which suppress <b>take-all</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> by inhibition <b>of</b> the causative agent Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. Phenazines also enhance survival of 30 - 84 within the wheat rhizosphere {{in competition with}} other organisms. Expression of the phenazine biosynthetic operon {{is controlled by the}} phzR/phzI N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) response system (L. S. Pierson III et al., J. Bacterial 176 : 3966 - 3974, 1994; D. W. Wood and L. S. Pierson III, Gene 168 : 49 - 53, 1996). By using high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry, the AHL produced by PhzI has now been identified as N-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (HHL). In addition, the ability of HHL to serve as an interpopulation signal molecule in the wheat rhizosphere has been examined by using isogenic reporter strains. Disruption of phzI reduced expression of the phenazine biosynthetic operon 1, 000 -fold in the <b>wheat</b> rhizosphere. Coinoculation <b>of</b> an isogenic strain which produced the endogenous HHL signal restored phenazine gene expression in the phzI mutant to wild-type levels in situ.

None of the four isolates of G. graminis var. avenae examined were sensitive to either of the antibiotics in vitro at the concentrations tested. The single isolate of G. graminis var. graminis tested was insensitive to PCA at 1. 0 (mu) g/ml. Pseudomonas fluorescens 2 - 79 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30 - 84, both of which produce PCA, effectively suppressed take-all caused by each of two PCA-sensitive isolates of G. graminis var. tritici. PCA-producing strains exhibited a reduced ability or complete inability to suppress take-all caused by two of three isolates of G. graminis var. tritici that were insensitive to PCA at 1. 0 (mu) g/ml. P. fluorescens Q 2 - 87, which produces Phl, suppressed take-all caused by three Phl-sensitive isolates but failed to provide significant suppression of take-all caused by two isolates of G. graminis var. tritici that were insensitive to Phl at 3. 0 (mu) g/ml. These findings affirm {{the role of the}} antibiotics PCA and Phl in the biocontrol activity of these fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. and support earlier evidence that mechanisms in addition to PCA are responsible for suppression of take-all by strain 2 - 79. The results show further that isolates of G. graminis var. tritici insensitive to PCA and Phl are present in the pathogen population and provide additional justification for the use of mixtures of Pseudomonas spp. that employ different mechanisms of pathogen suppression to manage this disease...|$|E

Root infection by either G. graminis var. tritici or R. solani resulted in populations of both bacterial strains that were equal to or significantly larger than their respective populations maintained on roots {{in the absence of}} these pathogens. In contrast, the population of strain 2 - 79 was significantly smaller on roots in the presence of any of the three Pythium species than on noninfected roots and was often below the limits of detection (50 CFU/cm of root) on Pythium-infected roots after 40 days of plant growth. In the presence of either P. aristosporum or P. ultimum var. sporangiiferum, the decline in the population of Q 72 a- 80 was similar to that observed on noninfected roots; however, the population of this strain declined more rapidly on roots infected by P. irregulare than on noninfected roots. Application of metalaxyl (which is selectively inhibitory to Pythium spp.) to soil naturally infestated with Pythium spp. resulted in significantly larger rhizosphere populations of the introduced bacteria over time than on plants grown in the same soil without metalaxyl. It is apparent that root infections by fungal pathogens may either enhance or depress the population of fluorescent pseudomonads introduced for their control, with different strains of pseudomonads reacting differentially to different genera and species of the root pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aureofaciens 30 - 84, a {{biological}} control bacterium for the soil-borne disease <b>take-all</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat,</b> {{is a model}} system for biological control of root-infecting fungal pathogens. Strain 30 - 84 inhibits the causal agent of take-all, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, primarily through the production of phenazine antibiotics, which are important for survival of the bacterium in the rhizosphere. Prior to this work, phenazine production was shown to be regulated by an N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) response system encoded by phzI and phzR. This work identified a second regulatory system involved in the phenazine regulatory cascade. The two-component regulatory system involving the GacS/GacA proteins regulates the production of phenazines, extracellular protease, hydrogen cyanide and fluorescent siderophores. GacS/GacA regulates the production of phenazines at multiple levels. They control {{the production of the}} AHL signal required for expression of the phenazine biosynthetic operon by tightly regulating transcription of phzI. This was the first report of a linkage between a two-component regulatory system and an AHL response system. GacS/GacA also control phenazine production through a second mechanism. Preliminary evidence suggests translational regulation of one or more genes involved in the phenazine regulatory cascade through transcriptional control of a regulatory RNA (rsmB RNA) required to neutralize the negative effects of the translational repressor RsmA. Another aspect of this work was the analysis of the formation and rhizosphere competence of spontaneous gacS and gacA mutants of strain 30 - 84. These are commonly isolated from laboratory cultures of all biocontrol bacteria and could pose a threat to the efficacy of biological control if they arise in the rhizosphere and displace the phenazine-producing wild type strain 30 - 84. This work indicated that the mutants did arise on wheat roots and did displace strain 30 - 84 on roots in sterile soil. However, the mutants did not displace strain 30 - 84 on roots in natural soil. In fact, the wild type strain 30 - 84 appeared to compete more favorably with indigenous microorganisms {{in the presence of a}} subpopulation of GacS/GacA mutants. Therefore, the results presented here indicate that a subpopulation of gacS and gacA mutants is a normal and beneficial part of the P. aureofaciens community in the rhizosphere...|$|E

The outbreak stage (5 yr) was mainly characterized by the prevalence of Proteobacteria, notably Pseudomonas (Gammaproteobacteria), Nitrosospira (Betaproteobacteria), Rhizobacteriaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae (Alphaproteobacteria), as well as Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia. By contrast, suppressiveness (10 yr) correlated with the prevalence of a broader range of taxa, which belonged mainly to Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Nitrospira, Chloroflexi, Alphaproteobacteria (notably Azospirillum) and Firmicutes (notably Thermoanaerobacter). • In conclusion, take-all decline correlated with multiple changes in rhizobacterial community composition, far beyond the sole case of pseudomonads...|$|R
40|$|The {{genotypic}} {{diversity that}} occurs in natural populations of antagonistic microorganisms provides an enormous resource for improving biological control of plant diseases.

One RAPD group made up 50 % {{of the total population}} of DAPG-producing Pseudomonas spp. Both short- and long-term studies indicated that this dominant genotype, exemplified by P. fluorescens Q 8 r 1 - 96, is highly adapted to the wheat rhizosphere. Q 8 r 1 - 96 requires a much lower dose (only 10 to 100 CFU seed− 1 or soil− 1) to establish high rhizosphere population densities (107 CFU g of root− 1) than Q 2 - 87 and 1 M 1 - 96, two genotypically different, DAPG-producing P. fluorescens strains. Q 8 r 1 - 96 maintained a rhizosphere population density of approximately 105 CFU g of root− 1 after eight successive growth cycles <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> in three different, raw virgin soils, whereas populations of Q 2 - 87 and 1 M 1 - 96 dropped relatively quickly after five cycles and were not detectable after seven cycles. In short-term studies, strains Q 8 r 1 - 96, Q 2 - 87, and 1 M 1 - 96 did not differ in their ability to suppress take-all. After eight successive growth cycles, however, Q 8 r 1 - 96 still provided control <b>of</b> <b>take-all</b> to the same level as obtained in the take-all suppressive soil, whereas Q 2 - 87 and 1 M 1 - 96 gave no control anymore.

40|$|Spore-forming {{bacteria}} {{were investigated}} as potential biological control {{agents of the}} pea root rot fungus, Aphanomyces euteiches (Oomycete). Isolations of the bacteria were made both directly from field soils (558) and from the rhizosphere of peas grown in soil (146). When the 704 isolates were screened for inhibition of A. euteiches mycelial expansion in vitro, a low frequency of suppressiveness was observed in isolates taken directly from field-soil (0. 05 %), whilst 19 % of the bacterial isolates taken from the rhizosphere were suppressive. Mycelial suppressive isolates were subsequently screened for inhibition of zoospore germination and germ tube growth. The seven isolates Bacillus cereus 15 • 80, Paenibacillus polymyxa 18 • 25, P. polymyxa 18 • 94, unidentified bacterium PB 45, Paenibacillus macerans PT 1, Bacillus pumilus PT 10 and Bacillus subtilis PT 69, inhibited growth by 50 % or more. Bacterial isolates were identified using carbohydrate fermentation profiles and, for Bacillus mycoides MW 27 and P. polymyxa 18 • 25, on their 16 S rRNA gene sequences. The seven suppressive isolates identified, and an additional five isolates which had appeared promising in an earlier study (unidentified bacterium MW 9 b, B. cereus MW 10, B. pumilus MW 12, B. pumilus MW 18, B. mycoides MW 27), were tested for disease control in glasshouse trials. Bacillus cereus 15 • 80 and Apron C 70 SD significantly (∝= 0. 05) reduced visual root rot disease in the initial trial. However, {{the presence of other}} root rot pathogens, causing disease with symptoms similar to Aphanomyces root rot, confounded the results. In a subsequent trial, counts were made of oospore numbers per gram of root tissue which allowed specific distinction of A. euteiches disease. Several species of bacteria were able to reduce oospores and root rot symptoms. Paenibacillus polymyxa 18 • 25 was the most effective, reducing oospores from 450 to 160 gram⁻¹ of root. Apron C 70 SD reduced overall root disease but had no effect on oospore counts. On the basis of both in vitro and glasshouse trial results, B. subtilis PT 69, B. pumilus MW 18 and PT 10, B. mycoides MW 27, B. cereus 15 • 80, P. polymyxa 18 • 25 and 18 • 94 were selected for field testing. In the first trial, no significant differences (∝= 0. 05) were found between nil and each of the other treatments. In part, this was due to low overall disease pressure (disease score of 1. 5 in untreated) and inadequate separation I resolution of treatment means (all bacterial treatment means were 1. 0). Bacillus mycoides MW 27 and P. polymyxa 18 • 25 were selected for further field trials. Bacillus mycoides MW 27 significantly (∝= 0. 05) increased the mean pod weight per plant from 2. 39 g (nil) to 2. 71 g, and the average plant root weight from 0. 81 g to 0. 95 g. No benefits were found by applying the two isolates together as opposed to individually, nor was there a benefit by combining them with Apron C 70 SD. Seed coat, prill and granule formulations of B. mycoides MW 27 were evaluated in a field trial. As a seed coat formulation, the isolate significantly (∝= 0. 05) increased plot stand by about 10 %. In a prill formulation, B. mycoides MW 27 had no effect on plot stand (early damping-off disease), but significantly (∝= 0. 05) increased the number of pods per plant and average pod weight per plant. Apron C 70 SD controlled damping-off disease but had no effect on root rot disease. Bacillus pumilus PT 10, B. mycoides MW 27, P. polymyxa 18 • 25 and fluquinconazole were tested as seed treatments for control of another root disease, <b>take-all</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat.</b> Bacillus pumilus PT 10 significantly (∝= 0. 05) increased plant yield by 77 %. Bacillus mycoides MW 27 had similar efficacy as fluquinconazole, increasing yield by approximately 10 % (not significant at ∝= 0. 05). As a seed coat treatment, B. mycoides MW 27 also effectively controlled damping-off disease. Paenibacillus polymyxa 18 • 25 suppressed a wide range of plant pathogenic fungi in vitro, possibly through production of the cell wall-degrading enzymes chitinase or cellulase, or an antibiotic compound which the bacterium was found to produce. Bacillus mycoides MW 27 was slightly suppressive to only two pathogenic fungi in vitro, and did not degrade chitin or cellulose. The soil bacterium Bacillus mycoides MW 27 has excellent potential for development as a biological control agent of Aphanomyces root rot of pea. A formulation of the bacterium could be marketed on both its ability to increase yields under Aphanomyces disease pressure, and to limit oospore development, thereby limiting disease in continuous cropping situations...|$|E
