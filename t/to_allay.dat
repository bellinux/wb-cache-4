5|$|Governor Breathitt died of {{tuberculosis}} on February 21, 1834, and Morehead {{was sworn in}} as governor the following day. The replacement of a Democratic governor with one from the rival National Republican party caused a great deal of angst among Democrats, but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's willingness to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, did much <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> their fears.|$|E
5|$|In Pune, an {{estimated}} 25,000workers {{left the city}} {{in the wake of the}} attacks, according to government officials. Pune's District Guardian Minister Ajit Pawar and Collector Prabhakar Deshmukh held meetings of various people's representatives to stop the mass departure. They were joined by local Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi, who picketed at Pune railway station <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> fears of those boarding the trains with their family members, carrying their meager belongings.|$|E

At Jocelyn's suggestion she wrote a message to inform her father that {{she had gone to}} her aunt's, with a view <b>to</b> <b>allaying</b> anxiety and deterring pursuit. They walked together to the platform and bade each other good-bye; each obtained a ticket independently, and Jocelyn got his luggage from the cloak-room.|$|R

5|$|Fort Snelling was {{established}} in 1819 to extend United States jurisdiction over the area and <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> concerns about British fur traders in the area. The soldiers initially camped at a site {{on the south side}} of the Minnesota River, but conditions were hard there and nearly a fifth of the soldiers died of scurvy in the winter of 1819–1820. They later moved their camp to Camp Coldwater in May 1820. Much of the military's activity was conducted there while the fort was built. Camp Coldwater, the site of a cold, clear, flowing spring, was also considered sacred by the native Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Half of Minneapolis–Saint Paul {{residents}} work in {{the city}} where they live. Most residents drive cars, but 60% of the 160,000 people working downtown commute by means other than a single person per auto. Alternative transportation is encouraged. The Metropolitan Council's Metro Transit, which operates the light rail system and most of the city's buses, provides free travel vouchers through the Guaranteed Ride Home program <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> fears that commuters might otherwise be occasionally stranded if, for example, they work late hours.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had they not already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{subject of}} the book, however, {{is what happens when}} a person's spontaneity is crushed in early life. The person will slowly lose touch with that spontaneity or [...] "real self", and develop, instead, a reactive self which is constructed to respond to dangers of various kinds. If a child's early environment is such that the child grows up seeing the world as basically hostile, compulsive actions will predominate and the child will grow up devoted <b>to</b> <b>allaying</b> anxiety. This development and its consequences for the adult personality are what Horney calls neurosis.|$|R

5|$|Mugabe {{initially}} emphasised racial {{reconciliation and}} he was keen to build {{a good relationship with}} white Zimbabweans. He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> fears that he would nationalise white-owned property. He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government, met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity. With the end of the war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved {{during the early years of}} Mugabe's regime. In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|The Second Constitutional Settlement was {{completed}} in part <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> confusion and formalize Augustus' legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general imperium proconsulare, or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus' proconsular imperium into imperium proconsulare maius, or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire. Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13BC.|$|E
5|$|Gromyko and Harriman debated how states {{not universally}} {{recognized}} (e.g., East Germany and China) could join the agreement. The US proposed asserting that accession {{to the treaty}} would not indicate international recognition. This {{was rejected by the}} Soviet Union. Eventually, with Kennedy's approval, US envoys Fisher and McNaughton devised a system whereby multiple government would serve as depositaries for the treaty, allowing individual states to sign only the agreement held by the government of their choice in association with other like-minded states. This solution, which overcame one of the more challenging roadblocks in the negotiations, also served <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> mounting concerns from Macmillan, which were relayed to Washington, that an agreement would once again be derailed. Finally, in an original Soviet draft, the signature of France would have been required for the treaty to come into effect. At Harriman's insistence, this requirement was removed.|$|E

5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. <b>To</b> <b>allay</b> any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The School of International and Public Affairs extends {{invitations to}} {{heads of state}} and heads of {{government}} who come to New York City {{for the opening of}} the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum. The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President Lee C. Bollinger tried <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased {{with the fact that the}} Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus. Columbia students, though, turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{adoption}} {{of an official}} language for the Indian Republic was a hotly debated issue during the framing of the Indian Constitution after India's independence from the United Kingdom. After an exhaustive and divisive debate, Hindi was adopted as the official language of India with English continuing as an associate official language {{for a period of}} fifteen years, after which Hindi would become the sole official language. The new Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were not acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi. <b>To</b> <b>allay</b> their fears, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their skepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations.|$|E

5|$|A similar episode {{however in}} 1644 had an entirely {{different}} outcome: on 28 September, the Knights of Malta attacked an Ottoman convoy on its way from Constantinople to Alexandria, aboard which {{were a number of}} pilgrims bound for Mecca, including the exiled Kızlar Ağa (Chief Black Eunuch) Sünbül Ağa, the kadi of Cairo and the nurse of the future sultan Mehmed IV. During the fight, Sünbül Ağa and most of the important pilgrims were slain, while 350 men and 30 women were taken to be sold as slaves. The Knights loaded their loot on a ship, which then docked at a small harbor on the southern coast of Crete for a few days, where it disembarked a number of sailors and slaves. The Ottomans were enraged at the incident, and the Porte accused the Venetians of deliberate collusion with the Knights, something the Venetians vehemently denied. With the hawkish party being then dominant in the Ottoman court, the incident was seen as a perfect pretext for war with a weakened Venice. Despite a long period of negotiations, which lasted until well into 1645, and against the objections of the Grand Vizier Sultanzade Mehmed Pasha, war was decided upon. An expedition was quickly assembled with over 50,000 troops and reputedly 416 vessels, under Kapudan Pasha Silahdar Yusuf Pasha, the Sultan's son-in-law. The Ottoman armada sailed from the Dardanelles on 30 April, heading towards the harbor of Navarino in the Peloponnese, where it remained for three weeks. The fleet's target was not announced, but the Ottomans, <b>to</b> <b>allay</b> Venetian fears, implied that it would be Malta.|$|E

40|$|Parental {{presence}} at induction of anaesthesia is controversial and of disputed value. Ninety out of 117 parents replied to a preoperative questionnaire designed {{to identify their}} preference and motivation with regard to accompanying {{their children to the}} anaesthetic room. Half the parents wished to be present at induction, irrespective of the child's age or previous surgical experience and the most commonly cited reasons for this were the child's anxiety or the parents' sense of duty; 32 % of these parents changed their preference if their child were to be adequately sedated preoperatively. In addition, 18 % of all parents felt that they would prefer not to be present at induction. The results suggest that in circumstances where parents are to be excluded from induction, adequate preoperative explanation and sedative premedication would contribute <b>to</b> <b>allaying</b> parental anxiety, but that a flexible policy may be most appropriate...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] publication of two high-level reports {{on the state of}} the Humanities in South Africa in recent months 1, 2 is in itself a historic event. If scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) had been concerned about the lack of appreciation and recognition by the government and senior decision-makers in the science system for their fields and disciplines, just the fact that these reports have been commissioned and published should go some way <b>to</b> <b>allaying</b> any fears of their imminent ‘demise’. But of course the rationale behind these two studies is to be found in more serious concerns by scholars in these fields: that there are systematic biases in the national science and higher education system which explicitly (and sometimes not so explicitly) constrain, weaken and disadvantage the HSS. These concerns relate to matters of funding, publication support, expenditure on R&D, reward systems and many other key components of these systems. Publishers' versio...|$|R
