Having fled to the Portuguese capital via Spain, Rezala made {{a phone call to}} his girlfriend from a public call box – unaware that investigators in France had <b>tapped</b> <b>her</b> phone. On January 11, 2000, Rezala's hiding place was snuffed out by Portuguese police, who arrested the man in Barreiro, south of Lisbon. He had been staying in Almada with friends of a Spanish acquaintance and was planning to leave within 24 hours for Spain's Canary Islands.|$|E

Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Nanking Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|After graduation, Buchanan {{became a}} {{principal}} {{at a public}} high school, in the Houghton school in Detroit. In 1870, she moved to Chicago {{to pursue a career}} in journalism. Her reception by the Chicago editors was anything but favorable. Her youth and sex, they told her frankly, were against her. It was some time, therefore, before she received a position on any of the Chicago dailies. During the time when she was without regular work, she wrote continuously, sending her stories to the various papers. Her manuscripts, as a rule, were accepted but the acceptances brought her no staff position. The editors refused consistently to take a woman on their papers. The first story which she had accepted was an account of the reception at Sacred Heart Convent, where she boarded during her first years in Chicago. She took the story to the offices of the Chicago Times and laid it on the desk of the managing editor. He picked it up, glanced at it and gave Sullivan US$5. A few days later, as she was walking down Madison Avenue, some one <b>tapped</b> <b>her</b> on the shoulder. It was the editor of the Times. “I am sorry, Miss Buchanan, that I did not read your article before I paid you. It was extremely well written and worth more than five dollars.” At that, he handed her a $10 bill. Margaret Buchanan was 20 {{years old at the time}} and bore a striking resemblance to Rosa Bonheur.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Norwood {{introduced}} her rap alter ego Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009), {{the result of}} artistic experimentation with the musician, who had <b>tapped</b> <b>her</b> for her rhyming ability after seeing a video on YouTube that Norwood had uploaded and showed her rapping freestyle. Norwood, who had initially thought of rapping as a hobby and fun for friends, felt encouraged by Timbaland to write and perform her own verses on at least three tracks for his album, two of which eventually {{made it to the}} track lisiting. In December 2009, the producer revealed his intentions to reteam with her on her next project, producing the bulk of an album that he envisioned to be “half singing, half rapping”. Norwood confirmed his idea in an interview she held at the release party of Shock Value II: [...] "What I'm doing on the [...] album is a little bit different than what everybody knows me for. Timbaland endorsed that [...] He really gave me a shot to be different and be versatile. I can't thank him enough for that. This is a wonderful opportunity." [...] Though Norwood went on to record several other rap songs the following months and hoped it would eventually lead to a signing with Timbaland's Mosley Music Group, plans for hip hop-oriented album under his imprint were eventually abandoned as the singer felt the sound would not aim at her core audience. Approached on the subject, she later dismissed the idea of recording a rap album, stating that “it was a hobby. I was convinced to do it professionally, which I never should have listened to that advice.” ...|$|E
