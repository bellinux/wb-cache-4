This cognitive thought propels further anxiety which compounds with further stuttering, sweating, and, potentially, a panic attack.|$|E

Participants were also asked about <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the issues at level crossings, and how predictable are trains arriving at crossings in their area. Knowing the times when trains are present at crossings is a known contributing factor to crashes at crossings, which can also be correlated with <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> {{the usefulness of the}} system.|$|R

In one study, researchers had one group of participants list all factors that influenced their chances of experiencing a variety of events, and then a second group read the list. Those who read the list showed less optimistic bias in their own reports. It's possible that greater knowledge about others and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> their chances of risk bring the comparison group closer to the participant.|$|E

Nichiren Shoshu Soka Gakkai was no longer considered a lay group, or hokkekō, of Shōshū, and its leaders, including Ikeda, were expelled. The priest also used Ikeda’s reverence of the Ode to Joy and his promotion of its performance, Ninth Symphony as evidence for non-Buddhist teachings.|$|E

50|$|Students’ {{race and}} {{ethnicity}} can have an influence on <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the school’s climate. For instance, a study collected information from African American and white middle school students found differences in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> racial climate in their school. Therefore, African American, female, and lower income students have a more negative <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the racial climate than white, middle class, and male students. Another study also conducted with middle school students found that students from a Hispanic/Latino background felt that relationships with teachers played a bigger role in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> community climate than relationships with students.

25|$|When {{individuals}} assimilate new information, they incorporate it into {{an already}} existing framework without changing that framework. This may occur when individuals' experiences are aligned with their internal representations of the world, but may also occur as a failure to change a faulty understanding; for example, they may not notice events, may misunderstand input from others, or may decide that an event is a fluke and is therefore unimportant as information about the world. In contrast, when individuals' experiences contradict their internal representations, they may change <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the experiences to fit their internal representations.|$|E

500|$|Language and {{linguistic}} barriers {{are a major}} theme in The Word for World Is Forest, something exemplified by the title. In contrast to other Hainish universe novels such as The Left Hand of Darkness, The Word for World Is Forest portrays a communication gap that the protagonists are never able to bridge. Both the native Athsheans and the loggers have languages that reflect <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> reality, but {{they are unable to}} find a common language. In the native Athshean language, the word [...] "Athshe" [...] means both [...] "forest" [...] and [...] "world", demonstrating the close link that the Athsheans have to the forest and their planet. It is noted by Lyubov that the Athsheans believe [...] "the substance of their world was not earth, but forest". The language used by the Athsheans during conversations similarly show their interconnectedness and dependence on their ecosystem through the use of forest related metaphors.|$|E

500|$|Scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout cites [...] "The Couple" [...] as {{an example}} of Angelou's {{practice}} of subtly including more than one level of meaning in her poems, of her ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse, and her placement of themes of racism and liberation. [...] Angelou combines liberation ideology and poetic technique to challenge society's concepts of gender identity, especially in how it affects women. [...] She varies the length of the poem's lines, beginning in the first stanza and continuing throughout the poem, to convey ambiguity and doubt, and to demand that the reader question <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> gender and power. [...] "The Couple", starting in its second stanza, attacks class-based ideals of masculinity in society. [...] The poem ends by demanding that the social constructs surrounding gender and class end, and insists that human survival depends upon recognizing shared emotions and experience, regardless of one's gender or position in society.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{the most}} {{significant}} factor was the fighting qualities of the Japanese soldier. One Australian veteran, Sergeant Charles Lemaire, who had previously fought against the Germans at El Alamein with the 2/17th Infantry Battalion, described the Japanese as [...] "tenacious, brave, self-sacrificing". In {{the minds of the}} Australian soldiers, the Japanese had a reputation for being tough opponents and for not taking prisoners. Despite this perception amongst the Australians, {{there was a sense of}} confidence in their technological superiority. For the Japanese soldiers, the technological edge that the Australians possessed and their relatively abundant supply of ammunition and artillery and air support was the main psychological factor that governed <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the Australians as enemy. In order to counter this, Japanese commanders exhorted their troops to draw upon [...] "spiritual strength" [...] to achieve victory. In the end, although many of the significant actions of the campaign were infantry engagements which occurred a long way from the Australian base areas where their technological superiority was limited, the Australians' use of combined arms tactics ultimately proved decisive. Although preliminary aerial bombardment, particularly that which was employed around Sattelberg, proved largely ineffective in terms of its physical effects, it did serve to reduce Japanese morale. Used in combination with artillery preparation, which caused significant casualties, considerable disruption was caused to Japanese lines of communications that were already stretched. Suffering from ammunition shortages that limited their fire support, the Japanese defenders were overwhelmed by Australian infantry that had a level of artillery support that was unprecedented for an Australian division in the Pacific, and who advanced in concert with tanks that they employed in a manner that exploited the element of surprise.|$|E

[...] Authors Lynch and Armeli wrote that [...] "fewer companies today than in the past implicitly guarantee long-term employment, provide generous pay increments and comprehensive health benefits, or subsidize general education courses." [...] Examples like these are possible sources for reciprocation wariness to bloom amongst employees, potentially lowering <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> organizational support.|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Elizabeth II's {{presence}} at The Pas, Manitoba, {{provided an opportunity}} for the Opaskwayak Cree Nation to publicly express <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> injustice meted out by the government. Then, during a royal tour by the Queen in 1973, Harold Cardinal delivered a politically charged speech to the monarch and the Queen responded, stating that [...] "her government recognized the importance of full compliance with the spirit and intent of treaties"; the whole exchange had been pre-arranged between the two. Still, during the same tour, Aboriginal people were not always granted the personal time with the Queen that they desired; the meetings with First Nations and Inuit tended to be purely ceremonial affairs wherein treaty issues were not officially discussed. For instance, when Queen Elizabeth arrived in Stoney Creek, Ontario, five chiefs in full feathered headdress and a cortege of 20 s and their consorts came to present to her a letter outlining their grievances, but were prevented by officials from meeting with the sovereign. In 1976, the Queen did receive First Nations delegations at Buckingham Palace, such as the group of Alberta Aboriginal Chiefs who, along with Lieutenant Governor of Alberta and Cree chief Ralph Steinhauer, held audience with the monarch there.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} information exchange patterns between 98 married couples in Israel where {{one is a}} cancer patient {{and the other is}} the main caregiver. Specifically, the accuracy <b>of</b> each spouse's <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the extent of knowledge and the need to receive more disease-related information is examined {{as a function of the}} role (patient-caregiver) and gender of the participants. The results showed that women, regardless of their role, were inaccurate in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> husbands' knowledge and motivation to know more. For men, a difference between the roles was found for the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wives' knowledge.

Moreover, female patients, more than male, relied on <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> themselves when assessing their spouse's knowledge and informational needs.
