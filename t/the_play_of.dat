5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War began, Bax {{moved to}} Sussex, taking up {{residence}} at the White Horse Hotel, Storrington, where he lived {{for the rest of}} his life. He abandoned composition and completed a book of memoirs about his early years, Farewell, My Youth. The Times found it at times waspish, at times reticent, surprising in parts, and regrettably short. Later in the war Bax was persuaded to contribute incidental music for a short film, Malta G. C.; he subsequently wrote music for David Lean's Oliver Twist (1948) and a second short film, Journey into History (1952). His other works from the period include the short Morning Song for piano and orchestra, and the Left-Hand Concertante (1949), both written for Cohen. Bax and the Poet Laureate, John Masefield, worked on a pageant, <b>The</b> <b>Play</b> <b>of</b> Saint George in 1947, but the project was not completed.|$|E
5|$|At Everton, Johnson {{was part}} of a forward line spearheaded by record-breaking goalscorer Dixie Dean. In Johnson's first full season Everton won the Second Division Championship, and in his second the club won the First Division, {{becoming}} the English champions. The following season Everton reached the 1933 FA Cup Final, where Johnson faced his former club Manchester City. Everton were comfortable victors, winning 3–0, and seven years after suffering defeat in an FA Cup final Johnson gained a winners medal. Accounts of the match suggest Johnson had a quiet game, with reports focusing on <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> Dixie Dean and Cliff Britton. The final was the first to use shirt numbers to identify the players, Johnson becoming the competition's first number 10. During his Everton career Johnson won a further three England caps. Johnson scored twice in a 7–1 victory over Spain in 1931. John William Smith and Sammy Crooks also scored braces while Dixie Dean scored the other goal.|$|E

5|$|Blackrock is a 1997 Australian drama thriller film {{directed}} by Steven Vidler and written by Nick Enright. Marking Vidler's directorial debut, {{the film was}} adapted from <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> the same name, also written by Enright, which {{was inspired by the}} murder of Leigh Leigh. The film stars Laurence Breuls, Simon Lyndon and Linda Cropper, and also features the first credited film performance of Heath Ledger. The film follows Jared (Breuls), a young surfer who witnesses his friends raping a girl. When she is found murdered the next day, Jared is torn between revealing what he saw and protecting his friends.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1891 season, both Crosby and John A. Hartwell, {{the other}} {{starting}} end, who later followed Crosby as Navy football coach, {{were injured in}} a game. While observing a team practice, Hartwell and Crosby noticed <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> backup end Frank Hinkey. After watching Hinkey for a time, Hartwell {{decided to return to}} practicing for fear of losing his starting position; Crosby did not consider this necessary. By the next game, Hinkey had replaced Crosby as the starting end and he did not regain the position. The team finished the season with a perfect record and would be retrospectively named national champions. Crosby remained popular through his senior year at the university, {{and he was one of}} three graduates presented with a class award. Upon graduation from the school, Crosby enrolled in New York Law School and joined a law office in New York City.|$|E

5|$|In the 12th {{inning of}} a tied game on July 1, 2004, against their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, Trot Nixon hit a pop fly down the left field line. Jeter ran from his {{position}} at shortstop and made an over-the-shoulder catch. He launched himself over the third-base side railing and two rows of seats, receiving a lacerated chin and bruised face. The Yankees {{went on to win}} the game in the bottom of the 13th inning. This was voted <b>the</b> <b>Play</b> <b>of</b> the Year in the This Year in Baseball Awards competition, as voted on by fans at MLB.com. Following the 2004 season, Jeter was presented with his first Gold Glove Award; his diving catch on July 1 was cited as a reason for the award. Though Jeter was fourth among shortstops in fielding percentage and errors, two traditional fielding statistics, critics pointed to his lower ratings in the more advanced sabermetric statistics, such as range factor and ultimate zone rating (UZR).|$|E

5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E

5|$|The Tigers {{won their}} next two games before losing {{four in a}} row, but {{remained}} competitive in every game, largely due to <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> Cannon and Taylor. LSU completed {{the season with a}} win over their rival team Tulane and a 5–5 record, although they had been predicted to finish last in their conference. At the end of the season, Cannon was included on the Associated Press (AP) Southeastern Conference (SEC) All-Sophomore team and the United Press International (UPI) All-SEC second team. He also had the leading kickoff return average in the country (31.2 yards).|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> agency.|$|E
5|$|The pre-game buildup focused {{primarily}} on the strong rushing attacks of both teams {{as well as the}} overall sound offense of Fresno State. Most analysts predicted a resounding victory by Fresno State. The point spread favored Fresno State as 12-point favorites over the Mustangs. Contrary to predictions, SMU won the game by a score of 43-10, largely thanks to <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>of</b> defensive end Margus Hunt, who forced two fumbles and totaled three sacks (including one safety) as well as two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. Consequently, Hunt and Fresno State's Davante Adams, who totaled 13 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, were named the game's co-Most Valuable Player (MVP).|$|E
