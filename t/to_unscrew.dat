25|$|The {{skill to}} be learned is broken down into small units for easy {{learning}}. For example, a person learning to brush teeth independently may start with learning <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> the toothpaste cap. Once they have learned this, the next step may be squeezing the tube, etc.|$|E
25|$|Projecting to {{the rear}} was a {{one-piece}} wire stock made from a formed steel rod that telescoped into tubes {{on both sides of}} the receiver. Both ends of the stock were tapped and drilled so that it could be used as a cleaning rod. It could also be used as a disassembly tool or as a wrench used <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> the barrel cap.|$|E
500|$|Thunder II {{would look}} attentively with his ears forward, {{seemingly}} on cue, for his picture {{to be taken}} whenever a photographer pointed a camera at him. He is known for being people-friendly and particularly gentle with children who became acquainted with him prior to each game. Instead of watching players on the field the way Thunder Sr. did, Thunder II liked to observe {{the people in the}} stands. When bored, he has entertained himself by grabbing the zipper pulls of his handlers' jackets and running them up and down. [...] He also learned how <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> water bottles and squeeze them to get water. Officially retired in 2014, Thunder II occasionally makes public appearances.|$|E

500|$|Elsewhere in the museum, {{they stole}} five Degas {{drawings}} and an eagle finial. The finial {{lay at the}} top of a Napoleonic flag, which they attempted <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> from the wall, but failed. Manet's Chez Tortoni was also stolen from its location in the Blue Room. Motion detector records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12:27a.m. and again at 12:53a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol. The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W. Grindle's chair near the front desk. The thieves made two trips to their car with artwork during the theft, which lasted 81 minutes. Before leaving, they visited the guards once more, telling them [...] "You’ll be hearing from us in about a year," [...] although they were never heard from again. The guards remained handcuffed until police arrived at 8:15a.m. later that morning.|$|E

2500|$|Jeepster dropped Snow Patrol in 2001, a {{decision}} that was criticised by Hot Press magazine as brainless. By July 2001, many major labels had started showing interest in Snow Patrol, but the band were cash-strapped and had no record deal. Lightbody sold {{a major part of}} his record collection to raise money to keep the band going. Lightbody calls the time [...] "miserable", but was confident of getting signed to another label quickly. However, the music scene in the United Kingdom had turned its attention to American bands and British bands were not getting signed. The band spent this time constantly writing songs. Lightbody, bored at this point, assembled The Reindeer Section, a Scottish supergroup, and found a record label to release the group's recordings. Quinn said that though the time was hard for everyone involved except for Nathan, the question of splitting up never arose. It was during this time the band wrote [...] "Run" [...] (which had been around since 2000) in a room on an acoustic guitar, which later became the band's breakthrough single. The band's [...] "low point" [...] came when they played a concert to 18 people at a popular strip club in High Wycombe. The show took place in a shoddy VIP area, and the management had <b>to</b> <b>unscrew</b> poles used by pole dancers to make space for the band to play, something that Gary would later joke about whilst performing at a sold out Wembley Arena. Quinn calls the show [...] "horrendous". Desperate for attention, the band raised £200 to nominate themselves for a Mercury Prize, but failed to get shortlisted.|$|E
60|$|To obtain Fire {{from the}} Sun.--Burning-glasses.--The object-glass, {{and every other}} convex glass of a {{telescope}} is a burning-glass, and has only <b>to</b> be <b>unscrewed</b> <b>to</b> be fit for use. The object lenses of an opera-glass are very efficient. The larger the glass and the shorter its focus, the greater is its heating power. Convex spectacle glasses and eye glasses are too small and of too long a focus {{to be used with}} effect, except when the sun is very hot. An old-fashioned watch-glass, filled with water, and having the rays of a powerful sun glittered down upon it vertically by help of a mirror, will give a light. Dr. Kane and other arctic travellers have made burning-glasses of ice.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} brands, {{including}} Quickfit, have begun using threaded connections for hose barbs. This allows the barb <b>to</b> be <b>unscrewed</b> from the glassware, the hose pushed {{on and the}} setup screwed back together. This helps avoid accidentally breaking the glass and potentially doing serious harm to the chemist, as will sometimes occur when pushing the hoses directly onto the glass.|$|R

30|$|To {{assess the}} biomechanical {{strength}} of the bone-implant interface, the following parameters were assessed: (a) maximum removal torque (N cm) (primary outcome measure), obtained during the unscrewing process (primary outcome measure); (b) connection stiffness (N cm/rad), corresponding to the ratio between removal torque and angular displacement (secondary outcome measure); and (c) removal energy (×[*] 10 – 2  J), corresponding to the energy (workload) necessary <b>to</b> completely <b>unscrew</b> the implant (secondary outcome measure).|$|R
50|$|Analog diving watches {{must have}} a water {{resistant}} crown. Some models have the crown mounted in unconventional positions like 4, 8 or 9 o'clock to avert or reduce discomfort from the crown touching the wearers (left) wrist or back of the hand. Often the crown has <b>to</b> be <b>unscrewed</b> <b>to</b> set or adjust the time and date and afterwards retightened to restore the water resistance of the watch and minimize the chance of unintentional operation under water. There are also watch models where a locking handle, separate knob or an extra crown cover has to be manipulated before the crown can be operated. There are however models that have crowns that are operated like the crowns of non diver's analog watches. Screw down or otherwise locking crowns and traditionally operated water resistant crowns can not be operated under water.|$|R
50|$|Tools, such as hooks or socket {{wrenches}} can be mounted {{at the end}} of the pole. More sophisticated poles can accept pneumatically or hydraulically driven power tools which allow, for example, bolts <b>to</b> be <b>unscrewed</b> remotely. A rotary wire brush allows a terminal to be scoured clean before a connection is made. However, a worker's dexterity is naturally reduced when operating tools {{at the end of}} a pole that is several metres long.|$|R
