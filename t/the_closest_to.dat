Graves, who {{was standing}} <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> Slotin, also developed acute radiation sickness and was hospitalized for several weeks. He survived, although he lived with chronic neurological and vision problems. Young also suffered from acute radiation syndrome, but recovered. By 28 January 1948 Graves, Kline and Perlman sought compensation for damages suffered during the incident. Graves settled his claim for $3,500.|$|E

Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the lessons of the war.|$|E

U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing {{since the end of}} World War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division was <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the warzone. Under the command of Major General William F. Dean, the division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. In spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial shock of the North Korean advances until the rest of the Eighth United States Army could arrive and establish a defense.|$|E
5|$|Since {{playing their}} first {{competitive}} match, 900 players {{have appeared in}} competitive first-team matches for the club, {{many of whom have}} played between 25 and 99 matches (including substitute appearances). Carlos Tevez fell one short of 100 appearances for Manchester United, scoring 34 goals in those matches, since he joined the club as a free agent in the summer of 2007. Billy Whelan, George Perrins, Arnold Mühren and Diego Forlán all played 98 matches in all competitions for Manchester United. Darren Ferguson, Jesper Blomqvist and Owen Hargreaves are among the former players who have been awarded league winners medals. Of the players still at the club, English midfielder Jesse Lingard is <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> 100 appearances; he has played in 99 matches for Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers’ {{record for}} {{consecutive}} games {{lost in a}} single season would be surpassed twice; by the 2001 Carolina Panthers, who lost fifteen consecutive games after winning their opener, and the 2008 Detroit Lions, the only winless team to have done so in a 16-game schedule. Ten NFL teams since the 1976 Buccaneers have lost 15 or 16 games in a season, but the Buccaneers’ 26-game losing streak from 1976 to 1977 still stands as the longest in modern NFL history. The aforementioned Detroit Lions have come <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> matching the Buccaneers' losing streak, having lost 19 consecutive games between 2007 until finally winning in week 3 of the 2009 season.|$|E

5|$|The chain can {{be divided}} into three subsections. The first, the Hawaiian {{archipelago}} (also known as the Windward isles), consists of the islands comprising the U.S. state of Hawaii (not {{to be confused with the}} island of Hawaii). As it is <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the hotspot, this volcanically active region is the youngest part of the chain, with ages ranging from 400,000 years to 5.1million years. The island of Hawaii is comprised by five volcanoes, of which two (Kilauea and Mauna Loa) are still active. Lōihi Seamount continues to grow offshore, and is the only known volcano in the chain in the submarine pre-shield stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E

Although the units went off scale after 8.5 seconds at Gifu and 13.5 seconds at Nagoya (probably due to an inundation of large S-waves) the seismograms they produced have been beneficial for seismologists to develop an understanding of the fault rupture process. The records from the stations at Gifu and Nagoya were especially useful as they were <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the fault zone.|$|E

5|$|The {{full-time}} side at {{the west}} end of the mezzanine has three street stairs. One leads to the northeast corner of Queens Boulevard and 59th Avenue, <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the mall. The other two staircases are through a long passageway to both southern corners of Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard, acting as a pedestrian underpass outside of fare control. These staircases date back to the station's original opening. There is an entrance to the southeast corner of Woodhaven and Queens Boulevards that, {{as a result of the}} construction of the Long Island Expressway in the mid-1950s, leads only to two entrance ramps to the expressway, with no continuous sidewalk leading to the entrance.|$|E
5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of cards are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip value, while tens and court cards count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23) is a {{business}} loop that runs through downtown Rogers City on two-lane streets. The highway starts at an intersection with US23 in Belknap Township south of downtown and passes the location of Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company's quarry on Petersville Road, the largest such quarry in the world. Farther north, the business loop passes {{the eastern end of}} the Rogers City Airport and turns northwesterly, parallel to, but inland from, the Lake Huron shoreline. Now following 3rd Street, Bus. US23 runs through a residential area on the southern side of town before entering downtown. At the intersection with Erie Street, Bus. US23 meets the eastern terminus of M-68. Four blocks later, the business loop comes <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> Lake Huron in another residential area before turning to the west. Anorther five blocks to the west of this curve, Bus. US23 terminates at an intersection with US23 on {{the western edge of the}} city. The business route carries the section of the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT) through Rogers City.|$|E

5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the top of the embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Lindwall came <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> a hat-trick in {{his entire}} Test career. He {{finished}} England's innings by clean bowling three batsmen in four deliveries, with the unsuccessful ball barely missing Doug Wright's stumps to end with 4/52. Lindwall took the last four wickets in two overs, conceding two runs. He took 2/60 and scored 20 in another drawn match. Lindwall came into the final Test on his home ground in Sydney with a match haul of 10/73 in a Shield match. He continued his productive series with 7/63 in the first innings on a flat pitch, managing to generate enough pace to knock the bat out of Denis Compton's hands. Lindwall took two further wickets in the second innings as Australia took a 3–0 series win with another innings victory. Lindwall topped the bowling averages on either side with 18 wickets at 20.38, {{in addition to his}} 160 runs at 32.00.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-final {{match against}} {{eventual}} champions France, Baggio came on {{as a substitute}} for Del Piero in the second half, and managed to create some scoring opportunities. The score remained 0–0, and the match went to extra time, although Baggio came <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> scoring the golden goal, with a volley from a lobbed pass by Albertini, but his shot was put just wide of Fabian Barthez's far post. The match eventually went to a penalty shootout. Although Baggio converted his penalty, the shootout was won by the host nation, as Italy were eliminated on penalties in a World Cup for the third consecutive time. Italy's coach, was criticised for starting the recovering Del Piero ahead of Baggio, and for not allowing the two players to play alongside each other. Despite rumours that the substitutions had created a rivalry between the players, Baggio and Del Piero remain friends. Baggio stated in 2008 that he has great respect for Del Piero, and that there had never been disagreements between them. Del Piero in turn stated in 2011 that Baggio, along with Zinedine Zidane, was the best player with whom he had ever played.|$|E
