5|$|Lingerie model Emily Diamond {{has a role}} as {{a prostitute}} who teases Jory Cassel during the visit to the brothel.

Also appearing in this episode is the casting team's Robert Sterne, who reprises his cameo role as a page in King's Landing.|$|E
5|$|Wise {{was born}} in 1884 to Sophie Hasel and her husband, farmers in Hardscrabble, a town in Medina County, Ohio. Three {{brothers}} and a sister were also born to the family, although contemporary sources name only one, a brother named Fred.

5|$|Candace {{discovers the}} boy's circus and has {{set out to}} tell their mother, Linda, when Jeremy, a boy who has romantic {{feelings}} for her, stops by <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> basket of plants. Unfortunately they include some wild parsnips, which give Candace an allergic reaction: to hide her hives and deep, scratchy voice she dons a sweatsuit and a paper bag {{before going to the}} mall to tell Linda about the boys' plans, and then sings E.V.I.L. B.O.Y.S. where Linda, Vivian Garcia-Shapiro, and Jeremy's mom are.|$|E

5|$|The Phoenix Zoo {{garnered}} worldwide {{attention for}} one of its animals, an Asian elephant named Ruby. Ruby came to the zoo in 1973, just months after being born in Thailand. After noticing Ruby doodling in the sand with sticks, her keeper decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> brush and paint. Ruby quickly became known for her paintings, whose sales raised over US$200,000 for the zoo. Art collectors {{all over the world}} joined 18-month waiting lists and paid hundreds of dollars for original prints.|$|E
5|$|With the 1979 {{municipal}} elections occurring only {{months after the}} riot, prominent gay leaders feared a backlash at the polls. The elections continued without incident, and the gay community fared better than expected, wielding unprecedented influence. Although the virtually unknown gay Mayoral candidate David Scott {{finished third in the}} election, his showing was strong enough to force Mayor Feinstein into a runoff election against conservative City Supervisor Quentin Kopp. Feinstein's promises to appoint more gay people to public office, and her heavy campaigning in the Castro, ensured that she won enough support from the gay community <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> full term as Mayor.|$|E

Becky claims to have been with Steve {{on the night of}} her rampage and blackmails him <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> false alibi, threatening to tell his partner Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) about their one-night stand.|$|E

60|$|However, it was {{possible}} that Curll wished <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> opening, for no sooner were the ladies settled at work than he bowed himself forward and offered his mistress his copy of the letter.|$|R
5|$|Chip Diller {{gets into}} a fight with the other Pi Sigs, and Veronica gets involved. However, Veronica is pulled away by a {{security}} guard hired by Logan.

5|$|In 2011, Madison Rayne {{would start}} a rivalry with Mickie James over the Knockouts Championship, and would {{successfully}} defend the title against her at Genesis and Against All Odds, after Tara interfered in both matches. During the feud, Tara began claiming that Rayne {{had gone too}} far in her brutality towards Mickie James, but was forced to follow her orders due to being under exclusive contract with her, and not TNA. After Rayne lost the Knockouts Championship to James at Lockdown, James agreed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> rematch on the condition that if she is unable to regain the title, Tara would be released from her contract with Rayne. On May 15 at Sacrifice, Tara became a fan favorite after knocking out Rayne during her match with James, costing her the Knockouts Championship and guaranteeing herself a release from her contract with Rayne.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may {{be inferred from}} the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. No proof of a formal agreement exists, and the evidence is {{based solely on the}} joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> false sense of security while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
50|$|One of its habitués, Charles de Sainte-Maure, marquis de Montausier (1610-1690), {{had been}} in love since 1631 with Julie d'Angennes (1606-1671), the {{daughter}} of the marquis and marquise de Rambouillet.

60|$|Here Peter stopped, {{nor could}} all Margery's {{questions}} induce him {{to complete the}} sentence. His gaze at the earnest countenance of the bride was such as <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> indefinite sort of uneasiness, not to say a feeling of alarm.|$|R
60|$|She {{allowed him}} {{to pass through the}} gate, which he shut slowly, perhaps <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} of speaking, if she wished to do so; then thinking that he did not see her she spoke in her soft, musical voice.|$|R
5|$|While in prison, Jack is {{contacted}} by Henry Turner, {{the son of}} Will and Elizabeth, to seek his aid in finding the Trident of Poseidon. Remembering Elizabeth and Will from his previous misadventures, Jack agrees but not before expressing some hesitation. The next day, Sparrow is sentenced to be executed by guillotine (by Jack's accidental choosing), but is rescued by Henry and his crew. Aided by aspiring astronomer Carina, Jack and Henry attempt to locate the Trident of Poseidon, as both {{are in need of}} its power to break curses related to the sea. Barbossa releases the Pearl from its bottle, giving them a chance to outrun Salazar. Jack and Barbossa discuss the fact that Carina is in truth Barbossa's long-lost daughter, whom he had left at an orphanage in order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> chance for a better life.

5|$|The main {{character}} designer for the game, Tetsuya Nomura, had also worked on both Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The Tsviets were designed {{with the idea}} of creating a sense of balance for the warriors with which players would already be familiar; primarily Vincent, Cloud Strife and Sephiroth. Nomura initially had doubts when designing Shelke's ordinary clothes {{for the end of the}} game, but he felt it was important for her to appear out of uniform so as to indicate she was truly free from Deepground. The character of G was based on the Japanese singer and actor Gackt, who wrote and performed the two theme songs of the game, and voiced G in the Japanese-language version of the game. Hideki Imaizumi, the producer of Crisis Core, liked the mysterious role of G so much, he decided to expand his character in that game. The character of Lucrecia Crescent, who features briefly in an optional quest in the original game, was redesigned so as <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> similar appearance to her son, Sephiroth, based on portraits from guidebooks and in fan-art. Reeve Tuesti was also redesigned, as he only appears briefly in the original game as himself rather than through Cait Sith.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{takes an}} {{interest}} in Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) but refuses to date him. Whitney applies for a new work experience at the local nursery which she later gets.

Whitney starts to feel smothered by Fatboy's affections. Lucy teases Tyler by telling him that Fatboy plans to publicly propose to Whitney, so Tyler tells Whitney he likes her but Whitney says it is too late. Tyler then surprises Whitney by kissing her.
