Behar had previously published an article on Scientology in Forbes magazine. He stated that he was investigated by attorneys and private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology while researching the Time article, and <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> contacted {{his friends and family}} as well. Behar's article covers topics including L. Ron Hubbard and the development of Scientology, its controversies over the years and history of litigation, conflict with psychiatry and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the suicide of Noah Lottick, its status as a religion, and its business dealings.|$|E

25|$|On July 27, The Hollywood Reporter {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> believed Houser {{chose to}} commit the shooting in a theater playing Trainwreck due to its feminist themes and characters, {{as well as its}} lead actor's Jewish background. Houser was said to have been a misogynist and praised the actions of Adolf Hitler on online message boards.|$|E
25|$|The body {{of another}} person was found at the crash site. It was so badly burned <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> could not tell if it {{was that of a}} man or a woman.

25|$|Grief {{turned to}} anger at TWA's delay in {{confirming}} the passenger list, conflicting information from agencies and officials, and mistrust {{of the recovery}} operation's priorities. Although NTSB vice chairman Robert Francis stated that all bodies were being retrieved {{as soon as they}} were spotted, and that wreckage was being recovered only if divers believed that victims were hidden underneath, many families were suspicious <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> were not being truthful, or withholding information.|$|E
25|$|The Stratocruiser {{had been}} {{carrying}} uncut diamonds in registered mail, then valued at over £1million, {{though it would}} be several days after the accident <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> had any hint of the cargo being carried.

The KLM Constellation that crashed near Prestwick six years earlier had also been carrying diamonds, then valued at over £5,000.|$|E
25|$|Birgenair Flight 301 was {{a flight}} {{chartered}} by Turkish-managed Birgenair partner Alas Nacionales from Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic to Frankfurt, Germany, via Gander, Canada, and Berlin, Germany. On 6 February 1996, the Boeing 757–225 operating the route crashed shortly after take-off from Puerto Plata's Gregorio Luperón International Airport. All 189 {{people on board}} died. The cause was a pitot tube <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> believe was blocked by a wasp nest that was built inside it. The aircraft had sat unused for two days without the pitot tube covers in place.|$|E

25|$|The Dallas Morning News {{reported}} on November 17 that ABC News, citing anonymous sources, reported <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> {{suspect that the}} shootings were triggered by superiors' refusal to process Hasan’s requests {{that some of his}} patients be prosecuted for war crimes based on statements they made during psychiatric sessions with him. Dallas attorney Patrick McLain, a former Marine, said that Hasan may have been legally justified in his request, but he could not comment without knowing what soldiers had said. Fellow psychiatrists complained to superiors that Hasan's actions violated doctor-patient confidentiality.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 2007, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> using a remotely controlled submarine found the ship's data recorder (VDR). In a struggle to protect the data, they secured it in a special sterilized bin and the authorities were to have transferred it to the United States in order to reveal the saved data, an action that only the manufacturer of the VDR can perform. The Greek Merchant Marine Ministry said the recorder could reveal details of {{the sinking of the}} ship which could be used in the prosecution of crew members.|$|E
25|$|By July 1969, as {{a result}} of the coordinated {{investigation}} into the killings, more than 1000 convicted sex offenders had been investigated and eliminated as suspects; over 800 tips from informants had been actively investigated; and several thousand individuals routinely interviewed. Although Washtenaw County Sheriff Douglas Harvey conceded at a press conference held that same month <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> had little physical evidence to act upon and that the perpetrator had yet to make a serious error, he was adamant the fact the murderer was still at large was due to pure luck, and not for lack of police effort.|$|E
30|$|Several myths {{have been}} {{associated}} with geometric shapes <b>that</b> cause <b>investigators</b> pause before using the shapes as descriptors. For example, one myth was <b>that</b> an <b>investigator</b> could determine the speed of the fire by looking at the width of the v-pattern. Another myth is that at the base of every v-pattern is an origin. These myths have been dispelled by several studies, but their influence on using the geometric shapes as descriptors has justifiably persisted (NFPA 2014; Shanley et al. 1997).|$|R
40|$|The Swedish Environmental Code {{states that}} certain {{potentially}} harmful activities {{must not be}} pursued without a permit.

The article also presents a newly made empirical study of whether and how arguments about investigator self-interest are considered and taken on board by Swedish environmental courts...|$|R
50|$|Both vessels {{left the}} Percy Isles on 4 October and Flinders spent several days {{looking for a}} passage through the reef, {{anchoring}} {{several times in the}} process. Investigator lost an anchor and Lady Nelson lost one and broke one arm off another. Flinders decided not to attempt any more narrow passages through the reef and resumed the voyage towards Torres Strait and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Flinders provided Lady Nelson with two grapnels, which was all <b>that</b> <b>Investigator</b> could spare.|$|R
25|$|In October 2011, Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>investigators,</b> having obtained full DNA profiles {{from each}} of the unidentified victims, were to renew their efforts to identify all of them. At a press conference held to announce this intention, Sheriff Dart stated investigators are actively seeking DNA samples from individuals across the United States related to any male missing between 1970 and 1979. Test results thus far conducted have confirmed the identification of two victims, ruled out the possibility of numerous other missing youths as being victims of Gacy, and solved four unrelated cold cases dating between 1972 and 1979.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days after}} the murder, the Los Angeles Times ran an October 18, 2008, news brief noting that the bodies were {{identified}} on October 17. On November 3, the Sheriff's Department announced that it had four Marines under arrest for the murders. As part of the November 3 announcement, the Sheriff's Department noted <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> had found numerous items of evidence since October 15 linking the four to the killings, even though the killers set {{a fire in the}} house to destroy evidence. On November 6, CNN television news journalist Jane Velez-Mitchell reported that the four Marines under arrest were African American and raised the possibility of race as a motivation.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September 2011, {{a report}} in the {{newspaper}} Moskovsky Komsomolets, quoting a source in the aviation industry, claimed that the parking brake of the aircraft was on during the take-off, which significantly slowed it down and prevented it from accelerating properly. According to this theory, the captain had turned over control to the co-pilot before take-off, as he was not feeling well. As it is the captain's duty to release the brake, the co-pilot may not have been aware that it had not been done, or had forgotten to do so. Another newspaper, Lifenews.ru, reported <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> were investigating the pilots' professional history, and that the pilots did not have sufficient experience on the Yak-42.|$|E

25|$|On 21 November, {{the results}} of Chikatilo's blood test again {{revealed}} his blood type to be type A and not type AB. Due {{to the amount of}} physical and circumstantial evidence investigators had thus far compiled, which indicated Chikatilo was indeed the murderer they had been pursuing, plus the fact <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> had deduced the blood type of the murderer they had pursued using semen samples obtained from the clothing and bodies of 14 of the victims as opposed to actual blood samples, investigators obtained a sample of Chikatilo's semen to test his blood type, {{the results of}} which confirmed that Chikatilo's semen was type AB, whereas his blood and saliva were type A.|$|E
25|$|French police {{launched}} a massive manhunt for Sid Ahmed Rezala in December 1999 {{after the murder}} of British student Isabel Peake who was thrown from a train, and the subsequent killings of a 36-year-old French mother and a one-time girlfriend. Having fled to the Portuguese capital via Spain, Rezala made {{a phone call to}} his girlfriend from a public call box – unaware <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> in France had tapped her phone. On January 11, 2000, Rezala's hiding place was snuffed out by Portuguese police, who arrested the man in Barreiro, south of Lisbon. He had been staying in Almada with friends of a Spanish acquaintance and was planning to leave within 24 hours for Spain's Canary Islands.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day as Myers' report was made public, NASCAR {{announced}} its own investigation, after having remained silent for six weeks since the crash. The official NASCAR report, which had cost over a million dollars and was published on August 21, 2001, concluded that Earnhardt's death {{was the result of a}} combination of factors, which included the last-second collision with Schrader's car, the speed and angle of impact, and the separation of the seat belt as being contributing factors. It was also noted <b>that</b> <b>investigators</b> could not determine whether a head and neck support (HANS) device would have saved Earnhardt's life, and that airline-style black boxes would be mandated for all vehicles in order to better understand the forces at work in a crash such as Earnhardt's.|$|E
50|$|An inquiry {{has been}} ordered into the crash. There were several things <b>that</b> <b>investigator</b> probed as the {{probable}} {{cause of the}} accident, which are bird strike, in-flight structural failure, sabotage, in-flight fire, pilot incapacitation, mechanical failure, or pilot error. However, there were no evidence indicating a bird strike, pilot incapacitation, sabotage and an in-flight structural failure. All of them were ruled out. Investigators later ruled out in-flight fire {{as the cause of}} the accident, as the fire occurred on the flight was due to post-impact rather than a pre-impact fire.|$|R
