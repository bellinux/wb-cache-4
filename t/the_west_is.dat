5|$|At one time, {{the church}} on this site {{was used as a}} chapel of ease to Llantrisant church. In the 15th century, St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio, was built to serve as a chapel of ease for St Ceidio's. In 2006, one author noted that St Ceidio's had not been {{regularly}} used for some years, but restoration work had been carried out by local people. St Mary's, which is about 0.75miles (1.25km) to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>is</b> no longer used for services either, but is in ruins.|$|E

5|$|Coquitlam {{is served}} by two {{international}} airports. Vancouver International Airport, located on Sea Island {{in the city of}} Richmond to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>is</b> the second busiest in Canada and provides most of the air access to the region. Abbotsford International Airport, located to the east, is the sixth busiest airport in Canada. Nearby Pitt Meadows Airport provides services for smaller aircraft and there are also Boundary Bay Airport and Langley Airport for small aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Directly to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>is</b> the Hall of Mental Cultivation (N). Originally a minor palace, {{this became}} {{the de facto}} {{residence}} and office of the Emperor starting from Yongzheng. In the last decades of the Qing dynasty, empresses dowager, including Cixi, held court from the eastern partition of the hall. Located around the Hall of Mental Cultivation are {{the offices of the}} Grand Council and other key government bodies.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, {{in many areas}} of the city, due in part to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>is</b> one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outskirts}} of town to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>is</b> the 19th-century Sneaton Castle built by James Wilson who sold his sugar plantation where he had over 200 slaves and moved to Whitby. Alongside it is St Hilda's Priory, the mother house of the Order of the Holy Paraclete. The castle was used as a school and is now a conference centre and hotel in association with the priory.|$|E
5|$|Summer Hill's {{boundaries}} are Parramatta Road and Liverpool Road to the north, {{the rear of}} the properties {{on the west side of}} Prospect Road (with a detour around Trinity Grammar School) to the West, Old Canterbury Road to the south, and the Inner West Light Rail to the east.

5|$|The Khawalid {{brothers}} {{share an}} anti-West conservative ideology. They believe that <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>is</b> conspiring with Iran against Bahrain and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries and often accuse the United States of secretly supporting the Bahraini opposition. They are allied with Saudi Arabia and Sunni Islamist groups, and hold an anti-Shia ideology, viewing {{them as a}} fifth column to Iran. Based on their beliefs, the Khawalid brothers have pushed a security approach {{to deal with the}} Shia instead of political reforms, and have allegedly used sectarianism as a political tool.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge {{much of their}} moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rain forest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>is</b> drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.|$|E
5|$|The word Mahatma, while often {{mistaken for}} Gandhi's given name in <b>the</b> <b>West,</b> <b>is</b> {{taken from the}} Sanskrit words maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning Soul). Rabindranath Tagore {{is said to have}} accorded the title to Gandhi. In his autobiography, Gandhi {{nevertheless}} explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.|$|E

5|$|Herm is only 1½miles long (north-south) {{and less}} than half a mile wide (east-west). In the {{northern}} part of the island are two hills, Le Petit Monceau and Le Grande Monceau. To the north of these is a common, leading to Mouisonniere Beach on the northern coast, with Oyster Point in the northwestern corner and La Pointe du Gentilhomme or Alderney Point at the northeastern corner. To the east of the common is Shell Beach and to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>is</b> The Bear's Beach, leading down to the harbour. Half of the coastline of {{the northern part of the}} island is surrounded by sandy beaches; the southern half is rocky. Much of Herm's bedrock is granite. In 2008, Adrian Heyworth, who was at the time the island's tenant, said that two or three metres of sand were being lost annually at Alderney Point.|$|E
5|$|M-125 {{starts at}} the state line as the {{continuation}} of Detroit Avenue running northward from Toledo. Once across the state line, the roadway takes on the Dixie Highway name and passes a residential subdivision. The highway runs north-northeasterly roughly parallel with, and between, both US24 and I-75 through farm land in rural Monroe County. The trunkline passes through the community of Erie before intersecting with Conn. M-125 (Summit Street) north of town. That unsigned connector is a state highway that links M-125 with I-75 to the south. Continuing north, M-125 intersects Luna Pier Road, which to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>is</b> the unsigned Conn. US24 that offers a path to US24 (Telegraph Road).|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the surface}} of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery. Pumice Valley, {{directly}} to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>is</b> covered by sagebrush scrubland. The soil consists primarily of deep pumice, which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain. Mule deer, coyotes, black bears, yellow-bellied marmots, raccoons and mountain lions all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono–Inyo craters.|$|E

5000|$|In the 16th century it {{was once}} again rebuilt. <b>The</b> <b>west</b> wall and zwinger were roofed over and became a three story palas. [...] The old gate in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>was</b> walled up and a new one was added in the south wall. <b>The</b> <b>west</b> wall <b>was</b> {{extended}} northward to protect the castle's flank.(Bauphase 4) ...|$|R

5|$|On its route southwards, {{the river}} passes the former {{junction}} with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed {{to join the}} Arram Beck. The Leven Canal used to join on the east bank, but the entrance lock {{has been replaced by}} a sluice. The Arram Beck flows in from the west, and then the river is crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between the owners of the Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge. Just above Beverley Beck, which joins from <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>is</b> Grovehill Bridge, now a lift bridge but once a ferry bridge.|$|E
5|$|The CLR and BSWR had {{separate}} surface {{buildings and}} lift shafts. The station buildings, which remain today as exits from the station, were built on very confined plots {{on either side}} of Argyll Street {{on the south side of}} Oxford Street, just east of the circus itself. The stations as originally built were entirely separate, but connecting passages were soon provided at platform level. The surviving Central London Railway building to the east of Argyll Street is the best surviving example of stations designed by Harry Bell Measures, and the Bakerloo line building to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>is</b> a classic Leslie Green structure. Both are Grade II listed since 20 July 2011.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins at}} the Calexico East Border Station, which is open from 6 am to 10 pm, seven days a week. Just north of the border, the highway splits into two roads {{to pass through the}} customs checkpoints before the two roads merge back together; the fork to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>is</b> for cars, and the fork to the east is for {{commercial}} vehicles. SR 7 takes the western fork, which passes over the other fork at the northern end and merges into that highway. From here to I-8, SR 7 is an expressway known as Orchard Road. Before reaching I-8, SR 7 travels north and has an at-grade intersection with SR 98 and a few other roads. At its northern end, SR 7 turns into County Route S32 (still Orchard Road) as it intersects with I-8. The entire route runs through the Sonoran Desert and is built to expressway standards.|$|E
