5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor is elected {{on the same}} election ticket as the Governor in a statewide election held every four years, concurrent with United States presidential elections.

Historically, the position has generally remained vacant during such events.

However, in recent years <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>has</b> appointed a Lieutenant Governor if a vacancy arises.|$|E
5|$|Under the Maryland Constitution of 1776, the Governor {{was chosen}} for one-year terms by both houses of the General Assembly.

At each election, only voters from a single gubernatorial election district selected the Governor. The Maryland Constitution of 1851 lengthened the Governor's term of office from three to four years, which brought elections for Governor in line with elections for Federal offices that occur only in even years. Finally, the Constitution of 1864 eliminated the rotating gubernatorial election districts and, since the election of 1868, <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>has</b> been elected by all the voters of the state.|$|E
