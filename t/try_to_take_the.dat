Despite trying to make the party perfect for her sister, Elsa's sneezes create tiny snowmen which <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> cake for themselves, and she nearly falls off the clocktower due to her condition. Afterwards Anna takes Elsa to rest and feeds her soup, while Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf help transport the snowmen to Elsa's ice palace in the mountains.|$|E

25|$|They {{met in the}} 2015 NRL Grand Final on October 4 at ANZ Stadium, {{the first}} to be played by two Queensland based teams.

25|$|The Fellowship {{find out}} that the dwarves within Moria have been slain, and they are {{attacked}} by Orcs and a cave troll. They defeat them, but are confronted by an ancient demon called a Balrog. Gandalf casts the Balrog into a vast chasm, but its fiery whip drags Gandalf down into the darkness with it. The rest of the Fellowship, now in command by Aragorn, reach Lothlórien, home to elves Galadriel and Celeborn. Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest, and one of his friends will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai to track down and kill the Fellowship.|$|E
25|$|The left-back and the right-back (generally {{referred}} to as the full-backs) are the defenders stationed either side of the centre-backs to provide protection from attacking wide players. They often have to defend against the opponent's wingers, who will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> ball past them down the flanks in order to cross or pass into the penalty area to their attackers. Full-backs traditionally do not go up to support the attack but may move up as far as the halfway line depending on the defensive line being held. In the modern game, there has been the tendency to prefer the use of the attacking full-back (wing-back) role though they are more often than not still {{referred to}} as right- or left-backs.|$|E

25|$|Many {{species of}} ants have been {{observed}} attacking queens and killing them. Predatory ants include: Ectatomma edentatum, Ephebomyrmex spp., Lasius neoniger, Pheidole spp., Pogonomyrmex badius, and Conomyrma insana, which {{is among the most}} significant. C. insana ants are known to be effective predators against founding queens in studied areas of Northern Florida. The pressure of attacks initiated by C. insana increase over time, causing queens to exhibit different reactions, including escaping, concealment, or defence. Most queens that are attacked by these ants are ultimately killed. Queens that are in groups have higher chances of survival than solitary queens if they are attacked by S. geminata. Ants can attack queens on the ground and invade nests by stinging and dismembering them. Other ants such as P. porcula <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> head and gaster, and C. clara invade in groups. Also, certain ants try to drag queens out of their nests by pulling on the antennae or legs. Small, monomorphic ants rely on recruitment to kill queens and do not attack them until reinforcements arrive. Aside from killing the queen, some ants may steal the eggs for consumption or emit a repellent that is effective against red imported fire ants. Certain ant species may raid colonies and destroy them.|$|E

[...] If Howe decided to launch an attack on the heights, Washington planned to launch an attack against the city from Cambridge. [...] As part of the preparations, he readied two floating batteries and boats sufficient to carry almost 3,000 troops. Washington's judgment of Howe's options was accurate; they were exactly the options Howe considered.|$|E

500|$|Harry and the Potters {{with its}} strong persona or theme {{is as much}} a {{performance}} art project as it is a rock band. Musically, they sound much like other indie rock music with the exception that the band adheres to a novel conceit: the Harry Potter books will inspire the lyrics. As Joe said in a 2005 interview, [...] "We <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> themes from the books and amplify them." [...] Their musical sound is described as [...] "simple, catchy rock – think The White Stripes crossed with Raffi – where everyone sings along which is easy because in songs like 'Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock' the title is pretty much the only line."

500|$|The Texian cavalry joined their infantrymen.

[...] The Mexican {{artillery}} fired three times, driving the Texians back. [...] Three times the Mexican cavalry attempted to take a small rise to give the artillery better position; they were repulsed. [...] The Mexican infantry then attacked. [...] Rusk wrote of the Mexican attack: [...] "These men advanced with great coolness and bravery under a destructive fire from our men, preserving... strict order and exhibiting no confusion." [...] The infantry abandoned their charge when they realized that Texian James Swisher had led a band of cavalry to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Mexican cannon.

500|$|The stage {{began with}} the largest {{successful}} breakaway of the Giro, 25 riders representing 18 teams. The only teams that missed the break were Milram, Ag2r, , and the team of the race leader, Rabobank. They worked together as a cohesive unit {{for much of the}} stage, gaining a maximum six-minute advantage over the peloton. Seven of the 25 broke free with [...] left to race, and they contested a final sprint for the stage win. The first rider to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> win was Dries Devenyns, but he was quickly overtaken by Félix Cárdenas, who was in turn passed by Danny Pate. Pate, however, had the breakaway's most experienced rider, Michele Scarponi, in his slipstream, and it was Scarponi who timed his sprint just right to take the stage win. The high-placed riders in the general classification all finished with the peloton, 3' 57" [...] behind the stage winner, so there was no change to the top ten overall.|$|E

500|$|Edward the Elder had {{conquered the}} Danish territories in Mercia and East Anglia with the {{assistance}} of Æthelflæd and her husband, but when Edward died the Danish king Sihtric still ruled the Viking Kingdom of York (formerly the southern Northumbrian kingdom of Deira). In January 926, Æthelstan arranged for one of his sisters to marry Sihtric. The two kings agreed not to invade each other's territories or to support each other's enemies. The following year Sihtric died, and Æthelstan seized the chance to invade. Guthfrith, a cousin of Sihtric, led a fleet from Dublin to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> throne, but Æthelstan easily prevailed. He captured York and received the submission of the Danish people. According to a southern chronicler, he [...] "succeeded to the kingdom of the Northumbrians", and it is uncertain whether he had to fight Guthfrith. Southern kings had never ruled the north, and his usurpation was met with outrage by the Northumbrians, who had always resisted southern control. However, at Eamont, near Penrith, on 12 July 927, King Constantine of Scotland, King Hywel Dda of Deheubarth, Ealdred [...] of Bamburgh, and King Owain of Strathclyde (or Morgan ap Owain of Gwent) accepted Æthelstan's overlordship. His triumph led to seven years of peace in the north.|$|E
500|$|Rowson {{also notes}} that Black's chances {{increase}} markedly by playing good openings, {{which tend to be}} those with flexibility and latent potential, [...] "rather than those that give White fixed targets or that <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> initiative prematurely." [...] He also emphasizes that [...] "White has 'the initiative', not 'the advantage'. Success with Black depends on seeing beyond the initiative and thinking of positions in terms of 'potential'." [...] These ideas are exemplified by the Hedgehog, a dynamic modern system against the English Opening that can arise from various move orders. A typical position arises after 1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 b6 4.Bg2 Bb7 5.0-0 e6 6.Nc3 Be7 7.d4 cxd4 8.Qxd4 d6 9.e4 a6. White has a spatial advantage, while Black often maneuvers his pieces on the last two ranks of the board, but White [...] "has to keep a constant eye on the possible liberating pawn thrusts ...b5 and ...d5." [...] Watson remarks, [...] "Black's goal is to remain elastic and flexible, with many options for his pieces, whereas White can become paralyzed at some point by the need to protect against various dynamic pawn breaks." [...] He also observes that, [...] "White tends to be as much tied up by Black's latent activity as Black himself is tied up by White's space advantage." [...] Moreover, attempts by White to overrun Black's position often rebound disastrously. An example of this is the following grandmaster game: ...|$|E
500|$|Amrita Daityari, {{author of}} Sourav Ganguly: the fire within, {{noted that in}} ODIs, where Ganguly usually opened the innings, he used to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> {{advantage}} of fielding restrictions by advancing down the pitch and hitting pace bowlers over extra cover and mid-off. She commented: [...] "Ganguly was notorious for attacking left-arm spin bowlers. Due to excellent eye–hand coordination, he was noted for picking {{the length of the}} ball early, coming down the pitch and hitting the ball aerially over mid-on or midwicket, often for a six. However, he did have a weakness in running between the wickets and judging quick singles." [...] There were many instances where Ganguly's batting partner was run out due to Ganguly's calling for a run, and then sending him back while halfway down the pitch. A situation like this happened in an ODI against Australia where he took a single when on 99, but he coasted and did not ground his bat. Although the bat was past the crease, it was in the air and he was consequently run out. Ganguly said, [...] "I love to watch myself hit a cover drive, to watch myself hit a hundred." [...] Ganguly's relationship with former Indian coach John Wright has been well documented in contemporary media, with them denoting the relationship as a [...] "symbiotic process". They credited Wright and Ganguly with bringing out international class performers, through academic, coaching and scientific fitness regimens. According to Dubey, Ganguly and Wright, along {{with other members of the}} team like Tendulkar and Dravid, were the first to understand the importance of a foreign coach for the Indian cricket team and was convinced that the domestic coach has outlived its utility. Ganguly's aggressive style and Wright's importance on fitness ushered in the development of a better cricket team for India.|$|E

2500|$|Liu Song founder Liu Yu was {{originally}} {{a leader of}} the Army of the Northern Garrison (...) that notably won the Battle of Fei River in 383. In 404, he helped suppress Huan Xuan's rebellion, leading to his dominance over the Eastern Jin court. In order to gain popularity to take the throne he led expeditions against the Sixteen Kingdoms, capturing Shandong, Henan and, briefly, Guanzhong by 416. He gave up Guanzhong to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> throne.

2500|$|According to RFE/RL, [...] "It is, of course, {{possible}} that the Georgian authorities initially assumed that the incursion was masterminded by Moscow, and realized only after verbal contact was established with the intruders that it was not.
