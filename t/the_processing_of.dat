40|$|The {{contribution}} of the sensory–motor system to <b>the</b> semantic <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> language stimuli is still controversial.

The existing evidence shows that although motor contexts can influence <b>the</b> semantic <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> action-related concepts, <b>the</b> mechanism of the contextual influences is still far from clear. Future investigations will be needed to clarify (1) whether motor contexts only modulate activity in motor regions, (2) whether the contextual influences are specific to the semantic features of language stimuli, and (3) what factors can determine the facilitatory or inhibitory contextual influences on <b>the</b> semantic <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> action-related language. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{emotional}} Stroop task {{has been}} used to investigate <b>the</b> selective <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> negative emotional states, with anxiety being one of the most researched emotions. In general, results from these investigations have suggested that participants with emotional problems focus attention on emotionally relevant material, although there have been relatively few studies investigating the emotion of anger. The conclusions resulting from these studies have suggested that <b>the</b> selective <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> anger may differ from that of other negative emotions, such as anxiety. However, the number of studies and Stroop task procedures used to study <b>the</b> selective <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> anger have precluded any definitive conclusions and comparisons to other negative emotions. The current study used anger-related stimuli and emotional Stroop procedures similar to investigations conducted with anxiety to more fully understand <b>the</b> selective <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> anger within this context. The results indicated a strong effect for emotional stimuli; however, differences in participants categorized as being low or high on trait anger characteristics were non-significant. These and other findings have implications for theorizing about <b>the</b> selective <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> anger. ...|$|R
5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, {{where it is}} mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E

40|$|Batch {{processing}} machines, where {{a number}} of jobs are processed simultaneously as a batch, occur frequently in semiconductor manufacturing environments, particularly at diffusion in wafer fabrication and at burn-in in final test. In this paper we consider a batch-processing machine subject to uncertain (Poisson) job arrivals. Two different cases are studied: (1) <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> times <b>of</b> batches are independent and identically distributed(IID), corresponding to a diffusion tube; and (2) <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> time <b>of</b> each batch is <b>the</b> maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> times <b>of</b> its constituent jobs, where <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> times <b>of</b> jobs are IID, modelling a burn-in oven.

The control policies considered are threshold policies, where <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> a batch is initiated once a certain number of jobs have accumulated in the system.

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in {{the sodium}} {{hydroxide}} liquor. From this {{it can be}} extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, tomato systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases.

Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted dibasic cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified. No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.|$|E

The scientists suggested these differences are cultural. The orangutans at Suaq Balimbing live in dense groups and are socially tolerant; this creates good conditions for social transmission. Further evidence that highly social orangutans are more likely to exhibit cultural behaviours came from a study of leaf-carrying behaviours of ex-captive orangutans that were being rehabilitated on the island of Kaja in Borneo.|$|E

5|$|The exosome is {{involved}} in the degradation and processing {{of a wide variety of}} RNA species. In the cytoplasm of cells, it {{is involved}} in the turn-over of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors, through interactions with proteins from the nonsense mediated decay or non-stop decay pathways. In alternative fashion, mRNAs are degraded as part of their normal turnover. Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex. In the nucleus, the exosome is required for the correct processing of several small nuclear RNA molecules. Finally, the nucleolus is the compartment where the majority of the exosome complexes are found. There it plays a role in <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (the first identified function of the exosome) and of several small nucleolar RNAs.|$|E
