40|$|The {{application}} of low temperature silicon nitride protective layers on wire bonded integrated circuits mounted on lead <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> is reported. An {{evaluation of the}} mechanical and electrical compatibility of both plasma nitride and photochemical silicon nitride (photonitride) passivations (parallel evaluations) of integrated circuits which were then encapsulated in plastic is described. Photonitride passivation is compatible with all wire bonded lead <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies,</b> with or without initial chip passivation. Plasma nitride passivation of lead <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> is possible only if the chip is passivated before lead <b>frame</b> <b>assembly.</b> The survival rate after the environmental test sequence of devices with a coating of plasma nitride on the chip and a coating of either plasma nitride or photonitride over the assembled device is significantly {{greater than that of}} devices assembled with no nitride protective coating over either chip or lead frame...|$|R

The extension of this model for glass wool for post protection phase has {{been published in the}} European technical guideline Fire Safety in Timber Buildings [2].

40|$|The work {{investigates the}} {{application}} of a novel frame model to reduce the computational cost of the mistuning analysis of bladed disc systems. A full-scale finite element (FE) model of the bladed disc is considered as benchmark. The single blade frame configuration is identified via an optimization process. The individual blades are then assembled by 3 D springs, whose parameters are determined via calibration process. The dynamics of the novel beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> is also compared to those obtained from three state-of-the-art FE-based reduced order models (ROMs) : a lumped parameter approach; a Timoshenko beam assembly, and component mode synthesis (CMS) based techniques with free and fixed interfaces. The development of these classical ROMs to represent the bladed disc is also addressed in detail. A methodology to perform the mistuning analysis is then proposed and implemented. A comparison of the modal properties and forced response dynamics between the aforementioned ROMs and the full-scale FE model is presented. The case study demonstrates that the beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> can predict the variations of the blade amplitude factors with results being in agreement with the full-scale FE model. The CMS based ROMs underestimate the maximum amplitude factor, while the results obtained from beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> are generally conservative. The beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> is 4 times more computationally efficient than the CMS fixed-interface approach. This study proves that the beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> can efficiently predict the mistuning behavior of bladed discs when low order modes are of interest...|$|R

High pressure <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> is a leak proof container design to hold precious electronics at a pressure substantially {{different from the}} abient pressure.

The final AHU “(Antenna Head Unit) ” <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> has to be designed in a tradeoff between strength, weight maintenance and thermal aspects. To overcome the problems in existing rectangle cross sectional vessel design, in our proposed design the stresses developed in the circular cross section with hemispherical end caps are very less as compared to rectangle cross sectional vessel.

40|$|The first {{fuel plate}} <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> of the AFIP- 6 MKII {{experiment}} was irradiated as planned from December, 2011 through February, 2012 {{in the center}} flux trap of the Advanced Test Reactor during cycle 151 A. Following irradiation in this cycle and while reconfiguring the experiment in the ATR canal, a non-fueled component (the bottom plate) of the first fuel plate <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> became separated from the rail sides. There {{is no evidence that}} the fueled region of the fuel plate <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> was compromised by this incident or the irradiation conditions. The separation of this component was determined to have been caused by flow induced vibrations, where vortex shedding frequencies were resonant with a natural frequency of the bottom plate component. This gave way to amplification, fracture, and separation from the assembly. Although parallel flow induced vibrations were analyzed, vortex shedding flow induced vibrations was an unfamiliar failure mode that was difficult to identify. Both the once-irradiated first fuel plate and un-irradiated second fuel plate <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> were planned for irradiation in the subsequent cycle 151 B. The AFIP- 6 MKII experiment was excluded from irradiation in cycle 151 B because non-trivial design modifications would be needed to mitigate this type of incident during the second irradiation cycle. All items of the experiment hardware were accounted for and cycle 151 B occurred with a non-fueled AFIP backup assembly in the center flux trap. Options for completion of the AFIP- 6 MKII experiment campaign are presented and future preventative actions are recommended...|$|R
