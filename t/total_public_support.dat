40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} public support and private donations by disaggregating the crowding effect into two components; one determined by level of public support and one determined by changes in public support levels. The analysis of a panel of American non-profit theatres shows that the crowding effect induced by the level of public support takes an inverted U shape: at low levels public support crowds-in private donations while at higher levels it displaces them. The change in <b>total</b> <b>public</b> <b>support</b> {{in the past year}} produces a constant crowding-in effect on the level of private donations. The paper finally illustrates how federal and state support have a crowding-in effect at all levels, while local support has a similar impact to <b>total</b> <b>public</b> <b>support...</b>|$|E

The results of the 5 th and final year, Fiscal Year 2003, are included in Table 1. We obviously {{did not come close}} to realizing this ambitious goal. In my 1998 Presidential Address, I compared the ADA to a large ship in which a new course first required a change of direction (which would occur slowly) before proceeding toward and hopefully reaching a new port. It’s obvious that we have not reached that port, and realistically speaking, we probably never will. However, I would be remiss if I didn’t point out the following. In each of the previous years, the increase in funding for Research Awards and Grants was much less than 50 % of the increase in <b>Total</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Support.</b> In the last fiscal year, in which there was a severe economic downturn, Total Public Sup-port increased much less than in previous years. However, the increase in research funding actually exceeded the increase in <b>Total</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Support.</b> To return to a per-haps tortured metaphor, although we probably will never reach the port prom-ised 5 years ago, we seem to be headed in the right direction. That’s certainly a pos-itive sign and speaks well for the future of research funding by the ADA...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLate {{imperial}} officials, {{from the}} highest-ranking ministers in Peking {{down to the}} county magistrates, repeatedly issued proclamations prohibiting women from visiting temples. Such bans were often ignored, but both normative and anecdotal evidence from {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries documents a number of sustained attempts at enforcement. This article summarizes interpretations given to such bans by historians and analyzes the parameters of enforcement. While all-out bans were rarely envisioned, because of the <b>total</b> lack of <b>public</b> <b>support,</b> some officials tried to curb certain types of female participation in temple life that were considered particularly offensive (ritual roles for women, staying overnight, spectacular penitential practices, and so forth). This article argues that while outright repression of women (jailing and punishing all women entering temples or joining festivals) or temples (closure or destruction) was difficult to maintain on a long-term basis, it might serve as a threat in negotiations between official and local elites. In the course of such negotiations, elite members agreed to try to curb some “excessive” female practices in temples in exchange for official approval for temple festivals...|$|R

There are issues about the borderline, i.e., what is included and what is excluded from the database.

40|$|The paper {{compares the}} design and outcome of public {{subsidies}} to business across a number of industrialized countries. The comparison {{of the amount of}} subsidies shows that the share of GDP devoted to <b>total</b> <b>public</b> <b>support</b> is markedly lower in the USA than in Europe but the share of GDP devoted to support that improves economic performance is comparable. Implementing public support follows two models. The first model (Anglo-Saxon) model is primarily "soft" in nature and decentralized. The second model is more interventionist and centralized. The former model seems to perform better especially in term of science and technology. However, the impact of public support policies remains seriously under-researched and more research is crucially needed to draw firm conclusions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

40|$|An {{assessment}} is made {{as to whether}} renewable energy use for electricity generation in the EU was beneficial throughout the cycle {{of high and low}} oil prices. Costs and benefits are calculated with the EU statistics for the period of low oil prices 1998 – 2002 and high oil prices 2003 – 2009. The share of renewable energy in electricity production was 21 % of all energy resources in 2008, growing on average 5 % a year during 2003 – 2008 compared to nil growth of the fossil fuels mix. Correlations show significant impacts of growing renewable energy use on changes in consumers' electricity prices during the high and rapidly increasing fossil fuel prices in the period 2005 – 2008. The growing use has contributed to price decrease in most countries that use more renewable energy and price increase in many countries that use little renewable energy. Costs and benefits are assessed through comparison between the observed consumers' electricity prices and simulated prices had they followed the costs of fossil fuel mix. A net benefit of 47 billion euro throughout the oil price cycle is attributable to the growing use of renewable energy, which is on average 8 billion euro a year. This net benefit is larger than the <b>total</b> <b>public</b> <b>support</b> for renewable energy. The net benefit would be larger had the EU anticipated high oil prices through more public support during low oil prices, as this would create productive capacity, but countries' interests increasingly differed.

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} essay is to study the <b>public</b> <b>support</b> givers view of the concept {{innovation}} and to study how the <b>public</b> <b>support</b> givers discuss and act around the division of <b>public</b> <b>support</b> to entrepreneurs innovations. The purpose is further to describe if the division of <b>public</b> <b>support</b> favour or not favour environmental innovations and to examine if the <b>public</b> <b>support</b> givers consider the industry for environmental innovations is profitable for the society’s economy. We have done several case studies where we have interviewed eight <b>public</b> <b>support.</b> Support givers in this essay are defined as public authorities and other organisations on local, national and/or international level that gives <b>public</b> <b>support</b> to innovations. The <b>public</b> <b>support</b> givers that take part of the essay is VINNOVA, ALMI Stockholm, Innovationsbron, Energimyndigheten, SU Holding AB, KTH Holding, Västra Götalandsregionen and MISTRA. Our theoretical starting point is Silverman and Baums theory ”Picking Winners or Building Them”. They discuss if external support givers act like scouts, who are experts on finding winning companies, or if the external support givers act like coaches and have a more advisory roll and help the companies to become winners. Our conclusions are that an innovation is an idea that is possible to comers and that it also has taken the step towards commercial. When {{you look at the}} support givers support processes they take in consideration different characteristics that the entrepreneur should possess, like the team behind the innovation and the innovation itself, when they decide who to give support to. At the same time they help entrepreneurs with guidance and coaching. Therefore they act both as scouts and coaches. The majority of the support givers don’t focus on a specific industry. Three support givers focus though more or less on environmental innovations. <b>Public</b> <b>support</b> is very important for the Swedish industry. It is important for the possibility for innovations to succeed since other external support givers like venture capitalists and banks don’t give support in the early innovation face. An important factor with <b>public</b> <b>support</b> givers is that they don’t focus on getting refund on invested capital. They <b>public</b> <b>support</b> givers want their actions to favour the society. Finally our essay shows that the <b>public</b> <b>support</b> givers neither favour nor not favour environmental innovations.

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{debate is}} now taking place among scholars {{and policy makers}} {{about the value of}} <b>public</b> <b>support</b> for internationalization activities. These incentives have been applied in many countries to stimulate not only the exports but also foreign direct investments, but the results are not clear. Governments must ensure that beyond the increase of a country's competitiveness, <b>public</b> <b>support</b> also will promote equity between rms. Assuming that the perceived importance of <b>public</b> <b>support</b> is a proxy of equity between rms, we have a scenario where the promotion of equity can be obtained if the less skilled rms place more value on support than rms with more competencies. In the same line of reasoning and extending the analysis to the rm's external environment, the equity increases if rms involved in more demanding environments place more value on support than rms whose investments are in less demanding environments. We propose an ordered probit model that considers the rms' competencies and the requirements of foreign direct investments as sources of variation for the evaluation of the perceived importance of <b>public</b> <b>support.</b> This model is tested on four policy measures of a recent survey that includes 104 Portuguese rms with foreign direct investment. The overall results reveal that <b>public</b> <b>support</b> may promote equity since rms' competencies have a negative e ect on the perceived importance of <b>public</b> <b>support,</b> and the requirements of foreign direct investment positively moderate the value assigned to <b>public</b> <b>support.</b> We conclude that a non-uniform evaluation of <b>public</b> <b>support</b> may roughly predict the promotion of equity through a positive discrimination in favor of rms with less competencies and involved in more demanding projects of foreign direct investments. Despite the use of representative sample, this study is exploratory and has at least two limitations that prevent a generalization of the ndings. The rst limitation is from the nature of the sample, which was built with rms from a small country. We do not consider any spatial di erences that could arise with the inclusion of rms from other countries. The second limitation derives {{from the fact that the}} model does not consider any time variation. The importance of <b>public</b> <b>support</b> may change in di erent periods of time, e. g., during periods of recession, <b>public</b> <b>support</b> may have more importance than in other periods. We only can caught the e ect of support during a period of crisis, 2009 { 2010. Despite these limitations, the study could help to understand how entrepreneurs assess <b>public</b> <b>support</b> and how <b>public</b> <b>support</b> can promote equity between firms...|$|R
