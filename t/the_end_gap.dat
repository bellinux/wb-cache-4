5000|$|When fitting new {{piston rings}} or {{breaking}} them in within an engine, <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>gap</b> {{is a crucial}} measurement. In order that a ring may be fitted into the [...] "grooves" [...] of the piston, it is not continuous but is broken at one point on its circumference. The ring gap may be checked by putting the ring into the bore/liner (squared to bore) and measuring with a feeler gauge. End gap should be within recommended limits for size of bore and intended [...] "load" [...] of engine. Metals expand with a rise in temperature, so too small a gap may result in overlapping or bending when used under hot running conditions (racing, heavy loads, towing) and, even at normal temperatures, a small ring gap may lead to ring gap closure, ring breakage, bore damage and possible seizure of the piston. Too large a gap may give unacceptable compression and levels of blow-by gases or oil consumption. When being measured in a used bore, it may indicate excessive bore wear or ring wear. (Radial wear on ring face reduces thickness of used/worn ring (face wear in bore) essentially decreasing face circumference of ring and thereby increasing size of ring end gap.) ...|$|E
40|$|PLIF {{has been}} used to observe the {{in-cylinder}} transport of unburned fuel that, while trapped in the ring-land and ring-groove crevices, survives combustion in the propagating flame. Away from the top-ring gap, we detect a wall-jet comprised of unburned charge exiting the top ring-land crevice opening. At the location of the top-ring gap, we observed unburned fuel lying in the cool boundary layer along the cylinder wall during the later stages of the expansion stroke. This layer is scraped into the roll-up vortex during the exhaust stroke. These data lead us to conclude that away from <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>gap,</b> unburned, high pressure charge, trapped between the two compression rings escapes as a wall jet after ring-reversal near the bottom center. Conversely, at the ring gap, when the cylinder pressure drops below the pressure between the compression rings, the trapped charge escapes through the gap and forms a thin layer on the cylinder wall...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Ring and {{cylinder}} bore wear {{may not be}} a problem in most current automotive engines. However, a small change in ring face and {{cylinder bore}} diameter can significantly affect the lubrication characteristics and ring axial motion. This in turn can cause to change inter-ring pressure, blow-by and oil consumption in an engine. Therefore, by predicting the wear of piston ring face and cylinder bore altogether, <b>the</b> changed ring <b>end</b> <b>gap</b> and <b>the</b> changed volume of gas reservoir can be calculated. Then the excessive oil consumption can be predicted. Here, the oil amount through top ring gap into combustion chamber is estimated as engine oil consumption. Furthermore, the wear theories of ring and cylinder bore are included. The changed oil consumption caused by <b>the</b> new <b>end</b> <b>gap</b> and <b>the</b> new volume of oil reservoir around second land, can be calculated at some engine running interval. Meanwhile, the wear amount and oil consumption occurred during engine durability cycle are compared with the calculated values. The wear data of rings and cylinder bore are obtained from three engines after engine durability test. The calculated wear data of each part are turn out to be around the band of averaged test values or a little below. It is shown that the important factor regarding oi...|$|R
