5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, and <b>that</b> <b>all</b> life-forms known {{have a common}} origin. The theory of evolution postulates <b>that</b> <b>all</b> organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E

5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, <b>that</b> <b>all</b> living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and <b>that</b> <b>all</b> cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E

5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} {{pioneering}} work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he is investigating the what (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to {{part of the natural}} world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen <b>that</b> <b>all</b> members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, <b>that</b> <b>all</b> birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E
