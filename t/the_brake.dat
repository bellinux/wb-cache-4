5|$|The {{body for}} coach 17 {{was built in}} 1911, by local firm Shapland and Petter, and mounted on a steel {{underframe}} constructed by the railway in its own workshops at Pilton. Marginally longer than the earlier coaches, it contained both smoking and non-smoking accommodation for first and third class passengers, as well as <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> van space.|$|E
5|$|The {{top floor}} of the mill is the dust floor. It could be used for storage of grain and gives {{internal}} access to the cap. The cast-iron wallower, which is driven by <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> wheel is carried {{at the top of the}} upright shaft, in the centre of the mill.|$|E
5|$|Work {{later in}} the year {{included}} the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing. <b>The</b> <b>brake</b> and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new braking torque {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative <b>braking</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>braking</b> torque distribution strategy is proposed based on <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque and <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque, a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions. Through <b>the</b> estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate <b>the</b> overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque required for <b>the</b> anti-lock <b>braking</b> system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as <b>the</b> emergency <b>braking</b> and <b>the</b> normal <b>braking.</b> In <b>the</b> case of emergency <b>braking,</b> <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque is to be equal to <b>the</b> overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque. In <b>the</b> case of normal <b>braking,</b> <b>the</b> command <b>braking</b> torque {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque is chosen as the smaller one between <b>the</b> overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque and <b>the</b> command <b>braking</b> torque. To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good <b>braking</b> performance when <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque is smaller than <b>the</b> maximum <b>braking</b> torque of <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system, <b>the</b> whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system; when <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque is bigger than <b>the</b> maximum <b>braking</b> torque of <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system, <b>the</b> whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by both <b>the</b> hydraulic <b>braking</b> system and <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system, while <b>the</b> maximum <b>braking</b> torque of <b>the</b> regenerative <b>braking</b> system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions, and <b>the</b> battery SOCs...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{configuration}} of a haptic gripper featuring magnetorheological(MR) brakes is pro-posed and an optimal design of <b>the</b> MR <b>brakes</b> for <b>the</b> haptic griper is performed considering <b>the</b> re-quired <b>braking</b> torque, <b>the</b> uncontrollable torque(zero-field friction torque) and mass of <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> Several configurations of MR brake is proposed such as disc-type, serpentine-type and hybrid-type. After {{the configuration}}s of <b>the</b> MR <b>brakes</b> are proposed, <b>braking</b> torque of <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> is analyzed based on Bingham rheological model of the MR fluid. The zero-field friction torque of <b>the</b> MR <b>brakes</b> is also analyzed. An optimization procedure based on finite element analysis integrated with an optimization toolbox is developed for <b>the</b> MR <b>brakes.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of the optimal design is to find optimal geometric dimensions of <b>the</b> MR <b>brake</b> structure that can produce <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque and minimize the mass of <b>the</b> MR <b>brakes.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> uncontrollable torque of <b>the</b> MR <b>brakes</b> is constrained to be much smaller than <b>the</b> required <b>braking</b> torque. Based on the developed optimization procedure, optimal solution of <b>the</b> proposed MR <b>brakes</b> are achieved and <b>the</b> best MR <b>brake</b> is determined. <b>The</b> working performance of <b>the</b> optimized MR <b>brake</b> is then investigated...|$|R
30|$|During {{process of}} the train to train rescue, the in-train forces are {{generated}} by <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> force applied by the assisting train while the assisted train does not possess <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> ability. <b>The</b> in-train force is closely relevant to the weight of train configuration and <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> deceleration.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, a {{new theory}} {{surfaced}} after the newspaper Crónica spoke to the police about {{the cause of the}} accident. The police source mentioned the possibility that Rodrigo's intensive routine might have increased the production of adrenaline in his body. The investigators explained that, if Rodrigo did not release the excess adrenaline through urination after his last concert, he could have lost his sense of distance in relation to Pesquera's Blazer. This could have caused Rodrigo to apply <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> and turn the wheel violently.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Rindt drove, {{again in}} a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 {{kilometre}} race at Zeltweg. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of Mike Parkes owing to a special lever that manually activated <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.|$|E
5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than the pioneering machines on display. Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a hydraulic ram and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle starter motor. This {{was based on the}} principle of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> press, a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal through progressive force.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>braking</b> value B is only {{calculated}} for players with a DWZ of under 1300 points {{and only if}} the achieved points are less or equal to the expected ones, else <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> value is zero. <b>The</b> <b>braking</b> value makes <b>the</b> DWZ of poor players decrease not so rapidly.|$|R

5|$|Several teams {{made major}} {{technical}} updates to their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren and Ferrari altered <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> ducts on their cars, improving the cooling {{to manage the}} high brake temperatures encountered in Montreal. Ferrari and Mercedes revised their rear suspension layouts, while Red Bull brought a new front wing optimised for a lower downforce level. Renault and Williams brought new rear wings, which were designed specifically for low-downforce circuits such as Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.|$|E
5|$|Slangen, Tivoli Gardens's family roller coaster, {{closed on}} September 21, 2003 {{to make room}} for Dæmonen. Once the roller coaster was demolished, {{construction}} for the new roller coaster commenced. By the beginning of December, most of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run and station portions of the track were erected. By the new year, the lift hill was topped off. The first drop was completed by the end of January 2004 and the last piece of track was placed in February.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pedal is pressed.|$|E
50|$|A second free-turning pinion wheel {{which also}} meshed with the rack, was {{mounted on the}} leading driving axle. It had grooved brake drums bolted to each side and acted as a <b>brake</b> only, with <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> being applied by a hand {{mechanism}} from <b>the</b> footplate. <b>The</b> <b>brakes</b> on <b>the</b> driving and free-turning pinion wheels were separately controlled, while <b>the</b> vacuum <b>brake</b> gear on <b>the</b> engine was only used to control <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> of <b>the</b> train.|$|R

5|$|The {{line has}} six steam {{locomotives}} for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used for shunting and to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable {{at the same}} time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul. The railway also owns 23carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> van built for the railway.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>braking</b> {{decelerations}} {{with respect}} to train speeds are shown in Fig.  8 b. <b>The</b> <b>braking</b> forces or torques are applied by the assisting train, while the assisted train does not possess <b>the</b> ability of <b>braking.</b> It is indicated the EB deceleration of type A is {{higher than that of}} type B. <b>The</b> <b>braking</b> deceleration at lower speed is higher. Thus, the braking-induced impact at low speed is mainly discussed in this paper.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> countersteam <b>brake</b> {{is often}} {{confused}} with <b>the</b> counterpressure <b>brake,</b> which works with air, not steam, and {{acts as a}} dynamic <b>brake.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> countersteam <b>brake,</b> <b>the</b> counterpressure <b>brake</b> is permitted {{to be used as}} an independent braking system in its own right.|$|R
5|$|Galactica departs {{the station}} and rises a chain lift hill. The ride's first drop dips to the right, before rising back up and flying through the ride's centrepiece theming element, a portal, which links to the ride's space theme. Followed by this, riders are turned from the prone {{position}} onto their backs. The coaster then performs a large upward left turn before twisting again, returning riders to the prone position. After exiting from the lie-to-fly element, Galactica passes underneath a small ravine before pitching up, into a tight turn over the plaza area. A 360 degrees inline twist is followed up {{by a series of}} straight flying, and several turns and dips in the track. The train then comes to a stop on <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run before returning to one of the station's two stations.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run and a final right-hand turn that leads back into the station.|$|E
5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle brake. Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a recoil and they say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E

50|$|The ECPB {{can also}} apply <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> on <b>the</b> {{rearmost}} wagons, slightly before <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> on <b>the</b> front wagons are applied, which reduces the shock and {{noise of the}} wagons bunching up.|$|R
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E
