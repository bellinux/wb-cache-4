500|$|Following Michigan's season-ending {{loss in the}} 2011 Gator Bowl, {{head coach}} Rich Rodriguez was fired and {{replaced}} by Brady Hoke. As Robinson had thrived in Rodriguez's spread offense, the coaching change led to speculation that Robinson may transfer.

[...] In the video statement released by the University of Michigan, Robinson said he seriously considered transferring and noted that Rodriguez {{was one of the}} few coaches willing to give him the chance to play quarterback at the next level.

She is a native English and German speaker (through her father and mother, respectively), and her fluency in German helped her pick up the Danish {{language}} quickly.

It reminds me a little of Chinese, with the glottal stop … Saying something with an upswing or a downswing can give a word an entirely different meaning," [...] she explained. [...] "It was my decision to learn the language immediately. It would have been terrible to have to stand up and speak English at an engagement, or thank someone for something.

40|$|Although {{my family}} immigrated to Canada from the Netherlands when I was {{one year of}} age, I have always {{been aware of the}} fact that I have no {{birthright}} to <b>this</b> country which <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>home.</b> I have always been aware of two points of view in my life and have spent much emotional energy balancing this tension. This dissertation provided me with an avenue to examine the visions of artists of Dutch Canadian heritage who, like myself, experienced this dualism. Their literary expressions of this dualism permitted me to explore the inherent tensions and determine what unique resolutions they may have discovered along the way. The Canadian attitude to the ethnic and cultural diversity in our society is a changing one. Our federal government takes pride in Canada's multicultural mosaic, recognizing it as a rich resource in which all Canadians share. The ethnic dimension of Canadian society, past and present, is one that needs examination if we are to understand fully the contours and nature of Canadian society and identity. Studies of Canadian history and literature have been largely controlled by the people of British or French origin. Due perhaps to fewer numbers, difference in keenness of sense of origin and identity, the immigrant experience itself, and the sheer force of Canadianism, other groups have been relatively silent until quite recently. Groups such as the Dutch, who have established themselves in Canada within the last hundred years or so, have traditions, values and visions they cherish, and particular members of this group have begun to express those in imaginative works...|$|R
