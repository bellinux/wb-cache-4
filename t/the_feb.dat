Analysis has revealed that it is mainly the Tkb which inhibits the growth rate (magnitude) and the range of frequency (bandwidth) of the instability mainly in the higher frequency spectrum. The inhibition in the growth rate and bandwidth increases with increase in Tkb. <b>The</b> <b>FEBs</b> with less Eb (giving drift velocity) reduce growth rate more than the beams with larger Eb.
