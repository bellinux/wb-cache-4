Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published further entirely false allegations that the singer had had the voiceboxes of his guard dogs removed because their barking kept him awake at night. MacKenzie confirmed their inaccuracy shortly after publication by sending a reporter to the singer's house, who quickly discovered that all of his guard dogs were quite capable of barking.|$|E
25|$|Popcorn will pop when freshly harvested, but not well: {{its high}} {{moisture}} content leads to poor expansion and chewy pieces of popcorn. Kernels {{with a high}} moisture content are also susceptible to mold when stored. For these reasons, popcorn growers and distributors dry the kernels until they reach the moisture level at which they expand the most. This differs by variety and conditions, but is generally {{in the range of}} 14–15% moisture by weight. If the kernels are over-dried, the expansion rate will suffer and the percentage of kernels <b>that</b> <b>pop</b> at all will decline.|$|E
25|$|Hawking {{radiation}} {{is required by}} the Unruh effect and the equivalence principle applied to black hole horizons.

The condition of local thermal equilibrium implies that the consistent extension of this local thermal bath has a finite temperature at infinity, which implies {{that some of these}} particles emitted by the horizon are not reabsorbed and become outgoing Hawking radiation.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Vital Signs helped others {{to follow their}} suit, and the rock music in the country skyrocketed {{for the first time}} in the history of the country. In a time when there was no hope for the {{industry}} to survive, rock/pop music bands notably and much quickly filled the gap <b>that</b> <b>pop</b> music industry had left. According to the Western observers and cultural critics, the rock music bands in the country brought the significant shift of country's transformation into modernism during the 1990s. With the rise of Vital Signs and later, Junoon and others, the rock music, exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, became a vehicle for expressing patriotic nationalist spirit in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals {{had allowed}} 69 steals against them through September 8, while they had stolen only 32. Yadier Molina {{is not at}} fault {{as much as the}} {{pitchers}} letting the runners get good jumps, instead of holding them closer to first base. Since his debut in 2004, the team has never allowed more than 64 steals until this year. Molina's pop time—defined as the time elapsed from the moment the pitch hits the catcher's mitt to the moment the intended fielder receives the throw—is {{the same as it was}} last year (1.92 seconds), when he allowed 37 stolen bases and ranked third in the National League with a caught-stealing percentage of 41. <b>That</b> <b>pop</b> time ranks seventh best among all catchers in 2016.|$|E

500|$|Rockism is {{the belief}} in the superiority of {{particular}} values of rock music, which often results in discrimination and prejudice against other forms of popular music.

Poptimism (or popism) {{is the belief}} <b>that</b> <b>pop</b> music is as worthy of professional critique and interest as rock music. It is conversely viewed as a variant of rockism sometimes motivated by commercial or social interests. In other words, a bias that privileges the most famous or best-selling pop, hip-hop, and R acts.|$|E

Hoberman of The Village Voice stated, [...] "This voluptuous phantasmagoria... is certainly Lynch's strongest movie since Blue Velvet and maybe Eraserhead.

500|$|Magazines {{devoted to}} the serious {{discussion}} of popular music first developed in the 1960s and 1970s, with some formative rock critics suggesting that enduring pop music art was made by singer-songwriters using traditional rock instruments on long-playing albums, and <b>that</b> <b>pop</b> hits reside on a lower aesthetic plane {{as a source of}} [...] "guilty pleasure". The term [...] "rockism" [...] was coined in 1981 by English rock musician Pete Wylie and soon became a pejorative used humorously by self-described [...] "anti-rockist" [...] critics in the British press. Originally coinciding with the rise of New Pop in the early 1980s, the term was not generally used outside the confines of small music magazines until the mid 2000s, partly due to the increasing number of bloggers who used it more seriously in analytical debate.|$|E

McCabe wrote that male pop singers {{have been influenced by}} Rihanna and Katy Perry, who have [...] "stripped down {{in the name of a}} hit. Or art.

Clashs Robin Murray wrote <b>that</b> <b>pop</b> music has lacked raunchiness and sex appeal for some time, and Timberlake's return was needed: [...] "Lavish, lush and 21st century in a direct, shocking fashion, the video finds Justin Timberlake on perfect preening form." ...|$|E

According to Collins, he and Cordell worked equally on the book, with Collins focusing more on material relating to character building, sample undead and running undead, while Cordell dealt with monster design and undead material, {{but he said that}} they [...] "dabbled in each others'" [...] sections quite a bit as well".

In writing for the Nottingham Post, Paul Hindle agreed, saying that when the tempo increased and choreography was introduced [...] "Lewis looked endearingly uncomfortable"; however, Hindle was positive about Lewis' vocals, calling her vocal performance [...] "virtuoso".
