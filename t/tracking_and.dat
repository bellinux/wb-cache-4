5|$|Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site {{started in}} March 1963 and {{construction}} proceeded rapidly. The radar was powered {{up for the}} first time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's travelling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different types of beams for detection, <b>tracking,</b> <b>and</b> discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{work in the}} {{planning}} of ESRO operations concluded that the ESTRACK network would initially consist of four radio <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> telemetry stations and three optical tracking stations. In addition to Svalbard, <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> telemetry stations were built on the Falkland Islands, in Fairbanks, Alaska and in Redu, Belgium. France actively opposed the Svalbard location, as Norway was {{not a member of}} ESRO. The ESRO secretariat wanted to quicken the location decision, as it was necessary to have all four in operation before the launch of the ESRO-1 and ESRO-2 satellites.|$|E

5|$|A third {{approach}} achieves some of {{the output}} benefits of tracking, with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and operating cost. This involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons. The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though some, such as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt, incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> fixed tilt.|$|E

5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf.

5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance of the spacecraft over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw and pitch manoeuvres to determine {{how easy it was to}} control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.|$|E
5|$|There are six Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMCs) worldwide.

5|$|As {{this was}} the first Boy Scouting event, the boys did not have uniform shirts, but they did wear khaki scarves and were {{presented}} with brass fleur-de-lis badges, the first use of the Scout emblem.

The patrol leader carried a staff with a flag depicting the patrol animal.

5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial <b>tracking,</b> <b>and</b> the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} return, Cockcroft was {{appointed}} Chief Superintendent of the Air Defence Research Development Establishment (ADRDE) at Christchurch, Hampshire. His {{focus was on}} the use of radar for shooting down enemy aircraft. The GL Mk. III radar was developed as a target <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> predicting radar, but by 1942 the SCR-584 radar developed for the same purpose in the United States became available, and Cockcroft recommended that it be acquired under Lend-Lease. On his own initiative, he acquired SCR-584 sets for testing, and trials conducted on the Isle of Sheppey in October 1943 conclusively demonstrated that SCR-584 was superior. This made Cockcroft very unpopular at the Ministry of Supply, but he had intelligence that the Germans were planning to deploy the V-1 flying bomb. On 1 January 1944, Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Weeks sent Washington an urgent request for 134 SCR-584 sets.|$|E
