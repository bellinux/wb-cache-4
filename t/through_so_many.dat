5|$|Takanohana finally {{returned}} to the ring in September 2002, after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire. He finished behind Musashimaru on 12–3, the 16th time {{he had been a}} tournament runner-up. Considering how long he had been away, it was seen as an impressive comeback. However, he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence of the knee injury. He made another comeback in January 2003, making a late decision to compete. A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days, and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement. He said he had no regrets and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo. His father spoke of his relief at the decision, after seeing his son battle <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> injuries. Takanohana's record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history, behind only Taihō, Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time. Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister, was among those paying tribute. His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the yokozuna rank and was widely regarded as being the end of an era.|$|E

[...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type for a guy with one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's a pleasant surprise to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of his tales."

500|$|In revisiting {{the film}} in the 1970s, Arthur Schlesinger noted that Hollywood films {{generally}} age well, revealing an unexpected depth or integrity, {{but in the case}} of Gone with the Wind time has not treated it kindly. Richard Schickel posits that one measure of a film's quality is to ask what you can remember of it, and the film falls down in this regard: unforgettable imagery and dialogue are simply not present. Stanley Kauffmann, likewise, also found the film to be a largely forgettable experience, claiming he could only remember two scenes vividly. Both Schickel and Schlesinger put this down to it being [...] "badly written", in turn describing the dialogue as [...] "flowery" [...] and possessing a [...] "picture postcard" [...] sensibility. Schickel also believes the film fails as popular art, in that it has limited rewatch value—a sentiment that Kauffmann also concurs with, stating that having watched it twice he hopes [...] "never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs". Both Schickel and Andrew Sarris identify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being [...] "created" [...] or [...] "directed", but rather having emerged [...] "steaming from the crowded kitchen", where the main creative force was a producer's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to the novel as possible.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted.

500|$|Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of Time {{thought that}} [...] "Because You Left" [...] {{provided}} a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended {{the character of}} Faraday, partially [...] "because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has {{turned him into a}} likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that the premiere [...] "offer compelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as Lost, or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. [...] This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done {{in a way that makes}} most big-screen versions pale in comparison." [...] Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling. [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised the opening sequence, calling it [...] "really, really great … nerd-tastic for [...] hardcore Lost fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic Lost moments and trivia." [...] She concluded that the premiere is [...] "quite good" [...] (three and a half out of four stars) with [...] "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday summed up that [...] "The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work <b>through,</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. [...] A bloated feeling may result." [...] Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle was impressed by the [...] "parallel plotting" [...] of the characters on and off the island in different times. [...] Despite deeming the premiere [...] "riveting" [...] and the script [...] "tantalizing as ever", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that [...] "I may be alone in this, and I hope I will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to [...] "Lost" [...] to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being unstuck in time." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed it [...] "really good, in terms of keeping the momentum from last season going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour." [...] In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks", due to the previous four seasons of [...] "baby steps" [...] that set up the science fiction driven fifth season. [...] Caryn Kunz of the Honolulu Advertiser said that [...] "This was a great episode to get back into every aspect of our favorite show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout." ...|$|E
