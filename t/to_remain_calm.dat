5|$|A {{multi-purpose}} breed, the Norman Cob {{was formerly}} used wherever {{there was a}} need. It was utilized {{in a variety of}} agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery. The postal service used it to pull mail carriages, which it was capable of doing at a fast trot over bad roads for long distances. Postal workers appreciated the breed for its willingness <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>calm,</b> stationary and tethered for long periods of time. Due to the modernization of agriculture and transport, it is now used very little in these areas.|$|E
5|$|In an {{era when}} defencemen were {{expected}} to stay behind during the play, Stuart became known {{for his ability to}} score goals while playing a defensive role, and for his ability <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>calm</b> during matches that often turned violent. He also became known for his work to reduce that violence and to increase the salaries of hockey players. His efforts were acknowledged when the Hockey Hall of Fame was created in 1945 and {{he became one of the}} first nine players to be inducted. He was joined there by his brother Bruce in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>calm</b> despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , {{the ancestors}} of today's draught horses, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>calm</b> in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught animals or not. Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included {{the ancestors of}} the Percheron, agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{has high}} {{personnel}} standards, and selection into the regiment {{is considered the}} most demanding of any entry test in the Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected {{for their ability to}} work in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview. About 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>calm</b> in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary SAS: The Search for Warriors was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary Battle for the Golden Road, had also been produced on the course.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2015 New York Times interview, Klein {{was asked}} {{how best to}} talk to {{children}} about sex. He responded that {{it depends on the}} child, a 4-year-old will probably not notice the conversation (it's still important, or course), older children will need some information and it is best to respond honestly, reflecting the parent's values. A teenager will need to understand what is real and what is fictional entertainment. In all cases it is important <b>to</b> listen, <b>remain</b> <b>calm</b> and make sure the child knows they are not a bad person for having sex questions and that they can ask the parent anything. '"There’s a technical word for the conversations that adults have with their kids when the parents are uncomfortable'" [...] says Klein '"parenting.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{tells of}} a Nottinghamshire coalminer's wife, a young mother, waiting for her husband Walter to come home. She blames his {{drinking}} for his absence.

In contrast, Walter's mother, who lives near the young couple and their children, becomes emotional [...] The presence of pink chrysanthemums throughout the story represents Elizabeth's constant desire for some hint of beauty within her life. One of the miners who brings in Walter's body knocks over the vase of flowers, symbolizing Elizabeth's loss of control over her life.|$|R

During his interview with Milonov, Lucas said that he attempted <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> as <b>calm</b> as possible in order to allow Milonov's remarks to speak for themselves. Although it was not included in the theatrical release, Lucas said he engaged in a debate with Milonov late in the interview, during which Milonov became angry and left. [...] Lucas cited weak opposition in the West to Russia's policies as one of the reasons why he shot the documentary. He said that he hoped to keep the issue in the news by highlighting it.|$|R
25|$|Although Thompson {{acknowledges}} {{similarities between}} African and European cool in shared notions of self-control and imperturbability, {{he finds the}} cultural value of cool in Africa which influenced the African diaspora {{to be different from}} that held by Europeans, who use the term primarily as the ability <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>calm</b> under stress. According to Thompson, there is significant weight, meaning and spirituality attached to cool in traditional African cultures, something which, Thompson argues, is absent from the idea in a Western context.|$|E
