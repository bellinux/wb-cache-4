5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E

5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} {{physical fitness and}} psychological characteristics of patients after cardiac rehabilitation, and to assess predictors of defaulting from the program. METHODS: A prospective study of 1902 consecutive patients admitted to a community-based, hospital-linked cardiac rehabilitation program was conducted {{over a period of}} 6 years and 7 months. The cardiac rehabilitation program centered on a 2 -to 6 -month circuit training course with education, stress management, relaxation, and risk factor monitoring. Before and after the program, measures of physical fitness and of hospital anxiety and depression were performed. RESULTS: The course was completed by 1443 patients (76 %), with 240 patients (13 %) defaulting. For those who completed the course, peak oxygen consumption per minute increased by 3. 2 mL/min/kg (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 1 - 3. 4) or 19 % (95 % CI, 17. 7 %- 20. 3 %). According to the hospital anxiety and depression scores, anxiety fell by 1. 1 (95 % CI, - 1. 3 to - 0. 98) and depression by 1. 3 (95 % CI, - 1. 4 to - 1. 2). The main predictors of defaulting were depression (patients with depression were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to default <b>as</b> nondepressed patients) and diagnosis (patients who had experienced angina or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to default <b>as</b> those who had experienced infarct or coronary artery bypass graft). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of depressed coronary patients known to be at increased risk should be a priority for cardiac rehabilitation coordinators.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the mortality risk associated with cognitive impairment among elderly populations in the community. METHODS. Cognitive impairment and other social and health factors were assessed in 1855 elderly community residents. This sample was reinterviewed periodically to assess changes in health and survival. RESULTS. At baseline 33 % of the sample were mildly impaired and 8 % were severely impaired. Across a 48 -month observation period the survival probability was. 85 for the cognitively unimpaired,. 69 for the mildly impaired, and. 51 for severely impaired respondents. When adjustments were made for the effects of other health and social covariates, severely impaired persons were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to die <b>as</b> unimpaired persons.

We have found a high incidence (25 - 30 %) previously in a population of anaemic, pregnant women in southern Malawi, studied with ultrasound dating. METHODS: Cohort study of 512 unselected pregnant women in rural communities in Malawi. All had ultrasound fetal measurements before 24 weeks. RESULTS: 20. 3 % of women delivered before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Babies born before 37 completed weeks but after 32 weeks (16 %) were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to die <b>as</b> babies born at term (6. 9 versus 3. 4 %) but this difference did not achieve statistical significance.
