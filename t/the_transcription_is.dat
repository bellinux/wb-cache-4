30|$|Soft target {{training}} {{experiments were}} carried out with the 110 - and 300 -h untranscribed data sets. In all experiments where fMLLR transforms are used as inputs to a teacher DNN for soft target training, the transforms are estimated in an unsupervised way and <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> <b>are</b> not used {{even if we have}} assumed some portion of <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> <b>were</b> available when performing supervised training of the teacher DNN (i.e., the 110 -h subset). The unsupervised transforms are computed from lattices using 3 decoding passes with the SAT GMM-HMM baseline.|$|R

50|$|TERRA {{consists}} of both telomeric and subtelomeric regions. <b>The</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> initiated in subtelomeric regions and proceeds in the centromere to telomere direction. TERRA is ubiquitously expressed in most {{all of the}} tissues by {{almost all of the}} mammals studied. TERRA is also expressed in yeasts.|$|E
50|$|The {{initiation}} of <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> a multistep sequential process that involves several mechanisms: promoter location, initial reversible binding of RNA polymerase, conformational changes in RNA polymerase, conformational changes in DNA, binding of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) to the functional RNA polymerase-promoter complex, and nonproductive and productive {{initiation of}} RNA synthesis.|$|E
30|$|The {{lyrics of}} both singing {{databases}} were manually annotated for reference. <b>The</b> <b>transcriptions</b> <b>are</b> used in <b>the</b> supervised adaptation procedure {{and in the}} evaluation of the automatic lyrics recognition.|$|R
30|$|The {{interactive}} {{data was}} analyzed {{based on its}} integrality to capture the signs of participants’ development. The target language used in <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>was</b> English. <b>The</b> <b>transcription</b> conventions <b>were</b> based on <b>the</b> phonetic <b>transcription</b> presented in Cucchiarini (1993). Only the coding conventions that were {{directly related to the}} research goal were employed. A list of <b>transcription</b> conventions <b>were</b> provided in Appendix 1.

5000|$|The metalinguistic {{import of}} the Jabo tonemic {{repertory}} becomes apparent when the attempt {{is made to}} select phonological distinctive features to represent the tonemes, whether binary or n-ary features. This in turn has implications for linguistic universals. However, the possibility exists that Sapir's analysis is overdifferentiated (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> too [...] "narrow" [...] to claim tonemic status).|$|E
50|$|Cyrillization {{systems for}} Korean were {{developed}} domestically in both North Korea (where {{it has been}} proposed to replace the current script in the past) and South Korea; Kontsevich carried out work on the systemisation of these rules. In contrast with some systems of romanization of Korean, <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> based primarily on the pronunciation of a word, rather than on its spelling.|$|E
5000|$|A strict {{transliteration}} of धर्म {{as written}} would be 'dharma' [...] In the modern spoken Hindi of the region, however, {{there is a}} common metathesis in which the vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable of certain words (including धर्म) are transposed, which changes 'dharma' to 'dharam' (pronounced somewhere between [...] and , depending on the speaker). Thus, if the goal of <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> phonetic accord with modern spoken Hindi, then 'dharam' and 'dharm' are both legitimate options.|$|E
5000|$|For consonants, <b>the</b> <b>transcriptions</b> <b>are</b> {{given for}} both initial and final {{position}} in the syllable. For vowels, a dash (" [...] - [...] ") indicates the relative position of the vowel's initial consonant.|$|R

5000|$|The runes on {{the stone}} are [...] Most of these {{characters}} belong to the Elder Futhark , but the final [...] "L" [...] is reversed compared with the last [...] "A", and the second character is a short-twig [...] "A" [...] from the Younger Futhark. <b>The</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> then gaomedal, but is generally thought that the intention is that the second character should be an elder futhark [...] "N" [...] (also reversed). The inscription then reads gnomedal (either [...] "gnome valley", or a personal name [...] "G. Nomedal").|$|E
5000|$|A 2009 {{investigation}} by the BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones alleged that the company transfers voicemail data out of the European Union to call centres in South Africa and the Philippines, in breach of its entry on the UK Register of data controllers, and that most of <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> done by humans rather than software. SpinVox admitted that [...] "parts of messages {{can be sent to}} a 'conversion expert'", but also claimed that [...] "the part sent is anonymised so {{that there is no way}} of tracking back a particular number or person".|$|E
5000|$|The 2001 edition {{consists}} of four sections: The Master of the Key, The Conversation, Who Was He?, and The Prophecy of the Key. The Conversation {{is the centerpiece of}} the book, containing what Strieber calls a [...] "transcription" [...] of the conversation with the Master of the Key. According to Strieber, he was able to reconstruct the conversation from memory {{with the help of a}} single page of notes that had a [...] "mnemonic power". Despite this, Strieber has said that <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> [...] "80 to 90 percent accurate" [...] and [...] "ninety percent accurate or more".|$|E
50|$|The {{text was}} {{transcribed}} from audiotape recordings made by Krishnamurti {{at his home}} in Ojai, California; the recordings took place between February 1983 and March 1984. <b>The</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>was</b> minimally edited by Mary Lutyens, a Krishnamurti biographer and longtime close friend.|$|R

25|$|All {{steps in}} <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>are</b> subject {{to some degree}} of regulation. Transcription {{initiation}} in particular is the primary level at which gene expression is regulated. Targeting the rate-limiting initial step is the most efficient in terms of energy costs for <b>the</b> cell. <b>Transcription</b> initiation <b>is</b> regulated by cis-acting elements (enhancers, silencers, isolators) within the regulatory regions of the DNA, and sequence-specific trans-acting factors that act as activators or repressors. Gene <b>transcription</b> can also <b>be</b> regulated post-initiation by targeting {{the movement of the}} elongating polymerase.|$|R
5000|$|The year is denoted as [...] "xin-hai" [...] {{according}} to the Chinese sexagenary cycle, in which {{the name of the}} year is recycled every 60 years. It generally regarded in Japan to correspond to 471 AD, but Seeley suggests that 531 is a more likely date. The person buried in the tomb, named Wowake, was an influential warrior in the region. King Waka Takiru in <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> thought to be the same person as Ōhatsuse-wakatakeru-no-mikoto as mentioned in the Nihon Shoki, an alias of Emperor Yūryaku. The name Waka Takiru is also apparently mentioned on another inscribed sword, the Eta Funayama Sword.|$|E
5000|$|In Trento's Civic Library, {{there is}} kept a 1602 {{manuscript}} of The City of the Sun (shelf mark BCT1-1538), discovered in 1943 by Italian historian Luigi Firpo. It {{is considered the}} most ancient manuscript copy that has survived to present time. The text arrived at the Library through the baron Antonio Mazzetti's (1781-1841) bequest. He was a book collector and bibliophile and, as written in his will, he donated his book heritage to the Civic Library. The manuscript was restored in 1980. It is made of parchment tied on paperboard. It consists of two codicological unities joined together years after their writing: {{the first is a}} Venetian historical chronicle from 1297 to 1582, followed by a list of [...] "Hospedali di Venezia" [...] ("Hospitals in Venice"). At the bottom, it is sewed to a small-sized booklet independently enumerated: it's a copy by anonymous author of [...] "The City of the Sun". <b>The</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> meticulous and there only are a few insignificant mistakes.|$|E
5000|$|In eukaryotes, <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> {{performed}} by three different RNA polymerase, RNA pol I for ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), RNA polymerase II for messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and some small regulatory RNAs, and the RNA polymeerase III for small RNAs such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The process of {{positioning of the}} RNA polymerase II and the transcriptional machinery require the recognition of a region known as [...] "core promoter". The elements that {{could be found in}} the core promoter include the TATA element, the TFIIB recognition element (BRE), the initiatior (Inr), and the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Promoters in eukaryotes contain {{one or more of these}} core promotes elements (but any of them are absolutely essential for promoter function), these elements are binding sites for subunits of the transcriptional machinery and are involve in the initiation of the transcription, but also they have some specific enhancer functions. In addition, the promoter activity in eukaryotes include some complexities in the way of how they integrate signals from distal factors with the core promoter.|$|E
