5|$|The Rev. Edward Barlow {{invented the}} rack and snail {{striking}} mechanism for striking clocks, {{which was a}} great improvement over the previous mechanism. The repeating clock, that chimes <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. George Graham invented the deadbeat escapement for clocks in 1720.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which Crusoe will reach an {{equilibrium}} between <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> he works and relaxes can be found out when the highest indifference curve is tangent to the production function. This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, {{the slope of the}} highest indifference curve must equal the slope of the production function.|$|E

Convective cloud often forms inland however, especially near hills, reducing <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1,700hours.|$|E

5|$|The Minister for Defence, Senator George Pearce, {{appointed}} McCay to {{the newly}} created post of Inspector General of the AIF on 29 November 1915, with the local rank of major general. McCay was involved in recruiting campaigns, and inspected AIF units and reported on their training and equipment. He proposed a new training regime, with a national syllabus that increased <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> per week of training and the duration of training to twelve weeks. This led to strikes at the camps at Casula and Liverpool. Rioting soldiers clashed with police at Circular Quay and at Central Station striking soldiers were shot and one killed by soldiers sent to return them to Liverpool. As a result, new liquor laws were introduced, including six o'clock closing.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 17 January 1943, 24 Japanese {{aircraft}} attacked Turnbull Field, destroying one of No.6 Squadron's Hudsons and damaging the remainder. While the squadron was unable to conduct any operations for several weeks after this attack, the damaged aircraft were subsequently repaired. In March No.6 Squadron participated in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea by searching for barges and attacking lifeboats carrying survivors from the Japanese ships which had been sunk. Due to the unit's high rate of flying activities, No.6 Squadron's Hudsons increasingly suffered from mechanical problems, and this {{may have contributed to}} a drop in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> flown by the squadron from March 1943. On 20 July No.9 Operational Group, which commanded No.6 Squadron and other RAAF units in New Guinea, banned the squadron's Hudsons from taking part in any further combat operations due to their poor condition. It was decided at about this time to re-equip the squadron with Australian-built Bristol Beauforts. To effect this change No.6 Squadron's Hudson crews flew their aircraft back to Australia and were replaced by new aircrews equipped with Beauforts from September. During this period the squadron's ground crew were frequently used as labourers as they did not have any aircraft to maintain.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} MSHA data on mine {{employment and}} active mining operations during 1986 - 1995. Figures 3 - 1 through 3 - 10 show, for each commodity, {{the location of}} mine operations in 1995, and employee hours and active mining operations by year during 1986 - 1995 for mine operators. For coal and nonmetal operators, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> active mining operations and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> employee <b>hours</b> decreased over the 10 -year period. For metal operators, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> active operations decreased, while <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> employee <b>hours</b> increased. For stone and sand and gravel operators, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> active operations and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> employee <b>hours</b> remained about the same. Figures 3 - 11 and 3 - 12 show that over the 10 -year period, {{there was an increase}} in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> worked by contractors in coal mining, while the overall employment decreased. For metal, nonmetal, stone, and sand and gravel combined, the proportion <b>of</b> contractor <b>hours</b> increased, with overall employment also increasing. Table 3 - 1 shows the distribution <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> worked during 1986 - 1995 by commodity and type of operation. For coal, the majority <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> worked were in underground mines.

25|$|However, {{commitment}} to laissez faire was not uniform and some economists advocated state support {{of public works}} and education. Classical liberals were also divided on free trade, as Ricardo expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs advocated by Richard Cobden and the Anti-Corn Law League would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{behavior}} undergoes {{substantial changes}} during adolescence. Some {{of these changes}} may be societal in humans, but other changes are hormonal. Another important change is the decrease in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> of sleep, as compared to childhood, which gradually becomes identical to an adult. It is also being speculated that homeostatic regulation mechanisms may be altered during adolescence. Apart from this, the effect of changing routines of adolescents on other behavior such as cognition and attention {{is yet to be}} studied.|$|E
30|$|The large {{differential}} between <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> {{spent on}} domestic activities {{for men and}} women may be driven by lower wages for women in the paid market activities compared to men, pushing them to carry out most of the housework activities. The bigger the wage gap, the larger the incentive for women to stay at home. In order to test this assumption we study the determinants of the allocation of time and look for the magnitude and significance of the wage coefficients.|$|R
