40|$|A DNA {{cassette}} containing an Arabidopsis C repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding factor 1 (CBF 1) cDNA and a nos terminator, {{driven by}} a cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter, was transformed into the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) genome. These transgenic <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> were more resistant to water deficit stress than the wild-type plants. The transgenic plants exhibited growth retardation by showing dwarf phenotype, and the fruit and seed numbers and fresh weight of the transgenic <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> were apparently less {{than those of the}} wild-type plants. Exogenous gibberellic acid treatment reversed the growth retardation and enhanced growth of transgenic <b>tomato</b> <b>plants,</b> but did not affect the level of water deficit resistance. The stomata of the transgenic CBF 1 <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> closed more rapidly than the wild type after water deficit treatment with or without gibberellic acid pretreatment. The transgenic <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> contained higher levels of Pro than those of the wild-type plants under normal or water deficit conditions. Subtractive hybridization was used to isolate the responsive genes to heterologous CBF 1 in transgenic <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> and the CAT 1 (CATALASE 1) was characterized. Catalase activity increased, and hydrogen peroxide concentration decreased in transgenic <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> compared with the wild-type plants with or without water deficit stress. These results indicated that the heterologous Arabidopsis CBF 1 can confer water deficit resistance in transgenic <b>tomato</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

25|$|When the {{infection}} occurs {{in an early}} stage of the <b>tomato</b> <b>plant</b> there may be wilting on leaves because Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis enter the plant by wounds, including root wounds, and if the bacterium gets to the xylem then a systemic infection is likely that may plug the xylem vessels. The wilting may only show {{on one side of the}} leaf and may recover during cooler periods. The entire system of xylem within the plant allows the bacteria to form titers of up to 10^9 bacteria per gram of plant tissue. Wilting may eventually spread to all leaves and these leaves, along with their petioles, may also show distorted, curled growth. One way to diagnose a severe vascular infection is to pinch the stem. If the epidermis and outer layer of the cortex separate from the inner stem then you've got a severe vascular infection. These exposed parts will have a soapy feel. Canker lesions, though rare, may develop on the stem. These cankers are necrotic regions where the epidermis is gone. As the bacteria continues its colonization, the canker will deepen and expand. In terms of fruit development, tomatoes may fail to develop altogether or may look marbled because they are ripening unevenly.|$|E

The transgenic <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> exhibited patterns of growth retardation; however, they resumed normal growth after GA 3 (gibberellic acid) treatment.

Seed pretreatment with shikimic acid at various doses induces {{a significant increase in}} total leaf conductivity, transpiration rate and photosynthetic pigments (Chl. a, chl. b and carotenoids) of <b>tomato</b> <b>plants.</b> Furthermore, shikimic acid at various doses applied significantly increased the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in tomato leaves as compared to control non-treated <b>tomato</b> <b>plants.</b> Among all doses of shikimic acid treatment, it was found that 60 ppm treatment caused a marked increase in growth, fruit productivity and quality and most studied parameters of <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> when compared to other treatments. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed in total photosynthetic pigments, concentrations of nitrogen and potassium in leaves of <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> treated with 30 ppm of shikimic acid and control plants.

40|$|Abstract The {{response}} of microconidia from patho-genic and non-pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum to root exudates from <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> inoculated with different pathogenic and non-pathogenic F. oxysporum strains was studied. Root exudates from non-inoculated tomatoes highly stimulated the microconidial germina-tion {{of the two}} tomato pathogens, F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strain Fol 007 and F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici strain Forl 101587. In root exudates from <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> challenged with the pathogen Fol 007 the microconidial germination of Fol 007 was increased, whereas in root exudates from plants challenged with Forl 101587 the microconidial germi-nation of Fol 007 was reduced. Root exudates of <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> challenged with the non-pathogenic unspecific F. oxysporum strain Fo 135 and the biocontrol strain Fo 47 clearly reduced microconidial germination of the pathogenic strain Forl 101587.

40|$|Resistance-breaking (RB) {{isolates}} of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) that {{overcome the}} resistance conferred by the Sw- 5 gene in tomato have {{had only a}} limited spread since they were first detected in north-eastern Spain in 2002. Symptom expression, homogeneity, stability and the transmission capacity of RB and non-resistance breaking (NRB) isolates were biologically compared. The fitness of both types of isolates infecting <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> was determined in competition assays. All TSWV isolates induced similar systemic symptoms {{in a wide range}} of plant species, except RB isolates in tomato carrying the Sw- 5 resistance gene and pepper carrying the Tsw resistance gene. The mechanical transmission of RB isolates to <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> with the Sw- 5 gene failed in some trials, although NRB isolates did not differ noticeably in transmission efficiency when tested with the thrips Frankliniella occidentalis. Biological clones from individual local lesions obtained by mechanically inoculating Nicotiana glutinosa in some TSWV field samples showed that they were biologically homogeneous. Mixed infections of RB and wilt-type isolates were not found. The RB isolates were relatively stable because no reversion to NRB isolates was seen after serial passages in susceptible <b>tomato</b> <b>plants.</b> In competition assays between RB and NRB isolates, after serial passages in susceptible <b>tomato</b> <b>plants,</b> the prevalence of a particular isolate was not related to its capacity to overcome Sw- 5 gene resistance. The low spread of the RB isolates in Spain does not seem to be related to a loss of fitness in <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> or to differences in transmission capacity by thrips, but it could be related to the reduction of the selection pressure of RB isolates as consequence of the gradual replacement of susceptible <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> by resistant <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> by growers. </span...|$|R
