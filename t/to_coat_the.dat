5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E

25|$|Mold {{creation}} - First, each pattern half {{is heated}} to 175-370°C (350-700°F) and {{coated with a}} lubricant to facilitate removal. Next, the heated pattern is clamped to a dump box, which contains a mixture of sand and a resin binder. The dump box is inverted, allowing this sand-resin mixture <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> pattern. The heated pattern partially cures the mixture, which now forms a shell around the pattern. Each pattern half and surrounding shell is cured to completion in an oven and then the shell is ejected from the pattern.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to providing water for plant growth and development, irrigation systems {{can also be used}} for alternative purposes. One of the most common is the dual application of fertilizer with water in a process known as fertigation. Commonly used in drip irrigation systems, this method allows similarly regulate control over how precisely how much fertilizer and nutrients that each vine receives. Another alternative use for sprinkler irrigation systems can occur during the threat of winter or spring time frost. When temperature drop below 32°F (0°C), the vine is at risk of developing frost damage that could not only ruin the upcoming years harvest but also kill the vine. One preventive measure against frost damage is to use the sprinkler irrigation system <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> vines with a protective layer of water that freezes into ice. This layer of ice serves as insulation keeping the internal temperature of the vine from dropping below the freezing mark.|$|E

Leakey turned to fellow conservationist Kuki Gallmann, who described their discussions and experiments in her memoir I Dreamed of Africa. She asked Hollywood special effects professional Robin Hollister what he would recommend, and introduced him to Leakey. Hollister understood Leakey's intention to create a spectacle, and the importance of producing an immediate dramatic flare-up. He suggested a combination of flammable glue <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> tusks, and a hidden system of pipes to spray them with fuel.

Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he wants to do is find his wife and kid. His belief that they still are alive is the emotional drive of the story, but there's not enough deep pain that seeps up <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> dialogue Lincoln delivers." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> <b>the</b> meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E
50|$|Ensure {{there is}} no contact with an electrolyte.

If it is not possible <b>to</b> <b>coat</b> both, <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> should be applied to the more noble, the material with higher potential. This is advisable because if <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> is applied only on the more active material, in case of damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> there will be a large cathode area and a very small anode area, and for the exposed anodic area the corrosion rate will be correspondingly high.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{intermetallic}} compounds formed during the application of an Al– 7 Ni wt % hot-dip multifunctional coating on boron steel, developed for Tailor Welded Blanks (TWB) and hot stamping, 2 – 6 wt % Si was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> reaction layer. <b>The</b> <b>coating</b> was run at 690 °C for 120 s. Al 9 FeNi phases were formed on the steel interface, Fe 2 Al 5 was formed on the steel, FeAl 3 was generated between the existing layers, and flake-type Al 2 Fe 3 Si 3 was formed in the Fe 2 Al 5 phase, depending on the Si content. In addition, as Si was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coating,</b> <b>the</b> thickness of the Fe 2 Al 5 phase decreased and the thickness of the Al 9 FeNi phase and Al 2 Fe 3 Si 3 increased. The decrease in the thickness of the Fe 2 Al 5 phase was mainly due to the effect of the Si solid solution and the Al 2 Fe 3 Si 3 formation in the Fe 2 Al 5 phase. The reason for the growth of Al 9 FeNi is that the higher the Si content in <b>the</b> <b>coating,</b> <b>the</b> more the erosion of the interface of the steel material due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> solution. Therefore, <b>the</b> outflow of Fe into <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> liquid increased...|$|R

Astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space.|$|E
