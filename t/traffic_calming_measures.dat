5|$|The {{construction}} of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> <b>measures</b> on these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} the Fulton Avenue roundabout.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of intersection collision warning systems (ICWSs) and <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> <b>measure</b> on drivers’ behavior, in response to a potential conflict event at the intersections, which constitute a crucial point with respect of the road safety. The drivers’ behavior was analyzed by means of a multivariate variance analysis (MANOVA) procedure. ICWSs were the auditory speech message and the visual warning. Both ICWSs provided to the driver the direction of the violator vehicle. The <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> <b>measure</b> was the dragon teeth. Results show that ICWSs help the drivers’ to detect earlier the violator vehicle and act a safer braking maneuver to avoid the conflict at the intersections.

25|$|The N2 {{crosses the}} River Boyne {{south of the}} village. The road descends a steep hill from the village and makes an almost ninety degree turn onto the 14th-century bridge. This bend has been the scene of at least 20 {{fatalities}} in living memory. As you climb the hill towards Slane village the wall on the right hand {{side of the road}} has a number of small white crosses, each representing a death on this stretch of road. Most of the crashes have involved heavy goods vehicles which are not able to slow down sufficiently to make the sharp bend after picking up speed on the hill. Meath County Council and the National Roads Authority have installed a number of <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> <b>measures</b> over the years in an attempt to make the bend onto the bridge safer, and since their installation, fatal accidents have ceased. It was hoped that the opening of the M1 motorway would divert a lot the heavy traffic from the village but there is evidence that many heavy goods vehicles still use the N2 (and thus Slane bridge) to avoid paying the toll on the M1 bridge.|$|E
500|$|The {{three main}} roads—and Upper Lewes Road, which runs between the Ditchling and Lewes Roads—experience heavy traffic, but little through traffic uses the smaller {{residential}} streets such as Roundhill Crescent.

Shared space schemes, which rely on human instincts and interactions, such as eye contact, for their effectiveness, and are characterised by the removal of traditional traffic signals and signs, and even by the removal of the distinction between carriageway (roadway) and footway (sidewalk), are also becoming increasingly popular.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate if the installation of a physical measure such as a speed hump significantly reduces operating speeds and traffic volumes. Speed control in the residential area has been a critical issue for Traffic Engineers for several decades. <b>Traffic</b> <b>Calming</b> application is becoming one of the major issues in the field of traffic engineering in the United States. <b>Traffic</b> <b>calming</b> is defined as the combination of policies and measures that help correct the negative effects of motorized vehicle use on individuals and society in general by changing the design and role of streets to serve a perspective of transportation, social, and environmental objectives. This paper presents a before and after study conducted in Manatee County, Florida. As a part of this study, a total of six locations were selected which are widely spread apart from each other in the residential areas in Manatee County. The paper describes the effects of each of these strategies on the traffic parameters such as volume, speed, and traffic safety at these locations. Statistical analysis of these data is performed to calculate the level of significance of these results.

5000|$|The Watchman Casualty Reduction Scheme is a <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> <b>measure</b> {{used in the}} United Kingdom. The scheme {{comprises}} various {{methods to}} reduce traffic speed including cameras and Variable Message Signs which flash the speed limit when a driver is going too fast. The cameras do not issue fines or penalty points to the driver, but record the number plate, speed and time of vehicles. The scheme has been very effective on keeping general traffic speeds below the limit of the road. Each Watchman System comes standard with high-speed communications allowing access to live and recorded video images without having to physically visit the unit. This feature allows traffic managers remote access from a PC, laptop or dedicated control room.Each unit can be programmed to take appropriate automatic action upon detecting a certain speed of vehicle, for example, automatically issuing {{a letter to the}} owners of vehicles traveling in excess of 50 mph on a particular stretch of road, or to capture on video the passage of vehicles driving above a certain speed.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether there are quantifiable collision-reduction benefits that result from <b>traffic</b> <b>calming.</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>calming</b> is typically implemented to address speeding and external traf-fic concerns.

40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the impacts of <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> on exhaust emissions, the most detailed and extensive of its kind to date. The main objectives of the work were to measure the effects of different types of <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> <b>measure</b> on vehicle emissions, to develop a system of comparative performance indicators and guidance for local authorities, and to assess and improve the performance of an existing micro-scale emission model in <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> applications. There were several elements to the research which have not previously been reported, including the development of driving cycles for <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> based on external speed measurements and the use of remote sensing to assess the impacts of <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> on emissions in situ. Nine different types of measure were investigated, including a mixture of vertical deflections (e. g. road humps, speed cushions) and horizontal deflections (e. g. chicanes). Driving cycles were formulated to represent vehicle operation before and after the introduction of the schemes, based on traffic speeds measured using both an instrumented car and an external method (LIDAR). Fuel consumption and emissions of CO, HC, NOx, and C 02 from a total of 22 cars (including petrol non-catalyst, petrol catalyst, and diesel vehicles) were measured on a chassis dynamometer using the cycles. Emissions of total particulate matter were also recorded from the diesel vehicles. The results from the laboratory emission tests were used to compare the performance of an 'average speed' emission model (MEET) and a 'modal' emission model (MODEM). Also, an attempt was made to improve the accuracy of MODEM model in such applications by developing a variant model (MODEM-TC) for use in <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> applications. In MODEM-TC the original MODEM emission matrices were replaced with ones derived from the laboratory test results.

40|$|In {{the present}} decade along the {{increasing}} trend of using private vehicles, calming the local streets and residential areas has been important for local authorities. There are many unsuccessful experiences of <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> implementations because of lacking knowledge and engineered assessment before implementing them. Considering the design speed of <b>traffic,</b> <b>calming</b> <b>measure</b> {{is an essential}} factor to employ these measures. Design speed of different size of speed humps is investigated in previous studies because of its circular shape but for speed tables it is unknown. In this research the design speeds of two common speed tables {{in the city of}} Tehran have been examined, 6. 5 and 8. 5 m speed table. For calculating the design speed of the speed tables, we asked 220 drivers to participate in our experiment by installing a GPS tracker in their vehicles and encouraging them to drive normally. Crossing speeds over 6. 5 and 8. 5 m speed tables have been analysed by collecting totally 220 samples. We pick out 100 correct samples for each speed table and the 85 th percentile speed has been calculated for them, consequently the results of 85 th percentile calculation of the crossing speeds have been proposed as the design speeds. For 6. 5 m speed table, design speed is calculated 41. 5 km/h and for 8. 5 m speed table, design speed is calculated 47. 5 km/h. the comparison of recent findings and past finding of 9. 5 m speed table which is used in Denmark with a design speed of 80 km/h reveals that 1 m increasing with the length of a 6. 5 speed table plateau will result 3 km/h increase in its design speed. The findings of this research can help <b>traffic</b> <b>calming</b> experts to take in consideration of the relation between speed table physical characteristics and its design speed. Furthermore by finding the design speed of speed tables, we can choose suitable speed tables for streets with different speed limits according to the design speed of speed tables...|$|R
