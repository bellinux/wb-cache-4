40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 02 - 04, 1967 / Marriott Motor Hotel, Washington, D. C. The {{problem of}} phase {{nonlinearities}} in telemetry-receiving systems is studied. The principal data-degrading effect {{is shown to}} be intermodulation distortion of FDM <b>telemetry</b> <b>signals.</b> Another form of data degradation, namely, intersymbol interference in TDM <b>telemetry</b> <b>signals,</b> is found not to be related directly to phase nonlinearities, but rather to the transient response of the receiving system. The noise-loading technique is introduced as {{an effective means of}} characterizing, analyzing and measuring intermodulation distortion. Some analytical results are cited relating the amount of intermodulation distortion to signal and receiving-system parameters. Analytical details are omitted, the emphasis being placed on interpreting the significance of the results to the telemetry systems engineer.

50|$|As the MA-5 capsule {{reached the}} Canton Island station, Mercury Control {{realized}} that the attitude control system was malfunctioning. A metal chip in a fuel supply line had caused one of the clockwise roll thrusters to fail. The failed thruster allowed the spacecraft to drift from its normal attitude. This drift caused the automatic stabilization and control system to correct the spacecraft attitude. The spacecraft would swing back into the normal 34-degree orbital attitude, and the sequence would start again. The spacecraft repeated this drift and correction process nine times before retrofire. It did it once more between retrofire and the receipt of the 0.05 g (0.49 m/sÂ²) light <b>telemetry</b> <b>signal.</b> The remaining thrusters used 9.5 lb of fuel to keep the spacecraft properly aligned during the second orbit.

50|$|The {{downlink}} <b>telemetry</b> <b>signal</b> was transmitted at 2273 MHz, over a Â±1 MHz bandwidth as a right-hand {{circularly polarized}} signal at a nominal power of 5 W and peak power of 7 W.

An omnidirectional antenna {{can be used}} for uplink and downlink, or a medium gain helix antenna can be used (downlink only). Since the spacecraft was spin-stabilized, the spin resulted in a bias in the Doppler signal due to the spacecraft antenna pattern spinning with respect to the Earth station of 0.417 Hz (27.3 mm/s) for the omnidirectional antenna, and âˆ’0.0172 Hz (âˆ’1.12 mm/s) for the medium gain antenna.

On April 13, 2007, two researchers were studying North Key Largo's population of Key Largo woodrats, one of two federally endangered mammals found only in North Key Largo (the other being the Key Largo cotton mouse). Graduate student / biologist Joanne Potts and her assistant, Wildlife Refuge volunteer Clay DeGayner, were working in KLH and tracking a <b>telemetry</b> <b>signal</b> transmitted by one of several radio collars they had placed on {{a small number of}} woodrats. The signal led them to a python weighing 12-pounds and measuring approximately seven feet in length, the radio signal was coming from inside the python.

The term arraying in this context denotes a method of enhanced reception of <b>telemetry</b> <b>signals</b> in which several antennas are used to track a single spacecraft.
