500|$|Afterwards, McAdams starred with Tim Robbins and Michael Peña in {{the road}} trip comedy-drama <b>The</b> <b>Lucky</b> <b>Ones,</b> a story about three Iraq War {{soldiers}} on a brief road trip back in the United States. She trained at a real boot camp, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, prior to filming. [...] In 2011, McAdams said that Colee Dunn was [...] "probably {{one of my favorite}} characters I've ever played". The film also had a limited release and Laura Kern of The New York Times found her [...] "luminous as always" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times hailed the performance as [...] "her coming of age as an actress". [...] "Previously she has been seen mostly as a hot chick or an idealized sweetheart", he wrote. [...] "Here she is feisty, vulnerable, plucky, warm, funny ... Watch the poignancy of the scene when she meets her boyfriend's family." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly found her [...] "feisty, gorgeous, and as mercurial as a mood ring". <b>The</b> <b>Lucky</b> <b>Ones</b> is the least commercially successful film of McAdams's career as of 2012, having grossed just $266,967 worldwide.|$|E

In 2010, McAdams appeared in her first star vehicle, the comedy Morning Glory. [...] In 2015, her highest profile roles were in the second season of the HBO crime drama True Detective, and as journalist Sacha Pfeiffer in the drama Spotlight.

He's left confused and upset." [...] As scenes from the storyline began to air Brewer made comment on the storyline reassuring viewers adding: [...] "I think they'll be okay with it...

But neither his natural bent nor his mental training inclined him to mechanical or administrative explicitness. Much more was his dream a vision of men inwardly ennobled and united in spirit. He saw history growing reasonable and life visibly noble as mankind realized the divine aim. All the outward peace and order, the joy of physical existence finely conceived, the mounting power and widening aim were but the expression and verification of the growth of God within. Then we would bear children for finer ends than the blood and mud of battlefields. Life would tower up like a great flame. By faith we reached forward to that. The vision grew more splendid as it grew more metaphorical. And the price one paid for that; one gave sham dignities, false honour, a Levitical righteousness, immediate peace, one bartered kings and churches for God....
