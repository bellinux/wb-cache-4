500|$|The whale {{watching}} industry and anti-whaling advocates argue that whaling catches [...] "friendly" [...] whales that are curious about boats, as these whales are {{the easiest to}} catch. This analysis claims that once the economic benefits of hotels, restaurants and other <b>tourist</b> <b>amenities</b> are considered, hunting whales is a net economic loss. This argument is particularly contentious in Iceland, as it has among the most-developed whale-watching operations {{in the world and}} the hunting of minke whales resumed in August 2003. Brazil, Argentina and South Africa argue that {{whale watching}} is a growing billion-dollar industry that provides more revenue than commercial whaling would provide. Peru, Uruguay, Australia, and New Zealand also support proposals to permanently forbid whaling south of the Equator, as Solor (an island of Indonesia) is the only place of the Southern Hemisphere that takes whales. Anti-whaling groups, such as the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), claim that countries which support a pro-whaling stance are damaging their economies by driving away anti-whaling tourists.|$|E

They are regarded as an interesting but incidental feature of the rural landscape, rather than an unusual and historically important aspect of post mediaeval and modern life.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. There {{are some}} common {{characteristics}} of rural communities throughout the world. They tend to lack a good economic infrastructure, essential social <b>amenities,</b> <b>tourist</b> potential, good road infrastructure, literacy, and most importantly, scarcity of sufficient energy supply to meet basic needs, and deteriorating environments due to increasing pressure on available traditional energy resources. Furthermore, rural {{areas in the}} developing countries of South and East Sub-Saharan Africa are characterised by high population ratios, low levels of income, concentration of poverty, significant socio-economic disparities relative to urban area, and a high rate rural-urban migration. The availability of adequate and convenient energy is essential in addressing these priorities of rural development. The development of energy resources for rural areas is, therefore, {{closely linked to the}} economic, social and environmental concerns of mainstream rural development. Unlike growth-driven energy development for industrialisation and urbanisation, rural energy development must consider social and environmental development. More importantly, it must be people-oriented. The result of the study has indicated that the pace of energy transition from traditional to commercial energy in the rural areas of countries in the region has lagged behind that in urban areas, a similar situation to that existing between developing countries and developed countries. Significant rural-urban inequalities in commercial energy supply and consumption exist. Rural communities still continue to rely heavily on traditional energy, mainly biomass resources...|$|R

The adopted methodology approached the problem of the built environment {{and its impact on the}} biophysical environment holistically, taking into account environmental, economic and socio-cultural justice, as main dimensions of sustainable development. This was undertaken in the form of a case study on the coastal area of ZM, along the LCZ. Recommendations in the form of guidelines for the sustainable rehabilitation of the built environment in the area of ZM were developed. These included the roles of all stakeholders in the decision-making process regarding urban development, the municipality, inhabitants, and finally built environment professionals. The literature is very robust, especially regarding the need for bottom-up participatory process where all stakeholders are involved in the policy and implementation process. In contrast, important gaps were found, / [...] . and this relates to the lack of interaction among stakeholders, especially between the municipality authority and the community on the one hand, and between built environment professionals and the rest of the community on the other. This has obvious negative implications for sustainable urban planning and development. Additionally, this study has demonstrated the need for all built environment stakeholders in ZM and, for that matter, in all of Lebanon to commit to sustainable development principles. This commitment is imperative, as it is the, [...] only viable strategy for meeting 'the needs of the present generation without compromising the needs of future generations. It is hoped that this research will contribute significantly to current debates on environmental sustainability in Lebanon, especially during this period of unprecedented physical reconstruction and development, so that the principles of sustainable development will be integrated into national plans, especially urban plans to avoid huge and future correctional expenditure.
