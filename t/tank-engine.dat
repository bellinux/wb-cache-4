I said nothing, but tried him with the Fellow Craft Grip. He answers, all right, and I tried the Master’s Grip, but that was a slip. ‘A Fellow Craft he is!’ I says to Dan. ‘Does he know the word?’ ‘He does,’ says Dan, ‘and all the priests know. It’s a miracle! The Chiefs and the priest can work a Fellow Craft Lodge in a way that’s very like ours, and they’ve cut the marks on the rocks, but they don’t know the Third Degree, and they’ve come to find out. It’s Gord’s Truth. I’ve known these long years that the Afghans knew up to the Fellow Craft Degree, but this is a miracle. A god and a Grand-Master of the Craft am I, and a Lodge in the Third Degree I will open, and we’ll raise the head priests and the Chiefs of the villages.’ ...|$|E

5000|$|There {{are only}} 20 {{standard}} gauge (...) engines with this wheel arrangement that were built for and ran in Europe: class 46 of the Bulgarian State Railways (BDŽ). They were ordered by BDŽ and built {{according to its}} specification by two different manufacturers: 12 engines by H. Cegielski in Poznań, Poland in 1931, and 8 by Berliner Maschinenbau (Schwarzkopf) in Berlin, Germany in 1943. Although {{there is a major}} difference between the two batches—the first 12 engines are type 1′F2′ h2Gt — <b>tank-engine</b> for freight service, two-cylinder system with simple steam expansion (Zwilling) with superheating, while the remaining 8 are 1′F2′ h3Gt — 3-cylinder (Drilling)—all were put into the same class 46 and numbered 46.01 - 46.12 and 46.13 - 46.20. They were designed to haul heavy coal trains on mountainous lines with gradients of about 2.67% (1 in 35.7) and more, and they coped with this hard task very well. Bulgarian railwaymen gave them nickname [...] "Mother Bear" [...] because they looked fat, clumsy and compact. These engines appear to be the most powerful steam locomotives in Europe. Two of them (46.03 of Zwillings and 46.13 of Drillings) are preserved. The Zwilling 46.03 has been restored to working order and made its maiden voyage on steam in May 2015.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} {{is described by}} which orthonormal modal vectors, computed from dynamic test response data, are used to derive mass, stiffness, and damping matrices for a discrete model of the distributed elastic system. Matrices thus computed from subsystems tests may be readily incorporated into larger system models. The method {{has been applied to}} a test of the Saturn V S-II stage LOX <b>tank-engine</b> support system. The dynamic responses of the discrete model are shown to correlate well with test data throughout the frequency range tested...|$|E
