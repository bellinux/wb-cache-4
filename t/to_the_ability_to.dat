5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discoveries made during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt was the Rosetta Stone. It was discovered in 1799, and eventually led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Although the Rosetta Stone was discovered by the French, it actually never made it to the Louvre Museum. It was seized by British Forces following the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Alexandria in 1801. It is now on display at the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Flood was They Might Be Giants' first {{release on}} any major label. Elektra Records {{approached}} the band following the unexpected {{success of their}} second album, Lincoln, which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was {{largely due to the}} work of Susan Drew, an A worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of the label's strategies and resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by many guest musicians on brass and string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the drums for the album.|$|E

5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness relates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it {{is vulnerable to}} breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

25|$|Biofilms {{have become}} {{problematic}} in several food industries due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> form on plants and during industrial processes. Bacteria can survive {{long periods of}} time in water, animal manure, and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment. The buildup of biofilms can affect the heat flow across a surface and increase surface corrosion and frictional resistance of fluids. These can lead to a loss of energy in a system and overall loss of products. Along with economic problems biofilm formation on food poses a health risk to consumers due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> make the food more resistant to disinfectants As a result, from 1996 to 2010 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses per year. Biofilms have been connected to about 80% of bacterial infections in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Musical memory refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} music-related information, such as melodic {{content and}} other progressions of tones or pitches. The differences found between linguistic memory and musical memory have led researchers to theorize that musical memory is encoded differently from language and may constitute an independent {{part of the}} phonological loop. The use of this term is problematic, however, since it implies input from a verbal system, whereas music is in principle nonverbal.|$|E
25|$|Pitch {{constancy}} refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perceive pitch identity across {{changes in}} acoustical properties, such as loudness, temporal envelope, or timbre. The importance of cortical regions lateral to A1 for pitch coding is also supported by studies of human cortical lesions and functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) of the brain. These data suggest a hierarchical system for pitch processing, with more abstract properties of sound stimulus processed further along the processing pathways.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{mainstream}} medical ethics is biased by the assumption of a framework in which individuals are not free to contract with one another to provide whatever medical treatment is demanded, subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> pay.
