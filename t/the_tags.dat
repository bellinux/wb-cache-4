40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} HMAC-based RFID mutual {{authentication}} protocol {{to improve performance}} at the back-end server. In existing hash-based protocols, <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> ID is a secret value for privacy, so the back-end server computes a lot of hash operations or modular operations to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> ID. In our protocol, <b>the</b> <b>Tag</b> ID {{is used as a}} secret key of HMAC and sends <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> ID XOR-ed by a random number, where XOR-ed tag ID is stored at the back-end server and <b>the</b> <b>tag.</b> <b>The</b> XOR-ed <b>tag</b> ID is changed every session like OTP. <b>The</b> <b>tag</b> sends XORed ID to the back-end server for authentication. Thus, simple matching operation is required to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> ID. Therefore, our protocol is much more practical than existing protocols.

25|$|Signaling {{between the}} reader and <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> is done in several {{different}} incompatible ways, depending on the frequency band used by <b>the</b> <b>tag.</b> Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, {{very close to the}} reader antenna because they are {{only a small percentage of}} a wavelength away. In this near field region, <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter in <b>the</b> reader. <b>The</b> <b>tag</b> can modulate <b>the</b> field produced by the reader by changing the electrical loading <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> produces a change that the reader can detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. <b>The</b> <b>tag</b> can backscatter a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> need not respond on a frequency related to the reader's interrogation signal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Traditional Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tag Equipment {{has some}} {{problems}} like these: {{it is difficult}} to realize if <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> is kept out, destroyed, or taken away abnormally.

Besides, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish the right of <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> in <b>the</b> <b>Tag</b> Management. To solve these issues, this paper serves with a method which is based on the Internet of Things（IOT）. It mainly includes as <b>the</b> following: <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> is activated in the Controlled Area, the judgment of <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> access <b>the</b> Controlled Area, whether <b>the</b> <b>tag</b> exists in <b>the</b> Controlled Area or not.

5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The Wild Card {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card, which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it does take away the Wild Card, individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{significant}} challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). <b>The</b> <b>tags</b> view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view {{is based on the}} physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.|$|E

25|$|Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) was a {{development}} of EST methodology {{to increase the}} throughput of <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> generated and allow some quantitation of transcript abundance. cDNA is generated from the RNA but is then digested into 11bp ‘tag’ fragments using restriction enzymes that cut at a specific sequence, and 11base pairs along from that sequence. These cDNA tags are then concatenated head-to-tail into long strands (>500bp) and sequenced using low-throughput, but long read length methods such as Sanger sequencing. Once the sequences are deconvoluted into their original 11 bp tags. If a reference genome is available, these tags can sometimes be aligned to identify their corresponding gene. If a reference genome is unavailable, <b>the</b> <b>tags</b> can simply be directly used as diagnostic markers if found to be differentially expressed in a disease state.|$|E

25|$|Radio-frequency {{identification}} (RFID) uses {{electromagnetic fields}} to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. <b>The</b> <b>tags</b> contain electronically stored information.

RFID is one method for Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{attributes}} the American jackalope's origin to a 1932 hunting outing involving Douglas Herrick (1920–2003) of Douglas, Wyoming. Herrick {{and his brother}} had studied taxidermy by mail order as teenagers, and when the brothers returned from a hunting trip for jackrabbits, Herrick tossed a carcass into the taxidermy store, where it came to rest beside a pair of deer antlers. The accidental combination of animal forms sparked Herrick's idea for a jackalope. The first jackalope the brothers put together was sold for $10 to Roy Ball, who displayed it in Douglas' La Bonte Hotel. The mounted head was stolen in 1977. The jackalope became a popular local attraction in Douglas, where the Chamber of Commerce issues Jackalope Hunting Licenses to tourists. <b>The</b> <b>tags</b> are good for hunting during official jackalope season, which occurs for only one day: June 31 (a nonexistent date as June has 30 days), from midnight to 2 a.m. The hunter must have an IQ greater than 50 but not over 72. Thousands of [...] "licenses" [...] have been issued. In Herrick's home town of Douglas, there is an [...] statue of a jackalope, and the town hosts an annual Jackalope Days Celebration in early June.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that some}} {{versions}} of <b>the</b> <b>tagged</b> Brown corpus contain combined <b>tags.</b> For instance <b>the</b> word [...] "wanna" [...] is tagged VB+TO, {{since it is}} a contracted form of the two words, want/VB and to/TO. Also some tags might be negated, for instance [...] "aren't" [...] would be tagged [...] "BER*", where * signifies <b>the</b> negation. Additionally, <b>tags</b> may have hyphenations: <b>The</b> <b>tag</b> -HL is hyphenated to <b>the</b> regular <b>tags</b> of words in headlines. <b>The</b> <b>tag</b> -TL is hyphenated to <b>the</b> regular <b>tags</b> of words in titles.

30|$|Within the TeL literature, {{there are}} limited and {{sporadic}} studies, which {{have investigated the}} dynamics of social tagging systems applied in LORs.
