40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of the Thrombotest reagent {{used with a}} steel ball coagulometer (KC) to the ISI of the same reagent used with the manual (<b>tilt</b> <b>tube)</b> technique. METHODS: The study {{was carried out by}} eight {{laboratories}} using their own KC instrument and method of testing. All laboratories used the same batch of Thrombotest to determine the clotting times of fresh blood samples from 20 local healthy volunteers and 60 patients on long term oral anticoagulant therapy. KC clotting times were plotted against manual clotting times on double logarithmic scales. Orthogonal regression lines were calculated to assess the ISI. RESULTS: In two laboratories the ISI of the KC method was lower than that of the manual method; these differences, however, were 2 % or less. In the other laboratories no clinically important differences were observed between ISI values obtained. However, the clotting times determined with the KC methods were shorter than the manual values. CONCLUSIONS: The ISI of Thrombotest determined with the KC methods was very similar to the manual value. Therefore, use of the ISI value supplied by the manufacturer without adjustment is justified. The mean normal prothrombin time, however, must be determined locally...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{most common}} mode of {{monitoring}} anticoagulation therapy {{is the use}} of prothrombin time (PT). There exist several methods for reporting results of PT. These include prothrombin time in seconds, prothrombin activity percent, prothrombin time ratio, prothrombin index and international normalized ratio (INR). Different sensitivities of thromboplastins along with various methods of performing the PT test and also different ways of reporting the results of tests have led into discrepancies in lab values among different laboratories which in turn has made appropriate pharmacotherapy with anticoagulation drugs quite difficult. In this study, we have compared different methods of reporting PT results and in vestigated the quality of patient management with warfarin. &# 13; Methods. In this study twenty three blood samples of normal individuals and thirty nine patients under warfarin therapy were collected and PT (INR) was measured. Also, PT kits by Biomerieux/France and the PT kit prepared by our team were compared during these measurements. The method of measuring PT was Manual <b>tilt</b> <b>tube</b> technique. Comparison of different modes of reporting PT was done by linear regression analysis. &# 13; Results. Comparison of the obtained regression lines on PT, PAP, PTR and INR by using the two kits show that INR is independent of the sensitivity of thromboplastin. By considering the recommended therapeutic range of INR, we found that only thirty one percent with Boimerieux kit and twenty eight percent with the prepared PT kit were in the therapeutic range. Eleven percent of patients were sub therapeutic shown by the two kits and fifty eight percent and sixty one percent were above therapeutic range using the Biomerieux kit and the prepared kit, respectively. &# 13; Discussion. Standardization of PT can be done most accurately through reporting PT by INR. The noticeable percentage of patients out of therapeutic range confirmed by both kits shows the inappropriate management of patients receiving warfarin...|$|E
30|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, many studies have been {{published}} on gravity- and pressure-driven two-fluid flows. Some works focused on the experimental and/or numerical investigation of miscible gravity-driven flows (Hallez and Magnaudet 2008; Séon et al. 2004, 2007 a, b). For instance, Séon et al. (2004) studied the buoyant mixing of two fluids in tubes experimentally, evaluating both the tube’s angle of inclination and the contrast in density between the fluids. The fluids had identical viscosities. It was shown that buoyancy-driven mixing in <b>tilted</b> <b>tubes</b> differs significantly from that in the vertical tubes, which was investigated by Debacq et al. (2003). In particular, Séon et al. (2004) demonstrated that Kelvin–Helmoltz instabilities play a crutial role in flows mixing in <b>tilted</b> <b>tubes.</b> Later, Séon et al. (2007 a, b) published more detailed studies on buoyancy-driven flows in nearly horizontal tubes, in which {{the dynamics of the}} mixing front (boundary separating two fluids) were predicted using a CFD-based model.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the effects of viscosity on the stability of a bounded stratified shear flow with Prandtl number Pr much greater than 1. Theoretical results obtained from the solution of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation extended to stratified fluids are compared with experiments performed in a <b>tilting</b> <b>tube</b> filled with water and brine. Theoretical analysis shows that a complete stabilization of the flow field with respect to infinitesimal disturbances is attained, irrespective of the Richardson number J, as the Reynolds number Re decreases below 75. This damping action of viscosity is shown to appreciably reduce the critical Richardson number J(c) with respect to the inviscid limit J(c) = 0. 25, even at moderately high Re. On the other hand, the destabilizing action enhanced by viscosity through the diffusion of momentum leads to a viscous mode of instability that may develop if J decreases below a threshold value. An extensive series of experiments has been carried out in a long <b>tilting</b> <b>tube</b> in order to verify theoretical results.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the concentration and flow fields resulting from the gravitational mixing of two interpenetrating miscible fluids placed in a <b>tilted</b> <b>tube</b> or channel is studied by using direct numerical simulation. Three-dimensional (3 D) geometries, including a cylindrical tube and a square channel, are considered {{as well as a}} purely two-dimensional (2 D) channel. Striking differences between the 2 D and 3 D geometries are observed during the long-time {{evolution of}} the flow. We show that these differences are due to those existing between the 2 D and 3 D dynamics of the vorticity field. More precisely, in two dimensions, the strong coherence and long persistence of vortices enable them to periodically cut the channels of pure fluid that feed the front. In contrast, in 3 D geometries, the weaker coherence of the vortical motions makes the segregational effect due to the transverse component of buoyancy strong enough to preserve a fluid channel near the front of each current. This results in three different regimes for the front velocity (depending on the tilt angle), which is in agreement with the results of a recent experimental investigation.

40|$|We have {{performed}} large-eddy simulation with subgrid scale (LES-SGS) stretched-vortex model of an inclined sonic jet into a supersonic crossflow at Mach 3. 6. The main flow features {{generated by the}} gas-dynamic interactions of the jet with the supersonic crossflow, such as barrel shock, shear layer, and counter-rotating vortex pair, are numerically captured by the employed LES-SGS. The transition and spatial development of the jet into a supersonic crossflow {{have been shown to}} be strongly dependent on the inflow conditions of the crossflow. This result indicates that correct turbulent inflow conditions are necessary to predict the main flow characteristics, dispersion and mixing of a gaseous jet in a supersonic, turbulent crossflow using LES-SGS. This work presents a methodology for the generation of realistic synthetic turbulent inflow conditions for LES of spatially developing, supersonic, turbulent, wall-bounded flows. The methodology is applied to the study of a supersonic turbulent flow over a flat wall interacting with an inclined jet.

40|$|Abstract: Perception of body {{orientation}} and apparent location of objects are altered when humans are using assisted means of locomotion {{and the resultant}} of the imposed acceleration and gravity is no longer aligned with the gravitational vertical. As the otolithic system cannot discriminate the acceleration of gravity from sustained inertial accelerations, individuals would perceive the resultant acceleration vector (GiA) as the vertical. However, when subjects are aligned on the GiA, {{an increase in the}} magnitude of GiA induced a lowering of the apparent visual horizon (i. e. “elevator illusion”). The main aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the contribution of body and egocentric perception in the elevator illusion. While being exposed to 1 G and 1. 3 G and aligned on the GiA acceleration, subjects (N = 20) were asked (1) to set a luminous target to the subjective horizon, (2) to set a luminous target on “straight ahead” position (egocentric task) and (3) to rotate a <b>tilting</b> <b>tube</b> to their subjective perception of body orientation. Results showed that increasing GiA lowered horizon and egocentric settings and induces a backward body tilt perception. Moreover, the elevator illusion can be expressed as the additive combination of two processes: one that is dependent on body tilt perception, and the other that is dependent on egocentric perception. Both misperceptions in hypergravity may be considered to be a consequence of excessive shearing of the otolith organs. However large inter-individual differences in body tilt perception were observed. This last result was discussed in terms of the contribution of extravestibular graviceptors...|$|R

This review summarises recent technical improvements in root observation and imaging, comparing results from various construction materials and installation angles. Both glass and transparent acrylic or polycarbonate tubes have shown a relatively low influence on root behaviour; <b>tilted</b> <b>tubes</b> are preferred to vertically oriented ones, {{in order to avoid}} artefacts, and to horizontal ones, which involve considerable soil disturbance during positioning in their surroundings in the open field. Precise camera positioning systems and new high-resolution (600 DPI and more) digital sensors are currently replacing external-tracked tubes and analog sensors, enhancing image capturing and quality. This allows for frequent root observation throughout the plant cycle and seasons, required for accurate estimation of root dynamics. Although manual and semi-automatic image analysis requires timing and tedious work, {{in the last few years}} minirhizotron systems have been increasingly used, thanks to fundamental advances in image analysis. The development of new algorithms for root detection and measurement in minirhizotron images has speeded up processing and research. The most interesting results in image analysis derive from the integration of luminance intensity- and geometry-based root vs. non-root classifiers. Discrepancies still remain between minirhizotron data and reference core sampling (root quantification) and carbon isotope methods (root turnover). Underestimation in root length mainly regards the top 0. 3 m soil layer, and irreconcilable differences emerge between root life-span and root carbon residence time. A critical point in minirhizotron studies is exact identification of root activity, and most of the previous work was based on manual or semi-automatic visual evaluation (e. g., root appearance/disappearance, colour, shrinking, blotting, cortex degradation). Natural root fluorescence under UV light is only a reliable feature of root activity in some plant species, but interesting perspectives are expected from visible and near-infrared spectral images.

In addition, they found three different regimes for the front velocity (depending on the tilt angle), which was in agreement with the results of experimental investigations (Hallez and Magnaudet 2008). However, it should be mentioned that the authors did not adequately take into account how the mixture viscosity depended on the local concentration of each fluid. In their momentum conservation equations, the kinematic viscosity was taken as a constant. Some other researchers have focused on the displacement of miscible fluids due to an imposed flow. Taghavi et al. (2010) experimentally studied how the flow rate affected the stability of a buoyant exchange flow between two miscible fluids of equal viscosity in a long tube. They measured the evolution of the front velocity (V_f) {{as a function of the}} imposed velocity (U_ 0). It was found that at low values of inflow velocity, U_ 0, there was an exchange-flow-dominated regime characterized by Kelvin–Helmholtz-like instabilities. When U_ 0 increased, it was observed that the flow became stable and V_f increased linearly with U_ 0. However, at a large U_ 0, it was concluded that V_f is almost the same as U_ 0. In another study, using DNS, Sahu et al. (2009) investigated the effect of buoyancy on the dynamics of pressure-driven flow of two miscible fluids in inclined channels. They examined {{the effect of the}} density ratio, Froude number, and channel inclination on the flow dynamics for different Reynolds numbers and viscosity ratios. They showed that the rates of mixing and displacement of the more viscous fluid are enhanced as the density ratio and Froude number increase. Furthermore, these rates are shown to increase when the inclination angle increased and the displaced fluid is the denser one. The most recent research, which is closely related to the case of interest in our study, has been conducted by Taghavi and Frigaard (2013) and Taghavi et al. (2012). They presented a numerical framework for estimating the degree of mixing between successive miscible fluids pumped along a near-horizontal pipe. However, the aspect ratio of their geometry was 100 and, to reduce computational cost, they used a tube with a diameter of 19 mm. It should also be noted that in their study, to estimate the length of the blended zone, only turbulent-turbulent and laminar-laminar configurations were examined.|$|R

We show that in a 2 D $X$-point collapse with a guide-field close {{to the strength of}} the in-plane field, the increased induced shear flows along the diffusion region lead to a new reconnection regime in which electron inertial terms play a dominant role at the $X$-point. This transition is marked by the emergence of a magnetic island - and hence a second reconnection site - as well as electron flow vortices moving along the current sheet. The reconnection electric field at the $X$-point is shown to exceed all lower guide-field cases for a brief period, indicating a strong burst in reconnection.

In this paper, the validity of this simple sheath theory is tested experimentally on the Tore Supra (TS) ITER-like antenna prototype (ILP), together with antenna simulation and post-processing codes developed to compute VRF. The predicted poloidal localization of high-|VRF| zones is confronted to that inferred from experimental data analysis. Surface temperature distribution on ILP front face, as well as ILP-induced modifications of RF coupling and hot spots on a magnetically connected lower hybrid current drive antenna, indicates local maxima of dc plasma potential in both the upper and lower parts of the ILP. This result, qualitatively conforming to VRF simulations, is interpreted in terms of j∥ flowing on ILP frame.

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that physical activity can slow down progression of neurodegeneration in humans. To date, automated ways to induce activity have been predominantly described in rodent models. To study the impact of activity on behavior and survival in adult Drosophila melanogaster, we aimed to develop a rotating tube device “swing boat” which is capable of monitoring activity and sleep patterns as well as survival rates of flies. For {{the purpose of a}} first application, we tested our device on a transgenic fly model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Activity of flies was recorded in a climate chamber using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) System connected to data acquisition software. Locomotor activity was induced by a rotating tube device “swing boat” by repetitively <b>tilting</b> the <b>tubes</b> for 30 min per day. A non-exercising group of flies was used as control and activity and sleep patterns were obtained. The GAL 4 -/UAS system was used to drive pan-neuronal expression of human Aβ 42 in flies. Immunohistochemical stainings for Aβ 42 were performed on paraffin sections of adult fly brains. Daily rotation of the fly tubes evoked a pronounced peak of activity during the 30 min exercise period. Pan-neuronal expression of human Aβ 42 in flies caused abnormalities in locomotor activity, reduction of life span and elevated sleep fragmentation in comparison to wild type flies. Furthermore, the formation of amyloid accumulations was observed in the adult fly brain. Gently induced activity over 12 days did not evoke prominent effects in wild type flies but resulted in prolongation of median survival time by 7 days (32. 6 %) in Aβ 42 -expressing flies. Additionally, restoration of abnormally decreased night time sleep (10 %) and reduced sleep fragmentation (28 %) were observed compared to non-exercising Aβ 42 -expressing flies. On a structural level no prominent effects regarding prevalence of amyloid aggregations and Aβ 42 RNA expression were detected following activity induction. The rotating tube device successfully induced activity in flies shown by quantitative activity analysis. Our setup enabled quantitative analysis of activity and sleep patterns as well as of survival rates. Induced activity in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer’s disease improved survival and ameliorated sleep phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} those factors that produce leg-length insufficiency (LLI) projection errors on AP pelvic x-rays: altered source-to-image distance (SID), altered central ray (CR) position, or altered object-to-film distance (OFD). Method: Femur head height discrepancy as apparent LLI {{was measured using}} a simulated femur head model during altered source-to-image distance (SID) of 100 cm and 180 cm, and altered central ray (CR) projections {{at the level of}} the xiphisternum (X), umbilicus (U), at the femur head height (FH), and {{at the level of the}} femur heads with a <b>tube</b> <b>tilt</b> to the umbilicus level (FHT) on AP pelvic x-rays. Altered OFD of + 3 cm, 0 cm, and - 3 cm from neutral were created by manipulating the model. Results: The greatest LLI error was at the CR position of X and U with altered OFD of + 3 cm and - 3 cm, which produced LLI errors of up to 9 and 8. 5 mm respectively. The SID of 100 cm resulted in greater LLI error across conditions than the SID of 180 cm. The condition with the lowest LLI error was the CR at FH with a SID of 180 cm. Conclusion: The use of standard AP full-spine x-ray centred at X, and the standard AP lumbo- pelvic x-ray centred at U, to determine LLI is invalid due to the possibility of high LLI error at these CR positions created by pelvic rotation. This work calls into question the validity of measuring LLI with x-ray unless a CR at FH is used with a SID of 180 cm. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Currently, DNA {{extraction}} {{methods have}} a number of drawbacks. These are mainly related to the use of hazardous chemicals in the liquid-based method, high costs and the non-reusable spin column kits for the solid-phase method. Here, research has been conducted to attempt to extract DNA out of bacteriophage ??X 174 as a model virus. In this method, high shear stress was imparted onto the phage {{through the use of a}} vortex fluidic device (VFD). The aims of the study were to simplify the process of viral DNA extraction. We attempted to use the high shear forces in the VFD to shear open the capsid. This process would result in the release of DNA into solution and an empty, intact capsid after the process. For this work, bacteriophage ??X 174 was processed under a wide range of VFD processing parameters. These include the use of variable sample tube sizes at different sample <b>tube</b> <b>tilt</b> angles: (0 ??, 45 ??, and 90 ??). Importantly, the rotational speed of the sample tube was varied (2000 - 8000 rpm) and studies into the effect of vibrations on the fluid flow. In a novel approach, the bacteriophage was exposed to laser radiation combined with high levels of shear force. The effect of VFD-mediated processing was assessed by six techniques including: UV-Vis spectroscopy (in-situ and post), dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, flow cytometry and gel electrophoresis. The results obtained suggest that there is phage fragmentation occurred during the VFD-mediated process, but DNA in solution was not being detected. This implied that the DNA in solution might be in a too lower concentration for the detection method we employed. Therefore, further studying this VFD-mediated process for viral DNA extraction is still feasible and should be continued to create an analysis that is suited for low concentrations of DNA...|$|R
40|$|Buoyancy-driven {{turbulent}} mixing of fluids of slightly different densities [At = Δρ/(2 〈ρ〉) = 1. 15 × 10 − 2] {{in a long}} circular <b>tube</b> <b>tilted</b> at an angle θ = 15 ° from the vertical is studied at the local scale, both experimentally from particle image velocimetry and laser induced fluorescence measurements in the vertical diametrical plane and numerically throughout the tube using direct numerical simulation. In a given {{cross section of the}} tube, the axial mean velocity and the mean concentration both vary linearly with the crosswise distance z from the tube axis in the central 70 % of the diameter. A small crosswise velocity component is detected in the measurement plane and is found to result from a four-cell mean secondary flow associated with a nonzero streamwise component of the vorticity. In the central region of the tube cross section, the intensities of the three turbulent velocity fluctuations are found to be strongly different, that of the streamwise fluctuation being more than twice larger than that of the spanwise fluctuation which itself is about 50 % larger than that of the crosswise fluctuation. This marked anisotropy indicates that the turbulent structure is close to that observed in homogeneous turbulent shear flows. Still in the central region, the turbulent shear stress dominates over the viscous stress and reaches a maximum on the tube axis. Its crosswise variation is approximately accounted for by a mixing length whose value is about one-tenth of the tube diameter. The momentum exchange in the core of the cross section takes place between its lower and higher density parts and there is no net momentum exchange between the core and the near-wall regions. A sizable part of this transfer is due both to the mean secondary flow and to the spanwise turbulent shear stress. Near-wall regions located beyond the location of the extrema of the axial velocity (|z|≳ 0. 36  d) are dominated by viscous stresses which transfer momentum toward (from) the wall near the top (bottom) of the tube...|$|R
40|$|Project 1 : Physics {{characterization}} of TLD- 600 and TLD- 700 Purpose: It {{is suggested that}} a pair of TLD- 600 and TLD- 700 can measure the exposure in neutron-photon mix fields. But the basic information of physics {{characterization of}} TLD- 600 and 700 are not available. The {{purpose of this study}} was study the individual TLD variation and the energy dependence of TLD- 600 and TLD- 700. Methods: The individual calibration factors for 52 TLD- 600 chips and 51 TLD- 700 chips were determined under x-ray beams of 60 kVp, 80 kVp, 120 kVp, a mono-energetic 662 keV gamma beam of a Cs- 137 source, and an Am-Be neutron beam (4. 4 MeV). The individual calibration factor was calculated as the ratio of the group average response in uC/mR and the individual response in uC/mR. In addition, energy corrections factors for the individual calibration factors were determined, from each of the x-ray beams (60 kVp, 80 kVp, 120 kVp) to the 662 keV Cs- 137 gamma beams. Results: For TLD- 600, the range and relative standard deviation of the individual calibration factors are: 60 kVp (0. 94003 - 1. 0927, 3. 5369 %), 80 kVp (0. 9395 - 1. 0867, 3. 0952 %), 120 kVp (0. 83403 - 1. 0796, 4. 5732 %), 662 keV (0. 80465 - 1. 1926, 9. 2515 %), AmBe (0. 91740 - 0. 94905, 3. 0882 %); and the energy corrections factors relative to the 662 keV Cs- 137 beams are: 60 kVp (1. 2223), 80 kVp (1. 1013), 120 kVp (1. 0299). For TLD- 700 the range and relative standard deviation of the individual calibration factors are: 60 kVp (0. 94351 - 1. 0630, 2. 6044 %), 80 kVp (0. 91690 - 1. 0614, 2. 6996 %), 120 kVp (0. 95697 - 1. 0474, 2. 3606 %), 662 keV (0. 91348 - 1. 2270, 4. 2243 %), AmBe (0. 79330 - 1. 2268, 9. 1577 %); and the energy corrections factors relative to the 662 keV Cs- 137 beams are: 60 kVp (1. 0373), 80 kVp (0. 97661), 120 kVp (0. 88532). Conclusion: We have measured individual calibration factors and the average energy correction factors for photon beams and Am-Be neutron beams. Our results will be used in the future experiments and measurements with TLD- 600 and TLD- 700. Project 2 : Acceptance testing of new X-RAD 160 Biological X-Ray Irradiator Purpose: An X-RAD 160 Biological X-Ray Irradiator was recently installed at Duke University to serve as a key device for cellular radiobiology research. The purpose of this study is to perform acceptance testing on the new irradiator for operator radiation safety and irradiation specifications. Methods: The acceptance testing included tests of the following components: (1) Leakage radiation survey, (2) Half-value layer (beam quality), (3) Uniformity, (4) KVp accuracy, (5) Exposure at varying mA (linearity of mA), (6) Exposure at varying kVp, (7) Inverse square measurements, (8) Field size measurement, (9) Exposure constancy. The irradiation parameters for each components of first round of acceptance testing performed on September 21, 2012 were: Leakage radiation survey (none, 160 kVp, 18 mA, 200 s), Beam quality (40 cm, 50 - 140 kVp in 10 kVp incensement, 1 mA, 10 s, none), Uniformity (40 cm, 160 kVp, 18 mA, 15 s, F 1), KVp accuracy (40 cm, 50 - 150 kVp in 10 kVp incensement, 10 mA, 15 s, none), Linearity of mA (40 cm, 160 kVp, 2 - 18 mA, 15 s, none), Inverse square measurements (20 - 63 cm, 160 kVp, 1 mA, 30 s, none), Field size measurement (40 cm, 160 kVp, 10 mA, 15 s, none), Exposure constancy (40 cm, 160 kVp, 18 mA, 20 s, none). The irradiation parameters for each components for each components of second round of acceptance testing performed on November 18, 2012 were: Beam quality (40 cm, 35 - 150 kVp, 1 mA, 10 s, F 1), KVp accuracy (40 cm, 35 - 150 kVp, 1 mA, 10 s, F 1), Variation of kVp (40 cm, 160 kVp, 18 mA, 30 s, F 1), Linearity of mA (40 cm, 160 kVp, 1 - 18 mA, 30 s, F 1), Uniformity (40 cm, 160 kVp, 18 mA, 30 s, F 1), Inverse square measurements (20 - 63 cm, 160 kVp, 18 mA, 30 s, F 1). Results: The first round of acceptance testing performed on September 21, 2012 failed due to the fact that the measured exposure along the X-axis was significantly non-uniform; the exposure greatly decreases going in the left direction, which is a clear indication of un-corrected anode heel effect. After the X-ray tube was returned to the manufacturer, the beam was reconfigured by <b>tilting</b> the X-ray <b>tube.</b> Another round of acceptance testing was performed on December 18, 2012.
