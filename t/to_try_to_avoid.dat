5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal {{has changed over}} the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were the}} reigning UEFA Cup champions, they had beaten Belgian team Club Brugge 4–3 on {{aggregate}} {{to win the}} 1975–76 UEFA Cup. Liverpool entered the competition as English champions having won the 1975–76 Football League First Division. They were drawn against the Northern Irish champions Crusaders in the first round. The first leg was a home tie at Anfield, which Liverpool won 2–0 courtesy of a Phil Neal penalty and a John Toshack goal. The second leg away at Seaview, was won 5–0 by Liverpool. Four of the goals were scored within nine minutes {{of the end of}} the match, to make the scoreline seem more one-sided than the match actually was. Liverpool won the tie 7–0 and were drawn against Turkish champions Trabzonspor in the second round. The first leg was played in Turkey at Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadium. Liverpool's plan was <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> defeat, however that plan failed when Trabzonsor were awarded a penalty midway through the second half. Trabzonspor converted the subsequent penalty and won the match 1–0. Liverpool recovered in the second leg at Anfield. Three goals early in the first half meant they won the match 3–0 to win the tie 3–1 on aggregate and progress to the quarter-finals.|$|E

40|$|In this {{commentary}} I {{reflect upon}} the conceptualisation of human meaning-making, utilised {{in the two}} target articles, that relies heavily on speech as the main mode of semiosis and considers time only in its chronological form. Instead I argue that human existence is embodied and lived through multiple modalities, and involves not only sequential experience of time, but also experience of emergence. In order to move towards a conception of meaning-making that takes this into account, I introduce the social-semiotic theory of multimodality (Kress 2010) and discuss notions of ‘real duration’ (Bergson 1907 / 1998) and ‘lived time’ (Martin-Vallas 2009). I argue that dialogical (idiographic) researchers need to develop analytic and methodological tools that allow exploring the emergence of multimodal assemblages of meaning in addition <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the monologisation of complex dynamic dialogical phenomena...|$|R

CSUN pressed and pressed the attack, out-shooting the Cougars 13 to 8, but the home team's defense turned away attack after attack, and Dal Santo made 6 saves in addition to preventing own-goals by corralling balls headed by Cougars that went off the post and the crossbar.

40|$|Mindfulness, an {{attentive}} non-judgmental {{focus on}} "here and now" experiences, has {{been incorporated into}} various cognitive behavioral therapy approaches and beneficial effects have been demonstrated. Recently, mindfulness has also {{been identified as a}} potentially effective emotion regulation strategy. On the other hand, emotion suppression, which refers <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> or escape from experiencing and being aware of one's own emotions, has been identified as a potentially maladaptive strategy. Previous studies suggest that both strategies can decrease affective responses to emotional stimuli. They would, however, be expected to provide regulation through different top-down modulation systems. The present study was aimed at elucidating the different neural systems underlying emotion regulation via mindfulness and emotion suppression approaches. Twenty-one healthy participants used the two types of strategy in response to emotional visual stimuli while functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted. Both strategies attenuated amygdala responses to emotional triggers, but the pathways to regulation differed across the two. A mindful approach appears to regulate amygdala functioning via functional connectivity from the medial prefrontal cortex, while suppression uses connectivity with other regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Thus, the two types of emotion regulation recruit different top-down modulation processes localized at prefrontal areas. These different pathways are discussed...|$|R
