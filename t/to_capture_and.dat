5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} machinations of Yelü Yixin, {{the only other}} event of note from Emperor Daozong's rule was a war fought between 1092 and 1102 between the Liao and a Mongolian, {{possibly}} Tatar tribe, group known as the Zubu. The Zubu were located at the northwest border of Liao territory and had fought several wars with the Liao when the Liao tried to expand in that direction. In 1092 the Liao attacked several other tribes in the northwest, and by 1093 the Zubu attacked the Liao, striking deep into Khitan territory. It took until 1100 for the Liao <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> kill the Zubu chieftain, and another two years to fight off the remaining Zubu forces. The war against the Zubu was the last successful military campaign waged by the Liao dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Ermanaric's great-nephew, Vinitharius, who disliked {{being under}} Hun rule, withdrew his forces and marched against the Antes {{in order to}} defeat them and to show his courage.

Boz, the king of the Antes (rex Antorum), had organized an alliance to defend the Antes, and managed to defeat Vinitharius in their first encounters, however, Vinitharius fought valiantly and managed <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> crucify Boz, together with his sons and 70 of his chiefs (primates). Vinitharius left their bodies hanging to induce fear in those who had surrendered. These conflicts constitute the only pre-6th century contacts between Germanics and Slavs documented in written sources.|$|E

While venturing the streets, Magnus finds herself under attack by a savage humanoid creature, but is saved by two men in Hazmat suits, who proceed <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> decontaminate her. Magnus is later shocked to discover that her protégé, Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne), {{is the leader of}} the survivalist group. Unlike his original personality, Zimmerman is acting far more violent and aggressive, and believes Magnus to be an imposter, citing she died three years ago. As more creatures attack the base, Magnus escapes and returns to the Sanctuary, where on the way she is joined by a young girl, Jessica Mitchell (Nicole Muñoz).|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of the South West Pacific Area, selected Morotai as the location for air bases and naval facilities needed to support the liberation of Mindanao in the Philippines, which at the time was planned for 15 November. While Morotai was undeveloped, it was preferred over Halmahera as the larger and much better-defended island was judged too difficult <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> secure. The occupation of Morotai was designated Operation Tradewind. The landing was scheduled to take place on 15 September 1944, the same day as the 1st Marine Division's landing at Peleliu. This schedule allowed {{the main body of the}} United States Pacific Fleet to simultaneously protect both operations from potential Japanese counter-attacks.|$|E

Recovering Hambleton quickly was essential, as the odds of recovering downed airmen dropped below twenty percent if the aircrew member {{was on the ground}} after four hours. But their efforts would be severely hampered by the huge number of troops and large quantity of anti-aircraft fire in the area, some of it supporting the NVA's efforts <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> protect the Cam Lo Bridge near Hambleton's position.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{read this}} Ultra {{intelligence}} {{in the office of}} the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February. The prospect of an additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his plans <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> develop the area. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stephen Báthory {{had decided}} to secure the Bishopric of Kraków for his nephew, but the Holy See did not appoint Andrew coadjutor bishop of the Kraków See, because he was still too young. The king wanted to invade Russia and sent Andrew to Rome to {{convince}} Pope Sixtus V to support his plan. Andrew left Poland on 22 March 1586.

5|$|Sharp {{divisions}} among rebel factions {{became apparent}} during a second meeting in Saqba on 5 December. According to Syrian journalist Munir al-Rayyes, hostility between al-Kharrat and al-Shallash was well-known among the rebels. Because al-Shallash had levied war {{taxes on the}} major landlords and city elites of the Ghouta, al-Kharrat's benefactor al-Bakri viewed him {{as a threat to}} the traditional landowning class to which al-Bakri belonged. Al-Rayyis claimed the meeting was called for by al-Kharrat, who ordered his fighters <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>and</b> bring al-Shallash to Saqba. However, according to al-'As, the summit was called by al-Shallash, and once the latter arrived in the village, al-Kharrat personally detained him and confiscated his horse, weapons and money.|$|E
