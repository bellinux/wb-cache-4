George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> with both very fast and very slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. They co-wrote two more papers on fission. Their first paper appeared in Physical Review on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Other {{possibilities}} {{to synthesize}} nuclei {{on the island}} of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus. Such nuclei tend <b>to</b> <b>fission,</b> expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium-40, tin-132, lead-208, or bismuth-209. Recently {{it has been shown that}} the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as uranium and curium) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability, although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or seaborgium is more favored. One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at 258–260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108), mimicking the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed. Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10−12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, {{neutrons}} {{from earlier}} stage fusion reactions {{can be used}} <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> lithium-6 (in the form of lithium deuteride for example) and form tritium during detonation. This approach reduces the amount of tritium-based fuel in a weapon.|$|E

25|$|Achieving {{start-stop}} interstellar trip {{times of}} less than a human lifetime require mass-ratios of between 1,000 and 1,000,000, even for the nearer stars.

25|$|Finally, {{the heat}} for fusion {{ignition}} {{comes not from}} the primary but from a second fission bomb called the spark plug, embedded {{in the heart of}} the secondary. The implosion of the secondary implodes this spark plug, detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it, but the spark plug then continues <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> in the neutron-rich environment until it is fully consumed, adding significantly to the yield.|$|E
25|$|The only {{practical}} way to capture most of the fusion energy is to trap the neutrons inside a massive bottle of heavy material such as lead, uranium, or plutonium. If the 14 MeV neutron is captured by uranium (of either isotope; 14 MeV is high enough <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> both 235U and 238U) or plutonium, the result is fission {{and the release of}} 180 MeV of fission energy, multiplying the energy output tenfold.|$|E
5000|$|The key to {{maintaining}} a nuclear reaction within {{a nuclear reactor}} {{is to use the}} neutrons released during <b>fission</b> <b>to</b> stimulate <b>fission</b> in other nuclei.

25|$|Uranium's {{most common}} isotope, U-238, is {{fissionable}} but not fissile (meaning that it cannot sustain {{a chain reaction}} by itself but can be made <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> with fast neutrons). Its aliases include natural or unenriched uranium, depleted uranium (DU), tubealloy (Tu), and 28. It cannot sustain a chain reaction, because its own fission neutrons are not powerful enough to cause more U-238 fission. The neutrons released by fusion will fission U-238. This U-238 fission reaction produces most of the energy in a typical two-stage thermonuclear weapon.|$|E
25|$|In Heretics of Dune, the Honored Matres destroy Arrakis and the Tleilaxu, {{in part to}} {{eliminate}} spice production and thus irrevocably damage the Old Empire.

Mimicking the devolvement of the God Emperor Leto II, they submerge the worm in spice-rich water, causing it <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> into its component sandtrout.

25|$|About 6 MeV of the fission-input {{energy is}} {{supplied}} by the simple binding of an extra neutron to the heavy nucleus via the strong force; however, in many fissionable isotopes, this amount of energy {{is not enough for}} fission. Uranium-238, for example, has a near-zero fission cross section for neutrons of less than one MeV energy. If no additional energy is supplied by any other mechanism, the nucleus will not fission, but will merely absorb the neutron, as happens when U-238 absorbs slow and even some fraction of fast neutrons, to become U-239. The remaining energy to initiate fission can be supplied by two other mechanisms: one of these is more kinetic energy of the incoming neutron, which is increasingly able <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> a fissionable heavy nucleus as it exceeds a kinetic energy of one MeV or more (so-called fast neutrons). Such high energy neutrons are able <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> U-238 directly (see thermonuclear weapon for application, where the fast neutrons are supplied by nuclear fusion). However, this process cannot happen to a great extent in a nuclear reactor, as too small a fraction of the fission neutrons produced by any type of fission have enough energy to efficiently fission U-238 (fission neutrons have a mode energy of 2 MeV, but a median of only 0.75 MeV, meaning half of them have less than this insufficient energy).|$|E
50|$|Yield {{is usually}} stated as {{percentage}} per fission, {{so that the}} total yield percentages sum to 200%.

5000|$|To improve [...] {{and enable}} a chain reaction, uranium-fueled {{reactors}} must include a neutron moderator that interacts with newly produced fast neutrons from <b>fission</b> events <b>to</b> reduce their kinetic energy from several MeV to thermal energies {{of less than}} one eV, making them more likely <b>to</b> induce <b>fission.</b> This is because 235U {{is much more likely}} <b>to</b> undergo <b>fission</b> when struck by one of these thermal neutrons than by a freshly produced neutron from fission.|$|R
25|$|Reactors {{that use}} the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle require fast {{reactors}} to sustain breeding, because only with fast moving neutrons does the fission process provide more than 2 neutrons per fission. With thorium, {{it is possible to}} breed using a thermal reactor. This was proven to work in the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, whose final fuel load bred slightly more fissile from thorium than it consumed, despite being a fairly standard light water reactor. Thermal reactors require less of the expensive fissile fuel to start, but are more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> products left in the core.|$|E
25|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of uranium dioxide is low; it {{is affected by}} porosity and burn-up. The burn-up results in fission products being dissolved in the lattice (such as lanthanides), the precipitation of fission products such as palladium, the formation of fission gas bubbles due <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> products such as xenon and krypton and radiation damage of the lattice. The low {{thermal conductivity}} can lead to overheating of the center part of the pellets during use. The porosity results in a decrease in both the thermal conductivity of the fuel and the swelling which occurs during use.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale {{reactors}} using neutronic fuels (e.g. ITER) {{and thermal}} power production (turbine based) are most comparable <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> power from an engineering and economics viewpoint. Both fission and fusion power stations involve a relatively compact heat source powering a conventional steam turbine-based power station, while producing enough neutron radiation to make {{activation of the}} station materials problematic. The main distinction is that fusion power produces no high-level radioactive waste (though activated station materials {{still need to be}} disposed of). There are some power station ideas that may significantly lower the cost or size of such stations; however, research in these areas is nowhere near as advanced as in tokamaks.|$|E

25|$|Bretscher and Feather argued, on {{theoretical}} grounds, {{that this}} element might {{be capable of}} fission by both fast and slow neutrons like uranium-235. If so, this promised another path to an atomic bomb, {{as it could be}} bred from the more abundant uranium-238 in a nuclear reactor, and separation from uranium could be by chemical means, as it was a different element, thereby avoiding the necessity for isotope separation. Kemmer suggested that since uranium was named after the planet Uranus, element 93 could be named neptunium and 94 plutonium after the next two planets. Later it was discovered that the Americans had independently adopted the same names, following the same logic. Bretscher and Feather went further, theorising that irradiation of thorium could produce a new isotope of uranium, uranium-233, which might also be susceptible <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> by both fast and slow neutrons.|$|E
25|$|An eight-period table {{containing}} {{this block}} was suggested by Glenn T. Seaborg in 1969. IUPAC defines an element to exist if its lifetime {{is longer than}} 10−14 seconds, which is {{the time it takes}} for the nucleus to form an electron cloud. No elements in this region have been synthesized or discovered in nature. The first element of the g-block may have atomic number 121, and thus would have the systematic name unbiunium. Elements in this region are likely to be highly unstable with respect to radioactive decay, and have extremely short half lives, although element 126 is hypothesized to be within an island of stability that is resistant <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> but not to alpha decay. It is not clear how many elements beyond the expected island of stability are physically possible, whether period 8 is complete, or if there is a period 9.|$|E
25|$|PWRs are {{designed}} to be maintained in an undermoderated state, meaning that there is room for increased water volume or density to further increase moderation, because if moderation were near saturation, then a reduction in density of the moderator/coolant could reduce neutron absorption significantly while reducing moderation only slightly, making the void coefficient positive. Also, light water is actually a somewhat stronger moderator of neutrons than heavy water, though heavy water's neutron absorption is much lower. Because of these two facts, light water reactors have a relatively small moderator volume and therefore have compact cores. One next generation design, the supercritical water reactor, is even less moderated. A less moderated neutron energy spectrum does worsen the capture/fission ratio for 235U and especially 239Pu, meaning that more fissile nuclei fail <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> on neutron absorption and instead capture the neutron to become a heavier nonfissile isotope, wasting one or more neutrons and increasing accumulation of heavy transuranic actinides, some of which have long half-lives.|$|E
