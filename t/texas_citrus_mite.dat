We compared the population fluctuation of pest mites in twenty citrus scion cultivars grafted on Rangpur lime (Citrus limonia). Adults of citrus rust mite Phyllocoptruta oleivora (Acari: Eriophyidae), <b>Texas</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>mite</b> Eutetranychus banksi and Tetranychus mexicanus (Acari:Tetranychidae) were monthly counted in each scion cultivar from April 2011 to February 2013 in Sergipe state, northeastern Brazil. Larger E. banksi population peak was recorded on sweet orange ‘Valência Montemorellos’ in February 2012 compared to the other cultivars and larger populations of T. mexicanus were found on sweet orange ‘Lima’ in January 2013 in comparison to acid limes ‘Tahiti IAC 5 ’ and ‘IAC 5 - 1 ’. The population of P. oleivora, however was not different among scion cultivars and varied only with time. Abiotic and biotic variables were important mechanisms underlying such responses. We conclude that the abundances of the mites E. banksi and T. mexicanus were influenced by scion cultivars only in some periods, suggesting putative resistance mechanisms in some genotypes to these pests...|$|E

The Dixit-Pindyck model employed in this research is an investment analysis technique building on orthodox investment analysis (based on net present value calculations) to account for uncertainty and irreversibility by incorporating the value of the option to wait to invest into a modified investment decision rule. The Dixit-Pindyck model applies because an investment in a citrus grove involves a large, irreversible (sunk cost) component. The research was conducted in four stages. First, based on a historical review of the <b>Texas</b> <b>citrus</b> industry, prices and freezes were modeled as key sources of uncertainty. Second, the environmental effects from growth associated with expanded trade-specifically, water scarcity, congestion, and the opportunity cost of land [...] were identified as factors likely to affect future investments in <b>Texas</b> <b>citrus.</b> Third, information and data pertaining to these variables were obtained through interviews with experts to develop a profile of a prototypical citrus investment opportunity.

And then the treated fruits were stored at 4 °C and the nutrient composition was studied in the following days. The results showed that the shelf-life could be extended when fruits were irradiated in the dose range of 0. 2 – 0. 4 kGy, while most unirradiated citrus decayed by 15 d. It also turned out that the citrus irradiated at 0. 5 and 0. 6 kGy were fully decayed within 45 d of refrigerated storage. The content of total soluble solids (TSS), total sugar, ascorbic acid (AA), and titratable acidity had no significant differences compare to those of the control during the 15 d storage period. Nevertheless, the activities of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased after 15 d; the improvement of storage quality and shelf life may be explained by the change of the protective enzyme activity.

30|$|An antipredator defence in the <b>citrus</b> red <b>mite</b> Panonychus citri, {{which does}} not produce {{protective}} webs, was examined experimentally. P. citri adult females lie down on citrus leaf surfaces with their dorsal setae (hair) directed in all upper directions. They seldom move in response to physical stimuli. Compared to normal lying females, both manipulated non-lying females and hair-removed females suffered higher predation by predatory mites. A predator approaching the body surface of a lying female inevitably created elasticity with a confronting seta, which eventually repelled the predator away from the female. These observations indicated that lying down with protective setae functions as an antipredator defence in P. citri females. This inflexible defence could also explain why the mite rarely runs away, {{even when it is}} consumed together with host plant leaves (via coincidental intraguild predation) by gigantic swallowtail caterpillars, against which protective setae are totally ineffective.|$|R

In Tieu mandarin, the use of agrochemicals was higher than in sweet orange, and pest risk assessment was not correlated with ant abundance, except for aphid infestation, which was rated lower. The number of sprays targeting a particular pest was positively correlated both with pest incidence and severity ratings and was negatively correlated with ant abundance. Irrespective of O. smaragdina abundance, citrus leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella {{was one of the}} major spray targets. <b>Citrus</b> red <b>mite</b> Panonychus citri was the most important target in Tieu mandarin, accounting for > 30 ␘f all target sprays. Stimulating O. smaragdina as a biological control agent in Tieu mandarin will only be successful when <b>citrus</b> leafminer and <b>mites</b> can be controlled simultaneously without excessive chemical treatments. The concept of ant predation, well known by most farmers, {{could be used as a}} starting point to educate farmers about the existence and role of predatory mites. Farmer participatory training and research that focuses on experiential learning and field observations offers a promising approach to enhance farmers' perceptions of pests, their ecological causalities and non-chemical alternative management option...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} egg of <b>citrus</b> red <b>mite,</b> Panonychus citri (McGregor) (Acari: Tetranychidae) during {{hatching}} were observed under scanning electron microscope. The egg was jewel-shaped having {{a diameter of}} 120 - 145 μ m. The guy ropes and stalk broken down after two weeks down {{after two weeks of}} laying eggs. The characteristics of the shell surface gradually changed before hatching. The vertically patterned ridges appeared from the stalk base toward the middle portion of the egg. With the passage of time, the egg surface converted into deep patchy form. The embryo developed and the larva made a pair of holes in the middle region of egg using claws. The inside surface of the shell was smooth. The internal surface was spongy and external surface was patchy type having a thickness of 1 μ m. The cleavage appeared on the equatorial portion of the egg and the larva came out. The deposited eggs had sticky wax materials on its ventral side for attachment on the leaf...|$|R
40|$|The {{equivalent}} of US$ 75 million is spent {{each year in}} Brazil to control Brevipalpus phoenicis, a <b>mite</b> vector of <b>Citrus</b> leprosis virus C (CiLV-C). In this study, we investigated the possibility that hedgerows and windbreaks normally found in citrus orchards could host CiLV-C. Mites confined by an adhesive barrier were reared on sweet orange fruit with leprosis symptoms then were transferred to leaves of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Malvaviscus arboreus, Grevilea robusta, Bixa orellana, and Citrus sinensis. Ninety days post infestation, the descendant mites were transferred to Pera sweet orange plants to verify the transmissibility of the virus back to <b>citrus.</b> Nonviruliferous <b>mites</b> which had no feeding access to diseased tissue were used as controls. Local chlorotic or necrotic spots and ringspots, symptoms of leprosis disease, appeared in most plants tested. Results generated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for CiLV-C and by electron microscope analyses confirmed the susceptibility of these plants to CiLV-C...|$|R
