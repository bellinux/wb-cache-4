500|$|The Simpsons are {{a family}} {{who live in a}} fictional [...] "Middle America" [...] town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety {{inspector}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in [...] "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot". Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening first {{conceived}} Maggie and {{the rest}} of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction, and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family was named Maggie after Groening's youngest sister. Maggie then made her debut with the rest of the Simpsons family on April 19, 1987 in the short [...] "Good Night". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series that would air on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Maggie {{and the rest}} of the family remained the main characters on this new show.|$|E
500|$|On July 16, 1999, tragedy {{struck the}} Kennedy family again when [...] John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s [...] Piper Saratoga light {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in-law. As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad." ...|$|E

40|$|Skinfold {{thickness}} {{measurements were}} made at biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac sites on both sides on 265 full-term newborn infants. The mothers were classified as thin (25), normal (179), or obese (61) on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> their triceps skinfold thicknesses. At all skinfold sites <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese mothers were significantly fatter than <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> normal mothers, and <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normal mothers were significantly fatter than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thin mothers. There was a highly significant positive correlation between maternal triceps thickness and <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> sum <b>of</b> skinfold thicknesses. Hypertension was common during <b>the</b> pregnancies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese mothers and {{was associated with a}} significant reduction in the babies' skinfold thicknesses. When each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 61 obese mothers were matched for parity, blood pressure, and smoking habit with 61 non-obese mothers <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese mothers still had significantly greater skinfold thicknesses than <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> non-obese mothers...|$|R

500|$|While {{attending}} UCLA, {{which did}} not have a public speaking team, Cartwright continued training as a voice actress with Butler. She recalled, [...] "every Sunday I'd take a 20-minute bus ride to his house in Beverly Hills for a one-hour lesson and be there for four hours... They had four sons, they didn't have a daughter and I kind of fitted in as <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family." [...] Butler introduced her to many of the voice actors and directors at Hanna-Barbera. After she met the director Gordon Hunt, he asked her to audition for a recurring role as Gloria in Richie Rich. She received the part, and later worked with Hunt on several other projects. At the end of 1980, Cartwright signed with a talent agency and landed a lead role in a pilot for a sitcom called In Trouble. Cartwright described the show as [...] "forgettable, but it jump-started my on-camera career". She graduated from UCLA in 1981 with a degree in theater. During the summer, Cartwright worked with Jonathan Winters as part of an improvisation troupe at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|Angelo {{was forced}} to help Nicole {{give birth to a}} baby boy, George, and she handed him over to Marilyn {{immediately}} as agreed. She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was alone with him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] Nicole was unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could put a big strain on their relationship." [...] After the incident, Nicole is asked by Marylin, {{to stay away from the}} baby. James defended Nicole stating: [...] "I think it's hard to not bond, but this is Marilyn's baby, and Nicole is so young and wants very much to give Marilyn and Sid this gift." ...|$|E

By this act he had at once assumed an isolated position, no other Forsyte being content with less than four per cent. for his money; and this isolation had slowly and surely undermined a spirit perhaps better than commonly endowed with caution. He had become almost a myth--a kind of incarnation of security haunting the background of the Forsyte universe. He had never committed the imprudence of marrying, or encumbering himself in any way with children.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something {{sinister}} {{about her}} looks, wasn't there?" [...] {{said the man}} in tweeds, looking down at old Jermyn with a friendly eye. [...] "I always {{had a sort of}} horror of her. She gave me a beastly shock when I was no more than fourteen, the very first day--nay, hour--I joined her. Father came up to see me off, and was to go down to Gravesend with us. I was his second boy to go to sea. My big brother was already an officer then. We. got on board about eleven in the morning, and found the ship ready {{to drop out of the}} basin, stern first. She had not moved three times her own length when, at a little pluck the tug gave her to enter the dock gates, she made one of her rampaging starts, and put such a weight on the check rope--a new six-inch hawser--that forward there they had no chance to ease it round in time, and it parted. I saw the broken end fly up high in the air, and the next moment that brute brought her quarter against the pier-head with a jar that staggered everybody about her decks. She didn't hurt herself. Not she! But one of the boys the mate had sent aloft on the mizzen to do something, came down on the poop-deck--thump--right in front of me. He was not much older than myself. We had been grinning at each other only a few minutes before. He must have been handling himself carelessly, not expecting to get such a jerk. I heard his startled cry--Oh!--in a high treble as he felt himself going, and looked up in time to see him go limp all over as he fell. Ough! Poor father was remarkably white about the gills when we shook hands in Gravesend. 'Are you all right?' he says, looking hard at me. 'Yes, father.' 'Quite sure?' 'Yes, father.' 'Well, then good-bye, my boy.' He told me afterwards that for half a word he would have carried me off home with him there and then. I am <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family--you know," [...] added the man in tweeds, stroking his moustache with an ingenuous smile.|$|E
