40|$|BACKGROUND: In October 2009, the Council of the European Union {{adopted the}} Directive on Sustainable Use of Pesticides (EU 128 / 2009 /EC). <b>This</b> <b>Directive</b> <b>establishes</b> a {{framework}} {{to achieve the}} sustainable use of pesticides by reducing the risk and impacts of pesticide use on both {{human health and the}} environment, and promoting the use of integrated pest management and of alternative approaches or techniques. These risks thus need to be assessed using appropriate risk indicators. The OPERA Research Centre organised an expert working group and has had several consultations with stakeholders in order to identify a common way of thinking in evaluating and identifying the factors that should be considered in selecting each indicator. RESULTS: Harmonised criteria has been suggested to allow the selection of the most appropriate indicators focusing on the use phase of pesticide as requested by the Directive on Sustainable Use. CONCLUSION: The proposed methodology has led to a sharing perspectives and knowledge between the experts involved, and some principles have been identified to help national regulatory institutions to estimate general trends in pesticide-risk reduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} waste {{generated}} in Europe and, beyond, by our {{production and consumption}} patterns is significant. A proper waste management is essential {{in order to reduce}} detrimental environmental impacts. For the European Union, the general principles of good waste management are outlined in the Waste Framework Directive (2008 / 98 /EC). <b>This</b> <b>directive</b> <b>establishes</b> a five-step hierarchy of waste management, starting with the preferred option of waste prevention, followed by preparing waste for re-use, recycling and other recovery, with disposal (such as landfill) as the last resort. The European Commission (EC) encourages the use of Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) to complement the waste hierarchy for a more environmentally sound and factual support to decision-making in waste management. This has {{led to the development of}} a set of guidelines, tailored to the needs of different target audiences, which help apply LCT and quantitative tools such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to waste management systems and strategies. The main aim of this paper is to present these guidelines, while also providing a structured overview on existing waste management criteria (e. g., the waste hierarchy), concepts and tools. JRC.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{different}} directives regulating {{the protection of}} pregnancy and maternity of workers, {{as well as the}} abundant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in that effect, in order to reveal not only the degree of harmonisation achieved but also the possible failings of the current protection system. Directive 76 / 207 /EEC on equal treatment for men and women at work bans discrimination on the grounds of sex as regards access to employment, working conditions and conditions governing dismissal. This Directive makes it clear that measures concerning the protection of pregnancy and maternity, whose paradigmatic case is the maternity leave, do not infringe on the principle of equal treatment. Having established this, the Directive has been fundamental in that, based on it, the CJEU has been punishing discriminatory behaviours regarding pregnancy and maternity leave, considering them as directly discriminatory on the grounds of sex, given that they can only affect women. Directive 92 / 85 /EEC concerning the safety and health of pregnant workers is, in itself, a permitted exception to the principle of equal treatment. <b>This</b> <b>Directive</b> <b>establishes</b> a 14 weeks’ maternity leave for employed women with the following guarantees: maintenance of income and other rights inherent to the work contract, the prohibition on dismissal from the beginning of pregnancy {{to the end of the}} maternity leave. In addition, the new Directive 2010 / 41 /EU on equal treatment of the self-employed establishes a 14 -weeks maternity benefit for female self-employed workers and female spouses and life partners. Lastly, this paper critically analyses the maternity leave within the European Union, both in relation to its legal basis used and objectives, as well as with regards to the perpetuation of the role of women as newborns carers. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} begins by the {{analysis}} of the Directive 2005 / 29 /EC, its ratio, its genesis, and its systemic profile concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices; <b>this</b> <b>Directive</b> <b>establishes</b> minimum criteria for harmonizing the legislation of the Member States through which the EC wanted to contribute “to the proper functioning of the internal market”, and also (according to article 153 EC Tr.) to “achieve a high level of consumer protection” (Directive’s article 1) and also approaches the phenomenon of commercial practices as a exclusive issue of business-to-consumer relationship, demanding the Member States to take into consideration the non direct connected interests of competitors. The cases approached by the Directive discipline are all and only those which can be leaded inside the notion of “business-to-consumer commercial practices”, definition by itself of imprecise boundaries, which can mean (ex art. 2, letter. b e art. 3, par. 1) any professional practice – before, in a given context or also following the contractual relationship between a trader and a consumer – that promotes the conclusion of a contract with a consumer, or even so “directivly connected” to thereof contracts. In reference of those cases, in the first place, the directive establishes to the traders of all Member States a general prohibition of business practice which could be “harming [to] consumers' economic interests” and qualified as “unfair” (art. 5, par. 1). In second place, the Directive contemplates and disciplines in an analytical way the complex system of evaluation of the “unfair” characteristic of a business practice, informing the parameters by which one can consider a business practice to be permitted (while fair), inside the whole European Union (art. 5 to 9) : such evaluation system is articled around a general (and residual) notion concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices (art. 5, par. 2), two categories of “misleading” commercial practices (artt. 6 e 7) and “aggressive” (artt. 8 e 9) and a so called “black” list of commercial practices which “are in all circumstances unfair” (art. 5, par. 5). In third and last place, the Directive trusts to Member States the task of providing adequate solutions (also procedural) to prevent and repress unfair commercial practices, and also the task of introducting a assemble of strong and effective sanctions on trader's field of activity (art. 11 to 13). Considering the objectives of the above mentioned Community Directive, it has been taken into consideration the meaning of the Italian discipline of reception, analyzing the evaluation system of wrong intentioned commercial practice and, in a particular way, the relationship between general clauses and black lists. So, our main question focused on the discipline of misleading commercial practice, in order to reach a conclusion with detailed analysis of each and single cases of commercial practices which are considered “in all circumstances unfair”, listed on the black list according the article 23...|$|E

However, GAO found no evidence that Congress was informed about most Directive 25 shortfalls identified in executive branch assessments of the proposed operations in East Timor and Sierra Leone or about U.

40|$|At EU-level, {{the use of}} {{substantive}} criminal law {{as a response to}} illegal migration is materialised by both the EU legislator and the Member States individually. EU involvement in criminalizing illegal migration takes place in a twofold manner: directly, through harmonization of national legislations, and indirectly, through the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). An example of the latter is the case law of the CJEU regarding criminal law sanctions for breaching an entry ban. In 2008 the EU adopted the Return <b>Directive.</b> <b>This</b> <b>directive</b> aims at <b>establishing</b> common standards and procedures to be applied in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{recently}} adopted <b>directive</b> <b>establishing</b> a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation from a disability rights perspective. The adoption of <b>this</b> <b>directive</b> represents merely the first stage in the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds falling within its protective remit. The next and arguably most important stage is the implementation of <b>this</b> <b>directive</b> into national law. Of the protected grounds, disability offers what is arguably the greatest challenge for national authorities in the implementation process. It demands flexibility in the legislative approach traditionally used to combat discrimination as well as the introduction of new legal concepts into the national legal order of most Member States. Whilst European Disability Non-Governmental Organisations, together with the European Parliament, are calling on the Commission of the European Union to propose a more expansive directive prohibiting disability discrimination, it is first crucial to ensure that the core aspects of the recently adopted directive are clearly understood and correctly implemented from a disability rights perspective. These core aspects include the definition of disability, the concepts of direct and indirect discrimination, and the duty to provide reasonable accommodations. Given that these core aspects will be common to any disability non-discrimination law, no amount of coverage beyond the context of employment and occupation will compensate for the subsequent loss of opportunity to make a real difference to the lives of disabled people if they are not appropriately addressed. </p...|$|R
