Thus there was almost relief when, on 6 December, Lozano moved decisively, declaring himself dictator. It was the same old story of someone {{assuming}} strong-man rule {{in order to avoid the}} imaginary ‘chaos’ that would result from democratic rule. Soon Lozano even uncovered the obligatory ‘communist plot,’ allegedly backed by Guatemalan ex-president Juan José Arévalo, which allowed him to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> even more.

50|$|Another form of scope canting {{is caused}} by the rings themselves. Many Weaver-type mounts (including many Picatinny-type scope rings) and even the Redfield Type either have two or four screws on top of the scope ring that hold the scope in place. Both the Weaver and Picatinny clamp systems have a screw side and a clamp side. With the two-screw style, the ring usually aligns well but does not have the {{strength}} of <b>the</b> four <b>screw</b> system. Many times, when <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> of <b>the</b> four <b>screw</b> type, <b>the</b> scope can twist in place, causing misalignment. <b>Tightening</b> <b>the</b> mounts in an “X” pattern and usually starting opposite of the outside clamp side; holding the scope slightly to the opposite side while <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> usually allows for proper alignment of the scope to barrel parallel.|$|R

50|$|Her {{left arm}} started giving her {{more and more}} burden and pain and the arm started to grow crooked. She had less and less {{movement}} in her left arm and noticed that, in relation to her right arm, the left arm seemed to be shorter. She {{had to return to}} the hospital and there they discovered that the epiphysis of the radius was so damaged during her fall, that one bone was no longer growing. Because the other bones in her arm are still growing, her left arm is growing crooked. This growth disorder is also known as Madelung's deformity. Only, in Kruger's case, the disorder is caused by a trauma and is not a hereditary or congenital defect. Because of these problems she had to undergo multiple surgeries, including an operation to extend the bone, where a pin was inserted to the non-growing bone, with a swivel mechanism on the outside. For three months she had to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> every day, in order to slightly lengthen the bone. This radical surgery did not do what the doctors hoped for and the doctor declared her inoperable in August 2014. As far as trying to extend the non-growing bone, the bone had been pushed over her carpal bones, which only caused her to have less movement in her wrist. So she has limited movement in her wrist, she can not turn her arm, can not put any pressure on her arm and can not hang on it. Her left arm is now about 7 centimetres shorter than the right arm and her left hand is a little bit smaller than her right hand. She has virtually no strength in her left hand and therefore 70% less strength in her left arm in comparison to her right arm. Until she stops growing she has to have, regular check-ups at the Erasmus hospital in Rotterdam, {{to see if there is}} a need for emergency surgery because of the imbalance. But it will never be all right again.|$|E

It is well known that mining environment is dirty and dusty as a whole, and this scenario contributes detrimentally for machines and equipment maintenance. This article reveals quantitatively the effect of the environment and the method in tightening screws to clamp the wheel buckets of a Stacker Reclaimer Machine at an Iron Ore Mining. For this study, a statistical tool called Minitab was utilized. The data were collected in the field during an intervention in the machine and treated statistically afterward. The elongations of the screws were measured by ultrasound which revealed that, when only torques are used to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws,</b> referenced on the theoretical torque (N m) value, the aimed elongation (elastic strain) of screws might not be reached, with the worst case being it may be widely spread; the values obtained by ultrasound revealed such differences. After knowing such discrepancy, the screws were tightened properly to insure that the bucket wheel was correctly clamped. This statistical study quantified the spread values of torque versus elongation condition (bell curves). The ultrasound measurement credited the method utilized. © ASM International 2012...|$|E

30|$|The {{enduring}} {{crisis in}} Ukraine presents the European Union (EU) with a conundrum. Should it strengthen its economic and energy ties despite Russia’s growing assertiveness {{in the hope}} to solidify its medium term energy security and reel in Russian foreign policy? Or should it rather continue to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> on the Putin regime, {{in the hope that}} doing so will concurrently compel the Russian Federation to moderate its behaviour? This paper argues that it is not prudent for the EU to decrease cooperation with Russia in the short term, but rather push for a political solution without additional sanctions and in the long-term secure different fossil resources such as LNG and different suppliers such as Iraq and Iran. Whichever way the EU chooses, Ukraine’s role in EU energy security is depreciating. Nevertheless, the EU possesses a stronger bargaining position than widely believed because Russia lacks a credible alternative to European foreign direct investments (FDI). The EU should (1) establish an energy union that includes gas storage and distribution plans and extends the Energy Community to include Turkey {{to pave the way for}} future gas flows; (2) support infrastructure projects that increase reverse flow capacities within the EU as well as South Stream or its heirs and the Southern Corridor via Turkey to enhance import capacity; and (3) massively invest into energy research.|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Desenvolver uma porca para fixação óssea (PFO) com o objetivo de aumentar a estabilidade da osteossíntese interna. MÉTODOS: Foram utilizados 16 cadáveres frescos (32 extremidades proximais do úmero), sendo oito masculinos e oito femininos, com média de idade de 60, 56 anos. Em cada um dos 16 cadáveres, o úmero de um dos braços foi fixado com sistema de placa-parafuso-PFO e o contralateral, com o sistema placa-parafuso-porca de metal convencional. Foi aplicada uma força sobre os sistemas, medida por meio de torquímetro, até que um dos elementos falhasse (porca de polietileno, porca convencional ou osso). Depois, foi medida a força usada individualmente por 20 ortopedistas para apertar parafusos até que acreditassem que o sistema podia ser considerado como estável. Todos os resultados foram anotados e avaliados estatisticamente. RESULTADOS: Na avaliação da força média utilizada para aperto de parafusos, nas fixações rotineiras, individualmente, por 20 ortopedistas experientes, registrou-se a força média de 3, 18 N. m, força esta {{inferior}} à resistência do sistema placa-parafuso-PFO, que foi de 6, 37 N. m. A falha do sistema no osso com a PFO ocorreu em três casos e do sistema no osso com a porca de metal, em 10. CONCLUSÃO: A porca PFO mostrou-se menos agressiva ao osso que a porca metálica convencional, apresentando menor índice de fratura no osso. A força média aplicada pelo ortopedista não é capaz de quebrar a porca e levar a falha do sistema. OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} bone fixation nut (PFO) {{for the purpose}} of increasing the internal osteosynthesis stability. METHODS: 16 fresh cadavers were used (32 proximal humeral extremities), eight male and eight female, mean age of 60. 56 years. In each of the 16 cadavers, the humerus of one of the arms was fixated with a PFO-plate-screw system, and the contralateral was fixated with the plate-screw-nut system made of conventional metal. A load was applied on the system and measured by a torquemeter till one of the elements failed (polyethylene nut, conventional nut, or bone). The load individually used by 20 orthopedists to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> till the point they believed that the system was stable was measured. All of the results were noted down and statistically evaluated. RESULTS: In the evaluation of the mean load used to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws,</b> in routine fixations, individually, by 20 experienced orthopedists, a mean load of 3. 18 N. m was found, this load being lower than the strength of the PFO-plate-screw system, that was 6. 37 N. m. Failure of the system in the bone with the PFO occurred in three cases and failure of the system with the metal nut occurred in 10 cases. CONCLUSION: The PFO nut showed to be less aggressive to the bone than the conventional metal nut, and presented a lower incidence of bone fracture. The mean load applied by the orthopedist is not sufficient to break the nut and lead to a system failure...|$|E
30|$|This {{paper is}} an {{expansion}} of the thoughts I presented in the closing plenary at the 4 th International Fire Ecology and Management Conference in Savannah, Georgia, USA. After ruminating over several days of oral presentations and posters and chatting with attendees, I concluded: 1) scientists are still wrestling with the same fundamental problems they have been for decades, 2) managers are increasingly skeptical of the proliferation of models because they don’t provide reliable predictions in a timely fashion, and 3) competitors for airspace in which to release combustion products have become much more adept at convincing regulators to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> on prescribed fire instead of on their industries. Yet the general mood of the attendees and overall conference atmosphere was highly positive. Perhaps this was because the attendees agree with me that healthy ecosystems are the key to our long-term survival on planet Earth—a planet that has been shaped by fire for millennia and that continues to require periodic fire to maintain healthy ecosystems, thus making prescribed fire the “Ecological Imperative.” Because fire managers have the high ground, I continue to be optimistic that, if we can stifle our self-serving tendencies, be factual, and not exaggerate the benefits nor gloss over the deleterious ramifications of prescribed fire, we can educate the general public and turn them into vocal advocates for the judicious use of fire. My primary objective in this paper is to share some concepts that guided me throughout my career with the hope that they will motivate you to improve your modus operandi and inspire you to expand your fire management outreach activities.|$|E

50|$|A {{micrometer}} {{reading is}} not accurate if the thimble is over- or under-torqued. A useful feature of many micrometers is {{the inclusion of}} a torque-limiting device on the thimble—either a spring-loaded ratchet or a friction sleeve.

However, with a thimble that will ratchet or friction slip at a certain torque, the micrometer will not continue to advance once sufficient resistance is encountered.

5000|$|Set screws are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where <b>the</b> set <b>screw's</b> point contacts. <b>The</b> detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> push <b>the</b> flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that <b>tightens</b> <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> Set screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large set screws holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set screws without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|R
