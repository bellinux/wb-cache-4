5|$|Organised or {{structured}} {{visits to}} war memorials became popular during the inter-war years.

Tensions existed between those who travelled to the sites as tourists and those who perceived themselves as pilgrims.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized <b>the</b> <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining <b>the</b> <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> bodily integrity of the human person.

5|$|The {{austerity}} and the passivity of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in the skirt, while wearing red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features a bright red room with red candles and candelabra. While <b>the</b> <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> pious Madonna shyly watches the Latinos and prays silently in her room, the passionate Madonna dances and leaves the room to join the dancers in the streets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{rock and roll}} was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was in jail, and Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest {{the last two years}} of the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were very similar to the young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking <b>the</b> <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought the realities of the Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{cultural}} practices that were to define Merina social and political life for centuries are credited to Andrianjaka. He designated the twelve sacred hills of Imerina that were to become <b>the</b> <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> political heartland of the Merina empire, contributing {{to the establishment of}} the kingdom's traditional boundaries; clans were assigned to specific regions within his kingdom, further defining {{the cultural}} landscape. He consolidated power through such measures as appropriating the folk tradition of sampy (community talismans), thereby ensuring all the powers traditionally attributed to these idols were {{under the control of the}} sovereign alone. Merina traditions related to the burial and mourning of sovereigns are also traced back to Andrianjaka's reign.|$|E

One of the barons, Joachim of the Gutkeled clan, even captured StephenV's heir, the infant Ladislaus, in 1272. StephenV died some months later, causing a new civil war between the Csák, Kőszegi, and other leading families who attempted to control the central government {{in the name of}} the young LadislausIV. He was declared to be of age in 1277 at an assembly of <b>the</b> <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> temporal lords and of the noblemen's and Cumans' representatives, but he could not strengthen royal authority. LadislausIV, whose mother, Elisabeth, was a Cuman chieftain's daughter, preferred his Cuman kin, which made him unpopular. He was even accused of initiating a second Mongol invasion in 1285, although the invaders were routed by the royal troops.|$|E
