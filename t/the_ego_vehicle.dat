40|$|Abstract: Collision {{detection}} plays a {{key role}} in collision mitigation system. The malfunction of the collision mitigation system can result in another dangerous situation or unexpected feeling to driver and passenger. To prevent this situation, the collision time, offset, and collision decision should be determined from the appropriate collision detection algorithm. This study focuses on a method to determine the time to collision (TTC) and frontal offset (FO) between <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the target object. The path prediction method using <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> information is proposed to improve the accuracy of TTC and FO. The path prediction method utilizes <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> motion data for better prediction performance. The proposed algorithm is developed based on laser scanner.

30|$|The {{reason that}} TTC {{algorithms}} were not {{implemented in the}} vehicle is that T_headway is a more stable measurement than TTC, as the later depends upon the behaviour of the leading vehicle. More specifically, TTC calculation depends on the relevant speed of <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the leading vehicle, while T_headway takes into account only <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed and {{the distance between the}} vehicles, both of which are provided directly by the vehicle and its sensors (radar and ego vehicle CAN bus). The frontal vehicle speed however is a distance derivative, thus introduces errors.|$|E
40|$|International audience—Collision Avoidance Systems need {{to perform}} scene {{analysis}} and risk assessment {{in order to}} react conveniently. Based on the {{information provided by the}} perception system, scene analysis has to predict the evolution of the current driving situation for the near future. Thanks to the predicted trajectories of the relevant traffic participants, the risk of collision on <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> can be calculated. In many cases, a predicted trajectory is not defined with explicit equations but is given as a set of sampled poses, each one corresponding to a different future time instant. A predicted trajectory being always uncertain, confidence has to be estimated on the so predicted poses. We present a method that propagates the known error covariance matrix of the current pose of <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> by considering local approximations of the predicted trajectory. This allows to estimate the risk of collision of <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a considered target object. The proposed approach uses a Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the probability that <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the object come into collision at a given future time instant. Each sample time of the whole prediction horizon is considered as a potential collision time so that a curve describing the variation of the risk of collision is obtained. This allows the system to have a better comprehension of the scene and to react proportionally to the threat. The overall approach has been tested with simulated data and the consistency of results is shown...|$|E
40|$|While motion {{planning}} {{techniques for}} automated vehicles in a reactive and anticipatory manner are already widely presented, approaches to cooperative motion planning are still remaining. In this paper, we present {{an approach to}} enhance common motion planning algorithms, that allows for cooperation with human-driven vehicles.

For this purpose, a new cost functional is presented, containing the cost for all relevant traffic participants in the scene. Finally, we propose a path-velocity-decomposing sampling-based implementation of our approach for selected scenarios, which is evaluated in a simulation.

40|$|The use of {{radar and}} camera for {{situation}} awareness is gaining popularity in automotivesafety applications. In this thesis situation awareness consists of accurate estimates of theego vehicle’s motion, {{the position of}} the other vehicles and the road geometry. By fusinginformation from different types of sensors, such as radar, camera and inertial sensor, theaccuracy and robustness of those estimates can be increased. Sensor fusion is the process of using information from several different sensors tocompute an estimate of the state of a dynamic system, that in some sense is better thanit would be if the sensors were used individually. Furthermore, the resulting estimate isin some cases only obtainable through the use of data from different types of sensors. Asystematic approach to handle sensor fusion problems is provided by model based stateestimation theory. The systems discussed in this thesis are primarily dynamic and they aremodeled using state space models. A measurement model is used to describe the relationbetween the state variables and the measurements from the different sensors. Within thestate estimation framework a process model is used to describe how the state variablespropagate in time. These two models are of major importance for the resulting stateestimate and are therefore given much attention in this thesis. One example of a processmodel is the single track vehicle model, which is used to model <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> motion. In this thesis it is shown how the estimate of the road geometry obtained directly from thecamera information can be improved by fusing it with the estimates of the other vehicles’positions on the road and the estimate of the radius of <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> currently drivenpath. <b>The</b> positions of stationary objects, such as guardrails, lampposts and delineators aremeasured by the radar. These measurements can be used to estimate the border of theroad. Three conceptually different methods to represent and derive the road borders arepresented in this thesis. Occupancy grid mapping discretizes the map surrounding theego vehicle and the probability of occupancy is estimated for each grid cell. The secondmethod applies a constrained quadratic program in order to estimate the road borders,which are represented by two polynomials. The third method associates the radar measurementsto extended stationary objects and tracks them as extended targets. The approaches presented in this thesis have all been evaluated on real data from bothfreeways and rural roads in Sweden. IVSS - SEF...|$|R
40|$|With an {{increasing}} traffic intensity {{the demands on}} vehicular safety is higher than ever before. Active safety systems {{that have been developed}} recent years are a response to that. In this master thesis Sensor Fusion is used to combine information from a laser scanner and a microwave radar in order to get more information about the surroundings in front of a vehicle. The Extended Kalman Filter method has been used to fuse the information from the sensors. The process model consists partly of a Constant Turn model to describe the motion of <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> as well as a tracked object. These individual motions are then put together in a framework for spatial relationships to describe the relationship between them. Two measurement models have been used to describe the two sensors. They have been derived from a general sensor model. This filter approach has been used to estimate the position and orientation of an object relative <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Also velocity, yaw rate and the width of the object have been estimated. The filter has been implemented and simulated in Matlab. The data that has been recorded and used in this work is coming from a scenario where <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> is following an object in a quite straight line.

The behaviours of intelligent vehicles are modelled by a finite state automaton. The V 2 V communication model is also built based on signal propagation models in an intersection scenario and a Markov-chain based MAC model.

Decision making for lane change manoeuvre is of practical importance to guarantee a smooth, efficient and safe operation for autonomous driving. It is, however, challenging. On one hand, <b>the</b> behaviours of <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle</b> and adjacent vehicles are dependent and interactive. On the other hand, the decision should strictly guarantee safety during {{the whole process of}} lane change with uncertain and incomplete information in a dynamic and cluttered environment. To this end, the concept of Receding Horizon Control (RHC) is integrated into game theory in conjunction with reachability analysis tool, resulting in RHC based game theory. Specifically, the decision of each game relies on not only uncertain information at current step but also the future information calculated by reachability analysis. The decision is repeatedly made with the advent of new information using the concept of RHC. As a result, safety can be guaranteed during the whole process of lane change in a dynamic environment. Case study is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.

40|$|Overtaking {{manoeuvres}} of vulnerable road users {{on rural}} roads have previously {{been found to}} be accident-prone events with severe or fatal outcomes for the involved vulnerable road users. Most of the previously conducted studies revolving around overtaking manoeuvres of vulnerable road users on rural roads have used either naturalistic driving data which was collected from the bicyclists' perspective or data from driving-simulators. The work described in this thesis involved quantifying data of cars overtaking vulnerable road users on rural roads. The thesis exemplified how to extract overtaking manoeuvre segments from naturalistic driving data and further demonstrated how to extract comfort zone boundaries. The data used was extracted from the database of the European Naturalistic Driving project UDRIVE and included CAN-data, Mobileye-data, and video data. The video data came from cameras capturing both the inside and the outside of <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The data was enriched via manual annotations and automatic derivation of signals using tools such as SALSA and MATLAB. Manual annotations also verified the data, since not all data extracted from the database contained overtaking manoeuvres.
