In 1722, the exiles finally found protection on the estate of Count Zinzendorf, a Saxon nobleman, where he helped create the village of Herrnhut as their home. First settling in North America in Savannah, Georgia in 1735, they moved to Pennsylvania in 1740, where they founded several communities (Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Lititz). Because of development pressures, they looked for more space to create their church communities. Purchasing just over 98985 acre from John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, one of the British Lords Proprietor, in the Piedmont of North Carolina in 1753, they sent groups from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to begin construction.

40|$|The {{state of}} Darfur is located around the Jebel Marra Mountains in western Sudan, Africa, and was first {{established}} around A. D. 1630 {{by the ruling}} African tribe known as the Fur. The Fur tribe homeland is divided amongst three Fur divisions, speaking six traditional dialects, and {{is located in the}} center and western border of Darfur. These dialects and traditions are quickly being erased by the assimilation Darfurians face by being forced to migrate across Sudan, often into eastern Chad, leaving behind their native culture. The detriment of militia groups in Darfur, Sudan upon the personal Sudanese identity can be examined in the archaeological record by comparing the <b>transitional</b> <b>settlement</b> patterns and purpose of the Meidob Hills and Tila Island against those of the modern villages Mukjar, Dor, Shoba, and the Turra Burial Grounds. Understanding the shift of traditional living and settlement patterns of the Fur tribe is beneficial to archaeologists, because it will be reflected in the archaeological record as a precursor signature of cultural genocide...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversity}} of shelters used in <b>transitional</b> <b>settlements</b> for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Herat, Afghanistan is described. The information {{is based on}} a field survey undertaken in March 2002 and highlights the adaptation techniques, which IDPs undertake to improve any provided shelter. Potential areas for improvement are indicated; for example, the possibility for using insulated, demountable liners to prevent cold-related deaths without sacrificing shelter flexibility along with the likely need for better agency coordination of the shelter responses they provide. The wider context in which the technical recommendations would be implemented must also be considered. Such issues include agency resources, political impediments to providing the desired option, and the preference of many IDPs that the best shelter would be their home...|$|R

It observes the spatial, material, cultural, and economic forces that shape the environment, viewing the complex socio-political forces that pressurize issues of post-disaster construction. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the interpretation of "better" for building back in relatively isolated communities within historical and cultural landscapes. It is also searching for ways that local governments can energize the potential for building self-sufficient communities and re-envisioning approaches to establish sustainable cities after disasters...|$|R
40|$|Extreme climatic risks pose {{significant}} {{challenges to}} displaced populations that often lack adequate shelter. Contemporary policy documents concerning emergency shelter {{reveal that the}} scope of shelter-associated risk is much wider than simply exposure to the elements and includes a significant social dimension. However, disparity exists between implicitly accepted risks described in aid agency literature and field practice. Experience in recent disaster assistance programmes in Kosovo and Afghanistan illustrates how ill equipped the aid community is to deal with cold weather affecting <b>transitional</b> <b>settlements.</b> A review of the environmental risks associated with living in tented accommodation in cold climates reveals the difficulty of providing thermal comfort and fire safety in both heated and unheated tents. In addition, social surveys and field trials with displaced populations in Afghanistan illustrate that shelter is used, perceived and valued differently according to the ethnic and cultural background of occupants, and that these are also factors that impact on the risks they bear. Several design recommendations and guides {{for the use of}} cold climate relief tents are made, whilst acknowledging that the provision of alternative, longer-term shelter provision during the phase of emergency response is nearly always preferable...|$|R
40|$|In natural {{disaster}} and man-made conflict scenarios, livelihoods, assets, community networks and relationships get destroyed {{and in many}} areas, lives and communities are devastated. Re-settling these communities and providing them the essential support {{to adapt to the}} new or changed environments has been a major challenge for governments. Taking into consideration case studies from two South Asian countries, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, this paper explores the displacement and re-location cycle experienced and the impact disaster, conflict and reconciliation has on families, community and stakeholder relationships and networks as they re-build their lives in the re-settlement process. The case studies were selected from available literature to focus on different kinds of {{natural disaster}}s and civil conflicts. The paper focuses on characteristics of resilient communities and how these characteristics have aided the recovery and re-settlement. It also identifies attributes that are inherent in communities that have undergone disaster and displacement and explores how these attributes have helped communities in re-building their lives. From the literature and the case study results and information, it is seen that topics of safety, security, and livelihoods summarises the core needs that are important for <b>transitional</b> <b>settlement</b> and shelter. Having ownership of assets, a shelter or dwelling unit or land is also important in the re-settlement process. These requirements vary according to the ethnicity, religion and culture and the challenges for the relief agencies are to provide alternative solutions that match these requirements in the short and long term...|$|E
40|$|Between the {{eleventh}} and thirteenth centuries AD, the Lower Vistula valley represented a permeable and shifting frontier between Pomerelia (eastern Pomerania), {{which had been}} incorporated into the Polish Christian state {{by the end of}} the tenth century, and the territories of western Prussian tribes, who had resisted attempts at Christianization. Pomeranian colonization eventually began to falter in the latter decades of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, most likely as a result of Prussian incursions, which saw the abandonment of sites across the borderland. Subsequently, the Teutonic Order and its allies led a protracted holy war against the Prussian tribes, which resulted in the conquest of the region and its incorporation into a theocratic state {{by the end of the}} thirteenth century. This was accompanied by a second wave of colonization, which resulted in the settlement pattern that is still visible in the landscape of north-central Poland today. However, not all colonies were destroyed or abandoned in between the two phases of colonization. The recently excavated site of Biała Góra, situated on the western side of the Forest of Sztum overlooking the River Nogat, represents a unique example of a <b>transitional</b> <b>settlement</b> that included both Pomeranian and Teutonic Order phases. The aim of this paper is to situate the site within its broader landscape context which can be characterized as a militarized frontier, where, from the later twelfth century and throughout much of the thirteenth century, political and economic expansion was combined with the ideology of Christian holy war and missionary activity. This paper considers how the colonists provisioned and sustained themselves in comparison to other sites within the region, and how Biała Góra may be tentatively linked to a documented but otherwise lost outpost in this volatile borderland...|$|E

30|$|Extreme weather events, {{sea level}} rise, and {{political}} disputes linked {{to climate change}} are driving masses to leave their homes. Their <b>transitional</b> <b>settlements</b> should be produced {{in a manner that}} causes minimum greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent any further acceleration of climate change and the humanitarian crises it causes. This article presents a study of the carbon footprint and primary energy demand of the construction materials of eight different transitional shelters. The lowest carbon footprints were found from shelter models made from bamboo or timber. The highest emissions were caused by shelters that have either a short service life or that are made from metal-intensive structures. The choice of cladding materials was surprisingly important. The findings were further compared to the overall impacts of each construction project, to national per capita GHG emissions, and to construction costs. Some shelter projects had notable total energy consumption even compared to the annual energy use of industrialized countries. The study concludes that construction materials have an important impact on the carbon footprint of shelters. Comparisons should however be made only between similar functional units. Furthermore, benchmark values and more background data are urgently needed in order to give humanitarian nongovernmental organizations tools for lowering the carbon footprint of their construction operations.|$|R
