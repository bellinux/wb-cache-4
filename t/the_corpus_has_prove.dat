40|$|In {{the year}} 2010, <b>the</b> {{parallel}} Croatian-Czech <b>corpus,</b> {{which is part}} of the InterCorp project, exceeded 10 million tokens in both language versions and therefore it was possible to proceed to its practical use in finding equivalents for the Croatian-Czech dictionaries being prepared. The indicated size of <b>the</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> to be quite adequate for building a medium size dictionary, which should contain approximately 20 thousand entries. In the case of frequent entries, due to the confrontation of two languages, this corpus size is often adequate to capture the polysemy of words better than some existing explanatory or bilingual dictionaries. This is a great advantage, especially for the creation of bilingual dictionaries of two closely related languages...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a <b>corpus,</b> <b>the</b> Lancaster-Leverhulme <b>Corpus</b> of Children's Writing, which is nearing completion at Lancaster University. <b>The</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> a particularly challenging one to construct, as {{the age range}} covered by <b>the</b> <b>corpus,</b> 8 – 11 years of age, {{is one in which}} literacy is still very much developing. As a result we have had to make a wide range of transcription decisions related to such issues as spelling and general corpus encoding. Our response to the data has been to develop a set of minimal encoding principles for the transcription of handwritten data. Additionally, to ensure that as much information as possible from the original is preserved, we are digitally scanning as well as transcribing the children's projects, making this a multimedia corpus...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of clear semantics for causal claims {{and of a}} sound logic for causal reasoning is relatively recent, with the consolidation over the past decades of a coherent theoretical corpus of definitions, concepts and methods of general applicability (e. g. Pearl [2000]) which is anchored into counterfactuals. <b>The</b> latter <b>corpus</b> <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> to be of high practical interest in numerous applied fields (e. g. epidemiology, economics, social science). In spite of their rather consensual nature and proven efficacy, these definitions and methods are {{to a large extent}} not used in Detection and Attribution (DandA). This article gives a brief overview on the main concepts underpinning the causal theory and proposes some methodological extensions for the causal attribution of weather and climate-related events that are rooted into the latter. Implications for the formulation of causal claims and their uncertainty are finally discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} experiments for {{enlarging the}} Croatian Morphological Lexicon by applying an automatic acquisition methodology. The basic {{sources of information}} for the system are a set of morphological rules and a raw <b>corpus.</b> <b>The</b> morphological rules <b>have</b> been automatically derived from the existing Croatian Morphological Lexicon and we have used in our experiments a subset of <b>the</b> Croatian National <b>Corpus.</b> <b>The</b> methodology <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> to be efcient for those languages that, like Croatian, present a rich and mainly concatenative morphology. This method can be applied {{for the creation of}} new resources, {{as well as in the}} enrichment of existing ones. We also present an extension of the system that uses automatic querying to Internet to acquire those entries for which we have not enough information in our corpus. 1...|$|R
40|$|Given how rapidly new {{electronic}} corpora {{come into}} existence, a chapter {{such as this}} may, {{on the face of}} it, seem to run the risk of going out of date quite quickly.

Many types of corpora for a huge variety of languages have sprung up all over the world (particularly in the last decade, in the case of languages other than English), and the trend looks set to continue apace largely because research withing <b>the</b> <b>corpus</b> paradigm <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> so fruitful.
