60|$|Nor {{let this}} {{necessity}} of producing immediate pleasure {{be considered as}} a degradation of the Poet's art. It is far otherwise. It is an acknowledgment of the beauty of the universe, an acknowledgment the more sincere, because not formal, but indirect; it is a <b>task</b> <b>light</b> and easy to him who looks at the world in the spirit of love: further, it is a homage paid to the native and naked dignity of man, to the grand elementary principle of pleasure, by which he knows, and feels, and lives, and moves. We have no sympathy but what is propagated by pleasure: I would not be misunderstood; but wherever we sympathise with pain, it will be found that the sympathy is produced and carried on by subtle combinations with pleasure. We have no knowledge, that is, no general principles drawn from the contemplation of particular facts, but what has been built up by pleasure, and exists in us by pleasure alone. The Man of science, the Chemist and Mathematician, whatever difficulties and disgusts they may have had to struggle with, know and feel this. However painful may be the objects with which the Anatomist's knowledge is connected, he feels that his knowledge is pleasure; and where he has no pleasure he has no knowledge. What then does the Poet? He considers man and the objects that surround him as acting and re-acting upon each other, so as to produce an infinite complexity of pain and pleasure; he considers man in his own nature and in his ordinary life as contemplating this with a certain quantity of immediate knowledge, with certain convictions, intuitions, and deductions, which from habit acquire the quality of intuitions; he considers him as looking upon this complex scene of ideas and sensations, and finding every where object that immediately excite in him sympathies which, from the necessities of his nature, are accompanied by an overbalance of enjoyment.|$|E

50|$|The {{portable}} {{or table}} lamp {{is probably the}} most common fixture, found in many homes and offices.

5000|$|<b>Task</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is mainly}} {{functional}} {{and is usually}} the most concentrated, for purposes such as reading or inspection of materials.

5000|$|The {{main feature}} of the freely {{adjustable}} <b>task</b> <b>light</b> is evident; one may adjust it freely at any whim or to suit one's needs.

5000|$|Localized {{lighting}} {{consists of}} a luminaire that provides ambient light as well as <b>task</b> <b>light.</b> Often it is an uplighter with a light source that is directed downward. It {{is intended to be}} mounted immediately over the workplace, and it can be either hung from the ceiling, mounted on the desk or a dividing wall, or it can be a free-standing floor lamp. Recessed lights placed directly over the work area are another common example.|$|E
50|$|The {{asymmetric}} <b>task</b> <b>light</b> {{is intended}} to be placed {{at the side of the}} actual task. The luminaire directs the light obliquely over the desk, with the highest illuminance typically about 1' to 1½' to the side of the lamp head. It mostly has an arm system that holds the lamp head horizontally irrespective of the arm movement - a parallel arm. Asymmetric lamps often cause more reflected glare than other lamps. In workplaces where people use different table heights, an asymmetric lamp may cause direct glare due to its absence of means for glare control (ref:1).|$|E

Energy efficient lighting has been studied extensively in the aspect of daylighting harvesting and task ambient lighting, predominantly in Temperate developed countries. However, the lack of evident {{on the effectiveness of}} low ambient task lighting in the Tropics has prompted this paper to investigate the practicality of such lighting design for the Tropics. This paper explores into the office occupant’s mood and preferences of low ambient daylight and usage of <b>task</b> <b>light</b> for the office in the Tropics. It also discusses the recorded work plane illumination level upon the usage of such lighting system. It studies the impact of such lighting design on people’s preference, work plane illumination for three office spaces with the different luminous environment. In regards to the source of ambient lighting, two offices harvest daylight, and another uses the conventional overhead lights in accordance with MS 1525 recommendations. Three of the offices have 15 samples respectively and the workspace horizontal illuminance level is measured across a month. The results of before and after the provision of <b>task</b> <b>light</b> reveal that the acceptance for low ambient task lighting system and it is widely preferred. However, the <b>task</b> <b>light</b> is not necessary utilized as some people are adapted to do computer work under low ambient lighting (~ 50 - 150 lux). It shows that people’s preference for work plane illuminance varies greatly.

The dc power allocation is determined by sharing the number of LED chips between the terminals to satisfy a desired luminance ratio. The ac power allocation decides the fraction of the information signal power to be consumed at the terminals in order to minimize the BER. Numerical results reveal that cooperation brings significant performance gains over direct transmission. We further provide comparisons of two relaying techniques under consideration and discuss the effect of clipping noise on the error rate performance. Qatar National Research Fun...|$|E

30|$|Because of {{the fact}} that {{practical}} application of QDs composites is mainly related to the interaction with light, the investigation of irradiation influence on the optical properties of QDs in polymer matrix is an important <b>task.</b> <b>Light</b> interaction with QDs can affect the latter in different ways. Very often, high-energy photons launch photoreactions on the surface of such nanocrystals. Under ambient conditions, there are two possible ways of such influence: (i) modification of nanocrystal surface leading to the increase of luminescence intensity and (ii) photooxidation of nanocrystals resulting in degradation of the luminescence spectra. During prolonged irradiation, the combination of both effects is expected.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} {{understood}} {{that the use of}} 4 in × 4 in luminous panels and the layouts of the panels were for clarity and simplicity in demonstrating the fundamental principle of this study and not as practical implementations. In specific, the panels on the ceiling plane could be regarded as having an equivalent lighting effect as that of general lighting luminaires such as 2  ft × 4  ft troffers or indirect lighting. The panels for <b>task</b> <b>lighting</b> layer was a representation of one or more <b>task</b> <b>lighting</b> luminaires capable of delivering even illumination across the entire task surface on the 4  ft diameter desktop. The choice of <b>Task</b> <b>Lighting</b> Layer at 6 in. above the work surface was to ensure that substantially all the light will reach the task surface. The study chose an array of panels mounted at 3.5  ft height within the personal space to represent Surround Lighting layer because it was a simple way to distribute the light consistently over the entire volume of the personal space. Other layouts could be possible such as putting the surround light at a lower height and even {{on one side of the}} table for as long as the light could fill the entire volume of space. Finally, the luminous panels for surround light were considered as physical entities with 50  % reflectance while <b>task</b> <b>lighting</b> layer was treated as photometric entities only with no light blockage.|$|R
30|$|With ever {{increasing}} energy {{costs and the}} push to reduce energy consumption, there is constant pressure {{to reduce the amount}} of energy devoted to lighting. Energy savings can be achieved by simply turning down the amount of ambient lighting in the room, and supplementing light on work surfaces, such as table tops and desk tops, and in work spaces with <b>task</b> <b>lighting.</b> Because <b>task</b> <b>lights</b> do not need to generate the amount of light needed to illuminate an entire room, they consume less energy for the same task illumination level [1, 2]. From an energy efficiency point of view, only <b>task</b> <b>lights</b> would be used in a space, without ambient lighting. However, from a practical point of view, some ambient lighting is required for circulation and safety and to provide visibility to surrounding architectural structure and amenities in the space. For example, if the ambient <b>lighting</b> in a <b>task</b> lit space were reduced from 400 lu× to 100 lu×, the energy savings would be appreciable. As a result, task-ambient lighting becomes more prevalent in many lighting applications.|$|R
