50|$|Teschovirus is a genus {{of viruses}} {{in the order}} Picornavirales, in the family Picornaviridae. Pigs serve as natural hosts. There is {{currently}} only one species in this genus: the type species Teschovirus A (previously Porcine teschovirus), {{which is responsible for}} the porcine enteroviral encephalomyelitis disease caused in pigs. The genus name comes from its type species and the disease it causes: <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> (a severe and fatal form of pig encephalomyelitis), which itself was named for the town in the Czech Republic where the disease was first recogniaed in 1929.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{response to}} <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> and the excretion {{and rate of}} virus distribution in tissues of colostrum-deprived, specific pathogenfree pigs was determined. Severe, mild, and clinically inapparent responses to the disease were noticed following simultaneous intracranial and intranasal infections. Fourteen-day-old pigs reacted more severely to infection than 21 -day-old pigs. The virus was detected in feces 2 - 3 days following infection but not in stools of surviving pigs 30 days after infection. The highest concentration of virus occurred during the incubation period and before onset of paralysis; the lowest concentrations were found during terminal disease stages. In tissues collected before or immediately after death of pigs, <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> virus was found in several visceral organs but not in blood, urine or urinary bladder tissue. Virus yield was highest in brain and spinal cord tissues. Highest virus concentration {{was found in the}} cervical thoracic portions of the spinal cord, thalamus and cerebellum. Other aspects of the clinical disease are discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> (previously {{also known}} as Klobouk’s disease), {{actually}} called Teschovirus encephalomyelitis, is a virulent fatal viral disease of swine, characterized by severe neurological disorders of encephalomyelitis. It was initially discovered in the Teschen district of North-Eastern Moravia. During the 1940 s and 1950 s it caused serious losses to the pig production industry in Europe. The most critical situation at that time, however, was in the former Czechoslovakia. A nationally organized eradication programme started in 1952. That year the reported number of new cases of <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> reached 137 396, i. e., an incidence rate of 2 794 per 100 000 pigs, in 14 801 villages with 65 597 affected farms, i. e., 4. 43 affected farms per village and 2. 10 diseased pigs per affected farm. The average territorial density of new cases was 1. 07 per km 2. For etiological diagnosis histological investigation of the central nervous system, isolation of virus and seroneutralization were used. Preventive measures consisted in feeding pigs with sterilized waste food and in ring vaccination. Eradication measures {{took the form of}} the timely detection and reporting of new cases, isolating outbreak areas, and the slaughter of intrafocal pigs followed by sanitation measures. Diseased pigs were usually destroyed in rendering facilities. The carcasses of other intrafocal pigs were treated as conditionally comestible, i. e., only after sterilization. During the years 1952 – 1965 from a reported 537 480 specifically diseased pigs 36 558 died; i. e., <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> mortality rate was 6. 80 % while other intrafocal pigs (88. 12 %) were urgently slaughtered. During the whole eradication programm...|$|E
40|$|Plaque {{patterns}} and diameters of four virulent strains and one tissue culture mutant of <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> virus {{were compared with}} six pig enteroviruses isolated in the United States. They are described as they were produced in primary pig kidney monolayer cultures. Reproducible plaques, with similar characteristics and class-types {{of each of the}} viruses tested were obtained with the application of a 45 -minute virus adsorption time. Their morphologic characteristics and the proportion in which the plaque types appeared may assist in the differentiation of these virus strains...|$|E
40|$|An {{antiserum}} of high antibody content against <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> Konratice {{virus was}} obtained by inoculating rabbits and guinea pigs with an antigen composed of aluminum gel and virus propagated in swine kidney cell cultures. The rabbit and guinea pig serums neutralized 1, 500 TCID 50 of virus at dilutions of 1 : 5, 120 and 1 : 2, 048, respectively. The antibody level in the rabbit serum was tenfold greater than that in convalescent swine serum. Rabbit serum neutralized 2. 8 x 106 plaque-forming units of the Konratice virus. At a dilution of 1 : 5, 120, this serum neutralized 1, 500 TCID 50 of the Reporyje virus. The methods used to prepare and assay the serum are described...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} compound, 2 -(a hydroxybenzyl) benzimidazole (HBB) partially inhibited the cytopathogenicity and multiplication of <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> virus (TDV) and 6 enteric-cytopathogenic porcine orphan (ECPO) viruses in swine cells {{but not of}} {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV) in bovine kidney cells. For FMDV, {{there appeared to be}} a slight enhancement in virus yield and in cytopathic effect when HBB was present. The inhibition of the viral cytopathic effect and reproduction of TDV and ECPO viruses was related to the concentration of HBB. At the inhibitory level, the compound did not cause any changes in the microscopic structure of pig kidney or bovine kidney cells. The suppression of TDV multiplication was reversed when HBB was removed. The compound did not inactivate TDV or FMDV...|$|E
40|$|A plaque {{assay method}} was {{developed}} for <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> virus using primary pig kidney cultures in which neutral red stain was incorporated in the agar overlay medium. Certain factors associated with the plaque-forming ability of the virus were standardized. Cultures allowed to adsorb the virus for 45 - 60 minutes at 28 and 37 C, gave maximal plaque count. The virus infected the cellular layer through the agar medium. Plating efficiency of the virus was enhanced by using a small volume of inoculum. Addition of serum to the medium was not required. Neutral red concentration in the agar overlay medium affected the number of plaques. Statistical analysis demonstrated the uniformity of the plaque counts and their linear relationship to virus concentration. Isolation of the virus by the plaque technique from infected spinal cord supernatant fluid was achieved...|$|E
40|$|Porcine teschovirus (PTV) is a {{picornavirus}} {{of swine}} {{that can cause}} {{a wide range of}} clinical signs. Most of the 11 serotypes are widely distributed and infect pigs asymptomatically or cause disease only in young animals. However, some strains of the most virulent serotype (PTV- 1) cause teschovirus encephalomyelitis, a highly contagious, often fatal, neurological disease that affects pigs of all ages. Severe outbreaks were reported in Europe from 1929 to the 1950 s, with the virus spreading to other continents; however, this disease disappeared from Western Europe after 1980 and has become very rare in other areas. It appears that the most virulent strains of PTV- 1 have been replaced in most swine populations by less pathogenic strains. Etiology The viruses that cause teschovirus encephalomyelitis, as well as less pathogenic strains, belong to a single viral species called porcine teschovirus. This virus is classified in the genus Teschovirus in the family Picornaviridae. There are at least 11 distinct serotypes of PTV, PTV- 1 through PTV- 11. Some virulent strains of PTV- 1 cause severe teschovirus encephalomyelitis (formerly called <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease).</b> Othe...|$|E
40|$|Conventional pigs of 4 -week-old were {{infected}} with KNM strain of virulent <b>Teschen</b> <b>disease</b> virus by intracerebral (IC), intranasal (IN) and contact (CT) routes. The pigs of the IC group showed {{a very clear}} relation among clinical signs, virus multiplication and antibody production. Six days after infection (DAI), half the number of group pigs showed sudden neural disorders, the first multiplicated viral antigens were seen in the brain by the fluorescent antibody (FA) technique and the virus was first isolated from the serum sample. Seven DAI, all pigs examined showed the most abundant fluorescence in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) ' Rapid decrease of fluorescence in the CNS, except for the thalami, occurred on the days following immediately. The pigs of the IN and the CT groups did not show such clear phases of infection. No neural disorders occurred in the CT group in particular. The pigs showed no fluorescence in the spinal cords, though vacuolated neurons were usually seen in the cords as they were also in the other 2 groups. After the middle stage of infection, all pigs showed fluorescence in the capillar...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} this Issues Paper are to document existing {{policy and the}} scope of the non-routine analysis of the risks associated with the importation of pig meat, and to identify the hazards to be considered in the import risk analysis. The non-routine import risk analysis of pig meat is ‘generic ’ in that (a) it is not restricted to specific exporting countries, and, (b) import conditions which may be developed will be relevant to each exporting country’s animal health status. Background issues are outlined in the first three sections of this document. Hazard identification is described in the fourth section, and yielded the list of disease agents shown below. In the final section of the document, technical information concerning each identified hazard is provided. It is envisaged that a risk assessment will be carried out for each identified hazard and documented in the ensuing Draft IRA Report.
