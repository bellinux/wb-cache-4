500|$|Johansson is {{described}} as a sex symbol by the media, which considers her lips, green eyes, and voice among her trademarks. The Sydney Morning Herald describes Johansson as [...] "the embodiment of male fantasy". During the filming of Match Point, director Woody Allen said he found it [...] "very hard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extra</b> witty around a sexually overwhelming, beautiful young woman who is wittier than you are". In 2014, New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane wrote that [...] "she is evidently, and profitably, aware of her sultriness, and of how much, down to the last inch, it contributes to the contours of her reputation." [...] Regardless, Johansson dislikes being [...] "super-sexualised" [...] as [...] "the new Marilyn Monroe" [...] and [...] "always be an object of desire. Because it doesn't last." [...] Johansson's sex appeal also cost her the lead role in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) as its director David Fincher thought she was [...] "too sexy" [...] for the part.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{beginning}} of the Civil War, getting Confederate mail {{in and out of the}} Confederacy to and from foreign suppliers and other interested parties overseas posed a problem. At first, getting a ship through the Union blockade was easier, but as the war transpired the number of Union ships on blockade patrol increased while veteran crews were becoming more experienced and growing wiser to the evasive tactics employed by blockade-runners. To escape detection, blockade-runners would often try to get the mail and cargo through by making night runs, especially when the moon was new. Many of the vessels were also painted a dark gray color to help them blend in with the backdrop of the night sea, a practice that earned these vessels the nickname of Greyhounds. Some of the steamers also burned a smokeless anthracite coal which greatly reduced their profile against the horizon. [...] However, as the war went on, the prospect of getting a ship through diminished greatly, and many of these ships faced capture or destruction, their cargoes and mail never reaching their ports of destination. As many of the vessels used as blockade-runners were built in England for British investors, the captured crews and passengers were usually British also. The cargo aboard was rewarded to the captain and crew of the capturing vessel, it is assumed as an added incentive for captains and crews on blockade patrolling ships <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>extra</b> vigilant. Mail was also confiscated and sometimes used as evidence against the parties involved with the ship and its cargo. (figure 2) Consequently, inbound covers that were prepared by forwarding agents for transfer to and delivery within the Confederacy never received various postmarks or other markings from the Confederate post office.|$|E
