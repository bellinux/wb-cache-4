40|$|Throughout the world, several {{millions}} of small ponds exist for water supply, irrigation, flood control or to control water quality downstream. The reduced flow velocity in these ponds causes sedimentation of transported particles. For most ponds {{this is a}} negative impact as their retention capacity decreases due to sedimentation processes. Sediment volumes in small ponds {{can be used to}} reconstruct sediment yield values and to study the spatial variation in sediment yield over large areas. Especially in developing countries, this technique can be very helpful in establishing large data sets on sediment delivery as there are often no resources for expensive monitoring programmes. However, when such studies are undertaken, one has {{to take into account the}} efficiency of the pond in trapping sediments. This <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> is dependent on the characteristics of the inflowing sediment and the retention time of the water in the pond, which in turn are controlled by pond geometry and runoff characteristics. Because <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> is one of the most important properties of a pond or reservoir, it has been studied for quite some time. This article provides an overview of the different methods available to estimate the <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> of reservoirs and ponds. The first set of methods are empirical models that predict <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency,</b> mostly of normally ponded large reservoirs using data on a mid to long-term basis. These models relate <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> to a capacity/watershed ratio, a capacity/annual inflow ratio or a sedimentation index. Today, these models are the most widely used models to predict <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency,</b> even for reservoirs or ponds that have totally different characteristics from the reservoirs used in these models. For small ponds, these models seem to be less appropriate. They also cannot be used for predicting <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> for a single event. To overcome these restrictions, different theoretical models have been developed based on sedimentation principles. These can be very simple, such as the overflow rate method, but also very complex when runoff and sediment are routed through a pond with incremental time-steps. The theoretical-based models are probably more capable of predicting <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> for small ponds with varying geometric characteristics, and some of them also provide data on effluent sediment concentrations and quality. However, when reconstructing sediment yield values using sedimentation rates over a period of a few months to a few year (the mid-term basis), one needs a <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> value for the whole period, not for one single event. At present only limited research has been done on establishing mid-term <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> models based on theoretical principles. This is probably the most important gap in <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> research. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} vital {{problems}} in the storage and utilization of surface waters for drinking, flood control, hydropower, and agricultural purposes is that of sedimentation in reservoirs and subsequent decline of dam lifetime. The useful lifetime of a dam {{is defined as the}} time necessary for approximately 80 % of the volume of its initial capacity to be filled by sediments washed in by water. It {{is a function of the}} volume of the incoming sediments, specific weight of sediments, and reservoir <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> depends on sediment characteristics, life, shape, and rule curves of the reservoir as well as on the capacity-inflow ratio. It is the purpose of the present study to calculate sediment <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> of small dams and also to determine the relationship(s) among the effective parameters in the Chaharmahal and Bakhtiary region. For our purposes, 14 small earth dams (with heights of less than 15 m and capacities of about 1 MCM) were selected around Shahrekord and Borougen. Since no data were available on the erosion and sedimentation for these dams, the MPSIAC empirical model was used to estimate the incoming sediment to the dams' reservoirs. The model considers nine factors effective on erosion and sediment production in each watershed. These factors were analyzed for the watershed of each dam under study and the annual sediment yield was calculated. The amount of sediments retained in the reservoirs as a result of the working life of the dams was estimated by reservoir surveying.

Sediment deposited in 13 small retention ponds was sampled and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), K, Mg, and Ca content. The TT content of the sediment deposits varied from 510 to 2001 mg P per kg sediment. Nutrients are predominantly fixed on the very fine sediment fraction (< 16 mum), which is the reason why the nutrient <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the ponds is {{only a fraction of the}} sediment <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Average nutrient <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the studied ponds varies between 4 and 31 %, whereas sediment <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> varies between 10 and 72 %.

The observed spatial variability In nutrient losses is primarily attributed to regional variations in erosion and sediment yield values and to a far lesser degree to the spatial variations in fertilizer application.

50|$|The ants {{have been}} {{observed}} to clean the peristome of fungal hyphae and other contaminants, thereby maintaining high <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiency</b> over the pitchers lifespan. Research conducted by Dennis and Marlis Merbach has shown that C. schmitzi also benefits N. bicalcarata by protecting it from pitcher-destroying weevils of the genus Alcidodes. In {{order to create a}} favourable environment for its pitcher inhabitants, it appears that N. bicalcarata actively maintains the pH of its pitcher fluid at a less acidic level than that found in most other Nepenthes species (this might explain the occasional presence of tree frog eggs in its pitchers). In doing so, however, the plant reduces its ability to digest and assimilate nutrients from captured prey. The pitcher fluid of N. bicalcarata is also less viscoelastic than that of most Nepenthes species, and appears to lack functional digestive enzymes. Nepenthes bicalcarata is therefore highly reliant on its ant symbiont. Indeed, plants not inhabited by C. schmitzi do not appear to benefit significantly from carnivory, with any gains from prey digestion being offset by the high costs of pitcher construction. Conversely, ant-inhabited plants have more leaves and a greater total leaf area, and ant presence is associated with lower pitcher abortion rates and more voluminous pitchers (and consequently greater prey biomass). Studies have shown that plants colonised by C. schmitzi have more nitrogen available to them, and a higher proportion of it is insect-derived.|$|E

The results {{were compared to}} those obtained using the 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine (2, 4 -DNPH) UV–vis reagent, a standard well-established technique used to detect atmospheric carbonyl compounds. The experimental rate constant were integrated into a data-processing model developed in the laboratory to simulate the <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of a mist chamber device {{as a function of}} temperature, reagent and solvent type among others. The results showed that in an aqueous solution, DNSAOA exhibits a higher reactivity towards carbonyl compounds without the addition of an acidic catalyst than 2, 4 -DNPH. It was observed that DNSAOA can trap efficiently water-soluble gaseous compounds (for example formaldehyde). However, because of a high initial contamination of the reagent caused by the synthesis procedure used in this work, DNSAOA cannot be used in high concentrations. As a result, very low <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of less reactive water-insoluble gaseous compounds (acetone) using DNSAOA are observed. However, the use of an organic solvent such as acetonitrile improved the <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the carbonyl compounds. In this case, using DIH as the derivatization reagent (DNSAOA is not soluble in acetonitrile), <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiencies</b> greater than 95 % were obtained, similar to 2, 4 -DNPH. Moreover, fluorescence associated with DIH derivatives (detection limits 3. 33 × 10 − 8 M and 1. 72 × 10 − 8 M for formaldehyde and acetone, respectively) is further advantage of this method for the determination of carbonyl compounds in complex matrix compared to the classical UV–vis detection method (detection limits 3. 20 × 10 − 8 M and 2. 9 × 10 − 8 M for formaldehyde and acetone, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|Previous field {{demonstration}} projects in metro-Atlanta {{have shown that}} seep berms, which are elongated sedimentation basins at the outlet of a disturbed land area, can provide high suspended sediment <b>trap</b> <b>efficiencies</b> with respect to coarse sediments on construction sites having drainage areas greater than five acres. Previous literature has shown that vegetative filter strips are efficient traps for fine suspended sediment in stormwater runoff. A combination of a seep berm and vegetative filter in series was studied in this thesis as an erosion control measure with quantification of its flow resistance and sediment removal efficiency. First, a field demonstration project was implemented to evaluate seep berms as a viable erosion control measure through a side-by-side comparison with the more commonly-used silt fences on construction sites with drainage areas less than five acres in metro Atlanta. High suspended sediment <b>trap</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were recorded for the seep berm on two separate sites, and the seep berm was shown to be superior to silt fences with respect to sediment control in the site runoff. Then a vegetative filter was studied in the laboratory in a specially-built flume for that purpose. The relationship between vegetative drag coefficient and various parameters reflecting flow conditions and vegetation density in steady, uniform open channel flow was studied in the flume. Both rigid, emergent vegetation and submerged, flexible vegetation were studied at two different plant densities. The application of porous media flow concepts to open channel flow through vegetation resulted in a collapse of data for vegetative drag coefficient for the various vegetation types and densities into a single relationship when plotted against vegetative stem Reynolds number. Point velocity and turbulence intensity profiles at different locations in the vegetative filter were recorded with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter to observe the turbulence structure of the flow {{and its effects on}} vegetative drag and settling of sediment. A sediment slurry consisting of a suspension of fine sand was fed into the flume, and an automated sampler was used to measure suspended sediment concentrations along the vegetative filter length for a series of discharges from which sediment flux and <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> could be determined. Experimental data for <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> were plotted against a dimensionless settling efficiency for each type of vegetation and density.

In an attempt to further improve the situation for this landlocked population, we have taken a holistic approach in evaluating where further measures are needed. Hence, we have measured <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> for upstream migrating spawners at the lowermost dam, spawning success, overwinter survival of post-spawners, downstream passage success of smolts and kelts and smolt production. Here, I present an overview of our eight years of research in the River Klarälven, focusing on <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> for upstream migrating spawners and smolt prodution. <b>Trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> varied from 18 - 78 %, depending on river discharge and experience of the fish.

A simple population model was developed for the River Klarälven, where we used our own data and data from the literature to estimate the number of return spawners.

The yttria filter was found to offer a stable material in which volatile ruthenium can be effectively trapped because of its incorporation into a highly stable lattice when at temperatures over 900 ℃ under air conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{trapping}} {{performance of}} four different capillary cold traps (deactivated, coated, Tenax-TA and Chromosorb 101 packed traps) for C 2 -C 5 n-alkenes, isoprene, benzene, toluene, p-xylene, mesitylene, α-pinene, β-pinene, 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene and 1, 2, 3 -trimethylbenzene were determined over the temperature range − 20 and − 180 °C. All the hydrocarbons except ethylene {{were found to}} be retained by all the traps at different temperatures, but only the Chromosorb 101 capillary trap retained ethylene, and then not completely. The coatings were found to increase the <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the higher hydrocarbons (C 6), whereas the packings increased the <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiency</b> for all compounds (C 2 -C 10). A linear relationship was found between the boiling point of the compound and its maximum temperature. The flow-rate of the carrier gas (10 – 60 ml/min) was found to affect the <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the C 2 -C 4 hydrocarbons...|$|E

Microfluidic cell-based arraying technology is widely used {{in the field of}} single-cell analysis. However, among developed devices, there is a compromise between cellular loading efficiencies and trapped cell densities, which deserves further analysis and optimization. To address this issue, the cell <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a microfluidic device with two parallel micro channels interconnected with cellular trapping sites was studied in this paper. By regulating channel inlet and outlet status, the microfluidic trapping structure can mimic key functioning units of previously reported devices. Numerical simulations were used to model this cellular trapping structure, quantifying the effects of channel on/off status and trapping structure geometries on the cellular <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Furthermore, the microfluidic device was fabricated based on conventional microfabrication and the cellular <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiency</b> was quantified in experiments. Experimental results showed that, besides geometry parameters, cellular travelling velocities and sizes also affected the single-cell <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiency.</b> By fine tuning parameters, more than 95 % of trapping sites were taken by individual cells. This study may lay foundation in further studies of single-cell positioning in microfluidics and push forward the study of single-cell analysis. 1...|$|E

We are setting up at the INFN-Legnaro National Laboratories a laser cooling facility that has as a first goal the realization of a 210 Fr magneto-optical trap. The general outline of the experiment and the improvements of the final <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> are discussed. Some preliminary results are presented...|$|R

The two proposed dams of the Sambor and the Stung Treng would have the Mekong river basin's highest sediment <b>trapping</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of all the Lower Mekong Basin's proposed mainstream projects, destabilising downstream channels between Kratié and Phnom Penh and reducing overbank siltation in the Cambodian floodplain.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to water}} {{shortage}} {{in different places}} in Iraq especially for areas far away from main river flows (Tigris and Euphrates Rivers), rainwater harvesting reservoirs were suggested previously to store runoff water for different water supply purposes. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to estimate the sediment load yields from each watershed of a selected reservoir to estimate probable life based on resultant sediment load and <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The results indicates that the annual sediment load varied from 40 * 103 to 4. 4 * 103 ton depending on watershed area and other effective properties, while the sediment yield per unit area were ranged between 9. 5 to 20 ton/km 2. The estimated <b>trap</b> <b>efficiency</b> based on annual inflow and reservoir storage capacity were varied from a minimum of 96. 5 to 100 % due to high reservoir capacity in comparison to annual inflow. The resultant probable life of the reservoirs was greater than 100 years, indicating that the reservoir can economically accepted. Validerad; 2016; Nivå 1; 2016 - 11 - 29 (inah) </p...|$|R
