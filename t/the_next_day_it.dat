5|$|On December1, Epsilon began a {{northeast}} motion due to {{an approaching}} trough, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>it</b> attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>it</b> turned {{to the south and}} southwest. Late on December7, the winds dropped below hurricane status {{for the first time in}} five days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December8. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The final {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} developed on December7 about 705mi (1735km) east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles as a tropical depression.

5|$|Tropical Depression Four {{formed in}} the southeastern Caribbean {{on the evening of}} July 4. Early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>it</b> {{strengthened}} into Tropical Storm Dennis. The storm began moving rapidly to the west-northwest, and reached hurricane strength on the afternoon of July 6 while approaching the southern coast of Hispaniola. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>it</b> strengthened rapidly to become a Category4 hurricane. Dennis moved between Jamaica and Haiti on July 7. Dennis reached its peak as the strongest recorded Atlantic storm to form before August with a minimum central pressure of 930mbar just south of Cuba – a record that would stand only for eight days until Emily broke it. On July 8, Dennis passed over Cuba close to the capital, Havana. A second episode of rapid intensification occurred on July 9 as it moved north toward the Gulf Coast of the United States. Dennis made landfall as a Category3 storm just southeast of Pensacola, Florida.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>It</b> moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted {{for a few more}} days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|After {{continuing}} through the southeast United States, the storm became extratropical {{near the border}} of North Carolina and Virginia midday on September18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September19 while it was near Philadelphia. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, moving through New England and {{along the coast of}} Maine before turning more to the east. Late on September19, the storm moved across Nova Scotia, passing southeast of Newfoundland <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>It</b> was last observed late on September20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.|$|E

A tropical storm warning was also issued for the Cayman Islands, where an emergency shelter was opened. There, tourists were recommended to temporarily leave the islands.|$|E

5|$|The first {{hurricane}} in November since 1991 {{formed from}} a tropical disturbance.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Paine {{were from a}} system that entered the eastern Pacific Ocean through Central America on September 27. By <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>it</b> {{organized}} into Tropical Depression 27 while located about 185 miles (300km) southwest of the coast of Guatemala. With a high pressure system to its north, the depression moved generally westward at first, although an approaching upper-level trough influenced a more northerly track. The depression slowly organized while paralleling the Mexican coastline, and it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Paine on September 30, while the storm was about 350 miles (565km) west-southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{held its}} {{strength}} {{for some time}} as it moved southward between Ono-i-Lau and Tongatapu. Beginning to accelerate, Vaianu entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. It curved southeastward and slowly deteriorated due to increasing wind shear and colder sea surface temperatures. The JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm on February 15, and by <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>it</b> was undergoing an extratropical transition. At 0600 UTC, the JTWC classified it as extratropical, but it remained a powerful storm system for several days as it tracked over the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression originated from a tropical wave off {{the southern coast}} of Mexico in late May2006. An area of convection {{was associated with the}} wave, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that environmental conditions favored gradual development. The system, which was enhanced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), drifted northward with an anticyclone to its east and west. On June1, the convection became more concentrated, and by early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>it</b> developed a low pressure area; by that time, it began a steady northwestward track.|$|E
