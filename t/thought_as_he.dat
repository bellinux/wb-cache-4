25|$|The {{reason for}} Belisarius' {{outburst}} {{was at first}} unclear, but as the Goths approached the moat, he drew forth his bow and shot, one after another, three Ostrogoth riders. The soldiers on the walls took this as an omen of victory and started to shout in celebration. Then Belisarius revealed his <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ordered his archers to concentrate their fire on the exposed oxen, which the Goths had so thoughtlessly brought within bowshot distance from the walls. The oxen were dispatched quickly, and the four towers were left there, useless, before the walls.|$|E
25|$|Authentic human {{happiness}} for Plotinus {{consists of}} the true human identifying with that {{which is the best}} in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus “… there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.” (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus’ greatest imprints on Western <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is one of the first to introduce the idea that eudaimonia (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.|$|E
500|$|Robert Patterson III, {{son of the}} Mint Director under whom Peale {{served for}} many years, wrote that through Peale's report, [...] "our Mint was placed in full {{possession}} of all that was then worthy to be known" [...] from foreign mints and refineries. Patterson indicated that he had often <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> passed through the Philadelphia Mint's coining department, that a plaque should be set up to Peale reproducing the tribute to Sir Christopher Wren in London's St. Paul's Cathedral, Si Monumentum Requiris, Circumspice (if you seek his monument, look around you).|$|E

500|$|III.1 {{opens with}} the Four Masters' ass narrating how he <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "dropping asleep", {{he had heard}} and seen an {{apparition}} of Shaun the Post. As a result, Shaun re-awakens, and, floating down the Liffey in a barrel, is posed fourteen questions concerning the significance {{and content of the}} letter he is carrying. Shaun, [...] "apprehensive about being slighted, is on his guard, and the placating narrators never get a straight answer out of him." [...] Shaun's answers focus on his own boastful personality and his admonishment of the letter's author – his artist brother Shem. After the inquisition Shaun loses his balance and the barrel in which he has been floating careens over and he rolls backwards out of the narrator's earshot, before disappearing completely from view.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of Sonnet 32 {{can be interpreted}} in light of its relationship to time. [...] "The exact match created between events as foreseen by the poet (his death, the increasing poetic sophistication of the age and consequently of the beloved's taste) and the beloved's conjectured <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> rereads the poet's verse makes intelligible Shakespeare's choice of a {{structure of}} superposition (in which lines 9-14 [...] repeat lines 3-8 [...] )." ...|$|E
2500|$|The parody {{generally}} {{follows the}} outline of The Lord of the Rings, including the preface, the prologue, poetry, and songs, while making light of what Tolkien made serious (e.g., [...] "He would have finished him off then and there, but pity stayed his hand. [...] It's a pity I've run out of bullets, he <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> went back up the tunnel..."). Names and words in the various languages are parodied with brand names that mimic their sounds (for example, Moxie and Pepsi replace Merry and Pippin). There are many topical references, including once-popular brand names. It has the distinction for a parody of having been continuously in print since it was first published.|$|E

In the last scene Ari returns to a church where Hanna-Riikka is working.|$|R
2500|$|When picking {{characters}} {{to die in}} battle scenes, Martin chooses secondary or tertiary characters from the character lists without giving much <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sees these characters as hardly developed {{and in some cases}} just as names. However, the death and time of death of many major characters have been planned from the beginning, although these scenes may not always be easy to write. A scene called the [...] "Red Wedding", which occurs about two thirds through A Storm of Swords and leaves several major characters dead, was the hardest scene Martin had ever written. He repeatedly skipped writing the chapter and eventually wrote it last for A Storm of Swords. Readership response ranged from praise to condemnation, but Martin said the chapter [...] "was painful to write, it should be painful to read, it should be a scene that rips your heart out, and fills you with terror and grief." ...|$|E

60|$|Even James Auberly, pompous, stern, and ungenial {{though he}} was, {{appeared}} to entertain some such <b>thoughts,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat {{by his own}} fireside, one such night, in his elegant mansion in Beverly Square, Euston Road, London; and smiled grimly {{over the top of}} the Times newspaper at the fire.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{peace of}} God {{rests on the}} place,' he said, when Sir James asked his <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{looked back at the}} grand mass of buildings.

60|$|His sister painted, as vividly as she could, the features, stature, {{and dress}} of her visitor; but John Carker, either from having no {{knowledge}} of the original, or from some fault in her description, or from some abstraction of his <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walked to and fro, pondering, could not recognise the portrait she presented to him.|$|R
60|$|He screwed {{himself up}} to as cheerful a pitch <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could without his former crony, and became content with his own <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> rode, instead of {{the words of a}} companion.

60|$|Such were Austen's <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{drove to}} Fairview that September {{afternoon}} when the leaves were turning their white {{backs to the}} northwest breeze. The sun was still high, and the distant hills and mountains were as yet scarce stained with blue, and stood out in startling clearness against the sky. Would he see her? That were a pain he scarce dared contemplate.|$|R

5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, but it's not possible!" [...] exclaimed Dick, {{answering}} his own <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> turned swiftly, {{and stretched}} out after his friends. Seeing this, the savages tried to close in on him from both sides, but their already winded ponies had no chance against the grand Mexican mare, which having been considerately handled during the day's journey was comparatively fresh and in full vigour.|$|R
