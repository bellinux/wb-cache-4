5|$|The {{movement}} {{spun off}} several subgenres {{of a similar}} political bent. Discharge, founded back in 1977, established D-beat in the early 1980s. Other groups in the movement, led by Amebix and Antisect, developed the extreme style known as crust punk. Several of these bands rooted in anarcho-punk such as the Varukers, Discharge, and Amebix, along with former Oi! {{groups such as the}} Exploited and bands from father afield like Birmingham's Charged GBH, became the leading figures in the UK 82 hardcore movement. The anarcho-punk scene also spawned bands such as Napalm Death, Carcass, and Extreme Noise <b>Terror</b> <b>that</b> in the mid-1980s defined grindcore, incorporating extremely fast tempos and death metal–style guitarwork. Led by Dead Kennedys, a U.S. anarcho-punk scene developed around such bands as Austin's MDC and Southern California's Another Destructive System.|$|E

25|$|On 26 October, Lenin {{formed a}} new government, the Council of People's Commissars ("Sovnarkom"), which he led as Chairman. Stalin {{was among the}} Bolsheviks who backed Lenin's {{decision}} not to form a coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionary Party, although they did form a coalition government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. Stalin was soon part of an informal foursome leading the government, alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov; of these, Sverdlov was regularly absent, and died in March 1919. Stalin's office was based near to Lenin's in the Smolny Institute, and he and Trotsky were the only individuals allowed access to Lenin's study without an appointment. Although not so publicly well known as Lenin or Trotsky, Stalin's importance among the Bolsheviks grew. He co-signed Lenin's decrees shutting down hostile newspapers, and with Sverdlov chaired the sessions of the committee drafting a constitution for the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He strongly supported Lenin's formation of the Cheka security service and the subsequent Red <b>Terror</b> <b>that</b> it initiated; noting that state violence had proved an effective tool for capitalist powers, he believed that it would prove {{the same for the}} Soviet government. Unlike senior Bolsheviks like Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin, Stalin never expressed concern about the rapid growth and expansion of the Cheka and Terror.|$|E

He further analyzes Rosas's government and personality, commenting on dictatorship, tyranny, the role of popular support, {{and the use of}} force to maintain order. Sarmiento criticizes Rosas by using the words of the dictator, making sarcastic remarks about Rosas's actions, and describing the [...] "terror" [...] established during the dictatorship, the contradictions of the government, and the situation in the provinces that were ruled by Facundo. Sarmiento writes, [...] "The red ribbon is a materialization of the <b>terror</b> <b>that</b> accompanies you everywhere, in the streets, in the bosom of the family; it must be thought about when dressing, when undressing, and ideas are always engraved upon us by association".|$|E

500|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century William Shakespeare wrote a number of dramatisations of {{historic}} figures. The use of history as a backdrop, against which the familiar characters act out Shakespeare's drama, lends a sense of realism to his plays. [...] Shakespeare wrote a three-part play about Henry VI, relying heavily on Hall's chronicle as a source. [...] His vision of the Battle of Towton (Henry VI, Part 3, Act2, Scene5), touted as the [...] "bloodiest" [...] engagement in the Wars of the Roses, became a set piece about the [...] "terror of civil war, a national <b>terror</b> <b>that</b> is essentially familial". [...] Historian Bertram Wolffe said it was thanks to Shakespeare's dramatisation of the battle that the weak and ineffectual Henry was at least remembered by English society, albeit for his pining {{to have been born}} a shepherd rather than a king.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{attempted}} to bring closure to {{several aspects of}} the series. In one sequence, Alex Krycek throws The Smoking Man {{down a flight of}} stairs, presumably to his death. Nicholas Lea, the actor who portrayed Krycek, noted: [...] "That's one of the character's great moments, when I get to push Bill Davis down a set of stairs. In a sense, he has nothing to lose because his life's burned out. So death doesn't have the same <b>terror</b> <b>that</b> it would to a young happy chap." [...] The episode also featured several tender moments between Mulder and Scully, which many fans found [...] "nearly pornographic {{in the context of their}} long, chaste courtship", according to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files. Gillian Anderson, however, defended the moments, arguing that there was ample amount of romance between Mulder and Scully prior to [...] "Requiem".|$|E

Carus writes in Toxic <b>Terror</b> <b>that,</b> [...] "There is no way to know to what extent [...] participated in actual decision-making. His followers believed he was involved in every important decision that Sheela made, but those allegations were never proven." [...] Rajneesh insisted that Sheela, who he said was his only source of information during his period of isolation, used her position to impose [...] "a fascist state" [...] on the commune. He acknowledged that the key to her actions was his silence.|$|E

The Daily Telegraph's Tim Robey granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that [...] "it's the nobility of this {{remarkable}} film that pierces the soul", while praising Ejiofor and Nyong'o's performances. Tina Hassannia of Slant Magazine said that [...] "using his signature visual composition and deafening sound design, Steve McQueen portrays the harrowing realism of Northup's {{experience and the}} complicated relationships between master and slave, master and master, slave and slave, and so on". David Simon, {{the creator of the}} TV series The Wire, highly praised the movie, commenting that [...] "it marks {{the first time in history}} that our entertainment industry, albeit with international creative input, has managed to stare directly at slavery and maintain that gaze".|$|E
500|$|On the {{day after}} the Double Tenth, internees were ordered to parade in the open at nine o'clock the next morning. No {{explanation}} was given. When the parade had assembled, the camp commandant came out with a number of Kempeitai and troops, who closed all the exits. While the names of a few men were called out for immediate arrest, the Kempeitai conducted a thorough search of the entire prison. After incriminating evidence including diaries of war news compiled from the BBC's radio broadcasts, self-made radios, and a tin box containing a substantial amount of money belonging to an ex-banker were unearthed, several more arrests were made, mostly of people who had been involved in monitoring news broadcasts and running a secret information service throughout the prison. This started a period of <b>terror</b> <b>that</b> lasted for several months. Suspects were hauled from their homes and places of work. Internees [...] were taken to the Kempeitai interrogation chambers, where they were subjected to torture and starvation to make them confess to acts of sabotage and treason. As none of the suspects had even heard of Operation Jaywick, let alone been part of it, any confessions they made were meaningless, lacking any information about the raid itself, how it had been organised, or where the explosives had been obtained.|$|E
500|$|On {{the heels}} of 1984's presidential campaign, the rock group Supertramp {{featured}} spoken voice-overs from both Reagan and Bush on the right audio channel and their Democratic opponents Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro on the left audio channel durning the fade-out for their song [...] "Better Days". The song's video reviews the 20th century through a retrospective montage of its hardships and the leaders who promised solution. Beginning with the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} the Third Reich, the video sequences clips of military parades and battles moving forward to atomic test and other advancements in weapons technology, to footage of President Nixon, and then Reagan as his voice can be heard saying, [...] "Our nation is poised...for greatness." [...] In a similar vein, the last minute of Def Leppard's [...] "God's of War" [...] is layered with soundbites of Reagan, Thatcher and the noises of missile launches and bombs exploding. In a departure from Cold War rhetoric, the two leaders' quotes are lifted from their justifications for the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and Britain's participation in the affair. Reagan's quotes serve as precursory marks to the War of <b>Terror</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. would lead against majority Muslim countries in the following decades. He can be heard on the track saying, [...] "A message to terrorists everywhere. You can run...but you can't hide", and, [...] "We are not going to tolerate these attacks from outlaw states", ending with, [...] "They counted on America to be passive...They counted wrong," [...] in contrast to Def Leppard's anti-war lyrics.|$|E

[...] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, saying [...] "Monsters University, the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated 2001 Pixar hit Monsters, Inc., is no better or worse than the average (and I mean average) time-filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying that it [...] "never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop {{in the manner of}} the best Pixar stories. Nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four, and said it [...] "may not be as inventive as Inc., but it's an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three stars out of four, saying [...] "It may be children's <b>terror</b> <b>that</b> powers the movie's fictional universe, but it's the energy of its stars that lights up Monsters University." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A− and said it [...] "is exactly the rebound Pixar needed after 2011's Cars 2 left some wondering if the studio had lost its magic. The delightful story of when Mike met Sulley puts those concerns to rest." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three stars out of four and wrote [...] "Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids." ...|$|E
