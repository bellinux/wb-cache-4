40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} {{research suggests that}} import competition within European markets imposes a major constraint on domestic firms's price-cost margins. The programme for {{the completion of the}} European Community's (EC) internal market by 1992 is largely based on the effects expected from a reinforcement of such a constraint. But imports {{from the rest of the}} world could also exercise an important <b>trade</b> <b>discipline</b> on European market performance. In fact there are various arguments suggesting that the disciplinary effect of extra-EC imports could be stronger than that of intra-EC imports. The paper develops an empirical model to measure the relative strength of import discipline on price-cost margins in European industries. We find that both potential and actual competition induced by imports are effective in narrowing such margins. Furthermore, <b>trade</b> <b>discipline</b> varies not only according to various features of industry but also according to the origin of imports: only extra-EC imports were found to exercise a significant impact on price-cost margins.

40|$|The Indian {{economy has}} {{experienced}} a major transformation during {{the decade of the}} 1990 s. Apart from the impact of various unilateral economic reforms undertaken since 1991, the economy also had to reorient itself to the changing multilateral <b>trade</b> <b>discipline</b> within the newly written GATT/WTO framework. The unilateral trade policy measures have encompassed exchange-rate policy, foreign investment, external borrowing, import licensing, custom tariffs, and export subsidies. The multilateral aspect of India's trade policy refers to India's WTO commitments regarding trade in goods and services, trade-related investment measures, and intellectual property rights. The present study analyzes the economic effects on India and other major trading countries/regions of the Uruguay Round (UR) trade liberalization and the liberalization that might be undertaken in a new WTO negotiating round. India's welfare gain is expected to be 1. 1 % ($ 4. 7 billion over its 2005 GDP) when the UR scenarios get fully implemented. The additional welfare gain is an estimated 2. 7 % ($ 11. 4 billion) when the assumed future WTO round of multilateral trade liberalization is achieved.

40|$|This PhD {{studies the}} World Trade Organization (WTO) ’s dispute {{settlement}} (DSU) from a political-economic perspective. It pays {{particular attention to}} the strategic decision-making at the different steps of the WTO dispute settlement, and whether the WTO’s dispute settlement provides equal access and outcomes to all of the WTO member states. The WTO DSU provides a system for the settlement of trade conflicts. When a country perceives a violation of the WTO agreements by another WTO member, it can file a complaint at the WTO, which will then investigate the trade policy at hand. Due to the strengthening of international <b>trade</b> <b>discipline</b> by the coming into action of the WTO (1994), the number of disputes filed at the WTO has strongly risen. The high number of complaints shows that the WTO has so far not been able to deter individual member states from installing WTO inconsistent foreign trade barriers (FTBs). The main question addressed in this dissertation is whether the WTO DSU has been able to rule out the power differences between its member states. Indeed, the WTO DSU has been proclaimed as a means to level the playfield between the WTO member states, as it provides a more rule-based environment which presumably should have put all WTO members on equal footing in enforcing their market access abroad. It specifically studies the selection of FTBs for WTO litigation, and the actions and strategies of developing countries in navigating WTO dispute settlement. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The world endured {{exceedingly}} {{high prices}} on food commodities {{in the period}} leading up to May 2008. Grain prices, in particular, experienced rapid growth, with grain commodities selling at well over double the price received in 2006. Countries reacted by implementing export restrictions on rice and wheat, which further exacerbated prices and market volatility. Consequently, many economic authors have attempted to explain the rising prices. Most of the papers produced {{in the months following}} the price peak focused on the impact of the expansion in bio-fuel production and the effect of dollar depreciation. Furthermore, policy recommendations were proposed in line with these apparent causes. However, this thesis will rather pay attention to the effect of trade policy on the agricultural commodity markets. One of the more important objectives of the thesis is to understand the rationale behind countries utilising export restrictions. It can be argued that large food-exporting countries could be acting optimally in their implementation of export restrictions. Advantages arise due to an improvement in terms-of-trade and depressed prices on the domestic market for the commodity. In spite of this, the restrictions place pressure on the international market, with prices becoming high and volatile. The thesis analyses the decisions facing food-importers under such circumstances. Furthermore, it assesses the impact of trade strategies on income and welfare in large exporting and importing countries, as well as small importing countries. Several global agreements and programs have been utilised in the past to deal with the issues of high and erratic prices. The most anticipated agricultural <b>trade</b> <b>discipline</b> is the current round of WTO trade discussions, namely the Doha Development Agenda. Yet, the slow progress of the discussions has necessitated the development of other avenues of stabilisation. This thesis will put forward and discuss some of the more important of these policies.

A proper share of particular sectors, i. e. of the state, co-operative and private (sectors, in the whole trade activity was among others the subject of live interests of the science and of economic publicism in the years of economic reconstruction (1945 - 1949).

Interests were devoted also to theory of trade and new concepts within that scope put forward: The still developing scientific discussion on appraisal, of commodity turnover functioning gave push, especially in the seventies, to new ideas tending to adjust properly organizational structure of consumers goods market as well as its systems of planning and management with consumers' needs and preferences.

40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{a survey}} of the application of trade law rules to environmental management and decision-making by governments. It correlates five generic stages of environmental management against seven major <b>trade</b> law <b>disciplines</b> that are particularly relevant to measures {{for the protection of the}} national environment. The initial assessment that results from this analysis suggests that most existing and many future environmental measures would not survive trade law challenges since the increase in independent disciplines under NAFTA and the 1994 WTO Agreements. For older measures, the risks of an environmental measure being found inconsistent with trade law in the event of a challenge are high, as most trade requirements simply appear not to have been considered in the course of environmental law-making in the 1970 'searly 1990 's. However, the risks of a challenge coming about are not high, based on current levels of challenges and the politically constraining fact they must be initiated by governments. In addition, in the event a measure is found inconsistent with trade law, at least under the World Trade Organization process, there is an opportunity to rectify whatever specific failures may be found, and to revise the measure as appropriate. For new measures, the primary concern is the human and technical capacity to meet the trade requirements in a manner that is also consistent with the environmental management requirements. If the interpretations of the <b>trade</b> <b>disciplines</b> set forth in the paper are accurate, there are no inherent inconsistencies between them and environmental law-making to protect one's own environment. However, meeting all the requirements does require significant expertise sensitive to both the environmental and trade issues. This capacity [...] ...|$|R

This research describes the persistent, or undiscovered and un-restored lack of conformance to requirements as value loss in the delivered project. Construction value is lost through sub-optimal execution across all tasks and events throughout the construction process. This sub-optimal execution is failure to conform to a task requirement. The contract purchaser (client) expects to receive a specified value through letting a contract to a construction service provider (contract holder). When the project is delivered, it may be significantly devalued compared to the expectations implied in the contract documents. Tasks executed in a non-conforming manner, which are never discovered through normal QAQC process and are therefore never corrected or restored, remain in the delivered project to degrade the project/contract value.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} has explored {{both physical and}} policy linkage between trade and environment. Here we explore linkage through leverage in bargaining, whereby developed countries can use trade policy threats to achieve improved developing country environmental management, while developing countries can use environmental concessions to achieve <b>trade</b> <b>disciplines</b> in developed countries. We use a global numerical simulation model to compute bargaining outcomes from linked trade and environment negotiations, comparing developeddeveloping country bargaining only on trade policy with joint bargaining on both trade and domestic environmental policies. Results indicate joint gains from expanding the trade bargaining set to include environment, opposite to the current developing country reluctance to negotiate in the World Trade Organization on this issue. However, compared to bargaining with cash side payments, linking trade and environment through negotiation on policy instruments provides signi cantly inferior developing country outcomes. Thus, a trade and environment policy-linked negotiation may be better than an environment-only negotiation, but negotiating compensation to developing countries for environmental restraint would be better.

However, {{the impact of}} this technology’s use on the nature and quality of individual decisions has remained under-researched. We fill this gap by examining 4. 5 million trades of 5315 investors in the UK spread trading markets. The results suggest that there are demographic differences between those who do and do not use smart devices for trading. In addition, even after controlling for these, there are differences in the performance and nature of trading decisions of these two groups. In addition, we show that those who use SDA at some time tend to achieve higher Sharp Ratios, but exercise less <b>trading</b> <b>discipline</b> (measured by disposition effect). Importantly, those who at some time have used smart devices for trading, achieve improved performance (in terms of returns) and risk control (higher Sharp Ratios), when they use SDA compared to when they use traditional trading channels. However, when they use SDA they tend to be more subject to the disposition effect.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role that}} trade can potentially play in both negotiating and operating a post Kyoto/post 2012 global climate policy regime. As an addition to the bargaining set for a global climate negotiation, trade in principle widens the range of jointly beneficial potential outcomes and can in this sense be a potential facilitator of an agreed global climate regime. The reverse is also true, that in a linked climate-trade-finance global policy coordination structure that goes well beyond what was envisioned at Bretton Woods, climate now added to the global policy bargaining set also offers the prospect of potentially stronger <b>trade</b> <b>disciplines</b> (and even beyond WTO <b>disciplines</b> being negotiated). <b>Trade</b> policy can as well be an instrument {{for the implementation of}} a global climate regime, since trade provides a mechanism for achieving an internalization outcome for the global externality that climate change represents, and that provides a potentially more efficient outcome and also helps meet distributional objectives. In short, trade added to the emerging post 2012 climate regime can both expand the bargaining set for both (effectively linked) negotiations, and additionally provide an instrument for the implementation of an agreed outcome. ...|$|R

A model of incentives for a set of multi-task multiprincipal agencies is used to analyze the allocation of monitoring of trade and labor standards across international agencies. We find that when trade standards can be set with greater clarity than labor standards and the interests of the principals in standards enforcement are not unified then the incentives to adhere to labor standards may be overpowered whereas the incentives to adhere to trade standards may be under-powered when monitoring is assigned to a single agency. As a consequence, we will find that monitoring tasks will be allocated across international agencies so that the maximum power of enforcement granted to the agency is consistent with the standards that shoul...|$|R
