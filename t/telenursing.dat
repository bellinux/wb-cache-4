40|$|Background: Approximately 2 {{million of}} the 4. 5 million calls made in 2016 to the 1177 {{healthcare}} advice line resulted in the <b>telenurse</b> providing self-care advice to the care seeker. In some of these calls, the care seekers were offered the possibility of receiving a monitoring call. In 2016, 275, 000 monitoring calls were registered. A monitoring call is defined as when the <b>telenurse</b> monitors and supervises {{the course of the}} disease by telephone, i. e., the <b>telenurse</b> calls the care seeker back at regular intervals to follow the course of the disease and adapt the advice based on the care needs {{at the time of the}} call. In previous studies, the use of monitoring calls is mentioned as a method for <b>telenurses</b> to assess the need for care. An extended body of knowledge is needed concerning the phenomenon of monitoring calls. The overall aim in this thesis was therefore to increase knowledge of monitoring calls in telephone advice nursing from the perspective of care seekers and <b>telenurses.</b> Methods: This thesis consists of two studies that illustrate the experience of monitoring calls from different perspectives: those of the care seekers and those of the <b>telenurses.</b> The thesis focuses on the context, which is typical for qualitative research. Two different sets of data were collected using interviews. In study I, ten parents (nine mothers and one father) were interviewed. In study II, 19 <b>telenurses</b> were interviewed. The data were analysed inductively in both studies using qualitative content analysis. Findings: In study I, four main categories emerged: convenience, confirmation, support and guidance. In study II, the main category was: aiming at patient-safe self-care. The generic categories were focusing on the parent aiming at increasing their feeling of security, focusing on the child for patient safety, learning for parents and <b>telenurses</b> and relieving care. The parents’ sense of security seemed to involve a core sense of being able to care for a sick child at home; security often means feeling safe in a specific situation. Security was seen as fundamental in both study I and study II. The parents’ experienced that the monitoring call provided an opportunity to share their concerns about their child and the <b>telenurses</b> aimed to give the parents a feeling of security by calling them back. The <b>telenurses</b> described that working with a focus on patient safety was a factor in the monitoring call and that the calls contributed to good communication between themselves and the parents. The parents described a feeling of being taken seriously and that they experienced a sense of trust and security. It also seemed that the <b>telenurses</b> used monitoring calls for their own safety by following up on their previous advice and re-evaluating their assessment. Monitoring calls was perceived as a learning opportunity and an opportunity for feedback for both parents and <b>telenurses.</b> Relieving care was one of the aims of performing monitoring calls; the <b>telenurses</b> believed that parents should first try to perform self-care at home before going to a healthcare service. The parents seemed to perceive the monitoring call as a way to save time and it seemed to be more convenient for them to care for their sick child at home. The <b>telenurses</b> experienced, therefore, that by performing monitoring calls they reduced the need for visits to healthcare services. Conclusions: The results show how people can receive expert self-care advice, support and guidance for care with the help of monitoring calls. Monitoring calls seemed to provide a sense of security for those seeking care and also seemed to increase patient safety. Monitoring calls also provides a learning situation for both parents and <b>telenurses.</b> The use of monitoring calls seems to be a patient-safe form of telephone advice nursing and contributes to sustainable healthcare...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} patient safety and communication within national telephone advice nursing (SHD) in Sweden. Four empirical studies with different perspectives were conducted. The aim of Study I was to describe telenurses’ experiences of working with computerized decision support systems and how such systems could influence their work. The <b>telenurses</b> described a duality of perceptions: the CDSS both supported and inhibited their work. Study II aimed at describing medical errors that had led to an incident report {{within the context of}} SHD. Incident reports sent to and from the SHD during 2007 were collected. The results showed that <b>telenurses</b> have limited possibilities to refer callers to the appropriate level of care, and that other healthcare providers reported that <b>telenurses</b> had made an incorrect assessment regarding callers’ need for care. Study III aimed at describing the actual communication between <b>telenurses</b> and callers expecting a higher level of care than recommended by <b>telenurses,</b> and at investigating relationships within the communication between <b>telenurses</b> and callers. The results showed that <b>telenurses</b> were more prone to use closed-ended questions and did not follow up on callers’ understanding of the advice given. There was also a statistically significant positive relationship between callers’ expressions of Concern and telenurses’ expressions of Criticism, and also between utterances of Criticism between the parties. The aim of Study IV was to describe the characteristics of all malpractice claims following telephone calls to SHD, including the identified causes, the healthcare providers’ measures, and the actual communication between the <b>telenurses</b> and callers. The results showed that among the cases, 13 of 33 patients died and 12 were admitted to intensive care. The National Board of Health and Welfare’s (NBHW) investigations most commonly reported communication failure as the cause of the malpractice claims. The measures reported by SHD most commonly involved discussion in work groups and education of staff. Communication analysis showed a positive correlation between the callers’ expressions of Concern and the telenurses’ expressions of Reassurance. The results also showed communication patterns similar to those found in Study III. Hence, telenurses’ communicative strategies are not in line with the “dialogue process” they are educated in and could be regarded as a threat to patient safety. In conclusion, the importance of high quality communication is undoubted within telephone advice nursing, and specific training and supervision in communication for <b>telenurses</b> might contribute to improving their communicative competence as well as patient safety. Adapting the CDSS into encourage <b>telenurses</b> to explore callers’ reasons for calling and to follow up on understanding might facilitate patient safety. Organizations also need to take a system-wide approach when addressing patient safety issues and ensure that <b>telenurses</b> are given the resources they need to fulfill their work...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare {{communication}} patterns in calls subjected to a malpractice claim with matched controls. Setting: In many countries, telephone advice nursing is patients' first contact with healthcare. Telenurses' assessment of callers' symptoms and needs are based on verbal communication only, and problems with over-triage and under-triage have been reported. Participants: A total sample of all reported medical errors (n= 33) during the period 2003 - 2010 within Swedish Healthcare Direct was retrieved. Corresponding calls were thereafter identified and collected as sound files from the manager in charge at the respective call centres. For technical reasons, calls from four of the cases were not possible to retrieve. For the present study, matched control calls (n= 26) based on the patient's age, gender and main symptom presented by the caller were collected. Results: Male patients were in majority (n= 16), and the most common reasons for calling were abdominal pain (n= 10) and chest pain (n= 5). There were statistically significant differences between the communication in the cases and controls: <b>telenurses</b> used fewer open-ended medical questions (p< 0. 001) in the cases compared to the control calls; callers provided <b>telenurses</b> with more medical information in the control calls compared to the cases (p= 0. 001); and <b>telenurses</b> used more facilitation and patient activation activities in the control calls (p= 0. 034), such as back-channel response (p= 0. 001), compared to the cases. Conclusions: The present study shows that <b>telenurses</b> in malpractice claimed calls used more closed-ended questioning compared to those in control calls, who used more open-ended questioning and back-channel response, which provided them with richer medical descriptions and more information from the caller. Hence, these communicative techniques are important in addition to solid medical and nursing competence and sound decision aid systems.

40|$|First line healthcare’ {{is offered}} via {{telephone}} in many Western countries. The overall {{aim of this}} thesis is to describe Telephone Nursing (TN) from three viewpoints: <b>telenurses,</b> parents calling for their children, and operation managers. Four empirical studies were conducted. <b>Telenurses</b> described their work in five different ways: ‘Assess, refer and give advice to the caller’, ‘Support the caller’, ‘Strengthen the caller’, ‘Teach the caller’ and ‘Facilitate the caller’s learning’, which all constitute a TN ‘work map’. Authentic paediatric calls between parents and <b>telenurses</b> revealed that 73 % of callers were mothers and children were aged between 5 days and 14. 5 years. The top three contact reasons were ear and skin problems, and fever, with a median call length of 4. 4 minutes. More {{than half of the}} calls resulted in referrals and 48 % received self-care advice. The likelihood of fathers being given referrals {{as a result of their}} call was almost twice as high as that for mothers, while mothers were almost twice as likely to receive self-care advice as fathers. Parents described their degree of worry and trust that influenced their decisions whether to contact SHD or not. Their calls were carefully prepared, and the parent calling often depended on family routine. Parents reported to follow recommendations. Most relied upon their own intuition if further worried, but some indicated they would never seek healthcare unless it was recommended. Operation managers described four main goals of TN work: ‘create feelings of trust’, ‘achieve patient safety’, ‘assess, refer and give advice’, and ‘teach the caller’. Equitable healthcare was regarded as important, whereas health promotion was not considered as part of the goals. Conclusion: The studied TN viewpoints present concordance and discrepancies. Paediatric health calls appear mostly to be a woman-to-woman activity. Telenurses’ increased gender competence might increase TN safety. For that matter, telenurses’ collaboration with parents and making parents aware of holding the ultimate responsibility for their child’s condition is important. Goals of TN work and their relationship with healthcare obligations such as equitable healthcare and health promotion need further clarification. The viewpoints described in this thesis may contribute to the development of TN...|$|R

Current representations generally take the form of taxonomic vocabularies. These are seen as important as they provide a structure for retrieving and analysing data from automated systems. However, there is increasing evidence to show that traditional taxonomic vocabularies are unsuitable for capturing detailed clinical data.

40|$|There is wide {{agreement}} that acceptance and resistance are crucial factors in information system (IS) adoption. Research has yielded many theories that {{have focused on}} either acceptance or resistance, often implicitly assuming that these are opposites. This paper proposes a two-factor view on acceptance and resistance, and shows how this idea may advance our knowledge of IS adoption. In developing a user reactions framework, we take a first step towards integrating the IS literature on acceptance and on resistance. This framework distinguishes between two behavioural dimensions, namely, acceptance, ranging from high use to non-use, and a dimension that ranges from enthusiastic support to aggressive resistance. Combining the two dimensions leads to four categories of user reactions. We show the framework's usefulness by analysing data from a telecare implementation project. The findings identify ambivalent reactions. Many clients are identified as supporting but non-using, while we also find <b>telenurses</b> and care coordinators that show themselves to be resisting but using. These findings {{support the view that}} non-acceptance and resistance are conceptually non-equivalent. Our data suggest voluntariness as one determinant of the variation in behavioural reactions encountered. We argue that the concepts are also functionally different: IS implementers will have to adapt their strategies to the different reactions described. ...|$|R

In many countries, interstate and intercountry practice of <b>telenursing</b> is forbidden (the attending nurse must have a license both in their state/country of residence and in the state/country where the patient receiving telecare is located). The Nurse Licensure Compact helps resolve some of these jurisdiction issues. Legal issues such as accountability and malpractice, etc. are also still largely unsolved and difficult to address.

40|$|Background Swedish Healthcare Direct (SHD) {{receives}} 6 million calls yearly {{and aims}} at increased public {{sense of security}} and healthcare efficiency. Little is known about what SHD managers perceive as the primary goals of telephone nursing (TN) work and how the organisation matches goals of health promotion and equitable healthcare, so important in Swedish healthcare legislation. The aim {{of the study was}} to explore and describe what the SHD managers perceive as the goals of TN work and how the managers view health promotion and implementation of equitable healthcare with gender as example at SHD. Methods The study was qualitative using an exploratory and descriptive design. All 23 managers employed at SHD were interviewed and data analysis used deductive directed content analysis. Results The findings reveal four themes describing the goals of TN work as recommended by the SHD managers. These are: ‘create feelings of trust’, ‘achieve patient safety’, ‘assess, refer and give advice’, and ‘teach the caller’. Most of the managers stated that health promotion should not be included in the goals, whereas equitable healthcare was viewed as an important issue. Varying suggestions for implementing equitable healthcare were given. Conclusions The interviewed managers mainly echoed the organisational goals of TN work. The managers’ expressed goal of teaching lacked the caller learning components highlighted by <b>telenurses</b> in previous research. The fact that health promotion was not seen as important indicates a need for SHD to clarify its goals as the organisation is part of the Swedish healthcare system, where health promotion should always permeate work. Time used for health promotion and dialogues in a gender equitable manner at SHD is well invested as it will save time elsewhere in the health care system, thereby facing one of the challenges of European health systems...|$|R

Some older research did not find rural older adults to be disadvantaged {{in their use of}} health-related services in comparison to urban dwelling older adults (Blazer, Landerman, Fillenbaum, & Horner, 1995; Krout, 1989). However, distance to providers and healthcare facilities have been cited as a common barrier among rural-dwelling Veterans (Buzza et al., 2011). While not an issue exclusive to rural locations, older adults cite difficulty traveling and lack of transportation, as well as affordability of care, as the most common barriers to utilizing psychological services (Gum, Iser, & Petkus, 2010). Transportation barriers to healthcare access may be most notable for those with lower incomes (Syed, Gerber, & Sharp, 2013). Telehealth (also known as telemedicine; with related specialties of telepsychiatry, telemental health, and <b>telenursing,</b> to name a few [...] ) is one such way that health care providers, researchers, and policy makers are striving to offset the physical distance and related barriers in rural health care delivery.
