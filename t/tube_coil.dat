The CFD analysis of superheaters is done at design stage and later at the troubleshooting and performance evaluation during the operation of the plant. The CFD results obtained can be useful for the maintenance engineer to make suitable predictions of the tube life and make suitable arrangements for the high temperature zone to reduce the erosion of the <b>tube</b> <b>coil</b> and restricting the tube leakage problem. CFD analysis consists of modelling the superheater and doing analysis to study the velocity, pressure and temperature distribution of the steam inside the superheater. The uneven temperature distribution of steam in the tube leads to boiler tube leakage. CFD also helps to study the effect of the operating parameters on the tube erosion rate. Thermal power plants operates round the year and it is not always possible to shut down and analyse the problem. CFD helps in this.|$|E

The focus {{of this study is}} different from past studies which have been based on investigating system reliability in that is based on evaluating system efficiency, i. e., coefficient of performance;The vapor-compression refrigeration system used in this study contained a reciprocating compressor especially designed for the HFC- 134 refrigerant and a direct expansion evaporator coil with a rated capacity of 10 kW (3 tons). With respect to the refrigerant side heat transfer surface, two types of evaporator coils were tested, namely the microfin-tube type and the smooth-tube type;The effects of refrigerant/lubricant miscibility were investigated by comparing the performance of a miscible polyol ester lubricant (POE) and an immiscible naphthenic mineral oil (MO) of similar viscosity grade. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the operating HFC- 134 a refrigeration system was found to be consistently higher, up to 5 percent, for the miscible POE lubricant compared to the immiscible mineral oil. The increased performance for the POE operation is attributed to an increased evaporation heat transfer rate for the POE lubricant. The results of other tested miscible lubricants also indicated superior system performance of miscible lubricants;The lubricant viscosity effects were investigated by comparing the HFC- 134 a system performance of two miscible POE lubricants of different viscosity grades, namely an ISO 22 and an ISO 32. The results show that both the COP and the capacity are generally higher, up to 3. 5 percent, for the system employing the lower viscosity POE. Again, these performance differences were correlated to the differences in the evaporation heat transfer rate with the lower viscosity lubricant indicating a higher evaporation heat transfer rate;A partially miscible POE was also evaluated, and it resulted in a reduced performance compared to a fully miscible lubricant, and thus, it was concluded that partial miscibility in the evaporator has a negative effect on system performance;In contrast to the evaporator performance, the effects of lubricant type on compressor efficiencies were not substantial, as evident by the observed differences in both the isentropic and the volumetric efficiencies between tested lubricants being rarely larger than the respective uncertainties;It was observed that the effect of the lubricant type on performance was more pronounced for the microfin-tube coil. The microfin-tube coil outperformed the smooth-tube coil by up to 10 percent in terms of the overall heat transfer coefficient. In addition, the performance enhancement (i. e. the heat transfer enhancement for the microfin <b>tube</b> <b>coil</b> compared to the smooth <b>tube</b> <b>coil)</b> is more pronounced for the miscible POE lubricant;In summary, lubricant selection should not only be based on system reliability but also on the system performance and efficiency as evident {{by the fact that the}} use of miscible lubricants and a lower viscosity lubricant resulted in improved performance...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{quantify}} the biochemical conversion of the strong greenhouse gas N 2 O into the environmentally benign N 2 was developed. It is based on N 2 O gas diffusing through a soil core under specified laboratory conditions. Soil moisture level in the soil significantly influenced the N 2 O reduction potential of the soil. Nitrous oxide is produced in soil by nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms. Most of the N 2 O produced in soil is reduced to N 2 in the final step of denitrification, and only a fraction is released into the atmosphere. No reliable methods exist, however, to quantify N 2 O reduction and its controlling parameters in soil. In this study, we investigated: (i) a novel method {{to quantify the}} reduction of N 2 O in soil as it diffuses upward; and (ii) the effects of soil moisture content on N 2 O reduction. We developed a setup where a silicone <b>tube</b> <b>coil</b> permeable to N 2 O linked to an N 2 O reservoir simulated a subsoil with a known, artificial N 2 O source. A soil core filled with repacked sandy soil (a Typic Endoaquoll) was placed {{on top of the}} silicone coil. Experimental treatments included water-filled pore space (WFPS) levels of 60, 75, and 90 %, as well as a quartz sand treatment at 90 % WFPS that served as an abiotic control.

In the 90 % WFPS treatment, 52 % of applied N 2 O was reduced to N 2. We conclude that our method enables us to quantify N 2 O reduction in soil columns.

Many correlations for calculating these coefficients are available in literature, therefore choose the more suitable of them turns out to be not an easy task. This paper presents a discussion about the methodology to perform a comparison aimed to define the criterion for choosing the most suitable correlation to be used in a simulation model for prediction of heat exchangers performance in refrigeration systems. Differently from others works, where the results of each correlation are compared with those obtained by means specific experiments focused on the local phenomenon visualization, in this work the correlations are compared against the measurements of a complete finned-tube condenser integrated in a traditional air-to-water heat pump. The comparison has been carried out using a model able to discretize the heat exchanger through a finite volume method (FVM). The discussion is supported with a case study which was experimentally tested and numerically modeled. The condenser is a finned <b>tube</b> <b>coil</b> that characterized by two asymmetric circuits.

An accumulator allow adjusting the condenser sub-cooling. A specific test campaign has been designed in order to cover a wide range operating points of the condenser: different air velocities (from 1. 5 m/s to 4 m/s), inlet temperatures (20 - 46 °C) and sub-cooling (0 - 5 - 10 °C) have been taken into account. All the correlations considered were programmed and simulated with the software IMST-ART.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{formation}} of frost on a forced convection refrigeration coil, operating below the freezing temperature {{is known to}} have the effect of imparing the efficiency of a refrigeration system, This investigation was directed toward the study of the behavior of the overall coefficient of heat transfer and the air static pressure drop for a frosted coil. The experiment was conducted with a finned <b>tube</b> <b>coil</b> having staggered tube arrangement, The experimental equipment was so designed that the frost accumulation on the test coil could be measured with a platform scale. A chilled solution of 30 percent by weight of ethylene glycol and water supplied the cooling for the test coil. Tests were run at constant air flow rates of 585, 685 and 775 CFM. In each test the inlet air was maintained approximately at 32 ° F with a specific humidity of 0. 003 lbs of moisture per lb of dry air; the supplied antifreeze solution was kept at about 14 ° F with a flow rate of 1, 853 lbs per hr. Sufficient data were recorded, during each test, to determine the overall coefficient of heat transfer and the air static pressure drop through the test coil at various frost accumulations. It was observed that the overall coefficient of heat transfer at constant air flow rate increased slightly as frost first accumulated on the test coil and then decreased after the peak had been reached as the frost continued to increase. The air pressure drop increased continuously with increasing frost accumulation on the test coil. For each increment of frost weight per square foot of coil surface the magnitude of the air pressure drop was found to be greater at the higher air flow rates. The agreement between {{the results of the present}} investigation and the one previously made on the coils having in-line tubes arrangement suggested that the behavior of the overall coefficient of heat transfer and the air pressure drop were independent of coil geometry. For a system with a fixed capacity and design conditions the decrease in overall coefficient of heat transfer, during the heavy frosting, would lower the system efficiency by the reduction in the coefficient of performance of the refrigeration system. The increase in pressure drop at increasing frost accumulation on the coil surface would have a direct effect on lowering the system capacity by reducing the air flow in the system. The limited information made available by this investigation was not enough to cover the wide range of operating conditions and heat exchangers encountered in practice. More extensive research would be necessary to provide sufficient information for a better design of the refrigeration systems when the {{formation of}} frost on the heat exchanger surface could not be avoided...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Experimental {{measurements}} on the longitudinal dispersion of flowing water in <b>coiled</b> <b>tubes</b> were made using NaCi as tracer and conductivity measurement techniques. The 171 runs {{were made in}} coiled and straight 1 / 8 ", 1 / 4 " and 1 / 2 " I. D. polyethylene tubes from 25 to 300 ft. in length with coiling ratio, r/R[subscript c] (<b>tube</b> radius to <b>coiling</b> radius) from 0. 00515 to 0. 07407, and at Reynolds numbers from 108 to 45, 000. The results show that: a) In both laminar and turbulent regimes the longitudinal dispersion in <b>coiled</b> <b>tubes</b> was lower than in straight tubes for the same Reynolds number and same flow regimes. b) Coiling causes the transition from laminar to turbulent flow to occur at higher Reynolds number. c) In certain regimes, <b>coiled</b> <b>tubes</b> had larger longitudinal dispersion values than straight <b>tubes</b> because <b>coiled</b> <b>tube</b> flow remained in the laminar regime, while straight tube flow was turbulent. The results were analyzed and compared with previous investigators; the final quantitative findings are as follows: a) The transition to turbulent flow {{as a function of}} coiling is given in Figure 16. b) In the laminar regime the longitudinal dispersion is represented by Figures 12 and 13. c) In the turbulent regime, the longitudinal dispersion is represented by Figure 14. d) Onset of secondary flow to affect the longitudinal dispersion at low Reynolds number depends on the curvature ratio, and is represented by Figure 20. These results are consistent with other investigators' findings...|$|R
