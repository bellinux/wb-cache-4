5|$|When Harding {{took office}} on March 4, 1921, {{the nation was}} in the midst of a postwar {{economic}} decline. At the suggestion of its leaders, Harding called a special session of Congress to convene on April 11. When Harding addressed the joint session the following day, he urged the reduction of income taxes (raised during the war), an increase in tariffs on agricultural goods to protect the American farmer, as well as more wide-ranging reforms, such as support for highways, aviation, and radio. But it was not until May 27 that Congress passed an emergency <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> on agricultural products. An act authorizing a Bureau of the Budget followed on June 10; Harding appointed Charles Dawes as bureau director with a mandate to cut expenditures.|$|E
25|$|A direct subsidy was {{established}} in 1994 to compensate for any <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> to eligible residential users (those that consume less than 300kW·h per month). In the period (2001–2005), the Government paid about US$75.6 million in direct tariff subsidies to residential consumers.|$|E
25|$|Any {{adjustment}} of water tariffs requires Cabinet approval. In September 2009, King Abdullah stated that water tariffs {{would not be}} increased. In June 2010 the government announced the first <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> since 1997, emphasizing that low-volume consumers would not be affected because the tariff in the first block remained unchanged. The <b>tariff</b> <b>increase,</b> said to amount to only 9% for volumes beyond the first block, would become effective in January 2011. At the same time, the billing cycle was changed from every three months to monthly. Furthermore, tariffs in five governorates were silently substantially increased to {{the same level as}} in Amman. In February 2012 the Cabinet decided to return to the quarterly billing cycle and to further increase tariffs in the higher blocks of consumption.|$|E

25|$|There are no {{autonomous}} {{regulatory agencies}} {{for water and}} sanitation in Germany at the state or federal level. The recently created federal regulatory agency for network industries (Bundesnetzagentur) covers telecommunications, postal services, electricity, gas and rail. It does not cover water supply and sanitation, since it is a responsibility of the states. Water and sanitation tariffs are approved through different procedures in each state, usually by a department in the state Ministry of Economy after {{a review of the}} <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> request by an independent auditor. In city-states (Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen) this means that the Minister (called Senator) of Economy both requests the <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> in his capacity as {{chairman of the board of}} the utility and also approves it, which constitutes a conflict of interest. In the case of some private utilities, tariffs are set by a mutually agreed arbitrator based on the professional opinion of an auditor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tariff</b> <b>increase</b> {{approvals}} occur infrequently and {{are insufficient}} {{to compensate for}} inflation, thus resulting in an erosion of real tariff levels. Tariffs in municipal systems tend to be even lower than tariffs for systems managed by SANAA, suggesting that tariff setting in municipalities is more prone to political capture in Honduras than tariff setting at the national level.|$|E
25|$|NWSC {{has been}} turned around without a <b>tariff</b> <b>increase,</b> except for {{inflation}} adjustments and a 10 percent increase to compensate the utility for a reduction in connection fees.

25|$|Water {{and sewer}} retails tariffs were {{increased}} in 2006 {{throughout the country}} by reducing {{the size of the}} first block of the increasing-block tariff from 8 to 6 cubic meters per month and by increasing the fixed portion of the bill. The volumetric tariff for each tariff block remained unchanged. These modifications were equivalent to an 11% (check) <b>tariff</b> <b>increase.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{regulatory}} agency, the National Water and Sewerage Institute - Instituto Nicaragüense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, INAA - is {{in charge}} of sector regulation. It handles customer complaints, approves tariff increases and can provide concessions for service providers. However, there were no <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> requests between August 2002 and February 2008 and no requests for concessions, so that the regulator has been condemned to inactivity.|$|E
25|$|Between 1994 and 2001 water tariffs {{throughout}} the country were increased substantially, so that the ratio of cost recovery to operating costs increased from 27% to 87%. Such a substantial real <b>tariff</b> <b>increase,</b> which apparently did not cause political turmoil, is unusual in developing countries. However, the increase in tariffs was not paralleled by improvement in services. According to the IDB sector performance even deteriorated in this period.|$|E
50|$|Change in tariffs over time. Tariffs in {{most cities}} {{increased}} moderately in the 2002-2005 period net of inflation. According to the SNIS the average urban water <b>tariff</b> <b>increased</b> by 57% {{and the average}} sanitation <b>tariff</b> <b>increased</b> by 54% in nominal value prices, while inflation stood at 40%, thus resulting in a moderate increase in real prices.|$|R
50|$|In {{almost all}} cases, water <b>tariffs</b> <b>{{increased}}</b> {{in the long}} run under privatization. In some cases, such as in Buenos Aires and in Manila, tariffs first declined, but then increased above their initial level. In other cases, such as in Cochabamba or in Guyana, <b>tariffs</b> were <b>increased</b> at the time of privatization. In some cases in Sub-Saharan Africa, where much of the investments are funded through development aid, <b>tariffs</b> did not <b>increase</b> over a long period. For example, in real terms tariffs remained stable in Senegal, while in Gabon they declined by 50% in five years (2001-2006) and by 30% in ten years in Côte d'Ivoire (1990 to 2000). These exceptions notwithstanding, <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> are the rule over the long term. However, initial tariffs have been well below cost recovery levels in almost all cases, sometimes covering {{only a fraction of the}} cost of service provision. <b>Tariff</b> <b>increases</b> would thus have been necessary under public management as well, if the government wanted to reduce subsidies. The magnitude of <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> is influenced by the profit margin of private operators, but also to a large extent by the efficiency of utilities in terms of water losses and labor productivity.|$|R
40|$|Using a North-South trade {{model with}} {{innovation}} and imitation, we investigate {{the interaction of}} intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and trade protection. We show that unlike a Southern tariff, a Northern tariff supplements IPR protection and {{is not necessarily a}} beggar-thy-neighbor policy. The globally optimal Northern <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> as IPR protection in the North or the South decreases. Global welfare may rise as Northern <b>tariff</b> <b>increases,</b> but necessarily declines as Southern <b>tariff</b> <b>increases.</b> This suggests that pushing for freer trade in the South is more urgent than in the North in innovation-intensive sectors where IPR protections are weak in both regions. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.

25|$|The {{autonomy}} of the local corporations, however, remained limited. Important decisions such as the approval of tariff increases, investment decisions, and {{the selection of the}} General Manager of each Local Corporation still required the approval of the central government. Investments are financed by foreign grants channeled through the central government. Furthermore, the Boards of the local corporations often did not play an active role. For example, in Ibb the Board met infrequently, did not discuss the corporation's accounts and was reluctant to even discuss a <b>tariff</b> <b>increase.</b> In 2009 a study recommended to transform local corporations into public companies with clear business plans and more autonomy, but this recommendation was not implemented.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, in December 1988 the General Water and Sanitation Law (Ley General de Servicios Sanitarios) {{allowed the}} {{granting}} of 13 regional concessions to public, private or mixed shareholding companies in each of Chile’s regions. In 1990 the regulatory agency SISS (Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios) was created through a separate law. An innovative model of tariff regulation was borrowed from the Chilean electricity and telecommunications sector: Efficient cost levels were estimated for an imaginary model company and used as a benchmark to set tariffs for the utilities. Means-tested subsidies (i.e. subsidies that are granted only to those that demonstrably have limited means) were also introduced {{at the same time}} to cushion the effect of the <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> on the poor. The legal framework with some modifications is still in force today.|$|E
2500|$|Urban {{water and}} sewer tariffs charged by ENACAL have last been {{increased}} in 2008. There used to be substantial increases between 1998 and 2001, with annual increases of 28, 27 and 12% in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively. Such high and sustained increases were unusual in the region. While these increases allowed the public utility to regain its financial health, [...] in 2001 they led to protests and legal action against a proposed further 30% <b>tariff</b> <b>increase.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} five years of the {{contract}} the government regularly approved requests for <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> from the private company without much questions asked. There was no independent regulatory agency that could give a professional opinion about whether a request for <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> was justified or not. There was also no financial model that could have served as a tool to help analyze of requests to <b>increase</b> <b>tariffs.</b> According to the World Bank the regulatory capacity of the asset holding company remained weak throughout the contract.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tariff</b> <b>increases.</b> Between 1998 and 2010 {{the water}} <b>tariff</b> <b>increased</b> threefold, from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m3 {{in the lowest}} {{category}} and from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) in the highest category. This far exceeded the growth of household income {{during the same period}} and thus increased the burden of water tariffs on all water consumers, including the poor.|$|R
25|$|Tariff setting. Residential tariffs are set {{centrally}} and {{are almost}} the same all over Egypt. In certain areas they were raised after the reforms of 2005, and again in 2017. Residential <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> have {{to be approved by}} the holding company, the national water regulatory agency EWRA, the Ministry of Water Supply and Sanitation, the Cabinet of Ministers, the President of the Republic and the National Assembly. Tariffs in some areas have not been increased {{for more than two decades}} since 1992,. Since the Arab Spring residential <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> have become even more difficult to approve. Industrial tariffs, however, can be set by Affiliated Companies without government approval. However, the rising subsidy bill compelled the government to approve <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> in 2017.|$|R
2500|$|Some historians, {{including}} Andrew Bacevich, {{suggest that}} U.S. {{foreign policy is}} directed by [...] "wealthy individuals and institutions." [...] In 1893, a decision to back a plot to overthrow the president Harrison in Hawaii was clearly motivated by business interests; it {{was an effort to}} prevent a proposed <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> on sugar. As a result, Hawaii became a U.S. state afterward. There was allegation that the Spanish–American War in 1898 was motivated mainly by business interests in Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards tariffs {{have been}} frozen, eroding again the {{financial}} {{health of the}} utility. This led to its near bankruptcy and required the National Government to make transfers of an average of US$20 million per year to compensate net losses as of 2005. In February 2008 a water <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> was approved to cover the rise in inflation between 2002 and 2006. [...] This increase {{is to be applied}} gradually beginning in May 2008, with an average increase of about 16%. [...] Future increases will be approved by INAA.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to address ENEE's {{delicate}} financial situation, the government intends to raise tariffs for certain consumers, those whose bills are the highest. This increase, which will bring tariffs closer to costs, would not affect residential users whose consumption is below 100kWh. A 16% <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> for fuel adjustment was already applied in January 2008. According to the new manager of ENEE, an additional 11% adjustment will be applied in May. The overall target, established in the [...] "Financial Plan for the Strengthening of ENEE" [...] is for tariffs to have increased by 27% {{at the end of}} 2008.|$|E
50|$|According to an {{analysis}} by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Trump's proposed <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> on China and Mexico could, if China and Mexico retaliate with their own <b>tariff</b> <b>increases,</b> push the U.S. into recession and cost 5 million U.S. jobs. Even more limited retaliation by China and Mexico, or an aborted trade war (the Trump administration backs down from its <b>tariff</b> <b>increases</b> one year into them) would hit the U.S. economy hard. Gary Clyde Hufbauer, senior fellow at PIIE, notes that there is ample precedent and scope for a U.S. president to unilaterally raise tariffs as Trump has vowed to do, and that efforts to block Trump's actions through the courts, or by amending the authorizing statutes in Congress, would be difficult and time-consuming.|$|R

Before the 2016 <b>tariff</b> <b>increase,</b> on average [...] "the government (was) only recovering {{one or two}} percent of its costs, and the (subsidy) plans are benefiting the rich, not the poor", according to Adil Bushnak. According to a 2000 estimate by the World Bank, the government paid annual subsidies of US$3.2 billion, equivalent to 1.7% of GDP and 7% of oil revenues. Desalinated water is provided for free by SWCC to NWC. Before {{the introduction of the}} private sector in Riyadh, the Riyadh branch of MOWE – probably one of the best performing branches - had revenues of 370 million Riyals in 2004, but expenses of 570 million Riyals.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the impact}} of the 1997 East Asian {{financial}} crisis the contracts were renegotiated through a [...] "Restated Cooperative Agreement" [...] signed in October 2001. The agreement also foresaw the creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) as an [...] "independent" [...] regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for tariff increases on behalf of the Governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works. Initially, PAM Jaya had the responsibility to monitor the performance of the two private companies on behalf of the city government in addition to being an asset holding company. By creating the regulatory body the regulatory function was to be clearly separated from the asset holding function, thus avoiding a possible perception of a conflict of interest. In April 2001 the City Council approved a <b>tariff</b> <b>increase</b> of 35 percent, while leaving tariffs in the two poorest consumer categories unchanged. After the signing of the new contract, lengthy negotiations began with the assistance of external advisors brought in {{with the support of the}} Asian Development Bank about the so-called [...] "rate rebasing" [...] for the period 2002-2007. During the negotiations, two other tariff increases were approved in April 2003 and January 2004, again leaving tariffs for the poorest unchanged. For the first time since 1998, in 2003 average water tariffs became higher than water charges, standing at 5,000 and 4,000 Rupiahs per cubic meter respectively.|$|E
