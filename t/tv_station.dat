5|$|The major Russian ORT <b>TV</b> <b>station</b> {{organised}} {{a national}} televised debate {{as to what}} should be done with the station. Former cosmonaut Georgi Grechko suggested that it should be kept in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it, for transfer to the International Space Station or other spacecraft, however Konstantin Feoktistov argued that it would cost more to retrieve the equipment than to replace it. Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E

40|$|My master thesis aims {{to examine}} how a Chinese {{political}} economy context has shaped the media landscape in China, especially {{in the domain of}} provincial television. The key issues are: 1) what the role of private profit accumulation is for provincial <b>TV</b> <b>stations</b> in China; 2) Whom the ownership of provincial <b>TV</b> <b>stations</b> in China belongs to; 3) how global capitalism influence provincial <b>TV</b> <b>stations</b> today; 4) how government regulation influence provincial <b>TV</b> <b>stations</b> today. Theoretically, we follow a political economy framework developed by Wasko (1994), Meehan (2005), and Mosco (2009) and relate western theories to a Chinese social context, by referring to a range of academic works focusing on the Chinese media and a political economy context in China (e. g. Bai, 2005; Zhao, 2008). Based on a case study of Hunan provincial satellite television (Hunan PSTV), the results show that: 1) advertising is the main contributor to the total income of provincial TV stations; 2) provincial <b>TV</b> <b>stations</b> are state-owned according to the party-state’s definition, but they have started to gain some capitalistic characteristics as they are increasingly driven by  audience-rating and advertising revenue; 3) party-state can support the commercialization of provincial <b>TV</b> <b>stations</b> by taking a series of reforms, and at the same time, it can readily suppress the development of provincial <b>TV</b> <b>stations,</b> by issuing legal decrees...|$|R

5|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union a few years earlier, the Russian economy had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia's space finances came from flights of astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese <b>TV</b> <b>station</b> paying $9.5 million to have one of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard Mir. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights of the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E
5|$|The flood had {{a massive}} effect on Fairbanks. Four people were killed, {{and the damage}} ran into the {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars. It helped push the city's remaining farm, Creamer's Dairy, into bankruptcy, and it forced the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital. Fairbanks residents responded to the problems with aplomb. The annual Tanana Valley State Fair was postponed but not canceled. Seven thousand dollars were raised to buy Creamer's Dairy and turn it into a bird sanctuary. KTVF, one of the few town businesses to have flood insurance, rebuilt its studio and became the first Fairbanks <b>TV</b> <b>station</b> to broadcast in color, four months after the flood. When two bond measures to build a government-run hospital were turned down by Fairbanks voters, residents raised $2.6 million from private contributions and $6 million from the state and federal government to build Fairbanks Memorial Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1952, General Tire {{purchased}} the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations {{and the rights}} to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its <b>TV</b> <b>station</b> in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post). Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of Mutual. That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined. Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.|$|E
5|$|The first {{television}} signal broadcast in Croatia occurred in 1939 during the Zagreb Fair, where Philips showcased its television system. The first regular broadcasts started in 1956, when Television Zagreb was established {{as the first}} <b>TV</b> <b>station</b> in the Yugoslav Radio Television system. Color broadcasts began in 1975. Coverage and number of channels grew steadily, and by the 2000s there were four channels with nationwide coverage in Croatia. DVB-T signal broadcasts began in 2002, and in 2010 a full digital switchover was completed. During that period the IPTV, cable and satellite television markets grew considerably, and by 2011 only 60.7 percent of households received DVB-T television only; the remainder were subscribed to IPTV, cable and satellite TV in addition, or as the sole source of TV reception. As of January 2012 DVB-T is broadcast in three multiplexes, while the territory of Croatia is divided into nine main allotment regions and smaller local allotments corresponding to major cities. High-definition television (HDTV) is broadcast only through IPTV, although HDTV DVB-T test programming was broadcast from 2007 to 2011. A DVB-T2 test broadcast was conducted in 2011.|$|E
