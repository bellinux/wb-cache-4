[...] Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times called the album [...] "exuberant." [...] Christian John Wikane from PopMatters commented that the album [...] "proved that Madonna, {{approaching}} 50 years-old, is a vital force in the ever-expansive landscape of popular music." [...] Joan Morgan from The Village Voice noted that [...] "ith Confessions on a Dance Floor, Madonna at long last finds her musical footing. Easily dance record of the year, Confessions is an almost seamless tribute to the strobe-lit sensuality of the '80s New York club scene that gave Madge her roots, which she explores with compelling aplomb." [...] Josh Tyrangiel from Time magazine commented that [...] "In dance music, words exist to be repeated, twisted, obscured and resurrected. How they sound in the moment {{is far more important}} than what they mean, and Madonna knows <b>that</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> anyone. Confessions on a Dance Floor is 56 minutes of energetic moments. It will leave you feeling silly for all the right reasons." ...|$|E

The analysis indicates <b>that</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> break-even performance is possible even in a deuterium-deuterium system at bench-top scales. The proposed device has the unusual property that it can avoid both the cusp losses of traditional magnetic fusion systems and the grid losses of traditional IEC configurations.|$|E

2500|$|President Abraham Lincoln asked Barnum and Nutt {{to come to}} the White House in November 1862. When the two arrived, Lincoln left {{a cabinet}} meeting to welcome them. Nutt asked Salmon P. Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, if he was the man who was {{spending}} so much of Uncle Sam's money. [...] Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, interrupted {{to say that he was}} the man. [...] "Well," [...] said Nutt, [...] "It is in a good cause, anyhow, and I guess it will come out all right." [...] As Barnum and Nutt were on their way out, President Lincoln shook Nutt's hand. He told the Commodore that he should [...] "wade ashore" [...] if his [...] "fleet" [...] was ever in danger. Nutt looked up and down Lincoln's long legs. [...] "I guess, Mr. President", he said, [...] "You could do <b>that</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> I could." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, Thomas {{was seriously}} {{considering}} {{not running for}} a fifteenth term. Local Democrats organized an appreciation dinner on November 21, 1963 with over 3200 attendees {{to persuade him to}} run for another term. The most visible attendees were President John F. Kennedy and Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson who both spoke of Thomas's leadership. Kennedy said, [...] "Next month, when the United States of America fires the largest booster {{in the history of the}} world into space for the first time, giving us the lead, fires the largest, payroll -- payload -- into space, giving us the lead. [...] " [...] here the President paused a second and grinned. [...] "It will be the largest payroll, too," [...] he quipped. The crowd roared. [...] "And who should know <b>that</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> Houston. We put a little of it right in here." [...] The President then resumed in a more serious vein, [...] "But in any case, the United States next month will have a leadership in space which it wouldn't have without Albert Thomas. And so will this city." ...|$|E
