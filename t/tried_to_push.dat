5|$|The only {{lightweight}} bout on {{the preliminary}} card saw Thiago Tavares defeating Manny Gamburyan by unanimous decision. Tavares went for ground-and-pound after takedowns, while the smaller Gamburyan <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the pace on the feet {{but was unable}} to counter Tavares' more powerful strikes. All three judges scored it 29–28 in favor of Tavares.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} he {{returned}} to Dorothea's Courland court, where {{he served as a}} tutor for her daughter. Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working for the Russian authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored a plan for a European federal organization of states intended to prevent armed conflicts and to maintain perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, on the {{northern}} flank, the 10th Division was much more successful. Instead of waiting for orders from General Żeligowski, the commanding officer of the 10th Division, Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée, started a push along the southern bank of the Bugonarew. The 28th and 29th Kaniów Rifles Infantry Regiments managed to reach the village of Mokre, on a small hill overlooking Radzymin and the Białystok-Warsaw road, directly behind the Russian lines. The Russians <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the Poles back from that position, but ultimately failed. Their assault on the village of Wiktorów also ended in failure. Soon the Polish positions in Mokre were secured, and further reinforced with {{the remainder of the}} 1st Battalion, 28th Regiment.|$|E

5|$|Detachment Brandenstein {{attacked}} {{towns of}} Kotka and Lahti. The Red Guards' strong defence {{in the former}} stalled the Germans' plan, but they took over Lahti on 19–20 April. The German troops advanced from east-southeast; via Nastola, through Mustankallio graveyard in Salpausselkä and Russian garrisons of Hennala. The battle was mild, but strategically important as it cut connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. Fierce battles, in {{the town and the}} surrounding area broke out between 22 April and 2 May 1918, as several thousand western Red Guard and Red civilian refugees <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> through Lahti on their way to Russia. The German troops were able to hold major parts of the town and halt the Red advance. Around 600 Reds and 80 German soldiers perished in the Lahti combats. In total 30,000 Reds were imprisoned in the town and the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fourteenth}} century the Swedish kings <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the areas of their control towards the north, and {{contemporary}} maps depicted the now Norwegian coastal areas of Troms and Finnmark {{as a part of}} Sweden. The possibly boldest move of any Danish-Norwegian regent was to make a voyage to the Northern Lands to secure these lands under the Danish-Norwegian crown.|$|E
25|$|According {{to his son}} Branislav, Momčilo Gavrić had an {{incident}} with the law in 1929. He was working in Šabac and Belgrade {{when he reached the}} age of conscription, and at the military barracks in Slavonska Požega, he reported that he already had been in the army during the war. He also said that he had been wounded, and had received the Albanian Commemorative Medal. However, an ethnic Croat in the Royal Yugoslav Army <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> Gavrić into signing a confession that he had told a lie. He refused, and was sent to prison, spending two months there.|$|E

25|$|Afterwards, Paisley {{gathered}} {{a throng of}} Orangemen and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> through the police lines, but was arrested. Loyalists threw missiles at the police and tried {{to break through the}} blockade; police responded with plastic bullets. In support of the Orangeman, loyalists blocked roads across Northern Ireland, and there were attacks on Catholics and the police. The march was eventually allowed to continue through the Catholic area. As the march ended, Paisley and David Trimble held hands in the air {{in what appeared to be}} a gesture of triumph, causing considerable ill-feeling among the Catholic residents.|$|E
25|$|The police {{broke down}} {{the door to the}} shop, only to find large, armed group of {{defenders}} waiting for them. The squatters started hurling stones through the shop window, and the police officers at the front soon found themselves trapped between the attacking squatters and the rush of police coming in from behind. Instead of retreating, the police commanders ordered their men to form a shield wall and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> their way into the street. The squatters responded by attempting to burn down the shop with the police inside, but the police had brought fire extinguishers with them and were able to put out the flames of the Molotov cocktail.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, U.S. {{forces in}} Stryker {{vehicles}} <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> deeper into Sadr City but {{were met with}} stiff resistance from fighters using machine-guns and RPGs. After heavy fighting the troops withdrew to their start positions. 28 militants were killed, 6 U.S. soldiers were wounded, several U.S. military vehicles were damaged and three buildings used by militants were destroyed by American bombing during the battle. It brought to 79 the number of militiamen killed in the three days of fighting in Sadr city. Later in the evening one U.S. soldier {{was killed in the}} vicinity of Sadr City. Two other U.S. soldiers were also killed this day in fighting in other northern and northwestern parts of the capitol.|$|E

25|$|Like most peace plans since 1967, it {{is based}} on UN Security Council Resolution 242. It {{followed}} the July 2000 Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David which ended in failure and the al-Aqsa Intifada beginning in September 2000. In fall 2002, the Bush administration strenuously <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> a temporary cease-fire in the intifada to give breathing room for the Beirut summit but failed to achieve an agreement. However, the presence of American negotiator Anthony Zinni in Israel led to a lull in the conflict for the two weeks before the summit. During this period, the administration hoped to draw attention away from the Iraq disarmament crisis that would later escalate into the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, about 10,000 Orangemen and {{supporters}} had gathered at Drumcree and {{were engaged in}} a standoff with about 1,000 police. During this standoff, loyalists continuously threw missiles at the police and tried to break through the police blockade; police responded by firing 24 plastic bullets. In support of the Orangeman, loyalists blocked numerous roads across Northern Ireland, and sealed off the port of Larne. There was violence in some Protestant areas. On the evening of Monday 10 July, Ian Paisley (Democratic Unionist Party leader) and David Trimble (Ulster Unionist Party leader) held a rally at Drumcree. Afterwards, they gathered a number of Orangemen and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> through the police line, but were taken away by officers.|$|E
25|$|When Christina came of age, she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> Oxenstierna, her old mentor, aside. The {{relations}} between the two were not good and Oxenstierna always attributed the exiguousness of Sweden's gains under the Peace of Westphalia − Sweden gained only Pomerania, Usedom, Wollin, Wismar and Bremen-Verden − following the conference in Osnabrück to Christina's undue interference. When the queen, a few years later, wanted to abdicate, Oxenstierna at first opposed this because he feared mischief to Sweden from the unruly and adventurous disposition of her preferred successor, Charles X Gustav. The chancellor changed his mind about Charles Gustav, however, and gave Christina the help she needed to go through with her abdication. Oxenstierna died a couple of months after the ascension of the new king.|$|E

25|$|As {{a police}} {{investigator}} in 1952, Heuer attempted {{to establish the}} circumstances of the death of his brother-in-law, who had been captured while fighting alongside the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord at Leisenwald and Waldensberg near Wächtersbach. Along with others, he had apparently been shot in the head by U.S. Army soldiers. His inquiries were not fruitful, but the German War Graves Commission did conduct an exhumation of a mass grave in the area in 1961, and re-interred 34 bodies in the nearby war cemetery, 23 of which had clearly been shot in the head. Heuer returned to the area during this investigation and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> for an inquiry into the killings, but was unsuccessful. He died on 6 January 2002.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{quarantine}} checkpoints instituted by Peter I {{and expanded}} by Catherine II were sufficient to prevent plague from reaching {{inside the country}} in peacetime, but they proved to be inadequate in time of war. The system regarded all epidemics as external threats, focusing on border control, and paid less attention to domestic measures. The epidemic blocked the logistics of Rumyantsev's army, and as the state <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> more reserves and supplies to the theatre, peacetime quarantine controls had to be lifted. Plague swept into Poland and Ukraine; by August 1770 it reached Bryansk. Catherine refused to admit the plague in public, although she was clearly aware {{of the nature and}} proportions of the threat, as evidenced by her letters to Governor of Moscow Pyotr Saltykov.|$|E
25|$|The two {{suspects}} at first denied {{any involvement in}} Meddour's death, but after he was remanded on probable cause, Nödtveidt eventually made a confession. His account started the night of 21 to 22 July 1997, which he spent drinking at various pubs and clubs in Göteborg, along with Vlad and two other friends. In the early morning, the two other friends headed back home, while Nödtveidt and Vlad started roaming in the city centre. Next to a park locally known as a meeting place for gay men, they were accosted by a stranger, who {{at the sight of}} their clothes asked them if they were Satanist, and told them he wanted to learn about this cult. At first, Nödtveidt and Vlad <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> back the unknown man, but he insisted. This was how they came to know Meddour.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the army}} {{continued}} to lose men and battles, the navy successfully cut the Japanese supply {{line from the}} sea; Admiral Yi Sun-sin defeated the Japanese fleet several times and did much damage to the supply ships. With the navy blocking supplies, Chinese forces under General Li Rusong arrived, and began to push the Japanese southward, eventually retaking Pyongyang. Konishi Yukinaga successfully blocked a Chinese advance at Battle of Byeokjegwan, and again <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the Koreans northward, but the crucial blow came at the Battle of Hangju, where General Gwon Yul defeated the Japanese with a much smaller force. The Japanese then decided to enter into peace negotiations, while both sides continued fighting. During these negotiations Koreans retook Seoul, but the palaces had all been burnt to the ground, so Seonjo repaired {{one of the old}} royal family's houses and renamed it Deoksugung, {{making it one of the}} official palaces.|$|E
25|$|During its {{earliest}} history, the colony of Louisville {{and the surrounding}} areas suffered from Indian attacks, as Native Americans <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> out the encroaching colonists. As the Revolutionary War was still being waged, all early residents lived within forts, {{as suggested by the}} earliest government of Kentucky County, Virginia. The initial fort, at the northern tip of today's 12th street, was called Fort-on-Shore. In response to the threat of British attacks, particularly Bird's invasion of Kentucky, a larger fort called Fort Nelson was built north of today's Main Street between Seventh and Eighth streets, covering nearly an acre. The GB￡15,000 contract was given to Richard Chenoweth, with construction beginning in late 1780 and completed by March 1781. The fort, thought to be capable of resisting cannon fire, was considered the strongest in the west after Fort Pitt. Due to decreasing need for strong forts after the Revolutionary War, it was in decline {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E
25|$|Mass Effect: Andromeda {{was built}} using EA DICE's Frostbite 3 engine, which {{required}} that BioWare construct all systems, tools, and assets from scratch as {{the series was}} previously built on Epic Games' Unreal Engine. Going into development, the company knew that the transition to Frostbite would be a difficult one, having already made the switch for Dragon Age: Inquisition, which proved to be extremely challenging as the engine was not designed with role-playing games in mind. In an effort to optimize the engine's capabilities, BioWare would sometimes enlist the help of other Frostbite developers. For example, {{to ensure that the}} game's driving mechanics handled well, BioWare invited the Need for Speed team to come onsite and offer advice and guidance. BioWare <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>push</b> the boundaries of the software, particularly in the area of character animation, but struggled with facial animations in particular. This was due in part to struggles with various animation programs, an understaffed development team, and a delayed production cycle.|$|E
