5|$|Portions of <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> are {{produced}} by various aerospace firms. AgustaWestland has produced number of components for <b>the</b> <b>Apache,</b> both for the international market and for the British Army's AgustaWestland Apache. Since 2004, Korea Aerospace Industries has been the sole manufacturer of the Apache's fuselage. Fuselage production had previously been performed by Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical; the transfer of fuselage production led to a prolonged legal dispute between Teledyne Ryan and Boeing.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Apache</b> was {{a valued}} form of {{close air support}} in the {{conflict}} in Afghanistan, being deployed to the region in 2006. <b>The</b> <b>Apache</b> has been an object of controversy over the fitting of some weapons, such as cluster munitions. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which is a unique application of <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> amongst its operators. British Apaches served in the NATO 2011 military intervention in Libya operating from Royal Navy ships.|$|E
5|$|The Comanches {{were willing}} to fight the enemies of their new friends, and soon {{attacked}} the Karankawa. Over the next several years, the Comanches killed many of the Karankawa {{in the area and}} drove the others into Mexico. By 1804, very few natives lived on the barrier islands, where the Karankawa had made their home. In January 1790, the Comanche also helped the Spanish fight a large battle against the Mescalero and Lipan Apaches at Soledad Creek west of San Antonio. Over 1000Comanche warriors participated in raids against <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> in 1791 and 1792, and <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> were forced to scatter into the mountains in Mexico. In 1796, Spanish officials began an attempt to have <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> and Comanche coexist in peace, and {{over the next ten years}} the intertribal fighting declined.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Dilzhe’e <b>Apache</b> {{refer to}} {{themselves}} (autonym) as Dilzhę́’é, as do <b>the</b> San Carlos <b>Apache.</b> <b>The</b> Western <b>Apache</b> from Bylas {{use the word}} Dilzhę́’é to refer to both the San Carlos and Tonto <b>Apache</b> groups. <b>The</b> White Mountain <b>Apache</b> use <b>the</b> term Dilzhę́’é {{to refer to the}} Bylas, San Carlos, and Tonto Apache.|$|R
25|$|The Chiricahua {{were divided}} into two groups after they were {{released}} from being prisoners of war. The majority moved to the Mescalero Reservation and form, with the larger Mescalero political group, <b>the</b> Mescalero <b>Apache</b> Tribe of <b>the</b> Mescalero <b>Apache</b> Reservation, along with <b>the</b> Lipan <b>Apache.</b> <b>The</b> other Chiricahua are enrolled in <b>the</b> Fort Sill <b>Apache</b> Tribe of Oklahoma, headquartered in Apache, Oklahoma.|$|R
2500|$|The Hughes YAH-64 was {{selected}} in December 1976 and was developed into <b>the</b> production AH-64 <b>Apache</b> version. <b>The</b> Army {{believed that the}} YAH-63's two-blade rotor was more vulnerable to damage than <b>the</b> <b>Apache's</b> four-bladed rotor. In addition the service {{did not like the}} YAH-63's tricycle landing gear scheme, believing it was less stable than <b>the</b> <b>Apache's</b> [...] "taildragger" [...] configuration. Some observers also suspected that the Army did not want to divert Bell from AH-1 production. Bell would use its experience with the T700 engine to develop the AH-1T+ design and later AH-1W.|$|R
5|$|The UK {{currently}} {{operates a}} modified version of <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> Longbow; initially called the Westland WAH-64 Apache, it is designated <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> AH1 by the British Army. Westland built 67 WAH-64 Apaches under license from Boeing, following a competition between the Eurocopter Tiger and <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> for the British Army's new Attack Helicopter in 1995. Important deviations made by AgustaWestland from the U.S. Apache variants include changing to more powerful Rolls-Royce engines, and the addition of a folding blade assembly for use on naval ships.|$|E

5|$|In 1762, missionaries {{established}} two unauthorized missions {{south of}} San Sabá, in the Nueces River valley. For several years <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> {{lived in the}} missions most of the year, but left in winter to hunt buffalo. One of the missions closed in 1763, when <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> never returned from their hunt. The surviving mission closed in January 1766, after a force of 400natives from the northern tribes attacked, killing 6Apaches and taking 25captives {{as well as all}} the livestock in the valley. Forty-one Spanish troops and their small cannon ambushed the northern tribes as they returned to East Texas. Before the Spanish were forced to retreat, over 200Indians and 12Spanish soldiers died. After the battle, <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> refused to return to the mission and returned to raiding near San Antonio. Raids by the northern tribes decreased, however.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, President Grant's Indian peace policy, {{enforced}} {{and coordinated}} by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona, required <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> {{to be put}} on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education. <b>The</b> <b>Apache</b> slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers. In one raid, believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors, settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan, Arizona. The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant. 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville. Angered over the murders, the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians, 42 Mexicans, and 6 whites to take revenge on <b>the</b> <b>Apache.</b> When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30, they murdered 144 Apaches, mostly women and children, in {{what became known as the}} Camp Grant Massacre. Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery. In May, an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise; during the chase they killed 13 Apache. Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Like the US AH-64D Apache Longbow, <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> AH1 {{carries a}} fire-control radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), {{providing}} an integrated surveillance and attack system. The 'Longbow’ radar is the bulbous unit over the rotor hub assembly; radar placement above the rotors allows <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> to hover behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} radar unit exposed. Additionally, the Longbow radar can monitor traffic in the Apache's airspace. The radar {{can also be used}} for surveillance and terrain profiling. A modem is interfaced into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Mescalero <b>Apache</b> were {{primarily}} a nomadic mountain people. They traveled east on the arid plains to hunt the buffalo and south {{into the desert}} for gathering Mescal Agave. Spanish colonists associated them with this plant and named them Mescalero <b>Apache.</b> <b>The</b> Mescalero <b>Apache,</b> along with <b>the</b> other <b>Apache</b> groups, lived by traditional hunting and gathering. If conditions were poor, they raided other tribes, and Spanish, Mexican and American settlers to survive.|$|R
5|$|The {{requirement}} {{for a new}} attack helicopter was identified by the British government in the early 1990s. In 1993, invitations to bid were issued. Bids received included the Eurocopter Tiger, a modernised Bell AH-1 SuperCobra, the AH-64 Apache, the Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche, and the Agusta A129 Mangusta. Both the Tiger and Cobra variant were derided for requiring development, and thus risk, while <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> was combat proven, however its performance in the First Gulf War was criticised by competitors. Westland and <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> was selected in July 1995, a contract for 67 helicopters was signed in 1996.|$|E
5|$|When the {{requirement}} for <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> had been formalised in the early 1990s, military doctrine assumed that a large conventional armoured assault from the Eastern Bloc was Britain's main threat. Following the collapse and break-up of the Soviet Union, the concepts of flexibility and rapid response took precedence. The UK's Strategic Defence Review called for Apaches to undertake amphibious attack missions, operating from the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, the Invincible class aircraft carriers and their successors, the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, and possibly the amphibious assault vessels HMS Bulwark and Albion. Each squadron equipped with <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> should have eight operational aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, the U.S. Army Apache fleet had {{accumulated}} more than 3 million flight hours {{since the first}} prototype flew in 1975. A DOD audit released in May 2011, found that Boeing had significantly overcharged the U.S. Army on multiple occasions, ranging from 33.3 percent to 177,475 percent for routine spare parts in helicopters like <b>the</b> <b>Apache.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Western <b>Apache</b> live {{primarily}} in east central Arizona, in the United States. Most live within reservations. <b>The</b> Fort <b>Apache</b> Indian Reservation, San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, and Tonto Apache Indian Reservation {{are home to}} the majority of Western <b>Apache</b> and are <b>the</b> bases of their federally recognized tribes. In addition, there are numerous bands. <b>The</b> Western <b>Apache</b> bands call themselves Ndee (Indé) (“The People”); because of dialectical differences the Pinaleño/Pinal and Arivaipa/Aravaipa bands of <b>the</b> San Carlos <b>Apache</b> pronounce <b>the</b> word Innee or Nnēē:.|$|R
5|$|During the 1980s naval {{versions}} of the AH-64A for the United States Marine Corps and Navy were examined. Multiple concepts were studied with altered landing gear arrangements, improved avionics and weapons. The USMC was very interested and conducted a two-week evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> in September 1981, including shipboard operation tests.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, after Operation Desert Storm, the AH-64B was a {{proposed}} upgrade to 254 AH-64As. The upgrade would have included new rotor blades, a Global Positioning System (GPS), improved navigation systems and new radios. Congress approved $82M to begin <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> B upgrade. The B program was canceled in 1992. The radio, navigation, and GPS modifications, were later installed on most A-model Apaches through other upgrades.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Boeing {{conceptualized}} an Apache upgrade {{prior to}} the introduction of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft, forecast to replace <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp turboshaft engine from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings to offload lift from the main rotor during cruise, and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust. In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another Apache upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E
50|$|Mescalero or Mescalero Apache is an Apache {{tribe of}} Southern Athabaskan Native Americans. The tribe is federally {{recognized}} as <b>the</b> Mescalero <b>Apache</b> Tribe of <b>the</b> Mescalero <b>Apache</b> Reservation, located {{in south central}} New Mexico.|$|R

50|$|Apache Plaza has {{historic}} significance {{because it}} was one of the first enclosed malls in the US, opening in 1961. It was the second such center in the state of Minnesota, after Southdale. Its design, by architect Willard Thorsen, was state-of-the-art at <b>the</b> time. <b>Apache</b> had a spacious center court with a hyperbolic paraboloid roof (hyperboloid structure). The paraboloids were concrete shells, shaped like an inverted umbrella. Ten of these paraboloids made up the roof of the center court, which was ringed with Mondrian-inspired clerestory windows. The mall had more than 60 stores at its height, as well as a large monthly indoor antiques and collectables show and a bowling alley in the basement. In the early 1970s, the mall was still thriving, despite the opening of nearby Rosedale. The larger mall would contribute to <b>the</b> <b>Apache's</b> decline, with <b>the</b> relocation of <b>the</b> <b>Apache's</b> anchor stores to Rosedale.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Apache</b> Trail {{connected}} the Old Spanish Trail where Apache Junction is today and Roosevelt Lake with an unpaved road {{as early as}} 1925, following much of the modern route. By the next year, SR 66 followed <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> Trail and the Old Spanish Trail was numbered as US 80. The number 88 {{was given to the}} route by 1927, but continued past its current terminus east to US 180 west of Globe. US 60 and US 89 became concurrent with US 80 at the western terminus by 1935, and the US 70 designation was added to the road by 1939. The section of the route from Apache Junction to Canyon Lake was paved in the late 1940s. By 1958, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was paved. The extra designations at SR 88's western terminus were removed by 1971, leaving only the US 60 designation. In 1999, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was renumbered as SR 188, cutting SR 88 back to its current terminus.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been {{accidents}} involving <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> helicopter in Israeli service. During the Lebanon War in 2006, two IAF AH-64A helicopters collided, killing one pilot and critically wounding three. In another incident in the conflict an IAF AH-64D crashed due to a malfunction in the main rotor, killing the two crew. In late 2007, the Israeli Air Force put further purchases and deliveries of AH-64Ds on hold during an investigation upon the aircraft's performance envelope. However, Israeli officials have since praised <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> for its role in Operation Cast Lead in 2008, against Hamas in Gaza. In recent years, Israeli Apaches {{have been used to}} patrol the skies over Gaza; strike operations against insurgents using these helicopters has become a frequent occurrence.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. {{military}} operations in Iraq in December 2011, several Apache helicopters had been shot down by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite <b>the</b> <b>Apache</b> being typically able to avoid such missiles. In 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the US Army was {{expanding}} {{the use of}} manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) technologies to manned aircraft to receive video feeds and control weapon onboard unmanned aircraft to improve situational awareness and better support ground elements, making ground units less reliant on other services' aircraft for overwatch and air support. <b>The</b> AH-64E <b>Apache</b> attack helicopter is the first Army rotorcraft with purpose-built MUM-T technology, allowing pilots to remotely control a Gray Eagle, extending <b>the</b> <b>Apache's</b> reach by using the Gray Eagle's sensors and weapons from the helicopter cockpit. Tests demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>Apache's</b> engagement range increases with MUM-T as the Gray Eagle can designate targets outside the helicopter's own targeting system range, increasing survivability, and potentially needing fewer helicopters as their effectiveness is increased with the inclusion of Gray Eagle. An Apache can control a Gray Eagle and access its sensors and weapons from up to 70 mi away.|$|R
50|$|Many of Cochise's {{descendants}} reside at <b>the</b> Mescalero <b>Apache</b> Reservation, near Ruidoso, New Mexico, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> Fort Sill <b>Apache</b> Tribe Chiricahua Warm Springs Apache in Oklahoma.|$|R
25|$|The Navajo {{practiced the}} most crop cultivation, <b>the</b> Western <b>Apache,</b> Jicarilla, and Lipan less. The one Chiricahua band (of Opler's) and the Mescalero practiced very little cultivation. The other two Chiricahua bands and <b>the</b> Plains <b>Apache</b> did not grow any crops.|$|R
