5|$|Defences to tracing are possible, {{particularly}} if returning the property would harm an innocent defendant, where the claimant has made false {{representations that the}} defendant relied on to his detriment, or where the property has been transferred to an innocent third party without anything given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> in return that the claimant could recover in lieu.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} another person must be unlawful. Some defences are {{therefore}} open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> among them self-defence. Carrying a lawful activity, for example, a fully qualified doctor carrying out an abortion in the required circumstances, could not result in an unlawful homicide even if the child was born alive. Consent might be relevant to some forms of homicide, but not to murder.|$|E
5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress {{and a number}} of states rewrote laws regarding the insanity defense. The old Model Penal Code test was replaced by a test that shifts the burden of proof regarding a defendant's sanity from the prosecution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E
50|$|During the {{discovery}} {{phase of the}} criminal trial, the USAO turned over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> <b>the</b> contents of 18,150 wiretapped communications involving 550 different people, which were recorded {{over the course of}} sixteen months from ten telephones, including home, office and mobile lines belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following the handing down {{of death}} {{sentences}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants,</b> <b>the</b> NAACP and Amnesty International campaigned to commute Pierre and Andrews' death sentences.|$|R
50|$|A sum of $900 for costs was {{assessed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b>|$|R
5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, common law tracing and {{equitable}} tracing. Common law tracing relies on the claimant having legal ownership of the property, and will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the legal title has been transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> or the legal title has been transferred by the defendant to any further recipient of the property. Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an equitable interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{there are}} {{alternative}} remedies to {{exclusion of the}} evidence which can adequately provide redress <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b>|$|E
25|$|Plaintiff's consent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> taking (if it exists, can {{be proved}} or {{inferred}} by circumstantial evidence).|$|R
50|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> FRCP, the {{plaintiff}} must initiate a conference between <b>the</b> parties <b>to</b> plan for <b>the</b> discovery process after the complaint was served <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b> <b>The</b> parties must confer {{as soon as}} practicable after the complaint was served <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> — and in any event at least 21 days before a scheduling conference is to be held or a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b). The parties should attempt <b>to</b> agree on <b>the</b> proposed discovery plan, and submit it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court within 14 days after the conference.|$|R
25|$|If the trier of {{fact has}} no doubt as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> guilt, or if their only doubts are {{unreasonable}} doubts, then the prosecutor has proved <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> guilt {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} and <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> should be pronounced guilty.|$|R
25|$|The jury {{is not to}} {{draw any}} inferences adverse <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> {{from the fact that}} he has been charged with a crime and is present in court facing the charges against him.|$|E
25|$|The only {{unilateral}} action which the Governor can take is to grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> {{and can do}} so {{regardless of what the}} Board recommends in a particular case.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{defendant}} discovered new facts {{that would have}} bolstered the defense already presented at trial. The court concluded that although the new facts would have been material and possibly beneficial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> at trial, {{they would not have}} precluded entry of the judgment.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Defendants</b> did not promise <b>to</b> sell <b>the</b> stock <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{highest bidder}} for cash. The Claimants sent a tender <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Defendants</b> which, {{following}} <b>the</b> submission of all tenders, {{was the highest}} tender. <b>The</b> <b>Defendants</b> refused <b>to</b> sell <b>the</b> stock <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Claimants.|$|R
50|$|Baker v. Dorfman, 239 F.3d 415 (2d Cir. 2000). Affirmed the {{district}} court judgment awarding the plaintiff damages for legal malpractice and fraud against his lawyer. Jacobs concluded that the plaintiff suffered {{the loss of his}} claim due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant’s</b> negligent untimely filings, and was induced <b>to</b> retain <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> as counsel because his resume contained intentional and material misrepresentations.|$|R
50|$|Benbrika {{also had}} links <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> in <b>the</b> 2005 Sydney {{terrorism}} plot, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Mohamed Ali Elomar, Abdul Rakib Hasan, and Mohammed Omar Jamal.|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of absence through fear, {{additional}} safeguards are imposed prior to the statement's admission. The court must be satisfied {{it is in the}} interests of justice, particularly considering the statements contents, whether special measures (screens in court, or video live-link) would assist, and any unfairness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> in not being able to challenge the evidence.|$|E
25|$|The {{identification}} {{and production of}} Jencks Act material may also be addressed at a pretrial conference. It is usual for the defense to receive the material outside {{the purview of the}} jury to avoid inference that the material is damaging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> If the material is not relevant, or helpful for impeachment, defense council may decide not to use it.|$|E
25|$|If the United States elects not {{to comply}} with an order of the court to deliver <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> a {{statement}} or portion {{of it as the}} court may direct, the court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness, and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.|$|E
500|$|All {{members of}} the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina recused {{themselves}} from the case. Therefore, Judge Joseph Putnam Willson of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania was designated <b>to</b> try <b>the</b> case by Chief Justice Burger. [...] Wilson decided <b>to</b> resolve <b>the</b> merits before reaching <b>the</b> plaintiff's motion <b>to</b> certify <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> class. [...] Wilson granted summary judgement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b>|$|R
25|$|If {{the burden}} of proof of all the issues in the action lies on <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> he or she is {{entitled}} to begin instead of the plaintiff. The trial then proceeds with <b>the</b> plaintiff responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> case, and so on.|$|R
50|$|In an 1898 case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court {{unanimously}} {{held that}} after an eight-year-old boy negligently {{placed his hand}} in <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> machinery, <b>the</b> boy {{had no right to}} be rescued by <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b> Beyond that, <b>the</b> trespassing boy could be held liable for damages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> machine.|$|R
25|$|Convenience is weighed, using a multi-factored {{test that}} {{includes}} elements such as: {{the connection between}} the plaintiff's claim and the forum, {{the connection between the}} defendant and the forum, unfairness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> by choosing the forum, unfairness to the plaintiff in not choosing the forum, involvement of other parties to the suit (i.e. location of witnesses), and issues of comity such as reciprocity and standard of adjudication.|$|E
25|$|A local {{undertaker}} and {{a member}} of the Lawrence school board attempted to frame the strike leadership by planting dynamite in several locations in town a week after the strike began. He was fined $500 and released without jail time. It later came to light that William M. Wood, president of the American Woolen Company, had made a large payment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> under unexplained circumstances shortly before the dynamite was found.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2006, Bybee {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Kesser v. Cambra, granting habeas corpus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> by a 6-5 vote. Richard Kesser {{had been convicted of}} hiring a hit man to kill his former wife and was sentenced to life without parole. During Kesser's trial in 1995, the prosecutor had eliminated three American Indian jurors and one Asian juror for racial reasons. Effectively granting Kesser a new trial, this decision laid out the current Batson analysis in the Ninth Circuit.|$|E
25|$|The Rorschach {{test was}} {{administered}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants,</b> along with <b>the</b> Thematic Apperception Test and a German {{adaptation of the}} Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Test. All were above average intelligence, several considerably.|$|R
50|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> {{evidence}} at trial, he saw Sullivan shortly before Christmas 1999. Sullivan {{said he was}} short of cash as {{he was doing a}} big cocaine deal. He wanted <b>the</b> key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rover, which <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> said he would look for. Just after Christmas 1999, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> said, Sullivan visited him again. He again spoke of a cocaine deal, giving <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>to</b> believe he had killed two dealers. He also spoke of killing another man by injecting him with a heroin overdose. He offered <b>to</b> show <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> <b>the</b> body of a man, Bryan Davies, in the boot of the Rover.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, {{the term}} public defender {{is often used}} to {{describe}} a lawyer who is appointed by a court to represent a defendant who cannot afford to hire an attorney. More correctly, a public defender is a lawyer who works for a public defender's office, a government-funded agency that provides legal representation <b>to</b> indigent <b>defendants.</b> <b>The</b> court appoints the public defender's office <b>to</b> represent <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> and <b>the</b> office assigns a lawyer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> case. In <b>the</b> federal criminal court system and some states and counties, representation is through a publicly-funded public defender office.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{courts of}} common law tradition, ecclesiastical tribunals {{do not follow}} the {{adversarial}} system. Based on the same Roman civil law that is behind much European law, the procedure of a canonical court is more akin to the inquisitorial system, with the judges leading the investigation. As a general rule, the defendant has the favorable presumption of law, {{which means that the}} defendant will win by default unless a majority of the judges is convinced with moral certainty of the petitioner's case (can. 1608). This presumption also applies in penal cases (can. 1728). There are few exceptions to this rule; in those cases, the burden shifts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similar {{results are}} seen in other cases from the time. The two actions were {{regarded}} as alternative remedies for the same wrong. Often, the plaintiff had a choice of action, although there were differences between the choices. Trover must involve a wrongful detention of goods which had not been wrongfully taken, while trespass would not. The theory of trespass was that the plaintiff remained {{the owner of the}} chattel, with his possession only interrupted or interfered with, so that when it was tendered back to the plaintiff, he must accept it. The damages must be limited to the loss of use, which could be considerably less than its total value. Trover, which involved lost goods or those placed in a bailment, necessitated full replacement damages. Once the damages were paid, the ownership of the chattel passed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> in trover.|$|E
25|$|The Tennessee Supreme Court {{observed}} it {{is essential}} in cases of trover, that the property must be found; it must {{at the time when}} the finder came upon it, to have been in such a situation as to clearly indicate that it was lost. It cannot have been placed there by the original owner who lost it by carelessness or forgetfulness, where it was later found by someone else. In such cases, the owner of the premises where the property is found is treated as a quasi-bailee (i.e. he holds the property for the original owner), and he may maintain trover against the finder. Since the log was not intentionally laid by the (unknown) owner on the land of the plaintiff (Deaderick), and hence he was not a quasi-bailee for the owner, he cannot hold against the superior right of the defendant (Oulds) arising out of his prior possession and earlier finding of the log. Judgment for ownership of the log was <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> Oulds.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{found in}} Harris v. New York, , that a {{confession}} obtained {{in violation of}} the Miranda standards may nonetheless be used for purposes of impeaching <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> testimony: that is, if <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> takes <b>the</b> stand at trial and <b>the</b> prosecution wishes <b>to</b> introduce <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> confession as a prior inconsistent statement <b>to</b> attack <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> credibility, <b>the</b> Miranda holding will not prohibit this.|$|R
50|$|If a {{defendant}} filed a claim in reconvention (called a counterclaim), the plaintiff will {{be obliged to}} file a plea to such a counterclaim, which is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> plea <b>to</b> <b>the</b> claim in convention (the plaintiff's claim).|$|R
50|$|Avegno was {{therefore}} {{the only possible}} party <b>to</b> <b>the</b> suit brought by Morgan to foreclose his mortgage. The proceedings and sale were valid and binding on the plaintiffs, and vested title in Morgan, which he conveyed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b>|$|R
