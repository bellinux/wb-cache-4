25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
500|$|Band said, [...] "Most of {{the films}} that I made, that I conceived, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{involved}} with {{and in some cases}} directed, definitely started with the title and usually a piece of artwork that made sense. Then I would work back to the script and the story and make the movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder that}} you can ask me that," [...] she answered, a little tremulously. [...] "You know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very,</b> very {{grateful}} indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘There’s {{another thing}} yet,’ said Francie, {{stopping}} his father. ‘There’s another thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> caring for. She—she sends me errands.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Also to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> well, {{and sadly}} longing for Brantwood; but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{glad to see}} some vestige of beloved things here, once more.|$|R
60|$|I {{struggled}} up {{to discover}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> weak; {{so weak that}} I was glad to sink back again.|$|E
60|$|She looked {{round the}} room, told me {{positively}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> comfortable there; to which I assented, humbly, acknowledging my undeserved good fortune.|$|E
6000|$|Under these {{encouraging}} circumstances, I replied <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> well, {{and that}} I hoped {{she was the}} same; with such an indifferent grace, that Miss Murdstone disposed of me in two words: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{another thing}} yet," [...] said Francie, {{stopping}} his father. [...] "There's another thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> caring for. She--she sends me errands." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{had evidently}} self-control, {{so when the}} attendants came I {{told them not to}} mind, and they withdrew. Renfield watched them go. When the door was closed he said with {{considerable}} dignity and sweetness, [...] "Dr. Seward, you have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> considerate towards me. Believe me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very,</b> very grateful to you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you decide," [...] he said quietly, [...] "to {{settle in}} America, {{you must not}} allow {{yourself}} to forget <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> much your debtor. I----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your aunt sowed the seed. It {{is strange}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> near {{choosing}} this place nine years ago, {{but it could}} not be seen from my window, which was an object with me then." ...|$|E
60|$|This, then, was Mrs. Major Ponto; to whom {{making my}} very best bow, I replied, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> proud {{to make her}} acquaintance, as also that of so charming a place as the Evergreens.|$|E
6000|$|... "And suppose," [...] Dick {{said very}} slowly, looking Mr. Crockett {{squarely}} in the eyes, [...] "suppose I said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> sorry, but that I did not care to say what I wanted it for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> stupid, but <b>I</b> must confess <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce {{that this man was}} intellectual?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> afraid <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am," [...] she {{admitted}} regretfully. [...] "I {{can assure you}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> tired of it. But--it will not last for very much longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Mr. Brooke. Will you kindly {{tell the}} general <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> pleased at the news? No doubt {{he will be}} up here, himself, this {{afternoon}} or tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Say you saw me,' said Tom, 'and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{bold and}} cheerful, {{and not a}} bit down-hearted; and that I entreated her to be the same, for all is certain to come right at last. Good-bye!' ...|$|E
60|$|And to him, on the reeling deck {{after the}} storm was past, old Lingaard brought me. I was only hours old, wrapped naked in a salt-crusted wolfskin. Now it happens, being prematurely born, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> small.|$|E
60|$|I {{had heard}} {{something}} of the Heatherstones and of the strange seclusion in which they lived, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much pleased at this opportunity of making their closer acquaintance, and lost no time in complying with her request.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you be {{good enough}} to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} the letter, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> much obliged?" [...] I said. [...] "There is no other reply necessary at present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tell him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> busy,' said Marie. 'Say that uncle is away, {{and that}} there is a deal to do. Ask him if another day won't suit as well.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I had her picture, Madame," [...] I {{answered}} with enthusiasm, [...] "that I could show you. You would understand, then, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> anxious indeed to be married." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} him for quite a long time. I did not understand. I thought he was mad. It must be remembered <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young, and I looked upon him as a middle-aged man. I forgot {{everything}} but my own amazement.|$|E
60|$|We bade adieu to Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle, {{with many}} thanks on my part, and much {{kindness}} on the devoted mother's. The last thing I saw was Littimer's unruffled eye; fraught, as I fancied, with the silent conviction <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> young indeed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is mightily sore, but it {{does not}} smart as it did at first. I can tell you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> glad when I was able to slip that great lump of tow out of my mouth as soon as I entered the forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you see if {{my husband}} {{is still in the}} card-room? And if he is, will you tell him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> tired, and would be glad to go home soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> {{glad to hear}} it," [...] Juanna replied, still {{somewhat}} dubiously. The rest of that conversation, {{being of}} a private character, will scarcely interest the public.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Who will to Cupar maun to Cupar,"' said Sir Gregory; 'I {{can only}} say, Mr. Tudor, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> sorry for you, and {{very sorry for}} your wife--very sorry, very sorry indeed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is still}} {{something}} I wish to say, and perhaps I should have mentioned it earlier; but {{in such cases}} one shrinks from causing pain," [...] she said. [...] "I should like you to believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> sorry when I heard--about your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was time}} for me to say something. There was a {{challenge}} in the reposeful black eyes resting upon my face. I murmured <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> glad to hear it. She waited a little, then uttered meaningly, “Mr. Mills is a little bit uneasy about you.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'For myself, I was so hotly {{pursued by}} {{a swarm of}} the men-vermin (who {{had come to the}} shore in boats) <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> soon overtaken, bound hand and foot, and {{conveyed}} to the beast, which immediately swam out again {{into the middle of the}} sea.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mixed. The {{last thing}} <b>I</b> thought about <b>was</b> pleasant. <b>That</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> lucky to <b>be</b> {{doing the work}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing now. Compared {{with some of the}} things I have done--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell Lucie <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> {{sorry she}} did not come over with you and Philip, {{and that it is}} only because you tell me how {{occupied}} she <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not furiously angry with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "There were {{notes in}} it," [...] said Harry, very gloomily, [...] "and--and papers <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> sorry to lose. What the deuce has come of it? I had {{it when we}} dined together." ...|$|R
