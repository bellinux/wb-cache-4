5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. <b>The</b> <b>failure</b> to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the Cyberpunk album, Billy Idol did {{not produce}} another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later. However, this was not due to <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the album, but rather his dissatisfaction with his producers at Chrysalis Records. With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, {{and the formation of}} a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E

5|$|One of Lem's major {{recurring}} themes, beginning {{from his}} very first novel, The Man from Mars, was the impossibility of communication between profoundly alien beings, which may have no common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel Solaris. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the first contact. In His Master's Voice, Lem describes <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of humanity's intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.|$|E

Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd.
