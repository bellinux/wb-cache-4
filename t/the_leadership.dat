5|$|Morton soon rose {{through the}} party ranks, {{becoming}} touted as a possible leader. When the Liberals lost their third election under party leader Vernon Treatt, Morton contested <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> in July 1954. Although Morton was defeated, Treatt did not stay long, resigning in August. Morton then stood, but was deadlocked against party whip, Robert Askin, and Askin then asked Murray Robson to take <b>the</b> <b>leadership.</b> Robson proved ineffective and was deposed in September 1955 in a party spill and Morton was elected to succeed him as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition.|$|E

5|$|With party support eroded, Treatt did {{not remain}} long as leader afterwards. On Friday 6 August 1954, Treatt {{announced}} that he would resign as leader on 10 August. At the following party meeting, after a deadlocked vote between Askin and Morton, Askin persuaded Murray Robson to accept <b>the</b> <b>Leadership</b> of the Liberal Party as a compromise candidate. Like other senior members of the party, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, he had little interest in policy except for Cold War anti-communism, ignored majority views of his party and fellow parliamentary colleagues and further alienated party members by trying to forge a closer alliance with Michael Bruxner's Country Party. Over a year after Robson had assumed <b>the</b> <b>leadership,</b> at a party meeting on 20 September 1955, senior party member Ken McCaw moved that <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> be declared vacant, citing that Robson's leadership lacked the qualities necessary for winning the next election. The motion was carried 15 votes to 5. Robson then moved a motion to prevent Morton, who was the only person nominated for leader, from taking <b>the</b> <b>leadership.</b> This was defeated 16 votes to 6 and Morton was elected unnopposed as leader, with Robert Askin remaining as Deputy Leader.|$|E

5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians. This marks {{the point at which}} <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the Athenians became explicit.|$|E
