5|$|In a noisy print shop, a disgraced {{police detective}} named Hofmeister (Karl Meixner) escapes from {{pursuing}} criminals' attacks. Hofmeister telephones his former superior Inspector Karl Lohmann (Otto Wernicke) and explains frantically {{that he has}} discovered a huge criminal conspiracy. Before he can disclose {{the identity of the}} responsible criminal, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out, shots are fired, and Hofmeister becomes mad. Hofmeister vanishes only to be found later singing every time he feels watched, and he is institutionalized at Professor Baum's asylum.|$|E
5|$|During a rainy night, Jake tells Finn a {{story about}} a {{supposed}} vampire that used to live in their tree fort. Finn, scared by the sounds outside the house, goes downstairs to talk to Jake. Suddenly, their window is blown open and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out. Finn and Jake soon discover that Marceline the Vampire Queen has snuck into their house. Both Finn and Jake are terrified that Marceline will kill them and drink their blood, but she reveals that she has no intentions of killing them, noting that she really only eats the color red. However, she explains that the tree house used to belong to her, and she promptly evicts them from their residence.|$|E
5|$|E. When Jos Verstappen stalled his {{car on the}} grid, Race Director Charlie Whiting {{attempted}} to abort the start, a procedure that is carried out when a car is stalled before <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out. However, {{the lights went out}} before he had the chance to do so, and as a result the lights afterwards displayed the standard 5 red lights and 3 amber lights. The race was immediately stopped, but the red flag was not displayed until the cars came to the start/finish line. As is the case when a start is aborted, the race was shortened by one lap as the cars were not refuelled, but Verstappen was allowed to regain his original grid position in 15th.|$|E

5|$|Around 17 hours later, {{the plane}} loses {{auxiliary}} power, and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out inside. Despite Neerja {{and the other}} attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire. The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out, and the zombies {{break through}} the barricades. Harry grabs Ben's rifle and threatens to shoot him. In the chaos, the two fight and Ben manages to wrestle the gun away and shoots Harry. Harry stumbles into the cellar and collapses next to Karen, mortally wounded. She has also died from her illness. The ghouls try to pull Helen and Barbra through the windows, but Helen frees herself. She returns to the refuge of the cellar to see Karen is reanimated and eating Harry's corpse. Helen is frozen in shock, and Karen stabs her {{to death with a}} masonry trowel. Barbra, seeing Johnny among the zombies, is carried away by the horde and devoured. As the zombies overrun the house, Ben fights off Karen and seals himself inside the cellar, where Harry and Helen are reanimating, and he is forced to shoot them.|$|E
25|$|Back at Westlake's lab, Dr. Westlake is {{conducting}} an experiment when <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out. Dr. Westlake {{and his assistant}} Yakatito, are astounded to find the synthetic skin is stable after 100 minutes. Westlake deduces that the synthetic skin is photosensitive. Their joy is short lived, when Durant and his crew show up and demand the Bellasarious Memorandum, which Westlake knows nothing about. While searching for the document, Durant and his gang kill Yakatito. They proceed to beat Westlake, burn his hands and dip his face in acid. After they find the document, they rig the lab to explode- leaving Julie to watch the explosion. The blast throws Westlake through the roof, into the river. Thought to be dead, he survives but is hideously burned. He is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the spinothalamic tract, so physical pain is no longer felt. However, he also loses his tactile sensation. The loss of this sensory input gives him enhanced strength due to adrenal overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but its absence also mentally destabilizes him.|$|E
25|$|The player, {{who sits}} in an office, is {{given access to}} a network of {{security}} cameras throughout the facility to track {{the movement of the}} animatronics. Each character roams the restaurant and has distinct movement patterns, and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are dimly lit and distorted, one of the rooms only contains an audio feed, and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics. Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out. Once these things happen, the Toreador March will play, the screen will go pitch black, and the player will be jumpscared by Freddy, provided they do not reach {{the end of the night}} in the meantime. If the player is jumpscared by any of the animatronics, the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning of the night.|$|E

500|$|Vaughan and McCartney {{left before}} the evening show which started at 8 o'clock. During the {{performance}} there was an unexpected thunderstorm, which made <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out. Bob Molyneux, a young schoolmate from Quarry Bank, recorded part of the performance on his Grundig TK8 portable reel-to-reel tape recorder. The tape included versions of Lonnie Donegan's [...] "Puttin' on the Style" [...] and Elvis' [...] "Baby Let's Play House". In 1963, Molyneux offered the tape to Lennon via Ringo Starr, but Lennon never responded, so Molyneux put the tape in a vault.|$|E

[...] When Olivia and the FBI arrive, they find that the bomb is set to release the deadly agent across the city but can only be defused if Olivia turns off a similar array of lights as were on the puzzle. Despite faking the earlier test, Olivia is successful at disabling the lights and the bomb with her thoughts.|$|E

Edward attacks with a knife—Stoller sees him shape-shift into Purdue, then Bear, and then Woodcock. However, Purdue fights and kills him, proclaiming it [...] "the sanest thing I ever did." [...] Black theorizes that Edward somehow absorbed the killers' violent impulses into himself, but was unable to refrain from acting upon them.|$|E
500|$|... "Ave Maria" [...] is a ballad {{that runs}} for 3 minutes and 42 seconds. The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond {{described}} the song as being [...] "opera-tinted". According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, {{it is written}} in the key of C Major with a slow tempo of 75 beats per minute and it is set in common time. The song samples Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria", however as noted by Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, even though it [...] "does riff on the classic aria, it's not an actual cover". The main instruments in [...] "Ave Maria" [...] include a piano and strings. Throughout the song, Knowles' voice shows restraint as she sings in a lower register with an operatic soprano that gives her more vocal power, as commented by Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News. Her vocal range spans from the music note of B3 to E5. Lyrically, [...] "Ave Maria" [...] is about being surrounded by friends but still feeling alone, as conveyed by the lines, [...] "How can the silence seem so loud?" [...] and [...] "There's only us when <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> down". This view was echoed by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, who wrote that the song weaves [...] "a vivid tale of a desperate woman".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour.

As [...] "S" [...] started, Rihanna removed her tuxedo to reveal a white PVC body suit. After performing [...] "S", Rihanna performed [...] "Skin" [...] while laying on raised platform, and at {{near the end of the}} performance said [...] "this is the part of the show when we like to have a little fun [...] who wants to come up here and get freaky with me?" [...] and takes a man out of the audience and pins them down on the platform, where she provocatively and sexually gyrates and grinds him as they are lowered under the stage as the song's instrumental ends and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>go</b> out. Rihanna has caused controversy by occasionally opting to perform the act with a woman instead.|$|E
