500|$|... "The {{consensus}} among the music press was that Mariah's insistence on {{including the new}} material {{made all the difference}} in increasing sales figures more than expected. Including some new with the old in a greatest-hits package had been tried from time to time by other artists with varying degrees of success, but with the triumph of #1's, it would become a regular element in nearly all future greatest-hits albums. As such packages go, #1's was a solid retrospective of Mariah's chart hits, but because these songs were oversaturating the radio, including a favorite nonhit album track or two might have made a nice change. The new songs were a definite bones even though none ever really rose to the spectacular level of her best ... they added up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> touch but little more." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised it for capturing [...] "Pharrell Williams' flair for slim, sleek grooves" [...] and labelled it a highlight from Hard Candy. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone, {{noted that the}} [...] "creative tension between Madonna and the Neptunes' Pharrell Williams crackles on the innuendo-laden opener 'Candy Shop'". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern criticized the lyrics but praised its catchiness, [...] "set <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice,</b> punchy beat, Madonna weaves her voice around a hypnotic groove that practically dares you not to sing along. [...] is all about letting loose {{and having a good}} time". He also opined that while it wouldn't work as a single [...] "it more than serves its purpose as an introduction to Hard Candy". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Pharrell makes his presence known a little too much [...] he manages to get Madonna to stretch vocally in ways she hasn't since Evita. That is, when she's not doing cheeky drag queen impersonations, with trannie-fierce moments sprinkled liberally throughout 'Candy Shop' (“My sugar is raw”) [...] The song is neither sexy nor campy, and somewhere, Dita is throwing her head back, laughing hysterically, and cracking her whip in disapproval", the last part being a reference to the alter ego Madonna incorporated for her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992).|$|E

2500|$|A small {{minority}} of critics have expressed dissenting opinions. In his 2004 book Blockbuster, British film critic Tom Shone suggested that Vertigos critical re-evaluation has led to excessive praise, and argued for a more measured response. Faulting Sight & Sound for [...] "perennially" [...] putting the film {{on the list of}} best-ever films, he wrote, [...] "Hitchcock is a director who delights in getting his plot mechanisms buffed up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> humming shine, and so the Sight and Sound team praise the one film of his in which this is not the case– it's all loose ends and lopsided angles, its plumbing out on display for the critic to pick over at his leisure." [...] In 2007, poet and critic Dan Schneider criticized the ending of Vertigo as melodramatic and argued that a close examination of the film's plot reveals numerous implausibilities, such as Elster allowing someone who knew his murder plot to remain living and thus possibly reveal the plan, or the police officers at the crime scene not inspecting the tower for evidence.|$|E

[...] Mumtaz also added that she had memories of having workied with him {{and said that she}} had been crying the whole morning, but was happy that she had met the ailing Khanna in Mumbai in June 2012, when the two discussed their respective battles with cancer. While Shahid Kapoor quoted: [...] "RIP to the 1st king of romance... Rajesh Khanna." [...] Subhash Ghai added that Khanna [...] "was the powerhouse of the Hindi film industry. I met him on the set of Aradhna, he had some kind of energy and you will be charged when he is around you. His name will be written in golden words." [...] Amitabh Bachchan was quoted as saying: [...] "The word 'superstar' was invented for him, and for me it shall ever remain his, and no others [...]. !! His generation and the generations that follow, shall never be able to describe, or understand his phenomena [...]. !!". His son-in-law Akshay Kumar told reporters about his death and added that [...] "he has gone <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> and heavenly place.

2500|$|Before Milton, [...] "the {{sense of}} regular rhythm... had been knocked into the English head so {{securely}} {{that it was}} part of their nature". The [...] "Heroick measure", according to Samuel Johnson, [...] "is pure... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable", Caesural pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle {{and the end of the}} line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no enjambed endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included hypermetrical syllables (trisyllabic feet), inversion or slighting of stresses, and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line. Milton deemed these features to be reflective of [...] "the transcendental union of order and freedom". Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: “The English... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit”. Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did Oliver Goldsmith, Henry Pemberton, and Scott of Amwell, whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was [...] "displeasing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> ear". It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with Gray) began to appreciate [...] "the composition of Milton's harmony... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification".|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} {{served as}} Walford's GP for 14 years. Although {{his first name}} of Harold was revealed by the visiting DI Marsh (Harry Miller) in the final scene of the show's second episode in 1985, {{he has always been}} referred to by the majority of the other characters and in the closing credits as [...] "Dr Legg". Though a regular character with his own storylines throughout the 1980s, for much of the 1990s he was a recurring character, making increasingly sporadic appearances, and only when other characters needed medical assistance. In 1998, the executive producer of EastEnders, Matthew Robinson, announced that he was officially retiring Dr Legg. The character was one of many axed by the producer, who was dubbed the [...] "axeman" [...] by the British press. Speaking of his decision, Robinson commented [...] "Dr Legg is getting on a bit, so we're retiring him. He'll be going <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> cottage in the country." [...] His place was filled by a younger alternative medicine fan, Dr Fred Fonseca, played by Jimi Mistry. Leonard Fenton has since spoken about his frustration that Dr Legg did not get to practice enough, claiming that he [...] "was frustrated for years by Dr Legg's sporadic appearances". In an interview in 2000, Fenton commented [...] "I told them I wasn't happy about going on once every two months. That's why it ended...". Dr Legg was never given an official exit on-screen, his retirement is mentioned by Dr Fonseca in January 1999, when the character Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson) requests to see him.|$|E
