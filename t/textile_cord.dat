40|$|The {{knowledge}} of thermal diffusivity data of thick fibre-elastomer composites {{is very important}} in heat conduction analysis of rubber products. The method of linear increase of surface temperature was used to determine the thermal diffusivity of thick fibre reinforced-rubber composites at temperatures ranging from 20 to 170 oC. In this paper the results of thermal diffusivity measurements of some rubber compounds reinforced with <b>textile</b> <b>cords</b> are presented. The values of the thermal diffusivity of thick fibre reinforced-rubber composite materials decrease with temperature. The thermal diffusivity parallel to the fibre direction is compared to the thermal diffusivity perpendicular to the fibre direction and to the thermal diffusivity of the matrix. It was found experimentally that the thermal diffusivity of rubber compounds reinforced with polyamide <b>textile</b> <b>cords</b> parallel to the fibre direction is approximately 1. 6 time higher than the thermal diffusivity perpendicular to the fibre direction and the thermal diffusivity of the matrix. The effect of thermal contact resistance in <b>textile</b> <b>cords</b> on the thermal diffusivity perpendicular to the fibre direction was tested...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this article}} {{the results of}} the {{measurements}} of thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat of some rubber compounds reinforced with polyamide <b>textile</b> <b>cords</b> (nylon cords) are presented. For thermal diffusivity the relationship between this quantity and temperature was measured within the temperature range 20 – 170 C. Both type and arrangement of reinforcement and matrix composition have an effect on thermal properties. For the heat flow perpendicular to the fiber direction, the rate of heat conduction is limited by the properties of the matrix. In this case, thermal properties of composites are approaching the properties of this component. Thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity increase with the number of twists per 1 m of cord length because of the effect of thermal contact resistance in <b>textile</b> <b>cords</b> on the thermal properties perpendicular to the fiber direction. The thermal diffusivity parallel to the fiber direction is compared with the thermal diffusivity perpendicular to the fiber direction and to the thermal diffusivity of the matrix...|$|R

40|$|The passive sizing system {{consists}} {{of a series of}} low-profile pulleys attached to the front and back of the shoulder bearings on a spacesuit soft upper torso (SUT), <b>textile</b> <b>cord</b> or stainless steel cable, and a modified commercial ratchet mechanism. The cord/cable is routed through the pulleys and attached to the ratchet mechanism mounted {{on the front of the}} spacesuit within reach of the suited subject. Upon actuating the ratchet mechanism, the shoulder bearing breadth is changed, providing variable upper torso sizing. The active system {{consists of}} a series of pressurizable nastic cells embedded into the fabric layers of a spacesuit SUT. These cells are integrated to the front and back of the SUT and are connected to an air source with a variable regulator. When inflated, the nastic cells provide a change in the overall shoulder bearing breadth of the spacesuit and thus, torso sizing. The research focused on the development of a high-performance sizing and actuation system. This technology has application as a suit-sizing mechanism to allow easier suit entry and more accurate suit fit with fewer torso sizes than the existing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) suit system. This advanced SUT will support NASA s Advanced EMU Evolutionary Concept of a two-sizes-fit-all upper torso for replacement of the current EMU hard upper torso (HUT). Both the passive and nastic sizing system approaches provide astronauts with real-time upper torso sizing, which translates into a more comfortable suit, providing enhanced fit resulting in improved crewmember performance during extravehicular activity. These systems will also benefit NASA by reducing flight logistics as well as overall suit system cost. The nastic sizing system approach provides additional structural redundancy over existing SUT designs by embedding additional coated fabric and uncoated fabric layers. Two sizing systems were selected to build into a prototype SUT: one active and one passive. From manned testing, it was found that both systems offer good solutions to sizing a SUT to fit a crewmember. This new system provided improved suit don/doff over existing spacesuit designs as well as providing better fit at suit operational pressure resulting in improved comfort and mobility. It was found that a SUT with a sizing system may solve several problems that have plagued existing HUT designs, and that a SUT with a sizing system may be a viable option for advanced suit architectures...|$|E

40|$|A perfect {{adhesion}} {{between the}} rubber of a tire and the reinforcing polymeric cord {{is crucial for}} the overall tire performance and safety. The problem of bonding rubber to <b>textile</b> <b>cords</b> {{is due to the}} big difference between the surface properties. Blending of polymers has obtained much attention because, {{it can be used to}} obtain new polymeric materials with particular properties suitable for some special purposes. The blends of Natural rubber (NR) / Polysulfide rubber (PSR) has been prepared with a verity weight ratios (100 / 0, 90 / 10, 80 / 20, 60 / 40). The characteristics of the prepared blends were investigated, such as rheological, mechanical and damping properties. It was found that the increasing of the weight percent of PSR in the blend compositions leads to the increase its adhesive strength with nylon 66 cord and also increase the hardness of the resultant blends. On the other hand, the curing time, tensile strength, elongation at break and rebound resilience were decreased...|$|R
40|$|<b>Textile</b> <b>cords</b> used in rubber {{applications}} are commonly {{treated with the}} so-called Resorcinol-Formaldehyde-Latex (RFL-DIP). Despite the relevance of good adhesion between cords and rubber, and although this system dates {{back as far as}} 1938 and is still commonly used for rubber reinforcement till today, the mechanism by which the adhesion is obtained has remained unclear. The level of knowledge of adhesion between RFL-treated cords and rubber today is empirical rather than scientific. With the introduction of new material in recent years, it is considered appropriate to revisit the physical and/or chemical processes at the basis of the interactions between latex and resin in the RFL-DIP traditional systems and to define also the nature of interactions among the RFL components and the reinforcing fibers and the RFL components and rubber. Based on the results obtained from the understanding of these interactions, a study on the possibility of developing alternative DIP systems formaldehyde-free has been performed...|$|R

40|$|Harsh high-altitude environments {{were among}} the last landscapes to be settled by humans during the Late Pleistocene between ∼ 15, 000 and 11, 000 {{calendar}} years before present (cal yr BP). Successful colonization required physiological adaptations to hypoxia and cultural adaptations to limited resources and cold temperatures. How and when humans colonized Andean South America has been poorly understood owing to controversial early archaeological sites and questions {{about the impact of}} environmental factors, including the presence of glaciers. Here we report the reexamination and direct dating of six finely woven <b>textiles</b> and <b>cords</b> from Guitarrero Cave, Peru, that identify South America’s earliest textiles and show that occupation of the Andes had begun by ∼ 12, 000 cal yr BP. Additional evidence for plant processing and fiberartifact construction suggests women’s presence among these earliest foraging groups. Previous research suggested use of the highlands by small groups of male foragers between 15, 000 and 13, 000 cal yr BP with permanent settlement only after 11, 000 cal yr BP. Together these data amplify accumulating evidence for Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene technological sophistication and cultural diversity in South America and are consistent with hypotheses that long-term settlement of higher elevations occurred immediately following glacial retreat.

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The {{aim of the research}} described in this thesis is to assess the technical feasibility of pneumatic tyres for passenger cars which have no directional reinforcement in their carcasses. Conventional tyres are constructed from composites of twisted <b>textile</b> or steel <b>cords</b> in a rubber matrix, a process which is both labour intensive and costly. If it were possible to injection mould or cast tyre carcasses in a single operation, and if the performance of the resulting tyres matched that of modern radial ply tyres, then the implications for the tyre industry would be of major proportions. After reviewing the history of pneumatic tyres and summarising their principal attributes, the design of unreinforced or fabricless tyres is investigated and methods developed for defining their meridional profiles. Materials suitable for their carcasses and treads are then considered, prior to describing the manufacture of two series of tyres designed to have section height to width ratios, or aspect ratios, of 0. 9 and 0. 7 respectively. To facilitate experimental work, two sizes of tyres were employed: half scale models for which testing procQdures had been developed previously; and a size suitable for small saloon cars. The results obtained on a range of tyre properties are presented and analysed to give a number of empirical relationships between the properties and the design variables: carcass material Young's modulus, carcass wall thickness and the inflation pressure. For the important property of radial stiffness which affects other tyre characteristics, an improved method of analysis is developed to allow the structural and pneumatic components to be quantified. Using the relationships established experimentally, consideration is given to optimising the design of a fabricless tyre. It is concluded that to approach the performance of a conventional tyre, a design with a low aspect ratio is preferred but, to restrict growth with inflation'pressure, limited directional reinforcement must be included as a circumferential-belt beneath the tread. Nevertheless, the discussion concludes that there are fundamental reasons why even the optimised tyre would be unacceptable for use on modern passenger cars, although less demanding applications may be identified...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the past}} decades, {{electronics}} have become smaller, {{more complex and}} more power efficient; going from the first (house-sized) computer in the 1950 s to the smart phones we can find today. This work has aimed at designing wearable electronics that wirelessly communicate with the environment, more specifically in medical and sport applications. Thanks to different collaborations with sport and medical experts, this work could be executed. The collaborations also have had the consequence that the eventual realizations of the separate projects were very application oriented. The design of electronics {{that have to be}} worn by sport athletes and patients is a challenging task. This PhD has focused on the exploration of 4 important challenges in this field: monitoring human performance, low power wearable design, smart sensing and the implementation of wireless technology in wearable electronics. The aforementioned applications {{can be found in the}} following domains: rheumatology, dosimetry, physiology, <b>textile</b> integration, spinal <b>cord</b> infarcts and swimming. Although these applications seem to be very diverse fields, the advantages of integrating wearable electronics into them are extremely big. In each of them, patients or athletes need to be monitored during their treatment or training by an expert. In many cases today, it is impossible to follow up on patients or athletes outside of a lab setting such as a hospital. The central goal of this work is to move towards bringing care and sports analysis out of the lab to the daily environment. The advantage for the measured subjects is that they can be monitored unimpededly in their familiar setting. For the expert who needs the data, this technology would have the important advantages of primarily providing long term data, but second, it also provides more reliable data with regard to the monitoring of daily tasks. The achievements in this PhD work can be situated into two domains. On the one hand, prototypes have been developed for multiple (niche) applications. These prototypes contribute to a new approach in applying electronics comfortably within these applications. On the other hand, the fragmented information about the design of wearable electronic devices has been collected and expanded with new techniques. These techniques are mostly oriented towards a specific application, but are often also applicable in a generic way and as such transferable to other applications. More specifically, prototypes and methods have been investigated in this PhD in 7 domains, as mentioned above. To achieve this, systems have been designed to which all or some of the following novel technical characteristics can be attributed: being smaller than the state-of-the-art, having a lower/more efficient power consumption, a novel form factor, better data processing and a novel on-body communication system. After describing the different technical challenges within the separate applications, this dissertation finally gives an overview of the possible future work which can aid in making progress in the domain of wearable electronics. The intention of this text is to inform the reader of the current state of the art within the domain of wearable electronics, as well as demonstrate the different findings of this research. status: publishe...|$|R
