The population grew from a mere 1,942 people in 1801 to more than 11,500 in 1901. This development was followed by improvement of the infrastructure, such as rail links with Odense, Faaborg and Nyborg, improvement of the local roads and the establishment of a real harbour suited for extensive trading, since goods could now easily be transported <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century an explosion of industrialization happened, and all kinds of factories, from engineering to breweries were established together with modern gas and water systems.|$|E
2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....."

Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E
2500|$|On February 10, 2006, in {{a meeting}} of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of which Coleman was a member, during {{testimony}} of former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown, Coleman attacked Brown for poor leadership during Hurricane Katrina disaster relief efforts, [...] "you didn't provide the leadership, even with structural infirmities." [...] Coleman went on, [...] "you're not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies" [...] and [...] "the record reflects that you didn't get it or you didn't in writing or in some way make commands that would move people to do {{what has to be done}} until way after it should have been done." [...] Brown responded combatively, [...] "well, Senator, that's very easy for you to say sitting behind that dais and not being <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> that disaster, watching that human suffering and watching those people dying and trying to deal with those structural dysfunctionalities" [...] and implored Coleman to stick to questions. He later likened Coleman's charges to a [...] "drive-by shooting." [...] Brown had recently stated that he notified Department of Homeland Security and the White House of the tremendous scale of Katrina flooding earlier than had been previously reported.|$|E

60|$|He was right. The {{earth was}} shaking {{in one corner}} of the {{enclosure}} like an earthquake. I approached cautiously.

60|$|But in {{this moment}} of despondency, and often afterwards, the {{recollection}} of Mr Pecksniff operated as a cordial to him; awakening in his breast an indignation that was very wholesome in nerving him to obstinate endurance.
