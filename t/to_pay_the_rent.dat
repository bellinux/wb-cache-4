Biographer John Barnes writes that after this abandonment, all Duarte left to the family was a {{document}} declaring that the children were his, thus enabling them to use the Duarte surname. Soon after, Juana moved her children to a one-room apartment in Junín. <b>To</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent</b> on their single-roomed home, mother and daughters took up jobs as cooks in the houses of the local estancias.|$|E
5|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{compromise}} which {{was recorded in}} the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. They agreed that the tithe would be reduced by half. The payment of the rents, taxes and other levies due to the landowners and the royal treasury was suspended until the tithe was collected. The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent</b> to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 dinars, {{much lower than the}} rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner. To keep the execution of the agreement under surveillance, the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna. Their assembly was entitled to punish noblemen who had broken the compromise.|$|E

50|$|From 1874 {{agricultural}} prices in Europe had dropped, followed by some bad harvests due to wet weather during the Long Depression. The effect by 1878 was that many Irish farmers were unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rents</b> {{that they had}} agreed, particularly in the poorer and wetter parts of Connacht. The localised 1879 Famine added to the misery. Unlike {{many other parts of}} Europe, the Irish land tenure system was inflexible in times of economic hardship.|$|R

When Ivan tries to get the truth, she convinces everyone else that he lying. Paul refuses to speak to Ivan and makes his father throw Nicola out of her home. She then tells Laurel that she lied about the whole thing. Laurel then tells everyone inside the pub that Nicola has lied and Ivan refuses to accept everyone's apologies. Rodney thinks that Ivan and Paul should get back together and lets the whole pub know. Ivan is annoyed but then realises he is right. When Ivan asks Paul for another chance, he turns him down and Ivan leaves the village. When he returns, Simon is annoyed with him for leaving him <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent</b> on Mulberry Cottage. He forgives him when Ivan reveals that he is just back for his job.

5|$|While Governor Pataki {{supported}} this revised, $1.5 billion people mover plan, Mayor Rudy Giuliani voiced his opposition {{over the fact}} that it was not a direct rail link from Manhattan, and thus would not be profitable because of the need to transfer from Jamaica. Additionally, Giuliani did not like that the city had to effectively pay $300 million toward the new light rail system. The Port Authority was originally planning to pay for only $1.2 billion of the project, with the other $300 million to be used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent</b> at the airport instead. In order to give his agreement, Giuliani wanted the Port Authority to study the possibility of extending the Astoria elevated to LaGuardia Airport, as well as make the light-rail system compatible with the subway or LIRR to allow possible future interoperability. In late 1997, Giuliani agreed to the plan under the condition that the state reimburse the city $300 million of the system's cost, with the city paying the $300 million for the line from 2002 through 2017. As part of the agreement, the state would also conduct a study on a similar train link to LaGuardia Airport.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Rovers Football Club is an English {{professional}} association football club based in Bristol, who play in Football League One, the Third tier of the English football league system, {{as of the}} 2016–17 season. The club was formed in 1883 under the name Black Arabs F.C. playing their home games at Purdown in Bristol, but they used the name for only a single season, becoming Eastville Rovers and moving to a site known as Three Acres in 1884. Eastville Rovers were somewhat nomadic, moving home in 1891 to the Schoolmaster's Cricket Ground, in 1892 to Durdham Down, and in 1894 to Ridgeway, before finally settling at Eastville Stadium and changing their name to Bristol Eastville Rovers in 1897. Two years later they adopted their current name of Bristol Rovers when they became founder members of the Southern League. They remained at Eastville Stadium for 99 years, before leaving in 1986 when financial pressures meant that {{they could no longer}} afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent,</b> whereupon they moved to Bath City's Twerton Park, a move that saved the club £30,000 a year. After playing for ten years in Bath, the club returned to Bristol in 1997 when they agreed to share Bristol Rugby's Memorial Stadium. Since joining The Football League in 1920, when the top division of the Southern League effectively became the Football League Third Division, Rovers have spent most of their time {{in the second and third}} tiers of the English football league system; the team has never played in the top flight and spent six years, 2001 to 2007, in the fourth tier.|$|E
50|$|Plaintiffs {{filed an}} action {{challenging}} {{the adequacy of}} the shelter allowance schedule for families with children in New York City.

They asserted their claims under § 350(1)(a) of the New York Social Services Law and Article XVII of the New York State Constitution.|$|R

Therefore, her mother had to take in boarders in order to meet her financial needs and <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent.</b> After Rodriguez-Trias graduated from high school, she decided that she would like to study medicine and that her chances would be much better in Puerto Rico, because the island had a good scholarship system.|$|E
25|$|The Permanent Settlement {{ultimately}} led to the dismemberment of the Bardhaman estate. As the rajas often failed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent</b> demands, {{some parts of the}} estate were auctioned off. However, there were bright spots. Mahatabchand was appointed additional member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council and in 1877 was allowed to use the title of His Highness before his name. Bijoy Chand Mahatab was conferred the title of Maharajadhiraj by Lord Minto in 1908. Uday Chand Mahtab took over in 1941 and served till abolition of the zamindary system in 1954, after independence of the country.|$|E

Late in the season, the Coliseum refused to give Livingstone's team ice time, citing non-payment of rent.

The program is not only less costly because it relies on the existing housing market, but {{also more likely to}} offer affordable and quality housing to participants. This program contrasts previous housing programs which often clumped federally funded families into low-income urban neighborhoods. This program is extremely effective, with the majority of participants living in areas that are less than 20% poor.|$|R
5000|$|From 1873 to 1896 {{farmers in}} Britain and Ireland {{suffered}} the [...] "Long Depression" [...] with its lower prices. Grain from America was cheaper and better, and was exported to Europe in ever-increasing amounts. Meat {{could be sent}} in refrigerated ships from as far as New Zealand and Argentina. For many tenant farmers in Ireland this meant lower net incomes with which <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rents</b> they had agreed. This impacted most on the poorer, wetter western parts of the island that also suffered from the 1879 famine. This provided the context and arguments for further legal reforms.|$|R

25|$|In June, Burmese Days was {{published}} and Cyril Connolly's {{review in the}} New Statesman prompted Orwell (as he then became known) to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat in Kentish Town, which he shared with Michael Sayers and Rayner Heppenstall. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Orwell and Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts. Orwell was now working on Keep the Aspidistra Flying, and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the News Chronicle. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent</b> on his own.

He had been visiting prostitutes and displayed more idealised amorous inclinations toward a number of women whose names are lost to history. Now in 1819, he was unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>rent</b> on their rooms at 19 York Street and his family were evicted. That was the last straw for Sarah, who moved into rooms with their son and broke with Hazlitt for good, forcing him to find his own accommodation. He would sometimes see his son and even his wife, with whom he remained on speaking terms, but they were effectively separated.|$|E

25|$|Only {{certain kinds}} of {{discrimination}} are covered by fair housing laws. Landlords are not {{required by law to}} rent to any tenant who applies for a property.

Landlords can lawfully discriminate against tenants with bad credit histories or low incomes, and (except in some areas) do not have to rent to tenants who will be receiving Section 8 vouchers.

As of 2010, no federal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is provided, but these protections do exist in some localities.|$|E
