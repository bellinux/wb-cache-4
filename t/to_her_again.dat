25|$|The {{results from}} the UN {{facilitation}} have been mixed; Razali Ismail, UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi. Ismail resigned from his post the following year, partly because he was denied re-entry to Burma on several occasions.

500|$|Jacqui {{has been}} {{described}} as a feisty character who is tough and hard. Holy Soap refer to her as a [...] "tough ex-con". Jacqui often takes on the matriarch role. Jacqui deals with the sisters in a different way and can get different responses from the sisters. Cooper describes her as always being there to pick up the pieces for her family. She also states that Jacqui is very loyal and the most loyal character out of the McQueen family. Speaking of Jacqui's time away from forefront plots Cooper has said: [...] "I think that Jacqui's one of those characters who, if she isn't on screen for a while, it takes the audience time to warm <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b> But when they do, they find her funny, they find her interesting and I try to give them as much as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>again.</b> Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
500|$|After the wedding, Cane {{recalled}} {{a phone call}} he had with his [...] "Uncle Langley" [...] regarding their con with Jill and Katherine. Afterward, Langley was revealed to be the long deceased Phillip Chancellor III in June 2009; Cane was in fact not Jill's son but someone hired by Phillip. Lily and Cane separated upon this revelation, but soon reunited upon her diagnosis with ovarian cancer. Her uterus was taken out during surgery, but the doctors were able to harvest two of her eggs; they decided {{to start a family}} with Mackenzie Browning (Clementine Ford) acting as their surrogate mother. Browning became pregnant with twins. Afterward, an immigration officer arrested Cane and planned to deport him, as he was not truly Phillip. Since he was present for the birth of his children, Charlie and Mattie in June 2010 and helped Lily overcome cancer he was not deported. Cane was then blackmailed by the crime family he turned to in Australia, and embezzled money from Tucker McCall's (Stephen Nichols) company with the help of Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell). Cane's biological father, Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers), then came to Genoa City in December 2010 to help Blake Joseph blackmail Cane. Colin then became engaged to Jill much to Cane's dismay. Cane then tried to stop their wedding but was shot in the chest by Blake on the church steps; he died afterward, leaving Lily devastated. Lily then began believing she was receiving afterlife messages from Cane and sought professional help. After seeing Cane several times, Lily realized he wasn't a figment of her imagination; it was then revealed in May 2011 that the man shot at the church wasn't Cane, but his identical twin brother, Caleb, who was scheming with Colin to kidnap Charlie and Mattie. However, Cane continued to act as Caleb to stop the plot with Colin and later his mother, Genevieve (Genie Francis). When Lily found out about the entire conspiracy, she refused to forgive Cane and divorced him. After Colin tried to kidnap her children, Lily began to forgive Cane and let him protect her. When Cane threatened to return to Australia, Lily let him back into her life. Later, they reunited when she realized the cause of all the secrets: to take down Colin. Cane proposed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>again</b> and they married in Provence, France in February 2012. Genevieve stays in town, and Cane constantly rejects her for everything she has done. Cane and Lily then go to work at Jabot Cosmetics, where Cane is interim CEO. Tyler Michaelson (Redaric Williams) becomes smitten with Lily and the two develop an attraction, making Cane jealous. Lily and Tyler share a kiss, but she turns him down and returns to Cane.|$|E

2500|$|Tate's version omits the King of France, {{and adds}} a romance between Cordelia and Edgar, who never address {{each other in}} Shakespeare's original. Cordelia {{explains}} in an aside that her motive for remaining silent when Lear demands public expressions of love is that he leave her without a dowry, so she can escape the [...] "loathed embraces" [...] of Burgundy. Nevertheless, when Burgundy departs, his obvious self-interest temporarily causes her to lose faith in Edgar's love and fidelity, and, left alone with him, she tells him not to speak <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>again</b> of love.|$|E
2500|$|In 2017, a rearranged {{version of}} the song was {{recorded}} for the band's fourth studio album Synthesis. The new version was made available for digital download and streaming on August 18, 2017; it was also made available for instant download for concertgoers who purchased tickets for the band's Synthesis Tour. The Synthesis version of [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] is a stripped-down one, as it replaces the drums and the guitars from the original version with a strings arrangement accompanied by crashing cymbals, [...] "tension-building" [...] timpani drums and various electronic elements throughout. Several critics have described its new arrangement as [...] "dramatic", with Billboards Sadie Bell calling it [...] "just as rich" [...] as the original and Rolling Stones Brittany Spanos calling it a [...] "cinematic take". Lee has described the song as [...] "new" [...] <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>again</b> {{due to the fact}} that she incorporated musical elements and vocals which she had [...] "heard in [...] head" [...] since its release.|$|E

2500|$|Freudian {{and other}} sexual psychologists say that Presley is a [...] "classic {{example of the}} mother/Madonna/whore split". He [...] "adored his mother and never {{recovered}} from her early death." [...] He met Priscilla [...] "when she was 14. She became a mother at 23. It is said that Elvis never made love <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>again</b> {{after the birth of}} his daughter, and would never have sex with a woman who had had a baby. He did not remarry after his divorce from Priscilla and did not have any more children." [...] However, Priscilla Presley states in her autobiography that they did have sex again after the birth of their daughter, and actress Barbara Leigh, who had a relationship with the singer after the birth of her own child, claimed that they made love often, despite Elvis' being aware of her child. Both accounts contradict claims made that Elvis would not have sex with a woman who had had a child.|$|E
2500|$|Al-Zubayr's wives {{complained that}} he had [...] "some {{harshness}} towards women".

Abu Bakr advised his daughter that Al-Zubayr was a [...] "righteous" [...] man, and therefore she should not leave him, or remarry after his death, because her reward for her patience would be {{to be reunited with}} him in Paradise. Asma also recalled: [...] "Whenever he reprimanded one of us, he would break off a branch from the wooden clothes hangers and beat her with it until he broke it over her." [...] Umm Kulthum asked him directly for a divorce, and when he refused, she tricked him into it by pestering him while he was busy with the ritual washing for prayer. Al-Zubayr complained, [...] "She tricked me, may Allah trick her!" [...] Muhammad advised him to propose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>again,</b> but Al-Zubayr realized that , [...] "She will never come back to me." [...] Atiqa only agreed to marry him on condition that he would never beat her.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{promotion}} of women's rights in the secular sphere, women in Utah, like renowned poet Eliza R. Snow, spoke of women's equality in sacred matters. This included {{the development of a}} Heavenly Mother theology. Joseph Smith discussed the doctrine of a Heavenly Mother as early as the 1840s. The idea of a Heavenly Mother expanded to a loving mother who sent each of us off on our journey to this earth and who will welcome us back <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>again</b> after death. As written in poems by Mormon authors, [...] " [...] oversees key moments for individual souls in the Mormon progressive plan of salvation." [...] These ideas were expressed throughout the early 1800s. Today, church leaders continue to mention Heavenly Mother, although less frequently and embellished than in early church history. Neal A. Maxwell affirmed the ideas or a homecoming expressed in Snow's poetry about Heavenly Mother by saying, [...] "Could such a regal homecoming be possible without the anticipatory arrangements of a Heavenly Mother?" ...|$|E
