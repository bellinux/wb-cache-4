25|$|In 1992, a {{new series}} of coins was {{introduced}} in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and (a somewhat different, 500‰ silver) 200 forint. Production of the 2 and 5 fillér coins ceased in 1992, with all fillér coins withdrawn from circulation by 1999.

25|$|On 16 October 1945, during Sainfoins voyage {{back to the}} United Kingdom, Sainfoin {{received}} a distress call from the hospital ship , which was carrying 820 repatriated prisoners of war from Hong Kong to Madras, India. It took Sainfoin four hours to reach Takliwa, which had run aground at Indira Point, Great Nicobar, and caught fire. Using her LCAs, Sainfoin rescued all 1,083 people on board Takliwa, {{as well as the}} ship's cat. During the rescue, three of Sainfoins LCAs were lost. Sainfoins mascot, a baboon named Mortimer, took a liking to the cat. On arrival at Bombay, the cat promptly went ashore. Mortimer's intended fate was to be given to a zoo in the United Kingdom, but he grew <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> dangerous so he was euthanased before Sainfoin reached the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Geysers: Geysers such as Old Faithful are {{a type of}} {{geothermal}} {{feature that}} periodically erupt scalding hot water. Increased pressure exerted by the enormous weight of the overlying rock and water prevents deeper water from boiling. As the hot water rises it is under less pressure and steam bubbles form. They, in turn, expand on their ascent until the bubbles are <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> numerous to pass freely through constrictions. At a critical point the confined bubbles actually lift the water above, causing the geyser to splash or overflow. This decreases {{the pressure of the}} system and violent boiling results. Large quantities of water flash into tremendous amounts of steam that force a jet of water out of the vent: an eruption begins. Water (and heat) is expelled faster than the geyser’s recharge rate, gradually decreasing the system’s pressure and eventually ending the eruption.|$|E
25|$|Swarm {{emigration}} {{occurs when}} a colony moves from the location of one nest to a new nesting site. This may occur for several reasons. One is if the colony sends a reproductive swarm from the original nest. This may happen if the colony has grown <b>too</b> <b>big,</b> <b>and</b> must split into two new colonies. In this situation, part of the colony {{will remain in the}} original nest, with a subgroup leaving to colonize a new nesting site. Other reasons swarm emigration occurs is if an old nest becomes unsuitable, or if the nest is attacked by a predator. At first, when the colony is driven from the nest, individuals assemble in groups of 2 or 3 around the original nest. Wasps will exchange between groups until the entire colony is assembled in one cluster. The colony may remain in this cluster for up to 2 days before migrating to the new site. Once the colony begins to travel, leading individuals will drag their gaster over prominent objects such as branches or tall grass. This releases a pheromone that other workers can follow to the new nesting site.|$|E

500|$|Despite these strengths, the castles {{and town}} walls are now {{recognised}} to {{have also had}} military flaws. The castles were much larger than {{they needed to be}} in order to protect against Welsh attack, but the sheer scale of them meant that the Crown could not afford to maintain or garrison them properly. The fortifications were in some regards simply <b>too</b> <b>big,</b> <b>and</b> as historian Michael Prestwich notes, smaller projects might actually have been more effective. Rather than the sites being scientifically designed, historian Richard Morris suggested that [...] "the impression is firmly given of an elite group of men-of-war, long-standing comrades in arms of the king, indulging in an orgy of military architectural expression on an almost unlimited budget".|$|E

500|$|There were {{objections}} to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the site. Prominent opponents included Mayor Franklin Edson, who believed that the system of parks was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> expensive to acquire, and Assemblyman Theodore Roosevelt, who opposed the bill's being pushed through. However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house). In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the bill, now {{referred to as the}} [...] "New Parks Act", as law, authorizing the creation of the park system. As part of the proposed system, Bronx Park would {{be at the center of}} the system. It was connected to Van Cortlandt Park in the northwest via Mosholu Parkway; to Pelham Bay Park in the east via Pelham Parkway; and to Crotona Park in the south via Crotona Parkway. There were no direct connections to Claremont Park and St. Mary's Park, the other two parks in the system.|$|E
500|$|Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society {{campaign}} against the practice of keeping cetaceans, particularly killer whales, in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of male killer whales.

Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign {{to those found in}} the wild.
