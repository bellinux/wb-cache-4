5000|$|As {{with many}} Internet {{business}} models, PTS companies attracted {{people trying to}} defraud the company out of money. First, as noted above, the companies {{had to deal with}} spammers, often having to <b>terminate</b> <b>member</b> accounts. Finally, utilities started appearing which allowed users to simulate surfing activity. Some users even created mechanical mouse-moving devices which ran around their desks, i.e. [...] "JiggyMouse". These programs and devices allowed users to get paid simply for leaving their machines on. This began an arms race between the PTS companies who built fraud-prevention software and fraud program developers, with each releasing increasingly sophisticated versions of their software.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, the American Association of University Professors took SNU off its censure list. SNU {{was placed}} on the list in 1987 after eight faculty <b>members</b> were irregularly <b>terminated</b> in 1986. Discrepancies in the reasons for their {{termination}} led the AAUP to investigate: the initial reason given was that of financial difficulty {{on the part of the}} institution, due to a decline in student retention and the resulting drop in enrollment, while the reason given later was one of unspecified performance deficiencies in the <b>terminated</b> faculty <b>members.</b> SNU eventually offered some of the <b>terminated</b> faculty <b>members</b> monetary compensation but remained on the list for 18 years, until its administration had drafted academic tenure procedures that met AAUP standards.|$|R

40|$|The current {{framework}} in Canada in which collectively-bargained, private-sector Multi-Employer Pension Plans (“MEPPs”) operate {{is difficult for}} a number of reasons including: • The Administrator (i. e., the Trustees) has no control over the contribution flow • Industries and employers within industries are subject to economic and business cycles and employers may enter or exit the MEPP relatively easily, leaving the MEPP with long-term obligations • There is pressure to set benefits at levels that anticipate future investment returns and if such returns do not materialize as anticipated there can be severe financial implications for the plan • There are inherent conflicts of interests among classes of members such as active members who continue to be voting union members and retirees and <b>terminated</b> <b>members</b> who are no longer represented by the union The tools available for plan management include: • Governance structure • Plan design • Investment policy • Annuity purchases • Benefit reductions This paper builds on a previous paper entitled “Extending ERM To Multi-Employer Pension Plans” which was presented at the Society of Actuaries 2006 ERM Symposium. In addition to the ideas presented in that work, it discusses the question of whether MEPPs should be subject to solvency funding rules and the viability of a pension benefit protection fund offered by the private sector.

40|$|Glutamatergic {{synaptic}} {{transmission is}} <b>terminated</b> by <b>members</b> of the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) family of proteins that remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft by transporting it into surrounding glial cells. Recent structures of a bacterial homolog suggest that major motions within the transmembrane domain translocate the substrate across the membrane. However, {{the events leading}} to this large structural rearrangement are much less clear. Two reentrant loops have been proposed to act as extracellular and intracellular gates, but whether other regions of these proteins {{play a role in}} the transport process is unknown. We hypothesized that transport-related conformational changes could change the solvent accessibilities of affected residues, as reflected in protease sensitivity or small-molecule reactivity. In the model system GltPh, an archaeal EAAT homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii, limited trypsin proteolysis experiments initially identified a site in the long extracellular loop that stretches between helices 3 and 4 that becomes protected from proteolysis in the presence of a substrate, L-aspartate, or an inhibitor, DL-TBOA in the presence of Na+, the cotransported ion. Using a combination of site-directed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and fluorescein- 5 -maleimide labeling we found that positions throughout the loop experience these ligand-induced conformational changes. By selectively cleaving the 3 - 4 loop (via introduced Factor Xa sites) we demonstrate that it plays a vital role in the transport process; though structurally intact, the cleaved proteins are unable to transport aspartate. These results inculcate the 3 - 4 loop as an important player in the transport process, a finding not predicted by any of the available crystal structures of GltPh...|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in 1961, Waters {{recognized}} several problems. The division had grown so fast that internal controls for monitoring card activity and service establishment payments were weak. Too many card members were not paying their bills on time, and the company was not charging enough relative to the services that it was providing to card members and service establishments. Waters' plan for reviving the business was based on positioning the card as a product that was not for everyone. He teamed up with mathematicians at MIT to develop algorithms to track card spending activity that avoided the need for credit limits and allowed card members to establish their own responsible spending patterns. Drawing on his Air Force computer experience, he installed a data processing system that kept track of card activity and improved accounting controls. Next, he <b>terminated</b> card <b>members</b> who were not paying their bills on time - approximately {{one third of the}} card base. He then raised the annual card fee to $8.00 from $6.00 and raised the discount rate - the percentage of the sale that the service establishments had to pay American Express - from 3% to 7%. To make the discount rate more palatable to merchants, Waters drew upon his supermarket marketing experience by partnering with merchants in a cooperating advertising program. Waters proposed to give back [...]5% of all charge card volume to merchants to fund cooperative ads that helped service establishments advertise their products, accompanied by the little blue box Amex logo {{at the bottom of the}} advertisement.|$|R

Three months later, Longy announced a staff restructuring which resulted in 37 of its 188 teachers (all of whom are part-time) being laid off. In October 2010, the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board issued a formal complaint against Longy for unfair labor practices. In December, the NLRB expanded the complaint against Longy. [...] In a January 2011 interim injunction, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that [...] "there is reasonable cause to believe that Longy has committed an unfair labor practice". While acknowledging [...] "Longys prerogative to pursue faculty restructuring", Judge Patti B.

Longy was also ordered to reinstate <b>terminated</b> faculty <b>members</b> with pay until a final settlement was reached, but was not required to reverse job reassignments. Following negotiations between the union and the administration in February 2011, a settlement and collective bargaining agreement were reached, and the union officially requested withdrawal of all charges filed with the National Labor Relations Board.|$|R
