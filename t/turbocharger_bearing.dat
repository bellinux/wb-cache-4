Engine electrification is a critical technology in the promotion of engine fuel efficiency, among which the electrified turbocharger {{is regarded as the}} promising solution in engine downsizing. By installing electrical devices on the turbocharger, the excess energy can be captured, stored, and re-used. The electrified turbocharger consists of a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) and an electric motor (EM) within the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>bearing</b> housing, where the EM is capable in bi-directional power transfer. The VGT, EM, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve all impact the dynamics of air path. In this paper, the dynamics in an electrified turbocharged diesel engine (ETDE), especially the couplings between different loops in the air path is analyzed. Furthermore, an explicit principle in selecting control variables is proposed. Based on the analysis, a model-based multi-input multi-output (MIMO) decoupling controller is designed to regulate the air path dynamics. The dynamics analysis and controller are successfully validated through experiments and simulations...|$|E
40|$|Today {{turbocharging}} {{represents a}} key technology {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and exhaust emissions for both Spark Ignition and diesel engines, moreover improving performance. 1 D models, generally employed {{to compute the}} engine-turbocharger matching conditions, can be optimized basing on certain information about turbine and compressor behavior. Because of difficulty in the correct evaluation of turbine isentropic efficiency with direct techniques, turbocharger turbine efficiency is generally referred to thermomechanical efficiency. To this aim, the possibility to accurately estimate power losses in <b>turbocharger</b> <b>bearings</b> can allow the assessment of the turbine isentropic efficiency starting from the thermomechanical one. In the paper, an experimental and theoretical study on turbocharger mechanical losses is presented. The proposed model, developed in the MATLAB environment, refers to radial and axial bearings...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to design and construct a high speed turbocharger test rig (TTR) to measure dynamics of differing <b>turbocharger</b> rotor <b>bearing</b> systems {{and to develop a}} coupled rotor-cartridge model for the ball bearing rotor system to corroborate the experimental and analytical results. The ball bearing rotor is supported by an angular contact ball bearing cartridge. In order to achieve the {{objectives of}} the experimental aspect of this study, a TTR was designed and developed with the capability of reaching speeds in excess of 100, 000 rpm driven by compressed air. The TTR was used to compare and contrast the whirl and friction characteristics of two identical turbochargers differing only by the support structure of the rotor system; one containing a floating ring <b>bearing</b> <b>turbocharger</b> (FRBT) and the other a ball <b>bearing</b> <b>turbocharger</b> (BBT). A pair of displacement sensors was installed to measure the whirl of the rotor {{near the end of the}} compressor. The BBT was shown to be significantly more rigid and stable as compared to the FRBT with an average reduction in radial rotor motion of 47 %. The motion of the BBT consisted of mainly synchronous motion whereas the FRBT was dominated by subsynchronous motion throughout the entire range of speeds. The TTR was also used to compare frictional losses within the bearings. A study of run-down times after the pressurized air supply was removed indicated that the BBT has significantly lower frictional losses under all operating conditions tested with an average increase in run-down time of 14. 1 %. ^ A wireless telemetry based temperature sensor was designed specifically for the <b>turbocharger</b> ball <b>bearing</b> system to monitor the internal bearing temperature located on the cage during operation. It was shown to be able to withstand the harsh environments of turbocharger fnapplications operating at high speeds. The sensor accurately monitored transient bearing cage temperature due to changes in operating speed. ^ Custom sensors were developed in order to measure the axial forces acting on the rotor due to aerodynamic effects. The sensors utilized cantilever beams outfitted with strain gages to measure the applied load from the bearing cartridge. Results of dynamic testing indicated the magnitude and direction of the axial force is dependent on the operating conditions of the turbine and compressor. ^ To achieve the objectives of the analytical investigation, the explicit finite element method (EFEM) and the discrete element method (DEM) were coupled to investigate dynamics of flexible rotor systems supported by deep groove ball bearings. DEM was used to develop the dynamic bearing model (DBM) in which all of the components of the bearing (i. e. races, balls, and cage) have six degrees-of-freedom. The flexible shaft was modeled with a full 3 D elastic formulation using the EFEM. Rotor and inner races of the bearings were fully coupled such that both translation and rotation of the flexible rotor are transmitted to the bearings. The resulting reaction forces and moments calculated in DBM were in turn applied to the nodes of the shaft. The combined rotor-bearing model was used to investigate the motions of the inner races at low speeds and the resulting reaction forces and moments from the supporting bearings due to a large applied load on the shaft. In the current coupled modeling approach, the deformation of the shaft affected the internal components of the bearing by altering the orientation of the inner race which results in ball spin and slip. The preceding rotor-bearing model was extended to represent the turbocharger rotor-cartridge system that is under consideration. A DEM angular contact ball bearing cartridge model was coupled with an EFEM shaft to simulate the dynamics of the turbocharger test rig. The bearing cartridge consists of a common outer ring, a pair of split inner races, and a row of balls on each end of the cartridge. The coupled rotor-cartridge model was used to investigate the shaft motion and bearing dynamics as the system traverses critical speeds. The analytical and experimental shaft motion results were in close agreement. The cartridge model allowed for thorough investigation of bearing component dynamics. Effects of ball material properties were found to have a significant impact on <b>turbocharger</b> rotor and <b>bearing</b> dynamics. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} an ElastoHydroDynamic (EHD) bearing calculation. The effect of body forces is shown to be important for highly loaded bearings in reciprocating internal combustion engines. Extension of the program to rotating machinery includes an examination of instability in the shaft <b>bearings</b> of a <b>turbocharger.</b> The development of a parameter to predict cavitation damage in a bearing is promising. Several calculation results using the program are shown. These are engine main bearing and connecting rod big-end bearings and full floating <b>bearings</b> for a <b>turbocharger.</b> The calculations on the big-end bearing if a racing engine show why the designers were having difficulty understanding the correct location for the oil feed hole position. Effects of elastic deformation, thermal deformation and manufacturing/assembly deformation all {{have a significant effect on}} the extent of the oil film. A novel calculation for a cavitation damage parameter is demonstrated successfully for a heavily loaded diesel engine bearing. The importance of body forces on the oil film due to high accelerations on certain bearings is shown to be theoretically important but not yet demonstrated. The program was written with the intention to be incorporated into the sponsoring company’s range of engine design software. A part of that development process included carrying out calculations to demonstrate to customers and present papers at conferences. The results of some of these calculations have been included in this thesis. Results of a study on the effect of crankshaft geometry on racing engine viscous friction losses were reported in a paper presented at the IDETC conference in Long Beach, 2005. This study used the first version of the software which only included Rigid Hydro Dynamics (RHD) at the time but was usable. Results of a study on stability of shaft motion in high speed <b>turbocharger</b> <b>bearings</b> were reported in a paper at the 8 th International Turbocharger conference in London, 2006. At this time the program was still only capable of RHD calculations but could now solve for multiple oil films simultaneously and sweep through the speed range. The studies on the effects of body forces and the development of a cavitation parameter will be presented in papers in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Various micro-radial {{compressor}} configurations {{were investigated}} using one-dimensional meanline and {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) techniques {{for use in a}} micro gas turbine (MGT) domestic combined heat and power (DCHP) application. Blade backsweep, shaft speed, and blade height were varied at a constant pressure ratio. Shaft speeds were limited to 220 000 r/min, to enable the use of a <b>turbocharger</b> <b>bearing</b> platform. Off-design compressor performance was established and used to determine the MGT performance envelope; this in turn was used to assess potential cost and environmental savings in a heat-led DCHP operating scenario within the target market of a detached family home. A low target-stage pressure ratio provided an opportunity to reduce diffusion within the impeller. Critically for DCHP, this produced very regular flow, which improved impeller performance for a wider operating envelope. The best performing impeller was a low-speed, 170 000 r/min, low-backsweep, 15 ° configuration producing 71. 76 per cent stage efficiency at a pressure ratio of 2. 20. This produced an MGT design point system efficiency of 14. 85 per cent at 993 W, matching prime movers in the latest commercial DCHP units. Cost and CO 2 savings were 10. 7 per cent and 6. 3 per cent, respectively, for annual power demands of 17. 4 MWht and 6. 1 MWhe compared to a standard condensing boiler (with grid) installation. The maximum cost saving (on design point) was 14. 2 per cent for annual power demands of 22. 62 MWht and 6. 1 MWhe corresponding to an 8. 1 per cent CO 2 saving. When sizing, maximum savings were found with larger heat demands. When sized, maximum savings could be made by encouraging more electricity export either by reducing household electricity consumption or by increasing machine efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{high-speed}} {{diesel engine}} turbocharger {{is known to}} have subsynchronous vibrations for a wide speed range. The bearing fluid-film instability is the main source of the vibration. The nonlinear forces inside the bearings are causing the rotor to whirl in a limit cycle. This study presents a new method for improving the dynamic stability by inducing the turbocharger rotor unbalance in order to suppress the subsynchronous vibration. The finite-element model of the <b>turbocharger</b> with floating-ring <b>bearings</b> is numerically solved for the nonlinear time-transient response. Both compressor and turbine added unbalance are induced and the dynamic stability is computed. The turbocharger model with linearized floating-ring bearings is also solved for eigenvalues to predict the modes of instability. The linear analysis demonstrates that the forward whirling mode of the floating-ring at the compressor end also becomes unstable at the higher turbocharger speeds, in addition to the unstable forward conical and cylindrical modes. The numerical predictions are also compared to the former experimental results of a similar turbocharger. The results of the study show that the subsynchronous frequency amplitude of the dominant first mode is reduced when inducing either the compressor or the turbine unbalance at a certain level. © 2011 R.

40|$|Thermal oil {{oxidation}} is {{an important}} reason for the engine oil degradation in trucks. Having a comprehensive model that includes all the influential factors while it is feasible for being implemented in the ECUs, was aimed for this work. Therefore, the chemical investigating of the problem leaded to propose a first kinetic model and its thermal analysis caused modelling the oil thermal behaviour. The latter was developed for four compartments: <b>Bearings,</b> <b>turbocharger,</b> piston cooling and oil sump in the oil path through the lubrication system, because the highest oil temperature happens due to friction, combustion of fuels and exhaust gas transportation. Independency from the design parameters of the compartments and simplicity of models for the ECU implementation caused to investigate two various modelling hybrid approach: physical modelling and control theory approach. The first one was done for the bearings and piston cooling, and showed {{a high level of}} complexity leading to switch to the second approach. The latter was applied for all compartments while it satisfied requested requirements. To adjust and evaluate the models, an experimental campaign was devoted to acquiring the needed parameters with consideration of the project budget. Also using the previous simulation and experimental efforts at the company provided a possibility to develop flow rate sub-models used in the thermal modelling. The proposed model for all compartments, well predicted the oil thermal behaviour for both stationary and dynamic operating conditions. A comparison between the experimental data for the oil in the oil sump and turbo charger was done to show the reliability of the related models in both stationary and transient statuses. For the bearings, the simulation data for stationary condition were applied as a reference. The modelled oil temperature after piston cooling was compared to a set of experimental data that presented the probable temperature in some conditions close to stationary operating points...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to design and construct a high speed turbocharger test rig (TTR) to measure dynamics of {{angular contact ball bearing}} rotor system, and to develop a coupled dynamic model for the ball bearing rotor system to corroborate the experimental and analytical results. In order to achieve the {{objectives of}} the experimental aspect of this study, a test rig was designed and developed to operate at speeds up to 70, 000 rpm. The rotating components (i. e. turbine wheels) of the TTR were made to be dynamically similar to the actual turbocharger. Proximity sensors were used to record the turbine wheel displacements while accelerometers were used to monitor the rotor vibrations. A wireless telemetry based temperature sensor was specifically designed and developed to monitor the bearing internal operating temperature. The TTR was used to examine the dynamic response of the turbocharger under normal and extreme operating conditions. To achieve the objectives of analytical investigation, a discrete element ball bearing model was coupled through a set of interface points with a component mode synthesis rotor model to simulate the dynamics of the turbocharger test rig. Displacements of the rotor from the analytical model were corroborated with experimental results. The analytical and experimental results are in good agreement. The bearing rotor system model was used to examine the bearing component dynamics. Effects of preloading and imbalance were also found to have significant effects on <b>turbocharger</b> rotor and <b>bearing</b> dynamics. ^ The dynamic bearing model was also modified to include the influence of cage flexibility on the force and motions of bearing components (i. e. inner and outer races, and balls). In order to achieve the objectives, a cage model based on the explicit finite element method was developed and combined with a discrete element dynamic bearing model. In this modeling approach, all bearing components, including the flexible cage have 6 degrees of freedom. The 3 D explicit finite element approach allows the cage model to elastically deform as the balls impact cage pockets. The ball inner and outer race contacts are modeled using Hertzian equations, while a separate contact algorithm was developed to determine the interacting forces between the cage finite element mesh and discrete bearing components. The discrete and finite element models interact at each time step to determine the position, velocity, acceleration and forces of all bearing components. The ball cage contact forces are used to determine the deformation and stresses generated within the cage. The model results were corroborated with previous experimental results as well as the traditional analytical cage models. The results from the current FEA cage model matched the known cage motion traits observed by previous investigators. However, further investigation using the current model demonstrates that cage flexibility/deflection has a considerable effect on the overall dynamics of the bearing, in particular the ball-cage contact forces. Also, the resulting cage deformation and stress helps to identify the effect of operating and loading conditions on cage stress distribution. ...|$|R
