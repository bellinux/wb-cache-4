5|$|By June29, a trough, {{moving through}} the westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>east.</b> Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) from the center. Convection became displaced {{from the center of}} circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving troughs to the north.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fay was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear {{for most of its}} duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>east,</b> Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October13.|$|E

5|$|On October 29, {{the fifth}} and final known {{tropical}} cyclone of the season developed in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave. It initially moved northwestward, but turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> shortly thereafter. Drifting due eastward, the storm grew into a minimal hurricane on October 31 while passing over the Cayman Islands. The hurricane's center passed {{just north of the}} island of Jamaica later that day as it weakened back into a tropical storm. Eventually, the storm turned abruptly northeastward and crossed the eastern tip of Cuba. By November 3, it had emerged into the Atlantic and entered the southern Bahamas. Beginning to accelerate, the tropical storm passed to the west of Bermuda before becoming extratropical on November 6.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{considered}} dissipated, a re-analysis of satellite imagery indicated {{the circulation of}} Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>east,</b> as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf turned toward the north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (115km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Elena was an {{unpredictable}} and damaging tropical cyclone that affected {{eastern and central}} portions of the United States Gulf Coast in late August and early September 1985. Threatening popular tourist destinations during Labor Day weekend, Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path, triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent. The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana, though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas. Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba, and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen. Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast, the hurricane unexpectedly veered <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> on August 30, then stalled just 50mi (80km) west of Cedar Key, Florida. Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida, the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours, causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves, before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4.|$|E

Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength.

We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>east,</b> well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out.

5|$|The {{hurricane}} originated {{over the}} southwestern Caribbean Sea, where, on October 17, {{a broad and}} immature low pressure system was noted. The hurricane forecast center in Jacksonville, Florida issued its first advisory on the storm late on October 20, following ship reports of winds approaching and exceeding gale-force. Contemporary reanalyses of the storm have determined that it organized into a tropical depression on October 18, then drifted <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>east,</b> turning north-northeastward as it strengthened into a tropical storm early the next day. Due to low environmental air pressures and the large size of the cyclone, intensification was gradual as the storm approached Jamaica, eventually making landfall {{on the eastern side}} of the island, just west of the Morant Point Lighthouse, at 13:00 UTC on October 21. The system came ashore with a central pressure of , suggesting maximum winds of 60 mph (100 km/h). After emerging into the waters between Jamaica and Cuba, the storm slowed in forward speed, continued to intensify, and curved northwestward toward southeastern Cuba. The storm attained the equivalent of Category 1 hurricane status on the current-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale early on October 22, while meandering just off the coast of Cuba.|$|E
