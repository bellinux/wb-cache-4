25|$|In The Adventures of Nero album Het Zeespook (1948) Nero meets a {{character}} who claims to be Diogenes. Two scenes in the comic depict famous anecdotes of Diogenes' life, namely <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was looking for a}} human and <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> asked Alexander to get out of his sun. He is also portrayed living in a barrel.|$|E
25|$|Sizing up the situation, Sgt Owens {{decided that}} the only way to {{neutralize}} the gun was to charge it directly from the front. Calling on four volunteers to assist him, he positioned them where they could place supporting bunkers under fire. At <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> judged he had a fair chance of reaching his objective, the six-feet-three, 232-pound Marine charged right into the very mouth of the still rapidly firing cannon. Entering the emplacement through the fire port, he chased the Japanese out the back where they were cut down by his rifleman. Pursuing them, he in turn was instantly killed.|$|E
25|$|Having said that, {{he moves}} the log a little forward and throws a coin into the fire. The {{woman of the}} house puts a woolen blanket on the polazniks back, and seats him on a low stool by the fireplace. In <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> sits down, they try to pull away the stool beneath him, {{as if to make}} him fall on the floor. The polaznik goes out into the yard, and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of {{household}} on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The polaznik usually stays for dinner with the family. He receives a gift {{in the form of a}} round cake with an embedded coin, and a towel, shirt, socks, or some other useful thing.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} of Rakovsky's life between that moment and July 1932, <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was allowed a medical leave. Towards {{the end of the}} same year, Trotsky was {{informed}} that he had attempted to flee the Soviet Union, and, in March 1933, it was announced that he had been deported to Yakutia. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist Jean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist Pierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author Maxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Istanbul. According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request. Researcher Tova Yedlin proposed that the problem was caused by Gorky's distress over having recently separated from his mistress Moura Budberg, {{as well as to the}} writer's close surveillance by OGPU agents.|$|E
25|$|He had {{excellent}} parts, {{which had}} been improved by parliamentary and diplomatic experience; but the infirmities of his temper detracted much from the effective strength of his abilities. Negotiator and courtier as he was, he never learnt the art of governing or of concealing his emotions. When prosperous, he was insolent and boastful; when he sustained a check, his undisguised mortification doubled the triumph of his enemies: very slight provocations sufficed to kindle his anger; {{and when he was}} angry he said bitter things which he forgot {{as soon as he was}} pacified, but which others remembered many years. His quickness and penetration would have made him a consummate man of business but for his selfsufficiency and impatience. His writings prove that he had many of the qualities of an orator: but his irritability prevented him from doing himself justice in debate: for nothing was easier than to goad him into a passion; and, from <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went into a passion, he was at the mercy of opponents far inferior to him in capacity. Unlike most of the leading politicians of that generation, he was a consistent, dogged, and rancorous party man, a Cavalier of the old school, a zealous champion of the Crown and of the Church, and a hater of Republicans and Nonconformists. He had consequently a great body of personal adherents. The clergy especially looked on him as their own man, and extended to his foibles an indulgence of which, to say the truth, he stood in some need, for he drank deep, and when was in a rage—and he very often was in a rage—he swore like a porter.|$|E
500|$|Mac {{experiences}} {{his spiritual}} resurrection {{even as he}} wrestles with death, in both the past—Sonny's father in the Vietnam War—and present—his own daughter in a car accident. The latter threatens to derail Mac's new life, captured in <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> learns of it and [...] turns off the radio that is playing his new song. Leonard writes of this resurrection, [...] "Depression hangs like a pall over Tender Mercies [...] what makes this film inspiring {{is that it is}} also about the joy of being found.... Mac finds the way, the truth, and the life he wants." [...] In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died. Jewett writes of this scene, [...] "Mac Sledge can't trust happiness because it remains inexplicable. But he does trust the tender mercies that mysteriously led him from death to life." ...|$|E
60|$|There were <b>moments</b> during <b>the</b> ensuing {{days when}} Mr. Brewster {{permitted}} himself to hope; but more frequent were <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{told himself that}} a pronounced chump like his son-in-law could not fail somehow to make a mess of the negotiations. His relief, therefore, when Archie curveted into his private room and {{announced that he had}} succeeded was great.|$|R

500|$|Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana, died at Badajoz on 23 January 1811 {{in a fit}} of apoplexy, seized at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was leaving}} his house to concert a plan of {{military}} operations with Lord Wellington. In the Siege of Badajoz, a detachment of the 45th Regiment of Foot (later amalgamated with the 95th to form the Sherwood Foresters Regiment) succeeded in getting into the castle first and the red coatee of Lt. James MacPherson of the 45th regiment was hoisted in place of the French flag to indicate the fall of the castle. This feat is commemorated on 6 April each year, when red jackets are flown on regimental flag staffs and at Nottingham Castle. Volume 23 of the Museum of Foreign Literature, Science and Art, published in 1833, described Badajoz as [...] "one of the richest and most beautiful towns in the south of Spain, whose inhabitants had witnessed its siege in silent terror for one and twenty days, and who had been shocked by the frightful massacre." [...] On 5 August 1883 there was an attempted revolt by the armed forces when a climate of confusion and chaos prevailed.|$|E
500|$|Noble and Metcalfe {{left the}} Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose {{introduced}} the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the Royal Air Force (RAF). In December 1964, they secured their first recording time, at {{a studio in}} West Hampstead, through one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time free. Wright, who was {{taking a break from}} his studies, did not participate in the session. When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band's frontman. Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club near Kensington High Street in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of 90 minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's need to extend their sets to minimise song repetition, the band realised that [...] "songs could be extended with lengthy solos", wrote Mason. After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over lead guitar. The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{featured}} {{a lot of}} character development {{that many of the}} actors had been waiting for. Lana's jealousy over Clark and Chloe going to the prom begins to come out; although Kristin Kreuk believes that Lana {{does not want to be}} jealous, and wants to be able to support Clark with his newfound feelings for Chloe. According to Eric Johnson, Whitney finally gets to show a side of himself that Johnson wishes the audience would have been able to see sooner, as Whitney gives Lana a private dance before the prom knowing that she will not be able to go because he is leaving town. To add further depth to his character not previously seen, Millar and Gough decided to send Whitney off to war, instead of killing the character outright. The idea of sending Whitney off to war was something that came to Millar and Gough midway through the season. They knew they did not want to kill him, because they wanted the ability to bring him back at some point in the future, so they came up with this [...] "noble, heroic, send-off" [...] for the character. For Lex, this episode featured <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finally began to contemplate what his life would be like if his father was no longer a part of it. As Rosenbaum sees it, the moment that Lex hesitates to free his father from the support beam that collapses on him is the moment that the audience gets to see a hint of the evil man they know Lex will one day become. This is a brief moment where Lex forgets who he is, and if he had let his father die he would have certainly made his [...] "turn to the dark side".|$|E
60|$|But the {{complexion}} even {{of external}} things seemed to suffer transmutation as her announcement progressed. The {{fire in the}} grate looked impish--demoniacally funny, as {{if it did not}} care in the least about her strait. The fender grinned idly, as if it too did not care. The light from the water-bottle was merely engaged in a chromatic problem. All material objects around announced their irresponsibility with terrible iteration. And yet nothing had changed since <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had been kissing her; or rather, nothing in the substance of things. But the essence of things had changed.|$|R
5000|$|Musically he {{was largely}} {{influenced}} by Bob Dylan and Donovan.

2500|$|... 1968 saw Lloyd score {{his first}} century for Lancashire, against Cambridge University on 8 June. He scored 148 not {{out in a}} rain-affected draw. Lloyd would later state to The Sunday Times that this was <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{realised}} {{he wanted to be}} a cricketer. He went on to score 935 runs from 23 matches that season, largely batting up the order. His bowling suffered, however, taking only one wicket at 93.00.|$|E
2500|$|The poet {{pictures}} {{the youth}} standing [...] "on {{the top of}} happy hours", {{the time when the}} stars or the wheel of fortune blessed an individual.

On this note, a [...] "maiden garden" [...] is a womb yet to be made fruitful. To [...] "set" [...] a garden was to 'sow' it (compare Sonnet 15 where it is used of grafting) so that it can give birth to the youth's [...] "living flowers," [...] self-generated new copies.|$|E

Instead, he shot him in the shoulder, which made the soldier drop his rifle. However, he had to carry on running towards his Lewis Gun, so to proceed, he shot him above the knee, and in the ankle. Patch said, ...|$|E
2500|$|Adalgisa prays at the temple, remembering {{with some}} sorrow how she became {{involved}} with Pollione. He enters, telling her that she prays to a cruel god and {{is not trying to}} invoke the god of love. While she appears to reject him, he declares (Aria: Va crudele /"Go, O cruel one, to your god: make an offering of my blood") but he is convinced that he cannot leave her; he is distraught, but she is equally torn, until <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> declares that he must return to Rome the following day. He begs Adalgisa to go with him: (Duet: Pollione, then Adalgisa, then together: Vieni in Roma / [...] "Come to Rome, my darling; Love and joy and life are there").

2500|$|Mendes had {{the cast}} rehearse for three-and-a-half weeks before {{principal}} photography and shot everything in sequence and on location. Actor Michael Shannon {{said that he}} did not feel that on the set of the film there were any stars, but [...] "a group of people united by a passion for the material and wanting to honor the book". He said that Winslet and DiCaprio could only make such a good performance as a couple because they had developed a friendship since their work on Titanic. For Shannon, it was more important to prepare for <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> walked on the set than being concerned about the movie stars he was working with. On the fight scenes between him and Winslet, DiCaprio said, [...] "So much of what happens between Frank and April in this film is what's left unsaid. I actually found it a real joy to do those fight scenes because finally, these people were letting each other have it." [...] The shoot was so emotionally and physically exhausting for DiCaprio that he postponed his next film for two months.|$|E
60|$|They were landed. Could {{it be that}} Berenger {{was only}} two miles--only half an hour's walk form Eustacie? The bound his heart gave as he touched the shore seemed to stifle him.

6000|$|The play grew rougher, and Jerry lost {{himself in}} the play. Still playing, he grew so excited that all that had been feigned became actual.
