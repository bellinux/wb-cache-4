5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} with a nick, {{or break}} {{in one of}} <b>the</b> <b>strands,</b> at the junction point adopt a perpendicular orientation, and always prefer the stacking conformer that places the nick on a crossover strand rather than a helical strand.|$|E
5|$|As a result, it is {{both the}} {{percentage}} of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines {{the strength of the}} association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high AT content, making <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> easier to pull apart.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
50|$|In the mold, a thin {{shell of}} metal {{next to the}} mold walls solidifies before the middle section, now called a <b>strand,</b> exits <b>the</b> base of the mold into a spray chamber. The bulk of metal {{within the walls of}} <b>the</b> <b>strand</b> is still molten. <b>The</b> <b>strand</b> is {{immediately}} supported by closely spaced, water-cooled rollers which support the walls of <b>the</b> <b>strand</b> against <b>the</b> ferrostatic pressure (compare hydrostatic pressure) of the still-solidifying liquid within <b>the</b> <b>strand.</b> To increase <b>the</b> rate of solidification, <b>the</b> <b>strand</b> is sprayed with large amounts of water as it passes through the spray-chamber; this is the secondary cooling process. Final solidification of <b>the</b> <b>strand</b> may take place after <b>the</b> <b>strand</b> has exited <b>the</b> spray-chamber.|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} uniformly impregnate stranded material with dry powder such as low solubility, high melt flow polymer powder to produce, for example, composite prepregs. <b>The</b> <b>stranded</b> material is expanded in an impregnation chamber by {{an influx of}} air so that the powder, which may enter through the same inlet as the air, penetrates {{to the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>stranded</b> material. <b>The</b> <b>stranded</b> material then is contracted for holding the powder therein. <b>The</b> <b>stranded</b> material and powder may be pulled through the impregnation chamber in the same direction by vacuum. Larger particles of powder which do not fully penetrate <b>the</b> <b>stranded</b> material may be combed into <b>the</b> <b>stranded</b> material and powder which does not impregnate <b>the</b> <b>stranded</b> material may be collected and reused...|$|R
30|$|This {{test program}} adopted seven-wire strand that was {{widely used in}} the PC structure. The {{geometric}} and mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>strand</b> included (1) <b>the</b> diameter of <b>the</b> <b>strand</b> is 15.2  mm, {{and the length of}} <b>the</b> steel <b>strand</b> is 1000  mm; (2) the yield strength, elastic Young’s modulus, and fracture strain of <b>the</b> <b>strand</b> are 1860  MPa, 198  GPa, and 0.05, respectively; (3) the ultimate tensile resistance of <b>the</b> <b>strand</b> is 264.2  kN.|$|R
5|$|Immobile Holliday junctions, with {{asymmetrical}} sequences that lock <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> in {{a specific}} position, were artificially created by scientists to study their structure {{as a model for}} natural Holliday junctions. These junctions also later found use as basic structural building blocks in DNA nanotechnology, where multiple Holliday junctions can be combined into specific designed geometries that provide molecules {{with a high degree of}} structural rigidity.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, the {{strength}} of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.|$|E
5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in {{homologous recombination}} are between identical or nearly identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch migration process to occur where <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> move through the junction point. Cleavage, or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. Cleavage of the original set of strands leads to two molecules that may show gene conversion but not chromosomal crossover, while cleavage of the other set of two strands causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. All products, regardless of cleavage, are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E

5|$|The sinew, {{soaked in}} animal glue, is then laid in layers {{on the back}} of the bow; <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> of sinew are {{oriented}} along the length of the bow. The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E
5|$|Tile-based structures. This {{approach}} {{breaks the}} target structure into smaller units with strong binding between <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> contained in each unit, and weaker {{interactions between the}} units. It {{is often used to}} make periodic lattices, but {{can also be used to}} implement algorithmic self-assembly, making them a platform for DNA computing. This was the dominant design strategy used from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s, when the DNA origami methodology was developed.|$|E
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between <b>the</b> <b>strands.</b> These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12Å wide. The width of the major groove means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E
50|$|Major {{reconstruction}} of King's began in 1966 following {{the publication of}} the Robbins Report on Higher Education. <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> Building, designed by E. D. Jefferiss Mathews, was opened in 1972. The Macadam Building was then built over 1972-75. Planning permission for further new buildings on <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> campus, linking <b>the</b> Macadam Building to <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> Building (Phase III) and <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> Building to Somerset House (Phase IV), was refused following the listing of older buildings on the area and the designation, in 1974, of <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> Conservation Area. Renewed efforts were made in the 1960s and 70s to acquire the east wing of Somerset House, but these were again unsuccessful.|$|R

50|$|Today <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> {{features}} shops, historical exhibits, museums, {{art galleries}} and many restaurants and night clubs. It {{is also the}} location of a very popular annual Mardi Gras celebration, as well as a Christmas festival known as Dickens on <b>the</b> <b>Strand,</b> which celebrates <b>the</b> city's Victorian heritage with participants roaming <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> in period dress.|$|R
5|$|Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider {{right-handed}} spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological {{conditions in}} partly dehydrated samples of DNA, {{while in the}} cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, {{the opposite of the}} more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.|$|E
5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E
5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an unstacked form and two stacked forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged backbones of <b>the</b> <b>strands.</b> In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the electrostatic repulsion is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of site-specific binding of cations to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|E
5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology Type I topoisomerases are enzymes that cut one of <b>the</b> two <b>strands</b> of double-stranded DNA, relax <b>the</b> <b>strand,</b> and reanneal <b>the</b> <b>strand.</b> They are further subdivided into two structurally and mechanistically distinct topoisomerases: type IA and type IB.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> {{opened in}} 1901. It {{was built by}} the British {{entrepreneur}} John Darwood but later acquired by the Sarkies brothers, who owned a number of luxury hotels in the Far East, including the Raffles Hotel in Singapore and the Eastern & Oriental Hotel in Penang, Malaysia. During the colonial period, <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> {{was one of the}} most luxurious hotels in the British Empire with a clientele of exclusively whites. The Sarkies brothers sold <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> to Rangoon restaurateur Peter Bugalar Aratoon and Ae Amovsie in 1925. The hotel underwent a major renovation in 1937 and then in 1941, during World War II, following Japanese occupation of Burma, the hotel was used briefly to quarter Japanese troops. The following year, <b>the</b> <b>Strand's</b> ownership was transferred to the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. For the first time in 1945, since <b>The</b> <b>Strand's</b> establishment, <b>the</b> Burmese became part of the hotel's clientele. After Burma achieved independence in 1948, the hotel was neglected by post-colonial governments. In 1963, <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> Hotel was bought by the Burma Economic Development Corporation, which poorly maintained it. After the 1988 coup d'état, <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> was sold in 1989 to Bernard Pe-Win, a Burmese businessman, who formed an alliance with Adrian Zecha and a group of investors who formed <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> Hotel International.|$|R

5|$|The {{backbone}} of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} of the Myxogastria to other creatures {{have not been}} thoroughly researched as of 2012. Their natural predators include many arthropods, including mites and springtails, and especially beetles such as the rove beetles, round fungus beetles, wrinkled bark beetles, Eucinetidae, Clambidae, Eucnemidae (false click beetles), Sphindidae, Cerylonidae, and minute brown scavenger beetles. Various Nematodes have also been observed to be their predators; they attach their posterior portion on the cytosol of the plasmodia or even live within <b>the</b> <b>strands.</b> Certain Diptera species have evolved to specialise in this way: these are mostly representatives of the Mycetophilidae, Sciaridae and Drosophilidae. The species Epicypta testata was especially frequently found, especially on Enteridium lycoperdon, Enteridium splendens, Lycogala epidendrum and Tubifera ferruginosa.|$|E
