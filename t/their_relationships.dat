5|$|Although erections are not {{necessary}} for satisfying sexual encounters, many men see them as important, and treating erectile dysfunction improves <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> and quality of life. Whatever treatment is used, it works best in combination with talk-oriented therapy to help integrate it into the sex life.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many species}} of Psittacosaurus have been named, <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> to each other {{have not yet been}} fully {{explored}} and no scientific consensus exists on the subject. Several phylogenetic analyses have been published, with the most detailed being those by Alexander Averianov and colleagues in 2006, Hai-Lu You and colleagues in 2008, and Paul Sereno in 2010. The middle one is shown below.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and <b>their</b> <b>relationships.</b> They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in <b>their</b> <b>relationships.</b> Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E

40|$|In a study among 141 Dutch {{undergraduate}} students, {{the participants}} perceived <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> sn average ns {{better than the}} relationships of most others, and assumed that a majority was happy and that only a minority was unhappy with <b>their</b> <b>relationship.</b> The higher the relationship satisfaction, the more one considered one's relationship as superior, the higher one estimated the percentage of individuals happy with <b>their</b> <b>relationship,</b> and the lower one estimated the percentage of individuals unhappy with <b>their</b> <b>relationship.</b> Overall, these three perceptions were independently related to relationship satisfaction. However, men's satisfaction was particularly related to the perception that one's own relationship vas superior {{as well as to}} the assumption that few others were unhappy with <b>their</b> <b>relationship,</b> whereas women's satisfaction may particularly related tc the assumption that most mhos were happy with <b>their</b> <b>relationship...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{families}} of Mecoptera are well accepted by taxonomists but <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> have been debated. In 1987, R. Willman treated the Mecoptera as a clade, containing the Boreidae as sister to the Meropeidae, but in 2002 M. F. Whiting declared the Mecoptera paraphyletic, with the Boreidae as sister to another order, the Siphonaptera (fleas).|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{reactive}} attachment disorder {{for children}} usually involves {{a mix of}} therapy, counseling, and parenting education.

5|$|A {{consequence}} of his perfectionism {{is that some}} artists who initially sign deals with Dr.Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash, featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with the label and Dr.Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman, Joell Ortiz, Raekwon and Rakim.|$|E

5|$|Caspar Bartholin, a 17th-century Danish anatomist, {{dismissed}} Colombo's and Falloppio's {{claims that}} they discovered the clitoris, {{arguing that the}} clitoris had been widely known to medical science since the second century. Although 17th-century midwives recommended {{to men and women}} that women should aspire to achieve orgasms to help them get pregnant for general health and well-being and to keep <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> healthy, debate {{about the importance of the}} clitoris persisted, notably in the work of Regnier de Graaf in the 17th century and Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the 19th.|$|E

5|$|During Shadow of the Colossus, {{the player}} {{receives}} little {{information concerning the}} backstories of the characters and <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with one another. The game {{takes place in a}} fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring within a vast and unpopulated peninsula, known as the Forbidden Land, separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east. The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate the area was once a settlement.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{characters}} became common {{enough that}} Diana Wynne Jones' The Tough Guide To Fantasyland contains an entry on gay mages as a fantasy clich√©. Such characters {{are found in}} Mercedes Lackey's works, such as the Lambda award-winning The Last Herald Mage trilogy (1989), in which the protagonists are gay and have magical powers. <b>Their</b> <b>relationships</b> {{are an integral part}} of the story, which takes places in the fictional country of Valdemar. Much of the extended series provides non-heterosexual role-models for younger readers.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{the film}} {{remained}} unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version {{under the title}} Unsane. It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing {{nearly all of the}} film's violence, which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes that established the characters and <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> were excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of Tenebrae received nearly unanimously negative reviews.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and <b>their</b> <b>relationships,</b> sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} and months {{following}} Woods' admission of multiple infidelities, several companies re-evaluated <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with him. Accenture, AT, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods. TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011. Golf Digest suspended Woods' monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue. In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online. A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods' affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} members of its genus, the phylogenetic {{position}} of the blacktip reef shark remains indeterminate. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick proposed in 1982 that the closest relative of the blacktip reef shark was the nervous shark (C.cautus). Leonard Compagno's 1988 morphological analysis suggested affinity not only between this species and the nervous shark, but also four other species, and could not resolve <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> further. A 1998 allozyme analysis by Gavin Naylor again yielded ambiguous results, finding that the blacktip reef shark forms a polytomy (irresolvable group) with 10 other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|Lynette and her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), {{have been}} keeping her cancer a secret from their {{children}} and friends. She wears a wig to hide her baldness from the chemotherapy. Muriel (Julia Campbell), an uptight PTA mother, nags Lynette to organize a school event, forcing Lynette to reveal her illness to everyone. After recovering from her suicide attempt, Edie discovers that Carlos has $10 million in an offshore bank account. She promises he can trust her with the secret, just as she can trust him not to break her heart.

5|$|Near the Congo River {{a female}} who participates in strong {{emotional}} or sexual relationships with another female among the Nkundo people {{is known as}} yaikya bons√°ngo (a woman who presses against another woman). Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in Ghana among the Akan people. In Lesotho, females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in cunnilingus, and maintain <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.|$|E
40|$|Meaningful {{interactions}} between families and schools benefit multiple facets of children‚Äôs functioning including their academic, social, and behavioral adjustment (Christenson 2 ÃÜ 6 Sheridan, 2001). Positive relationships {{between parents and}} teachers predict children‚Äôs enhanced social-emotional functioning and academic adjustment across time (Izzo, Weissberg, Kasprow, 2 ÃÜ 6 Fendrich, 1999). Studies of parent-teacher relationships often focus on the association of child outcomes with separate parent or teacher reports of <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> quality. Little attention {{has focused on the}} congruence of perceptions within parent-teacher dyads. It may be the case that when parents and teachers view <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> in a similar positive light, better connections or partnerships across the home and school environments result, thereby enhancing children‚Äôs functioning. Conversely, when parents and teachers hold discrepant views about <b>their</b> <b>relationship,</b> or both view it negatively, they may be less likely to communicate and share goals for children; this disconnect may impede children‚Äôs functioning. This study examined the degree to which congruity and incongruity in parent and teacher views of <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> are related to children‚Äôs academic, social, and behavioral functioning. Congruity was examined using a categorical approach: o Positive congruence: parents and teachers share positive views about <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> o Non-positive congruence: parents and teachers share non-positive views about <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> o Incongruence: parents and teachers hold differing views about the quality of <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> Research Question and Hypothesis Is congruence/incongruence between parents and teachers in their views of <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> related to children‚Äôs academic, social, and behavioral functioning? It was hypothesized that congruent, positive views of the parent-teacher relationship would be associated with children‚Äôs enhanced academic, social, and behavioral functioning {{to a greater extent than}} non-positive congruent or incongruent views...|$|R
