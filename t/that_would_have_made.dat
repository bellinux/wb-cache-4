As it happened, during this period the invaders would have encountered a major storm lasting four days, between 19 and 22 June, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the initial landings impossible.|$|E
5|$|Save Our Children was {{the first}} {{organized}} opposition to the gay rights movement, whose beginnings were traced to the Stonewall riots in 1969. The defeat of the ordinance encouraged groups in other cities to attempt to overturn similar laws. In the next year voters in St. Paul, Minnesota, Wichita, Kansas, and Eugene, Oregon overturned ordinances in those cities, sharing {{many of the same}} campaign strategies that were used in Miami. Save Our Children was also involved in Seattle, Washington, where they were unsuccessful, and heavily influenced Proposition 6—a proposed state law in California <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the firing of openly gay public school employees mandatory—that was rejected by California voters in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{is officially}} the main {{language}} of Sweden. Swedish {{is also one}} of two official languages of Finland. In Sweden it has long been used in local and state government and most of the educational system but remained only a de facto primary language with no official status in law until 2009. A bill was proposed in 2005 <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> Swedish an official language but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin (145–147) due to a pairing-off failure. A proposal for a broader language law, designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status of the minority languages, was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry of Culture in March 2008. It was subsequently enacted by the Riksdag and entered into effect on 1 July 2009.|$|E

5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India. In 1863, the first reading of a bill <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, {{failed to make the}} statute book because of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system. The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E

25|$|Typical uniform grids are unresponsive to topography. Priene's plan, for example, {{is set on}} a hill {{side and}} most of its north-south streets are stepped, a feature <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> them {{inaccessible}} to carts, chariots and loaded animals. Many modern cities, such as San Francisco, Vancouver, and Saint John, New Brunswick, follow Priene's example, e.g.. In a modern context, steep grades limit accessibility by car, and more so by bicycle, on foot, or wheelchair, particularly in cold climates.|$|E

25|$|At 06:45 on 6 November, LCAs landing Nos. 40 and 42 Commando {{touched down}} at Port Said. The water here was {{particularly}} shallow as the beach shelved gently and the Commandos, having {{to wade through}} such a wide water gap, were perhaps fortunate that LVT amphibians also participated in the landing. Still, the LCA crews had done exactly what was required of them - landing the assault force on target and on time. The weather and sea conditions had cooperated; north-easterly winds blew up over the next eight hours <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the landing less accurate (and {{by the next morning}} impossible).|$|E
25|$|Somewhere in {{the middle}} Sixties, I first came upon the 56-page letter which Kelly {{attempted}} to have printed when the gang robbed the bank in Jerilderie in 1879. It is an extraordinary document, the passionate voice {{of a man who}} is writing to explain his life, save his life, his reputation … And all the time there is this original voice - uneducated but intelligent, funny and then angry, and with a line of Irish invective <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> Paul Keating envious. His language came in a great, furious rush that could not but remind you of far more literary Irish writers.|$|E
25|$|One {{complication}} {{for readers}} and translators of the Genji is that {{almost none of}} the characters in the original text are given explicit names. The characters are instead referred to by their function or role (e.g. Minister of the Left), an honorific (e.g. His Excellency), or their relation to other characters (e.g. Heir Apparent), which changes as the novel progresses. This lack of names stems from Heian-era court manners <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it unacceptably familiar and blunt to freely mention a person's given name. Modern readers and translators have used various nicknames {{to keep track of the}} many characters.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the further}} designs made by Bücker's Swedish {{engineer}} Anders J. Anderson, the Bü 180 and the Bü 182 Kornett, {{could have been}} the result of the Volksflugzeug proposal made by the LC II, the department of the Technisches Amt responsible for the development of new aircraft. The Bü 182 Kornett, the last plane designed by Anderson, of which only three were built, also found no support in the Air Ministry of the Reich, even though it combined technical progress and low-cost. The Bü 182 Kornett was a highly innovative model, fitted with a low-priced high-performance engine, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a good trainer for the Luftwaffe.|$|E
25|$|One {{month after}} the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Blunt voted for two Republican-sponsored bills. The first was {{proposed}} by John Cornyn and would have enabled a 72-hour waiting period for federal authorities to investigate individuals seeking to buy guns who are listed on the terrorist watch list. The second bill was proposed by Chuck Grassley would have expanded background checks and made it illegal for individuals with certain mental health disorders to purchase guns. Neither bill passed. Blunt voted against two Democrat-sponsored bills, both which also did not pass, including one <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> background checks required for online gun sales and gun sales at gun shows and another that would have not allowed anyone on the terrorist watchlist to purchase a gun.|$|E
25|$|She is {{also the}} first woman to climb Torre Egger, a {{difficult}} summit in Patagonia, of which she made the first one-day ascent, with her then partner Dean Potter. When Davis arrived in Patagonia, Potter was already established and they both climbed Cerro Stanhardt via what might have been a new route on the east face. They next attempted Torre Egger but half-a-rope-length from the top had to turn back because of a melting ice mushroom <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it dangerous to continue. Once colder weather returned, the couple climbed Titanic {{on the east side of}} Torre Egger, a feat that took them 23 hours.

25|$|Eurypterus {{were most}} {{probably}} marine animals, as their remains are mostly found in intertidal shallow environments. The concentrations of Eurypterus fossils in certain sites {{has been interpreted}} to {{be a result of}} mass mating and molting behavior. Juveniles were likely to have inhabited nearshore hypersaline environments, safer from predators, and moved to deeper waters as they grew older and larger. Adults that reach sexual maturity would then migrate en masse to shore areas in order to mate, lay eggs, and molt. Activities <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> them more vulnerable to predators. This could also explain why the vast majority of fossils found in such sites are molts and not of actual animals. The same behavior can be seen in modern horseshoe crabs.|$|E
25|$|Under Islamic law, non-Muslim males must {{convert to}} Islam to marry Muslim women. Christian and Jewish women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim women are {{prohibited}} from marrying Christian men. Muslim female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian widows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide for all family members who require assistance; however, this assistance is not always provided. In January 2000, the Parliament passed a new Personal Status Law that {{made it easier for}} a Muslim woman to obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, provided that she is willing to forgo alimony and the return of her dowry. However, an earlier provision of the draft law <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it easier for a woman to travel without her husband's consent, was rejected.|$|E
25|$|After Louis's death, {{the rival}} factions of Hungarian nobles {{simultaneously}} elected two kings, John Zápolya (1526–40) and Ferdinand of Habsburg (1526–64). Each claimed sovereignty {{over the entire}} country but lacked sufficient forces to eliminate his rival. Zápolya, a Hungarian who was military governor of Transylvania, was recognized by the sultan and was supported mostly by lesser nobles opposed to new foreign kings. John I's realm also became an Ottoman vassal in 1529 when he swore fealty to the sultan. Ferdinand, the first Habsburg to occupy the Hungarian throne, drew support from magnates in western Hungary who hoped he could convince his brother, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, to expel the Turks. In 1538 George Martinuzzi, Zápolya's adviser, arranged an agreement between the rivals, called the treaty of Nagyvárad, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> Ferdinand sole monarch upon {{the death of the}} then-childless Zápolya. The deal collapsed when Zápolya married and fathered a son. Violence erupted, and the Turks seized the opportunity, conquering the city of Buda and then partitioning the country in 1541.|$|E
