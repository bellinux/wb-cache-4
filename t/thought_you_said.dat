5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you were going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E

She finally says, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> 'School's out forever.'" [...] Alice is shown behind the cart, saying, [...] "The song goes 'School's out for summer'. Nice try, though." [...] The hit song then plays as supplies are shown. The tagline, [...] "That was easy", is heard playing over the company logo, formed to resemble a stapler.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{have found}} that out sooner than I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would,' <b>said</b> the landlord, composedly. 'Yes, he's dead, sure enough. He died at five o'clock to-day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{degrees of}} seriousness," [...] replied Syme. [...] "I have never doubted {{that you were}} {{perfectly}} sincere in this sense, that <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> well worth saying, that <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> did,' <b>said</b> the Mouse. '--I proceed. [...] "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, {{declared}} for him: {{and even}} Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--"' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, 'Smothers!'" [...] exclaimed Morley. [...] "Sol Smothers? Why, {{he lives}} in the next house to me. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'Smithers.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> did,' <b>said</b> Miss Grandison, 'I {{thought there}} was {{something}} in your manner that indicated you had met before. I do not think you knew my aunt before you met her at Bellair House?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Mary, I {{thought it}} was always {{understood}} between us that--that--I mean {{that you were not}} to care about him; not in the way of loving him, <b>you</b> know--I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> always <b>said</b> so--I have always told mamma so as if it came from yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nobody {{would teach}} the {{children}} at all if they <b>thought</b> like <b>you,</b> Helen,' <b>said</b> Anne; 'and then what would become of them?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are unusually enthusiastic, cousin," [...] said Emma, with a laugh. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{last night}} that weather never {{affected}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go?" [...] echoed Elmore, who {{had with}} {{difficulty}} realized the rapid change of tense. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you couldn't get her ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a change! I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> the billiards and cards paid well; but I {{suppose you}} have got {{something}} better in view?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> might," [...] <b>said</b> Newman, [...] "and I {{have taken}} a copy." [...] And he drew from his {{waistcoat}} pocket a small, folded sheet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! my lord, I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> dead. They <b>said</b> {{that they}} had come to kill you by command of the Jew Caleb, he who gave the evidence." ...|$|R

6000|$|LADY (innocently). I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you won {{the battle}} of Lodi for your country, General Bu-- shall I {{pronounce}} it in Italian or French? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that fellow, Ward Porton, {{was going}} to join the company up here," [...] remarked Phil, by way of {{changing}} the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{that other}} was {{the road to}} Butterfield," [...] said he, running {{his fingers through his}} shaggy {{whiskers}} in a puzzled way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't," [...] <b>said</b> Jack, coolly reopening {{the rail}} and {{stepping}} back again. [...] "It all depends upon {{the way you look}} at those things. Good-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> had," [...] <b>said</b> his step-son complacently. [...] "I {{can always}} tell. I don't {{see why you}} want to come picking on me, though. I've done nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> knew," [...] <b>said</b> McVeigh, who {{had been}} {{regarding}} him curiously. [...] "You, of all men, should have known. I thought that was why you were here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Time;--yes; but cannot we arrange some {{plan for}} the future? Cannot {{something}} be done? I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you would ask her to come here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Were there, then, a {{troop of}} these hyenas?" [...] asked Miriam, innocently. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> it was a solitary beast that took the sheep." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Randolph gave {{a gritty}} laugh. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> she was alone. Is that an escort she has picked up, American fashion, on the road?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not miserable from doubt,' {{answered}} Phoebe, disconcerting in her turn. 'We {{know you}} too well for that;' {{and as an}} expression, amused, indignant, but far from favourable, came over the fair face she was watching, she added in haste, 'It is this project, he <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> had <b>said</b> it was given up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{certainly}} is news," [...] was Ben's comment, as they rolled {{along the river}} road. [...] "I <b>thought</b> from what <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> Dave, {{he must have been}} buried alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would," [...] <b>said</b> she. [...] "Like to like, you know. You {{have both}} of you the same {{aptitude}} for climbing. But the monkeys never fall, they tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shouldn't slur {{your words}} so. For a moment I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'half of one per cent. One {{and a half}} of course you really said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{with your}} {{immediate}} future. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{that you were}} trying to get a job. Have you given up the idea of newspaper work, then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{spoke with}} such an air of {{finality}} that the officer looked at him suspiciously. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> none of you saw this happen," [...] said he.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> just <b>said</b> {{that there}} were no {{soldiers}} in Lothar," [...] said the Heliumite, with a gesture toward the guardsmen. [...] "What are these?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, but I'm not {{speaking}} from {{his point of}} view." [...] Nash was perfectly lucid. [...] "Moreover, I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> just now <b>said</b> it would be such a good thing for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would," [...] <b>said</b> {{the young}} man who looked like a parrot. [...] "Directly I saw you go over the side I said to myself: 'That fellow's going to get wet!'" ...|$|R
