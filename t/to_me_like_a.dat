25|$|The Felt {{theory was}} a strong one... Felt had a {{personal}} motive for acting. After the death of J. Edgar Hoover... Felt {{thought he was a}} leading candidate to succeed Hoover... The characteristics were a good fit. The trouble with Felt's candidacy was that Deep Throat in All the President's Men simply did not sound <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> career FBI man.|$|E
500|$|It {{was placed}} fifth on Entertainment Weeklys top 25 The Simpsons episode list. In 2003, USA Today {{published}} a top 10 episodes list {{chosen by the}} webmaster of The Simpsons Archive, which had this episode listed in tenth place, and it was again placed tenth on AskMen.com's [...] "Top 10: Simpsons Episodes" [...] list. IGN.com ranked John Waters's performance as the ninth-best guest appearance in the show's history, with TV Guide naming him the third-best film-related guest star. In a 2008 article, Entertainment Weekly named Waters {{as one of the}} 16 best The Simpsons guest stars. John Patterson of The Guardian wrote that Waters' appearance [...] "felt <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> summit meeting between the most influential pop-culture figures of the last 25 years".|$|E
500|$|After marrying Sara Fricker {{in autumn}} 1795, Coleridge left their home at Clevedon {{and began to}} travel {{throughout}} England {{in order to meet}} with various philosophers and political theorists. In part, he was trying to meet with people so he could raise subscriptions for his various works. During this time, he would write home constantly to his pregnant wife and was concerned about her state of health. His feelings of guilt, along with a fever that he treated with laudanum, affected him greatly and caused him to express these feelings in a letter to Josiah Wade on 10 February 1796: [...] "My past life seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream, a feverish dream! all one gloomy huddle of strange actions, and dim-discovered motives! Friendships lost by indolence, and happiness murdered by mismanaged sensibilities." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{heard him}} leave the house, {{but he did}} not go down the garden. Then, in a few minutes, every one of which seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> hour, the low voices at the gate ceased and my mother came slowly up the path towards the house.|$|R
500|$|The investors {{showed little}} {{interest}} in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing {{side of the business}} was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla would recount that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing [...] "My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mockery".|$|E
500|$|Symeon {{repeatedly}} {{describes the}} experience of divine light in his writings, as both an inward and outward mystical experience. These experiences began in his youth, and continued all during his life. They came to him during inward prayer and contemplation, and were associated {{with a feeling of}} indescribable joy, as well as the intellectual understanding that the light was a vision of God. In his writings, he spoke directly to God about the experience variously as [...] "the pure Light of your face" [...] and [...] "You deigned to reveal Your face <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> formless sun." [...] He also described the light as the grace of God, and taught that its experience was associated with a mind that was completely still and had transcended itself. At times he described the light speaking to him with kindness, and explaining who it was.|$|E
500|$|On November 20, 2016, soon before {{abruptly}} {{ending a}} concert prematurely he said, [...] "Jay Z—call me, bruh. You still ain't called me. Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send them at my head. Please call me. Talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man." [...] The following day, he {{was committed to}} the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. Contrary to what early reports said, however, West was not actually {{taken to the hospital}} involuntarily; he was persuaded to do so by authorities. While the episode was first described as one of [...] "temporary psychosis" [...] caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West's mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy; he was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization, but remains formally undiagnosed. The Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia. On November 30, West was released from the hospital.|$|E

6000|$|Then it was I {{appealed to}} Doctor Warren, telling him we Minute Boys {{were eager to}} be up and doing, and that {{it seemed as if}} we might be of {{assistance}} as spies; but he cut short the conversation by saying in what sounded <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> odd tone: ...|$|R

"We {{are to have}} {{a meeting}} to-night at the old ship-yard, near to Luke Wright's home," [...] Archie said, evidently {{thinking}} we had {{spent too much time}} over the gaining of this one recruit, and as we hurried away Seth cried, in what sounded <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> odd tone: ...|$|R
500|$|Roddenberry said of Christianity, [...] "How can I {{take seriously}} a God-image that {{requires}} that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That sounds <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> very insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, {{which was to}} have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing. Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{was forced}} into making it, you understand? I called it The Game because that's how the music {{business}} had become <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> little roulette wheel where everything we did had all of this political value to it, but it didn't make any difference because you spin the wheel and if it landed on the right number you were all right, the wrong number and you were not all right." ...|$|E

"Well, sir," [...] said Thomas, [...] "this sounds <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{illustrated}} post-card from South Boston with 'We're {{having a}} good time here' written on it. I don't know the game. Is this ten thousand dollars money, or do I have to save so many coupons to get it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Edgar. [...] "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> iron or steel box much encrusted with rust, and I shouldn't wonder if it contained something of value.

2500|$|My {{greatest}} {{pride and}} pleasure was seeing {{you as the}} head of the greatest orchestra in Germany. You may remember that I missed almost no performance which you conducted, saw only you and was happy. I believed that what I was hearing emanated from you only...the Ninth Symphony will be forever unforgettable to me on account of you. You appeared <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> God governing all the powerful elements and working enchantments on men. See, dear Richard, you own the power, the glorious gift of creating something great even as a conductor...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1991, Dylan told {{interviewer}} Paul Zollo that [...] "there was a {{time when}} the songs would come three or four at the same time, but those days are long gone...Once in a while, the odd song will come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bulldog at the garden gate and demand to be written. But most of them are rejected out of my mind right away. You get caught up in wondering if anyone really needs to hear it. Maybe a person gets to the point where they have written enough songs.
