5|$|Because of its low {{reproductive}} rate and historically documented declines {{in areas such}} as the Caribbean, the night shark has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the American Fisheries Society (AFS).

5|$|Many procellariids {{undertake}} long annual migrations in the non-breeding season. Southern {{species of}} shearwater {{such as the}} sooty shearwater and short-tailed shearwater, breeding on islands off Australia, New Zealand and Chile, undertake transequatorial migrations of millions of birds up to <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Alaska and back each year during the austral winter. Manx shearwaters from the North Atlantic also undertake transequatorial migrations from Western Europe and North America to <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Brazil in the South Atlantic. The mechanisms of navigation are poorly understood, but displacement experiments where individuals were removed from colonies and flown to far-flung release sites have shown {{that they are able}} to home in on their colonies with remarkable precision. A Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 kilometres (3,200mi).|$|E

5|$|At this time, the ADF had no {{military}} units on operational deployment outside Australia.

5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the leopard}} shark is caught by {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries {{for food and}} the aquarium trade. This species is mostly fished in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> California where, {{after a period of}} population decline in the 1980s, new fishing regulations in the early 1990s reduced harvesting to sustainable levels. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, while noting that local stocks may easily become overfished because of the shark's slow growth and limited migratory habits.|$|E

5|$|Like their {{relatives}} in the Elapidae family, {{the majority of the}} Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or trivial. For example, P. platurus has a venom more potent than any terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica based on LD50, but despite its abundance in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> its western coast, few human fatalities have been reported. Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be handled with great caution.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{territory}} is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, and a tall ice wall stretches throughout its coast. In some areas further within the ice sheet, mountain ranges breach through the ice, allowing for birds to breed {{and the growth of}} a limited flora.

5|$|Cleveland was a {{committed}} non-interventionist who had campaigned {{in opposition to}} expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration's Nicaragua canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations. Cleveland's Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of New England's Republican Senators.

5|$|Due to the {{rotation}} of the Earth, tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere tend to move from east to west. This causes tropical cyclones to approach the West Coast of the United States infrequently. Another inhibiting factor for a California landfall is the water temperatures. Because of the water currents, <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> California are rarely above , which is too cold for hurricanes to sustain themselves. This tropical cyclone was rare enough that only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones brought tropical storm-force winds to the Continental United States during the twentieth century. The Long Beach Tropical Storm was the only one to make landfall; the other three hit Mexico before moving north.|$|E
5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} this goal, the ADF was {{restructured}} {{to increase its}} ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. This was achieved by increasing {{the capabilities of the}} RAN and RAAF, and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia. During this time the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. However, in 1987 the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Fiji in response to the 1987 Fijian coups d'état.

Here she broke the flag of Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., 24 August, becoming flagship of the United States Third Fleet. On 30 August New Jersey set sail from Pearl Harbor, {{and for the next}} eight months was based at Ulithi to lend support to Allied forces operating in the Philippines. In this span of the Pacific War, fast carrier task forces ranged <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> the Philippines, Okinawa, and Formosa, making repeated strikes at airfields, shipping, shore bases, and invasion beaches.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1942, 10 Norwegian ships at Gothenburg made {{an attempt}} to escape into Allied-controlled waters, {{where they would be}} met and {{protected}} by a group of British warships. However, Sweden would not allow the Norwegian ships to use their neutral waters for this, and Swedish ships steered the escapees towards waiting German warships. Of the 10, two made it through to the British, six were sunk by the Germans or scuttled by their crew, of which Skytteren was one, two turned back to Gothenburg. Skytteren was scuttled in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>off</b> Måseskär, Sweden. Her crew were taken as prisoners of war.
