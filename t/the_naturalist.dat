5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, {{which seeks to}} explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac the father of <b>the</b> <b>naturalist</b> novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, <b>the</b> <b>naturalist</b> sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} form {{of protective}} mimicry is Müllerian mimicry, discovered by and named after <b>the</b> <b>naturalist</b> Fritz Müller.

5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book <b>The</b> <b>Naturalist</b> on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} insects in the Amazon basin, and especially the butterflies. He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by a predator, in the process now called after him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Public {{mentions}} of Cope's passing {{were relatively}} slight. <b>The</b> <b>Naturalist</b> ran four photographs, a six-page obituary by editor J. S.

The American Journal of Science devoted six paragraphs to Cope's passing, and incorrectly gave his age as 46. Cope was survived by his rival Marsh, who was suffering poor health.|$|E
5|$|The {{obsession}} {{led him to}} {{deny that}} animals could be colored for other reasons: for protection by mimicry, as <b>the</b> <b>naturalist</b> Henry Walter Bates had proposed, supported by many examples of butterflies from South America; through sexual selection, as Charles Darwin had argued, again supported by many observations. The unbalanced treatment of animal coloration in Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom encapsulates Thayer's partial understanding and his rejection of other theories.|$|E

5|$|Von Stroheim {{did not see}} Greed as {{political}} and told a journalist that he considered it {{to be like a}} Greek tragedy.

Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner falling in love with an aristocrat or royal.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and <b>the</b> <b>naturalist</b> cure Bond undergoes.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aculeata, {{commonly}} known as prickly banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by <b>the</b> <b>naturalist</b> James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981—by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In Wallonia, {{literature}} in French began a revival in 1881 {{with the creation}} of the La Jeune Belgique ("The Young Belgium") movement, which supported the creation of distinctively Belgian literature and opposed romanticism. Among the members of the Jeune Belgique were the writer Camille Lemonnier, whose works were often set against the background of Belgian peasant life in <b>the</b> <b>naturalist</b> style, and the poet Charles Van Lerberghe. French language poetry flourished in Belgium in the early 20th century under Émile Verhaeren and Maurice Maeterlinck; Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1911.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Naturalist</b> on the River Amazons, subtitled A Record of the Adventures, Habits of Animals, Sketches of Brazilian and Indian Life, and Aspects of Nature {{under the}} Equator, during Eleven Years of Travel, is an 1863 book by the British naturalist Henry Walter Bates about his {{expedition}} to the Amazon basin. Bates and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace set out to obtain new species and new evidence for evolution by natural selection, as well as exotic specimens to sell. He explored {{thousands of miles of}} the Amazon and its tributaries, and collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to discover Batesian mimicry.|$|E
50|$|In {{the midst}} of her career with the U.S. government, Shirley Briggs gained {{employment}} in <b>the</b> Audubon <b>Naturalist</b> Society in 1948, where she worked as an editor of The Wood Thrush, a periodical published by the organization.

5|$|Delahaye {{was one of}} many gardener-botanists {{employed}} on European colonial voyages {{of scientific}} exploration in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Their duty was to assist with the collection, transport, cultivation and distribution of economic plants. They worked with the naturalists on these expeditions, but gave particular assistance to the botanists by collecting live plants and seed, as well as plant specimens for herbarium collections. They often maintained journals and records of their collections and made observations on the vegetation encountered during the voyage. On this particular expedition, Delahaye assisted <b>the</b> <b>naturalist</b> and botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardière—who accumulated one of the largest herbarium collections of that era and published what was, in effect, the first Flora of Australia based on the collections he made on the New Holland (Australian) leg of the expedition. Delahaye also made numerous botanical collections of his own.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{indicate}} the Gurdons or Gordons occupied the village {{from at least}} the 13th century when Sir Adam de Gurdon held property. In 1472 the Gurdon holding was purchased by Winchester College who would increasingly grow to dominate the parish over the next 500 years. The Sandals holding later merged with the Gurdons and documents exist indicating {{the existence of the}} Sandals in 1255 and another in 1329, witnessed by a John de Sandale. For centuries, village life centred on the old farm holdings of the Manor; the Shelleys, Freres, Sandals and Gurdons (now merged into Old House Farm), and the Heathers, Clays, Porters, Park, Smiths and some descendants of these families continue to live in the village today and many old farm buildings still exist. <b>The</b> <b>naturalist</b> and ornithologist Gilbert White immortalised the localities of the region, including East Worldham, in his The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789).|$|E
5|$|Henry Walter Bates: (1825–1892) was an English explorer-naturalist who {{surveyed}} the Amazon rainforest with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. While Wallace returned in 1852, Bates remained {{for over a}} decade. His field research included collecting almost a hundred species of butterflies from the families Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, as well as thousands of other insects specimens. In sorting these butterflies into similar groups based on appearance, inconsistencies began to arise. Some appeared superficially similar to others, even {{so much so that}} Bates could not tell some species apart based only on wing appearance. However, closer examination of less obvious morphological characters seemed to show that they were not even closely related. Shortly after his return to England he read a paper on his theory of mimicry {{at a meeting of the}} Linnean Society of London on 21 November 1861, which was then published in 1862 as 'Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley' in the society's Transactions. He elaborated on his experiences further in <b>The</b> <b>Naturalist</b> on the River Amazons.|$|E
