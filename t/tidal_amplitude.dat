40|$|Abstract. Tides and {{planetary}} wave interactions in the MLT region using meteor radar observations over Trivandrum (8. 5 °N, 77 °E) are discussed. Continuous zonal and meridional wind measurements in the MLT region {{during the period}} of August 2004 to August 2005 are used for the present analysis. Using the hourly wind data, <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> are estimated on a daily basis and it has been observed that <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> do show variations shorter than seasonal time scales. Time series data of diurnal, semidiurnal and terdiurnal amplitudes are obtained and the same is subjected to the wavelet analysis, which revealed the tidal variability at planetary wave scales. The present results also showed the seasonal dependency of modulation of tides by the planetary scale waves, which can be directly attributed to the variability in the source of both tides {{and planetary}} waves. Another important observation from the present analysis is tidal variability at 20 - 30 days periodicity. Variation of <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> at planetary wave scales gives evidence for wave-wave interaction beyond doubts and variability at 20 - 30 day periodicity suggests the role of solar activity in controlling the MLT region dynamics.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{evaluates the}} {{geophysical}} {{influence of the}} combined effects of historic sea level rise (SLR) and morphology on tidal hydrodynamics in the Grand Bay estuary, located in the Mississippi Sound. Since 1848, {{the landscape of the}} Mississippi Sound has been significantly altered as a result of natural and anthropogenic factors including the migration of the offshore Mississippi–Alabama (MSAL) barrier islands and the construction of navigational channels. As a result, the Grand Bay estuary has undergone extensive erosion resulting in the submergence of its protective barrier island, Grand Batture. A large-domain hydrodynamic model was used to simulate present (circa 2005) and past conditions (circa 1848, 1917, and 1960) with unique sea levels, bathymetry, topography and shorelines representative of each time period. Additionally, a hypothetical scenario was performed in which Grand Batture Island exists under 2005 conditions in order to observe the influence of the island on tidal hydrodynamics within the Grand Bay estuary. Changes in <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> from the historic conditions varied. Within the Sound, <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> were unaltered due to the open exposed shoreline; however, in semi-enclosed embayments outside of the Sound, <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> increased. In addition, harmonic constituent phases were slower historically. The position of the MSAL barrier island inlets influenced tidal currents within the Sound; the westward migration of Petit Bois Island allowed stronger tidal velocities to be centered on the Grand Batture Island. Maximum tidal velocities within the Grand Bay estuary were 5 cm/s faster historically, and reversed from being flood dominant in 1848 to ebb dominant in 2005. If the Grand Batture Island was reconstructed under 2005 conditions, <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and phases would not be altered, indicating that the offshore MSAL barrier islands and SLR have a greater influence on these tidal parameters within the estuary. However, maximum tidal velocities would increase by as much as 5 cm/s (63 %) and currents would become more ebb dominant. Results of this study illustrate the hydrodynamic response of the system to SLR and the changing landscape, and provide insight into potential future changes under SLR and barrier island evolution...|$|R

40|$|Horizontal winds in the {{mesosphere}} {{have been}} measured over Ascension Island (8 ° S, 14 ° W) {{in the tropical}} mid-Atlantic region throughout the years 2002 – 2011. The observations were made by a very high frequency (VHF) meteor radar. The observations reveal the presence of atmospheric tides of large amplitude. The observations are analysed to characterise the seasonal and interannual variability of the diurnal and semidiurnal tides. Monthly-mean diurnal <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> are found to reach values as large as 48 m s − 1 in the meridional component and 41 m s − 1 in the zonal. A semiannual seasonal variation is found in diurnal <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> with amplitude maxima at the equinoxes and amplitude minima at the solstices. Diurnal tidal meridional vertical wavelengths are generally in the range 24 – 30 km. The diurnal zonal vertical wavelengths {{are similar to the}} meridional, except for the winter months when the zonal vertical wavelengths are much longer, occasionally exceeding 100 km. Semidiurnal amplitudes are observed to be significantly smaller than diurnal amplitudes. Semidiurnal vertical wavelengths range from 20 to more than 100 km. Our observations of <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and phases are compared with the predictions of the extended Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (eCMAM) and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). Both eCMAM and WACCM reproduce the trend for greater diurnal amplitudes in the meridional component than the zonal. However, eCMAM tends to overestimate meridional amplitudes, while WACCM underestimates both zonal and meridional amplitudes. Vertical wavelength predictions are generally good for both models; however, eCMAM predicts shorter diurnal zonal vertical wavelengths than are observed in winter, while WACCM predicts longer zonal vertical wavelengths than observed for the semidiurnal tide for most months. Semidiurnal amplitude predictions are generally good for both models. It is found that larger-than-average diurnal and semidiurnal <b>tidal</b> <b>amplitudes</b> occur when the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) at 10 hPa is eastwards, and smaller-than-average amplitudes occur when it is westwards. Correlations between the amplitude perturbations and the El Niño Southern Oscillation are also found. The precise mechanism for these correlations remains unclear...|$|R

Our assessment employs observed meteor distributions for June of 2009, 2010, or 2011 for each radar {{and a set of}} seven test motion fields including various superpositions of mean winds, constant diurnal tides, constant and variable semidiurnal tides, and superposed GWs having various amplitudes, scales, periods, directions of propagation, momentum fluxes, and intermittencies.
