5|$|In 2011, city {{couples who}} both came from one-child {{families}} were allowed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> child, while couples {{in rural areas}} could have a second if just one of them came from a one-child family. In 2013, the further revision of the Planned Birth Policy allowed couples in which either parent had no siblings to have two children. In 2015, China allowed all couples to have two children, abolishing its decades-long one-child policy for urban families.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 1792 Kentucky Constitution had {{the governor}} chosen by an electoral college for {{a term of}} four years. The second constitution in 1799 changed this to a popular vote, and prevented governors from succeeding themselves within seven years of their terms. The third constitution in 1850 reduced the succession limitation to four years. A 1992 {{amendment to the constitution}} allowed governors <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> term before being prevented from succeeding themselves for four years.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon monarchs used various {{locations}} for their coronations, including Bath, Kingston upon Thames, London, and Winchester. The last Anglo-Saxon monarch, HaroldII, was crowned at Westminster Abbey in 1066; the location was preserved for all future coronations. When London {{was under the}} control of rebels, HenryIII was crowned at Gloucester in 1216; he later chose <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> coronation at Westminster in 1220. Two hundred years later, HenryVI also had two coronations; as king of England in London in 1429, and as king of France in Paris in 1431.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{argues that}} large noncontrolling shareholders enhance firm value because they deter expropriation by the controlling shareholder. We {{propose that the}} conflicting incentives faced by large shareholders may induce a nonlinear relationship between the relative size of large shareholdings and firm value. Consistent with this prediction, we present evidence that there are costs <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> (and third) largest shareholder, especially when the largest shareholdings are similar in size. Our results are robust to various relative size proxies, firm performance measures, model specifications, and potential endogeneity issues...|$|R
5|$|The Second Avenue Subway was {{supposed}} to be the flagship project of the Program for Action. In a 1964 report, it was given top priority on a list of projects to be completed. Prior attempts to build the line had failed, and the city wished <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Second</b> Avenue subway line to alleviate overcrowding on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. Twenty-two blocks of tunnel were ultimately constructed, excluding seven blocks in the East Village that were prepared for tunneling operations, but never excavated.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} Miami's post-score kickoff {{needing to}} score quickly {{in order to}} have a chance <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> opportunity on offense â€” needed because Tech was now two scores behind. Tech returned the kickoff to the 24-yard line but were penalized 12 yards for an illegal block. Casey passed for an eight-yard gain and ran for three yards for a first down. After that gain, things went against the Hokies. Casey was penalized 15 yards for intentional grounding, and Tech was unable to gain another first down. The Hokies punted, and Miami took over on offense at its 46-yard line. In possession of the lead, Miami began to run out the clock, executing multiple rushing plays in succession in order to force the game clock to continue to count down. Tech's defense forced a stop, but because Miami punted the ball with just 2:20 remaining in the game, there was little chance that Tech would be able to make up the needed two scores.|$|E

25|$|The town's Parish Church {{was used}} as the first school house. Until 1893, Lanark Grammar was a fee-paying school and until 1884 it was for boys only. From its {{beginnings}} in the Parish Church, the school would usually have only two teachers at a time until 1884.

In 2007, 36% of China's population was subject to a strict one-child restriction, with an additional 53% being allowed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> child if the first child was a girl.
