5|$|Despite Brown's intentions, Saban {{was used}} {{occasionally}} on the Browns' offense in 1946. He caught a 44-yard pass from quarterback Otto Graham in a September {{game against the}} Buffalo Bisons. He was mainly used as a linebacker, however, and had four interceptions as the Browns won the first AAFC championship. In the offseason, he worked for Browns owner Mickey McBride's Yellow Cab Company; many of his teammates spent the offseason either at college making up for time lost to the war or taking jobs <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> football incomes.|$|E

According to the website Chessmetrics, Berthold was among the world's top ten players in the early 1890s. <b>To</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> income Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes, {{especially}} at the CaféKaiserhof.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach {{contents}} and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E

During 1978 and 1979, while looking <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 {{investment}} generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal. Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s, Russia's economy {{suffered}} from a financial crisis, depressed oil prices, and international sanctions put into place during the Ukrainian crisis. With less disposable income to spend, citizens were forced to take drastic measures.

5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> income, the {{inhabitants}} of Milnrow entered the domestic system, producing flannel and woollen cloth in purpose-built weavers' cottages, some of which from the Early Modern period have survived as listed buildings. Coalmining and metalworking also flourished in this period, but the Industrial Revolution supplanted the domestic industries and converted Milnrow into an urban mill town that mass-produced textile goods in cotton mills, such as Ellenroad Ring Mill (now a museum). The Milnrow Urban District was established in 1894 and was governed thereafter by its own district council until its abolition in 1974.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 U.S. recon {{photographs}} uncovered {{an unusual}} sight. POL barrels were spotted {{floating in the}} waters of the Kong River south of Ban Bak, Laos. Soon, PAVN was making use of the Banghiang River which flowed southwestward from the Demilitarized Zone {{all the way to the}} Mekong River, for the same purposes. The watertight drums were launched en masse from tributary streams into the main channel, floated downstream, and were recovered by systems of nets and booms. The Kaman River was added to the system in 1969. By 1970 the North Vietnamese were making intense use of streams and rivers <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> logistical route, especially in the rainy season, when the water levels rose and the roadways became impassable mires. During one two and one-half month period during 1969, over 10,000 POL barrels were spotted in the waterways of southeastern Laos.|$|E

5|$|In the game, players fight various monsters as they {{explore the}} pyramid's halls and catacombs. Players may pick up weapons and {{ammunition}} {{left behind by}} others <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> arsenal. As additional levels are unlocked, new weapons become available, including machine guns and grenade launchers. Players can absorb {{a certain amount of}} damage, but once their health reaches zero, they must resume their progress at the last saved checkpoint. Resting in place replenishes health but saps game time and leaves the player open to attack. Scattered throughout the levels are other items players may use. Potions have different effects: rare blue potions, for example, rid the player character of poison and damage. Otherwise items provide points or cash; every four points increases the player character's maximum health by two units. Crystals can be used against enemies to freeze, burn, or otherwise harm them.|$|E
5|$|In the {{intervening}} time, through {{contact with other}} tribes that had more European contact, the Yavapai began to adopt certain European practices. They raised some livestock and planted crops, also adopting some modern tools and weaponry. In a syncretic way, they adopted elements of Christianity. An estimated 25% of the population {{died as a result}} of smallpox in the 17th and 18th centuries, smaller losses than for some tribes, but substantial enough to disrupt their societies. With the use of guns and other weapons, they began to change methods of warfare, diplomacy, and trade. They used livestock raiding, either from other tribes such as the Maricopa, or from Spanish settlements to their south, <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> economy. They often acquired human captives in raids, whom they traded as slaves to Spaniards in exchange for European goods.|$|E
5|$|Some Weiquan {{lawyers have}} {{advocated}} {{for the rights}} of HIV/AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood drives. In the 1990s, government officials in central China, and especially in Henan, encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable. Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of Li Changchun, the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan.|$|E

5|$|The {{father was}} {{eventually}} fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, {{and forced to}} take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment, and eventually chose <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> income by lodging boys in the house. Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born. She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old. Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder. Maria's father was an atheist; her mother a devout Catholic. The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.|$|E
5|$|The imprisoned {{soldiers}} {{received two}} {{meals a day}} of steamed rice, occasionally accompanied by fruit, soup, or meat. <b>To</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> diet, prisoners were able to smuggle food and supplies hidden in their underwear into the camp during Japanese-approved trips to Cabanatuan. To prevent extra food, jewelry, diaries, and other valuables from being confiscated, items were hidden in clothing or latrines, or were buried before scheduled inspections. Prisoners collected food {{using a variety of}} methods including stealing, bribing guards, planting gardens, and killing animals which entered the camp such as mice, snakes, ducks, and stray dogs. The Filipino underground collected thousands of quinine tablets to smuggle into the camp to treat malaria, saving hundreds of lives.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{source of}} wealth for Plymouth Colony was the fur trade. The {{disruption}} of this trade caused by Myles Standish's raid at Wessagussett created great hardship for the colonists {{for many years to}} come, and was directly cited by William Bradford as a contributing factor to the colonists' economic difficulties in their early years. The colonists attempted <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> <b>their</b> income by fishing; the waters in Cape Cod bay were known to be excellent fisheries. However, they lacked any skill in this area, and it did little to relieve their economic hardship. The colony traded throughout the region, establishing trading posts as far away as Penobscot, Maine.

40|$|Background: Most {{children}} already {{meet their}} daily nutrient needs through food intake. However, {{many of them}} still consume food supplement. Supplement use becomes popular, but the pattern of supplement provision amongst preschool children has never been investigated. As the supplement use increases, there is {{an increased risk of}} over consumption of several micronutrients. Objective: To evaluate the predictors of preschooler’s <b>supplement</b> intake related <b>to</b> mother’s socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics and to compare dietary pattern and nutritional status of preschool children who consume and did not consume supplements. Method: This is an observational study with case control design. The subjects were preschool children enrolled at Bandar Lampung Kindergarten and their mothers. The case and control group consisted of 79 mothers, respectively. Sociodemographic information and frequency of dietary supplement consumption were collected via parental questionnaires, including a 24 -hour food recall. Result: Most children consume multivitamin supplement once a day (65. 45 %). The most infl uential factor for mothers <b>to</b> give food <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> child is media exposure. Mothers from families with higher income, lower educated, consume supplement and highly motivated were signifi cantly more likely <b>to</b> give food <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> child than their counterparts. Excluding nutrient intake from supplement, there were no differences in nutrient intake between supplement consumers and non-consumers. There were also no differences in nutritional status between supplement consumers and non-consumers. Conclusion: The most infl uential factor for mothers <b>to</b> give <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> child is media exposure. There were no differences in nutritional status and nutrient intake between supplement consumers and non-consumers...|$|R
