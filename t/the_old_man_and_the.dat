5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea (1952), Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill health for much of his remaining life. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida, (1930s) and Cuba (1940s and 1950s), and in 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where he killed himself in mid-1961.|$|E

MTV later hired Seidell and Blumenfeld to host Pranked, a clip show featuring prank videos from the Internet. Outside of CollegeHumor, Blumenfeld has appeared in the short film <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Seymour, the television series Louie and I Just Want My Pants Back, and the 2011 film A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas. He also writes for ESPN The Magazine and Mental Floss.|$|E
5|$|Todd {{purchases}} an SS uniform from {{a costume}} shop, and forces Dussander to wear it. When he {{spends more time}} with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes great pride in Todd's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.|$|E

25|$|The answer {{assumes a}} third level on which <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea must be read—as {{a sort of}} allegorical {{commentary}} on all his previous work, by means of which it may be established that the religious overtones of <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea are not peculiar to that book among Hemingway's works, and that Hemingway has finally taken the decisive step in elevating {{what might be called}} his philosophy of Manhood {{to the level of a}} religion.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea {{is a short}} novel {{written by}} the American author Ernest Hemingway in 1951 in Bimini, Bahamas, and {{published}} in 1952.

500|$|In 1948, Hemingway and Mary {{traveled}} to Europe, staying in Venice for several months. While there, Hemingway {{fell in love}} with the then 19-year-old Adriana Ivancich. The platonic love affair inspired the novel Across the River and into the Trees, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews. The following year, furious at the critical reception of Across the River and Into the Trees, he wrote the draft of <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea in eight weeks, saying that it was [...] "the best I can write ever for all of my life". <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea became a book-of-the-month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, Tracy {{appeared}} in <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea, {{a project that}} had been in development for five years. An adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's novella of the same name, Hemingway's agent, Leland Hayward, had previously written to the author: [...] "Of all Hollywood people, the one that comes the closest to me in quality, in personality and voice, in personal dignity and ability, is Spencer Tracy." [...] Tracy was delighted to be offered the role. He was told to lose some of his 210 pounds before filming began, but failed to do so. Hemingway thus reported that Tracy was a [...] "terrible liability to the picture", and had to be reassured that the star was being carefully photographed to disguise his weight. Appearing alone on screen {{for the majority of the}} film, Tracy considered <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea the toughest part he ever played. In reviewing the performance, Jack Moffitt of the Hollywood Reporter said it was [...] "so intimate and revealing of universal human experience that, to me, it almost transcended acting and became reality." [...] Tracy received Oscar and BAFTA Award nominations for the work.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{wrote in}} 1926 of Hemingway's first novel, [...] "No amount of {{analysis}} can convey {{the quality of}} The Sun Also Rises. It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame." [...] The Sun Also Rises is written in the spare, tight prose that made Hemingway famous, and, according to James Nagel, [...] "changed the nature of American writing." [...] In 1954, when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, it was for [...] "his mastery {{of the art of}} narrative, most recently demonstrated in <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style." ...|$|E
500|$|Fish feature {{prominently}} {{in art and}} literature, in movies such as Finding Nemo and books such as <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea. Large fish, particularly sharks, have frequently {{been the subject of}} horror movies and thrillers, most notably the novel Jaws, which spawned a series of films of the same name that in turn inspired similar films or parodies such as Shark Tale and Snakehead Terror. Piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as Piranha; however, contrary to popular belief, the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger species that is unlikely to harm humans. In the Book of Jonah a [...] "great fish" [...] swallowed Jonah the Prophet. Legends of half-human, half-fish mermaids have featured in folklore, including the stories of Hans Christian Andersen.|$|E

500|$|In {{our time}} was {{published}} {{as part of}} Pound's modernist series by Three Mountains Press, Paris in 1924. The work was well received by critics; Edmund Wilson described the writing as [...] "of the first distinction", and in the 1940s he again wrote of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", [...] "along with the mottled trout... the boy from the American Middle West fishes up a nice little masterpiece." [...] When the story {{was published in the}} United States, critics asserted Hemingway had reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style. [...] In 1952, reviewing <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea—for which Hemingway would win the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature—The New York Times said of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] {{that it was one of}} the [...] "best and happiest of his early short stories".|$|E
500|$|Almost a {{year later}} in October 1955, he declared: [...] "Am passed 650 pages in the book. Am trying to write now like a good sorcer's (sic) apprentice... always start to write as an apprentice. By {{the end of the}} book you are a master but if you {{commence}} as master in writing anyway, you end as a bloody bore." [...] Two months later, Hemingway was bedridden with kidney disease. By January 1956, he acknowledged, in a letter written on the second anniversary of the accidents, [...] he was having trouble remembering the trip. [...] In 1956, Hemingway agreed to work on the filming of <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea and abandoned work on the Africa book. [...] He wrote to his editor, [...] "I found it impossible to resume writing on the Africa book." [...] Hemingway put the manuscript in a safe-deposit box in Havana, although after the 1959 [...] Cuban revolution he feared the manuscript lost.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the episode itself is a {{reference}} of Ernest Hemingway's book <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea.

When Grandpa and Zelda take off {{on one of their}} dates, three old men with long beards imitate ZZ Top as a short part of [...] "Sharp Dressed Man" [...] is played. Grandpa's interaction with the [...] "Souvenir Jackitos" [...] in Apu's store mirrors a scene in the 1961 musical film West Side Story, with Grandpa and his friends taking the role of the Jets in the film, the [...] "Souvenir Jackitos" [...] as the Sharks, and Apu as Doc. The [...] "Death race" [...] on the other hand, is a reference to the 1955 drama film Rebel Without a Cause. The abandoned aqueduct, in which the death race takes place, is based on the Los Angeles River.|$|E
