Overall, hurricanes lead to large increases in foreign aid. For other types of international financial flows, the impact of hurricanes varies according to income level.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the thesis is to study the value of snow {{measurements}} in the scheduling of hydropower plants. This is done by implementing an approximative Least-Square Monte Carlo(LSMC) method to calculate the scheduling. The optimization algorithm uses dynamic programming to find the optimal strategy. The spot price is deterministic, while the inflows are stochastic. Snow measurements are then included in the model, to calculate the Value of Information. Realistic data from a large-size Norwegian power plant is used to fit a normal distribution to simulate different inflow scenarios used in the model. The correlation between the snow measurements and the inflows are also studied to see how different snow levels influence the inflows in the flood period. The {{analysis of the data}} showed that the maximum amount of snow and the <b>total</b> <b>inflow</b> in the flood period, week 16 - 32, is highest correlated with a correlation coefficient equal 0. 85. The numerical testing of the LSMC-method showed that the spot price and the ratio between the <b>total</b> <b>inflow</b> and the upper reservoir limit have the biggest impact on the optimal strategy. The value of the snow measurements vary for different parameters in the model. When the reservoir is big compared to the <b>total</b> <b>inflow,</b> the snow has no value. When the reservoir is smaller, the probability for overflow is bigger and the snow measurements are valuable. The increase in value by using the snow measurements variates between 0 and 10 %. The annual production in Norway is 130 TWh, worth more than 4 billions NOK. This means that even a small improvement results in a big revenue. If 40 % of the snow measurements are uncertain and in average 10 % higher or lower than the real snow reservoir, the value of the measurement decreases with 25 %. The value was also calculated for different correlation coefficients 0. 55 and 0. 25, and the value of the measurements decreased with 24 and 60 %. This shows that even though there are some uncertainty in the measurements, the additional information is very valuable if the reservoir is small compared to the <b>total</b> <b>inflow</b> in the flood period...|$|R

This paper focuses on hurricanes (one {{of the most common}} and destructive types of disasters), and examines the impact of hurricane damages on resource flows to affected countries. Due to the potential endogeneity of disaster damage, I exploit instrumental variables constructed from meteorological data on hurricanes. Instrumental variables estimates indicate that disaster damages lead to increases in national-level net inflows of migrants’ remittances, foreign lending, and foreign direct investment. These types of flows respond rapidly, within the first year after damages. Official development assistance (ODA) also responds positively to hurricane damage, but with a lag of roughly two years. On average, <b>total</b> <b>inflows</b> from these sources within the following four years amount to roughly four-fifths of estimated damages. The null hypothesis of full insurance of hurricane disaster damages cannot be rejected. By contrast, ordinary least squares estimates find essentially no response of international flows to disaster damages, highlighting the importance of an instrumental variables approach in this context. risk-sharing, insurance, official development assistance, foreign aid, remittances, foreign direct investment, international lending, natural disasters, hurricanes...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{recovery}} in capital flows towards developing countries, {{some of their}} characteristics have generated serious problems. As these flows are increasingly concentrated in {{a small group of}} emerging markets, most developing countries have been facing a severe scarcity of external resources, while for the minority endowed with some measure of access to international financial markets, volatility and sustainability remain the key issues. Financial liberalisation has helped to create new channels for resource transfers from the developed world, but it has also generated conditions wherein such transfers can easily be reversed with serious consequences in terms of instability. The present study depicts, discusses and analyses some of the issues related to capital movements between developed and developing countries.

40|$|Introduction: Over {{the last}} few years, the rising level of the Great Salt Lake has changed Utah. It has {{inundated}} vast waterfowl feeding areas, crippled the salt industry, required raising transcontinental freeways and railroads, threatened metropolitan waste treatment plants, caused a major electrical outage, and damaged many properties. If nothing is done, approximately $ 3. 6 billion of damages in 1985 dollars can be expected by 2050 (James et al, 1985, p. 4). This threat led the State Legislature to set aside $ 100 million (an amount approximating the damages that had then occurred) in January 1985 to identify, select, and implement remedial measures. The rise has slowed. However, the lake entered February 1986 at its highest level since 1877, and a large storm of tripical origins brought a record one-month rise, tying the high of the previous spring at 4209. 95, with heavy snowpacks {{in the mountains and}} at least three months of precipitation left before the normal date of the annual peak. Nevertheless, the legislature is diverting some of the funds to other purposes. As shown in Figure 2, the rise has greatly enlarged the surface area of a shallow water body. Table 1 shows how the historic variation has increased the lake surface area from 587, 000 to 1, 556, 0000 acres, a range that varies normal annual evaporation from 1, 470, 000 to 4, 800, 000 acre feet.

Acknowledging {{the importance of}} food and other agricultural products, this paper additionally investigates frequently neglected flows of N related to consumers and estimates their magnitude, using Austria in 2010 as an example. Specifically, N in non-food industrial products (synthetic & natural polymers, wood & paper products, waste), and N related to pets, gardens, and energy use is considered. Over the last five decades, both food and material consumption have increased distinctly. While food supply accounts for 52 % of total directly consumer-related nitrogen inflows covered in this study (66, 000 t Na^ 1), also material products account for a considerable share of 28 % (36, 000 t Na^ 1). N application in gardens (12 %) and N in pet food (7 %) do also play a role. Quantified outflows are human excretion (54 %), food waste (13 %), garden waste (16 %), material waste (7 %) and waste from pets (10 %). The detected balance surplus of 34, 000 t Na^ 1, corresponding to 27 % of <b>total</b> <b>inflows,</b> points to some accumulation of N {{in the form of}} durable consumer goods and to potentially missing flows.

30|$|Collecting data on {{bilateral}} migration is, in general, {{a difficult}} task. Reliability of statistics from origin countries is low {{because it is}} difficult {{to keep track of the}} people who leave the country. Data from destination countries is more accurate. The lack of comparable cross-destination country bilateral data led many papers in the literature to follow a single destination country over time (e.g. Borjas and Bratsberg 1996; Karemera et al. 2000; Clark et al. 2007; Bertoli and Fernández-Huertas Moraga 2013). More recently, researchers and institutions have put some effort in gathering comparable bilateral migration data across destination countries. Pedersen et al. (2008) and Mayda (2010) are the first papers using cross-destination country panel data on bilateral inflows to analyze the effect of income gains and moving costs on international migration. Mayda (2010) uses a database from OECD on annual legal inflows of workers by country of origin; she uses these data to investigate the determinants of migration inflows into 14 OECD countries between 1980 and 1995. Pedersen et al. (2008) produce a similar database collecting data on issues of residence and work permits from National Statistical Offices from 1989 to 2000. They use these data to look at the effects of networks and welfare benefits on international migration. These two databases have recently been expanded by Ortega and Peri (2013) and Adserà and Pytliková (2012) respectively. 4 The four databases contain information on inflows of immigrants and, with a lower accuracy, net flows. They are based on the number of issues of residence and work permits, which is likely to produce a severe underestimation the real numbers due to illegal migration. And, acknowledged by the authors, they have an important amount of missing data and incorrect zero values (for countries with relatively small flows), covering, as a result, a limited fraction of <b>total</b> <b>inflows</b> (Mayda 2010, pp.  1258 – 1259).|$|E

The Guaraní Aquifer System is the largest transboundary aquifer in South America. It contains an enormous volume of water, however, it is not well known being difficult {{to assess the impact}} of exploitation currently used to supply over 25 million inhabitants. This is a sensitive issue because the aquifer is shared by four countries. Moreover, an integrated groundwater model, and therefore, a global water balance were not available. In this work, a transient regional scale model for the entire aquifer based upon five simplified, equally plausible conceptual models represented by different hydraulic conductivity parametrizations, is used to analyze the flow system and water balance components. Combining an increasing number of hydraulic conductivity zones and an appropriate set of boundary conditions, the hypothesis of a continuous sedimentary unit yielded errors within the calibration target in a regional sense. The magnitude of the water budget terms resulted very similar for all parametrizations. Recharge and stream/aquifer fluxes were the dominant components representing, on average, 84. 2 % of <b>total</b> <b>inflows</b> and 61. 4 % of total outflows, respectively. However, leakage was small compared to stream discharges of main rivers. For instance, the simulated average leakage for the Uruguay river was 8 m 3 s− 1 while the observed absolute minimum discharge was 382 m 3 s− 1 . Streams located in heavily pumped regions switched from a gaining condition on early years to a losing condition over time. Water is discharged through the aquifer boundaries, except at the eastern boundary. On average, pumping represented 16. 2 % of inflows while aquifer storage experienced a small overall increment.
