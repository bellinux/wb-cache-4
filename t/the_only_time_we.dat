He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

30|$|Mean peak temperature, heat duration, {{and heat}} dose were all most {{strongly}} correlated with fuel loads (Figures 1 and 2; Table 2). Weather parameters also influenced fire temperature, heat duration, and heat dose, {{but over the}} range of the conditions in which our burns occurred, the influence of fuel load was 3.4 times (for peak temperature) to 5.6 times (for heat dosage) greater than the influence of any weather parameter (Table 2). For both peak temperature and heat duration, wind speed was the most important weather influence, followed by ambient air temperature (Table 2). For heat dosage, however, air temperature became the most important weather parameter, followed by wind speed (Table 2). After accounting for wind speed and air temperature, relative humidity had only a minor influence on any of the heat production measures (Table 2). We caution that this finding reflects the fact that most burns occurred with low relative humidity (8 % to 20 %), and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> when <b>we</b> burned with relative humidity greater than 30 % was also under conditions of high wind speed and low ambient temperature (Table 1). For all measures of heat production, the scale of <b>the</b> burn had <b>only</b> a minor influence, with larger burns producing slightly higher peak temperature and slightly lower heat duration and dosage than small burns (Table 2).|$|R
60|$|But {{all such}} trades {{as can be}} {{rendered}} decent the aristocracy has adopted one by one.

40|$|I am not {{the right}} person to have been {{assigned}} the topic, “Thinking about the Future. ” I am a presentologist, not a futurologist. So much time is currently spent in worrying about the future that the present is allowed to go to hell. Unless we correct some of the world’s current systemic deficiencies now, the future is condemned to be as disappointing as the present. My preoccupation is with where we would ideally like to be right now. Knowing this, we can act now so as constantly to reduce the gap between where we are and where we want to be. Then, to a large extent, the future is created by what we do now. Now is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> in which <b>we</b> can act. I have found widespread agreement among governmental and organizational executives that their current state is more a product of what their organizations did in the past than a product of what was done to them.

40|$|In the {{philosophy}} of time, the neo-positivist is focussed above all else on sustaining the view called the static theory of time, as the very foundation of their scientific metaphysics. This is the deeply held metaphysical conviction of almost all ‘modern philosophical-scientific’ writers on time. In fact it is hardly {{too much to say}} that the entire official modern 20 th Century philosophy of physics rests {{on the assumption that the}} static theory of space-time is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> concept of <b>time</b> <b>we</b> can use in physics. The static theory of time prescribes the representational space for physics as being logically based on space-time – to the point physicists are incapable of conceiving a theory without space-time any longer, and mutter superstitiously among themselves if someone suggests such a thing. By extension, this space-time provides the representation of all reality for the modern scientific materialists, since they believe that everything ultimately reduces to physics. This agenda simultaneously requires discrediting the alternative concept of time flow and the associated traditional metaphysical concepts that it supports. This Chapter explains the concept of time flow and contrasts it with the static or block universe theory as a genuine and natural alternative for a physical ontology...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A {{positive}} {{focus on}} <b>the</b> present, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> zone which <b>we</b> experience directly and permanently, {{is at least}} as relevant as perspectives on the past and future in a balanced time perspective and its relation to wellbeing. Yet, few instruments examining a positive present time perspective exist. Two present-directed concepts, mindfulness and flow, that are intrinsically linked to mental wellbeing were analyzed and used to formulate a present-eudaimonic scale that complements the past and future scales of the balanced time perspective scale. The present study addresses the psychometric properties of the present-eudaimonic scale and the modified balanced time perspective scale. Method: 131 participants filled out the present-eudaimonic scale, the balanced time perspective scale, the Zimbardo time perspective inventory, the five facet mindfulness questionnaire – short form, the Swedish flow proneness questionnaire and the mental health continuum – short form. Balanced time perspective was operationalized using the deviation from a balanced time perspective coefficient. Results: The present-eudaimonic scale showed good psychometric properties including internal consistency, factor structure, and convergent validity. The present-eudaimonic scale explained an additional eleven percent of variance in mental health beyond the other time perspective scales. Balanced time perspective as measured with the modified balanced time perspective scale correlated significantly stronger with mental health than balanced time perspective measured with the Zimbardo time perspective inventory. Conclusions: The present-eudaimonic scale fills a gap in the assessment of time perspective and the modified balanced time perspective scale is a promising way to study balanced time perspective...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> {{in which}} <b>we</b> can act is the future; the {{consciousness}} of the centrality of futures’ study within our discipline has been slow to grow in a scientific and systematic manner. The current strength of the international scientific debate about the study of the future, and Anticipation Studies in particular, allows us to meet this important area of concern with many other disciplines involved in the dimension of time yet to come. Sociology, psychology, anthropology, technology, economy, art, can become sources of practices and useful tools to improve the awareness and investigation on possible futures, for their construction and their narration. This document presents a series of reasoning related to the future that we have named Advanced Design approach. This specific field of study is developed around four main thematic strands: the projection into the far future (long-term), typical of some complex areas such as the automotive sector; the very eccentric and distant spatial or sectorial speculation, that we call extreme design; the contribution of design to continuous innovation processes that neglects the actual speed of need for innovation; and finally the problem finding or the idea that evermore frequently - in the lack of a clear demanding system capable of guiding and filtering the design work - the project brief is generated without client by the designer him-herself. Within the modifications of the value chain, inside a turbulent and indefinable field as that formed by the contemporary markets and the social changes taking place, here is the Advance Design that, contextualized in the Fuzzy Front End of Innovation (FFEI), represents the contribution that design cultures can develop to renew confidence in the resolute production of design activity...|$|R
