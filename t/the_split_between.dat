5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{molecular}} {{study of}} the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period (35–30 million years ago), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil albatrosses were found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early Oligocene of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina. Similar to the last was Plotornis, formerly often considered a petrel but now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri, both being mid-Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California. These show that <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 mya. Similar fossil finds in the Southern Hemisphere put <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the sooties and mollymawks at 10 mya.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognition}} of pneumatic foramina in Majungasaurus, besides providing {{an understanding of}} its respiratory biology, also has larger-scale implications for evolutionary biology. <b>The</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the ceratosaur line, which led to Majungasaurus, and the tetanuran line, to which birds belong, occurred {{very early in the}} history of theropods. The avian respiratory system, present in both lines, must therefore have evolved before the split, and well before the evolution of birds themselves. This provides further evidence of the dinosaurian origin of birds.|$|E
40|$|In {{short period}} pseudodirect GaAs/AlAs superlattices, the two {{radiative}} heavy exciton states exhibit {{a very small}} anisotropic splitting due to their coupling with light exciton states. They are dipole-active along the [110] and [1 (- 1) 0] directions in the layer plane. <b>The</b> <b>splitting</b> energy (a few µeV) is obtained from {{the period of the}} quantum beats between the two sublevels observed during the time decay of photoluminescence under excitation with light linearly polarized along [101] or circularly polarized. We report here on the variation of the quantum beats in a magnetic field. In a longitudinal field (parallel to the wave vector of light), we measure <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> radiative states and obtain the hole longitudinal g-factor. In a transverse field, we observe two periods for the quantum beats. One corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> radiative states and the other to <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> radiative states and the non-radiative ones which become optically allowed in a transverse field. We also discuss the influence of the coupling to light excitons in a transverse field on the hole transverse g-factor...|$|R

5|$|Tuatara, {{along with}} other, now extinct {{members of the}} order Sphenodontia, belong to the {{superorder}} Lepidosauria, the only surviving taxon within Lepidosauromorpha. Squamates and tuatara both show caudal autotomy (loss of the tail-tip when threatened), and have transverse cloacal slits. The origin of the tuatara probably lies close to <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the Lepidosauromorpha and the Archosauromorpha. Though tuatara resemble lizards, the similarity is superficial, because the family has several characteristics unique among reptiles. The typical lizard shape is very common for the early amniotes; the oldest known fossil of a reptile, the Hylonomus, resembles a modern lizard.|$|E

5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a marbled newt, {{shows that the}} genus already existed {{at that time and}} contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the crested and marbled newts and their sister genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and marbled newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} spectrum of the light scattered by anisotropy fluctuations is studied in liquids (salol and benzophenone). Two branches are observed in the {{temperature dependence}} of <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> components of the doublet induced by shear waves. There is a low temperature branch, in which <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> compoments decreases when temperature increases, {{and there is a}} high temperature branch, in which this splitting decreases when temperature decreases. In the Rayleigh line wing of the liquids that were studied one can distinguish two lorentzians the width of which differed by two orders. Two relaxation times and their temperature dependence are defined from these data. With the use of these measurements and data of the temperature dependence of an other parameter it is shown that Rytov's theory with two times of anisotropy relaxation describes very well the temperature behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> <b>between</b> components of Rayleigh wing fine structure. The gain of stimulated Rayleigh line wing light scattering is measured as well. The phenomenon of stimulated temperature light scattering due to an electrocalorical effect is observed in the liquids that were studied...|$|R

5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. <b>The</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> Phaner {{and the rest of the}} cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E
5|$|Approaching I-96 {{from the}} south, the freeway passes {{east of the}} DeltaPlex Arena, and it median widens further {{across the river from}} Comstock Riverside Park in Walker. An extra lane is added on the left, {{widening}} the freeway to four lanes. Unsigned I-296 occupies the left two lanes that form the left exit for I-96 from US131. At <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> I-296 and US131, I-296 curves northwest, and US131 curves northeast to follow a bend in the Grand River. Once I-296 diverges from US131, the highway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation and passes over West River Drive. To the northwest of these crossings, exits emerge on the right for eastbound I-96 and the left for northbound M-37 (Alpine Avenue). Past these exits, I-296 merges into westbound I-96 and terminates. Southbound unsigned I-296 begins where the ramps to US131 southbound split from eastbound I-96 at the Alpine Avenue overpass, merging with southbound US131 north of Ann Street.|$|E
5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no {{more recent}} than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups {{are found in the}} early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.|$|E

5|$|Woese {{used his}} new rRNA {{comparison}} method to categorize and contrast different organisms. He sequenced {{a variety of}} different species and happened upon a group of methanogens that had vastly different patterns than any known prokaryotes or eukaryotes. These methanogens were much more similar to each other than they were to other organisms sequenced, leading Woese to propose the new domain of Archaea. His experiments showed that the Archaea were more similar to eukaryotes than prokaryotes, even though they were more similar to prokaryotes in structure. This led to the conclusion that Archaea and Eukarya shared a more recent common ancestor than Eukarya and Bacteria in general. The development of the nucleus occurred after <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> Bacteria and this common ancestor. Although Archaea are prokaryotic, they are more closely related to Eukarya and thus cannot be placed within either the Bacteria or Eukarya domains.|$|E
5|$|According to Nađ, <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the Partisans and the Chetniks in Bosanska Krajina {{and central}} Bosnia began on 14December 1941 {{in the village}} of Javorani. Lazar Tešanović, the schoolteacher in Javorani, {{influenced}} members of the local Partisan unit to join the Chetnik side. Tešanović then organised a Chetnik unit of about 70 to 80 men, and at the beginning of March 1942 he and his men were {{in the village of}} Lipovac. On 5March, Stojanović, Nađ, and Danko Mitrov (the commander of the 4th Krajina Detachment) set out for Lipovac with the Kozara Proletarian Company, an assault unit formed in February 1942. According to some sources, they went to Lipovac for pre-arranged negotiations with Tešanović, while other sources state that they intended to disarm Tešanović and his Chetniks. When the column of the Partisans approached the school in Lipovac, they were ambushed by Chetniks, and Stojanović was severely wounded in the head. The Partisans remained pinned down by Chetnik fire until evening; thirteen were killed and eight beside Stojanović were wounded. At nightfall, he and the other wounded were transported to the Partisan field hospital in Jošavka.|$|E

5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E
5|$|Early plans also {{included}} a northsouth freeway {{on each side of}} the Los Angeles Central Business District, splitting at the merge of the Harbor Parkway (Harbor Freeway) and Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, and rejoining at <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> the Arroyo Seco Parkway (Pasadena Freeway) and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. Initially known as the East By-Pass and West By-Pass, the latter later became part of the Harbor Parkway, while the former remained as a separate route roughly along Main Street. The state legislature added the East By-Pass to the state highway system in 1947 as Route 222. The Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved a revised master plan in mid-1955, based on various studied that had been made. A new Industrial Freeway replaced the Terminal Island Freeway and Alamitos Parkway between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles, where it then continued north along the former East By-Pass (which was not kept south of the Santa Monica Freeway) and the southern part of the Riverside Parkway to the interchange of the Glendale Freeway and Golden State Freeway (which had replaced the rest of the Riverside Parkway). The Industrial Freeway south of the Santa Monica Freeway became Route 270 in 1959, but the ex-Riverside Parkway piece north of the Arroyo Seco Parkway never became a state highway.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is {{currently}} {{one of four}} living species in the genus Triaenops; a 2009 revision by Petr Benda and Peter Vallo split off the African T.afer and the Yemeni T.parvus from T.persicus and removed three other species, including two from Madagascar, to the separate genus Paratriaenops. An extinct species, Triaenops goodmani, is known from northwestern Madagascar. In 2007 and 2008, Amy Russell and colleagues used phylogenetic and coalescent methodologies to investigate {{the history of the}} Triaenops group. They found that T.menamena (as T.rufus) was closest to mainland African Triaenops (but did not study Middle Eastern bats) and concluded that T.menamena and the species of Paratriaenops (then still placed in Triaenops) independently reached Madagascar from Africa; the colonization of the island by T.menamena was dated to about 660,000 years ago. Benda and Vallo also studied phylogenetic relationships in Triaenops and included Middle Eastern T.persicus and T.parvus in their analysis. They found little resolution of relationships within Triaenops, but some evidence suggested that T.menamena is more closely related to the Middle Eastern species than to T.afer in mainland Africa; therefore, T.menamena may have reached Madagascar from the Middle East or northeastern Africa. They also placed <b>the</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> T.menamena and the other species much further back, at around 4 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins and}} {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between the}} three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated. A molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are {{more closely related to}} each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fishes. This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split. Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl-origin hypothesis is more credible than other theories. The neobatrachians seemed to have originated in Africa/India, the salamanders in East Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea. Other researchers, while agreeing with the main thrust of this study, questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data. They proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the Permian, rather less than 300 million years ago, a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data. A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological, as well as molecular data, {{came to the conclusion that}} Lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within Lepospondyli rather than within Temnospondyli. The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late Carboniferous, some 290 to 305 million years ago. <b>The</b> <b>split</b> <b>between</b> Anura and Caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.|$|E
