500|$|When Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{ends up in}} a coma on life support, Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) makes Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{the interim}} {{regional}} manager before they find a proper replacement, much to Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) chagrin, as the office had actually functioned very smoothly during the manager hiatus. As Jim notes, everyone showed up, worked for the day with reasonable breaks, and were highly productive. Once appointed, Dwight establishes a strict management style {{in stark contrast to}} their previously relaxed style, from making the employees say the Pledge of Allegiance to setting up firewalls and long passwords to use the office's various machines and installing antique punch clocks. Jim, who had turned down the temporary manager position believing that they should not be assigned one at all, is especially unhappy with the changes, and begins pranking Dwight by suggesting that he is leading an uprising called [...] "The Fist". In order to impress Jo, Dwight buys a gun, though he is more excited when he receives a holster as a gift from a relative, and uses the gun to accessorize. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) insists that he put it away, but Dwight accidentally fires the gun right by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), causing him <b>temporary</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Dwight attempts to bribe the office workers into silence with various favors, and Jim insists that Dwight do outlandish things (such as saying [...] "Shagedelic, baby") at certain promptings.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{following}} study is to study experimentally {{the differences in the}} amount hearing decreases after listening to loud noise. In the past, researchers have suggested that men and women as well as left and right ears experience differing amounts of <b>temporary</b> <b>hear</b> <b>loss,</b> called <b>temporary</b> threshold shift (TTS). Careful selection of twenty subjects was made to ensure all were normal hearing with healthy ears. Each subject’s hearing was tested at all frequencies and recorded. Subjects randomly drew instructions assigning them to either a left or right ear group. All subjects listened to a broad-band static-like loud noise through headphones for a total of four hours. After each hour, hearing was rechecked at one frequency in the ear that was originally assigned to each individual. The change in hearing, or TTS, was found by subtracting the hearing level before listening from the hearing level after four hours of listening. The data were analyze to assess the statistical significance of the change in hearing between men and women, and right and left ears, and the time of testing. The results did not indicate significant changes between gender and ear. The factor of time of listening was found to be significant. Advisor: T. Newell Decke...|$|R
40|$|Children with permanent, minimal-mild, {{bilateral}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{have been}} shown to exhibit a number of difficulties in language, academics, and social domains. Permanent <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is a form of auditory deprivation, which can cause significant deviations of organization and function in the auditory areas of the brainstem and brain. A paucity of data exists documenting the effects of permanent mild levels of auditory deprivation on the central auditory nervous system (CANS). <b>Temporary</b> mild <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in childhood has been shown to cause dysfunction in the processing of sound by the CANS. Given that <b>temporary</b> mild <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can cause CANS dysfunction, auditory deprivation caused by bilateral mild permanent <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in children may also lead to dysfunction of the CANS, resulting in disordered central processing of sound. This disordered sound processing, when coupled with reduced audibility due to the mild <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> {{may be related to the}} academic, language, and social deficits experienced by this population. ^ This study utilized behavioral and electrophysiological measures to evaluate CANS function in ten children with previously diagnosed permanent, bilateral, minimal-mild <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and ten age-matched, gender-matched normal hearing peers. A teacher questionnaire pertaining to school functioning was used to examine the relationship between central auditory function and school performance. ^ Results indicated that while no significant differences were present in mean scores between groups on behavioral and electrophysiological indices, significant differences did exist in the amount of children classified as 2 ̆ 7 disordered 2 ̆ 7 using clinical criteria, normative data, and electrophysiological asymmetries. Additionally, children in the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> group were rated significantly more poorly by their teachers in the areas of academics and communication, when compared to children in the normal hearing group. Teacher ratings of school function were strongly correlated to one measure of central auditory function, and this central auditory measure was also a significant predictor of teacher ratings in the areas of academics and communication. ^ Overall, children in this study with permanent, minimal-mild <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> did show signs of central auditory dysfunction on the tests utilized, and their central auditory abilities were related to how they performed and communicated in the classroom environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective(s) : Noise-induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (NIHL) is {{the major}} cause of {{acquired}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>   Celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibitor, is a non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) with known antioxidant and antineoplastic activity. Therefore, we monitored the extent of temporary noise- induced threshold shifts (TTS) and cochlear damage caused by high level 4 - kHz noise exposure to verify the differences with those pretreated with celecoxib. Materials and Methods: Ten male albino guinea pigs (300 - 350 g in weight) were randomly allocated into two groups: the primal group was exposed to 4 - kHz octave band noise at 102 dB SPL for 3 hrs (group 1, n= 5);  the latter pretreated with 50 mg/ kg celecoxib for 3 days, then  exposed to noise (group 2, n= 5).   Before exposure and one hr after noise exposure, threshold shifts were evaluated with auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and finally the animals were euthanized for histological evaluation.   Results: Comparing the threshold shifts before/after noise exposure with those pretreated, {{we found out that}} TTS caused by noise exposure did not show significant mitigation by celecoxib.   By observing the organ of Corti at lower middle turn of cochlea in celecoxib pretreated group, considerable hair cell loss was discovered.

50|$|When {{exposed to}} noise, the human ear's {{sensitivity}} to sound is decreased, corresponding {{to an increase}} in the threshold of hearing. This shift is usually temporary but may become permanent. A natural physiological reaction to these threshold shifts is vasoconstriction, which will reduce the amount of blood reaching the hair cells of the organ of Corti in the cochlea. With the resultant oxygen tension and diminished blood supply reaching the outer hair cells, their response to sound levels is lessened when exposed to loud sounds, rendering them less effective and putting more stress on the inner hair cells. This can lead to fatigue and <b>temporary</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> if the outer hair cells do not get the opportunity to recover through periods of silence. If these cells do not get this chance to recover, they are vulnerable to death.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a young girl in whom transient deafness occurred when her core body temperature rose. Methods: The patient was referred for a series of audiological and neurologic evaluations performed over time in both afebrile and febrile states, as well as after a stress test (with a treadmill) in which the body temperature rise simulated the febrile state. Results: The patient was found to have a <b>temporary</b> bilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> but had normal distortion product otoacoustic emissions. Moreover, auditory brain stem responses revealed the absence of neural synchrony when her core body temperature increased. Conclusions: These results are consistent with a temperature-dependent auditory neuropathy, a rare condition in which patients show normal outer hair cell function and abnormal neural function of the eighth cranial nerve. The symptom is reminiscent of Uhthoff's phenomenon, which is described as transient visual loss and is usually observed in multiple sclerosis. This case of temperature-dependent auditory neuropathy is noteworthy because it sheds light on a disorder of which there have been few reports in the literature.
