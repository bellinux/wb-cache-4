The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.|$|E

At a summer camp {{at the age of}} 10, Haydn witnessed a magic show by a Methodist minister who was an amateur magician, and Haydn reportedly stayed up all night <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> he had seen. This became the beginning of a lifelong fascination.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> to {{do about}} K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was {{difficult to deal with}} technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E

According to Witwer, Starkiller's characteristics and personality depended on who he was talking to and what circumstances he is in. Witwer called him [...] "a really interesting guy, speaking of layered characters". Although acting as a villain {{in the beginning of the}} , Blackman has commented how Starkiller is [...] "really just this damaged kid." ...|$|E

He was previously seen in the season two episode [...] "One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish", {{where he is a}} waiter at a Japanese restaurant. It is revealed in this episode that the characters Ned Flanders, Moe Szyslak and Montgomery Burns are left-handed, just like The Simpsons creator Matt Groening. The Simpsons writer George Meyer {{came up with the idea}} of The Leftorium when the creators were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> Ned's failed business would be. The inspiration came from a friend of Meyer's who opened a left-handed store that was quickly forced to close down due to lack of business.|$|E

[...] "I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> {{it would look like}} if it said Around. Suddenly, I said to myself, 'Why am I doing this, anyway?

500|$|In the Dunder Mifflin office, Charles asks Jim (John Krasinski) for a [...] "rundown" [...] of {{his client}} information. Jim {{does not know}} what a rundown is, but is too embarrassed to ask because he has been making such a poor {{impression}} with Charles. Jim spends much of the day <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> a rundown is, making several failed attempts to figure it out by chatting vaguely about it with Charles and other coworkers. When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles does not look at it and simply asks Jim to fax it to everyone on the distribution list.

500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club was {{generally}} {{favorable to the}} episode, giving it a B+. He wrote, [...] "Much like Fringe fan favorite 'The Arrival' (not a favorite of mine, sorry to say), 'The Dreamscape' is an episode more involved with insinuation and mythology-building than with telling a complete-in-one story. But perhaps because I've come to trust Fringe more over its recent run of entertaining episodes, I enjoyed it fairly well, and found myself <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> kind of thematic connections I could make using {{the notion of the}} body reacting to mere thoughts." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.8/10, explaining that it [...] "certainly moves in the right direction". Fickett found the [...] "coolest moment" [...] to be when Olivia witnesses John Scott's memory, and he also appreciated Peter's backstory ("It's more than Peter usually gets, but what we know isn't much and isn't very exciting."). Fickett criticized Olivia however for leaving the man at the hospital unsuitably protected.|$|E
500|$|McIlrath {{wrote the}} video treatment, and remarked how the band at first {{had no idea}} {{what they wanted to do}} for the video due to the song's unique sound. McIlrath did know that since [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] has simple lyrics, he wanted the video to {{replicate}} the song's easygoing feel. The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only a few months after the song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts. Looking back on the video, McIlrath said: [...] "Parts of it are kind of cheesy...but it captured where I was at when that song was written - it was written when I was living in a house with four roommates in a bedroom and we were all just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> to do with our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{was written}} by Aaron Shure and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. Shure {{said there was a}} great deal of debate among the writers about Pam's decision to leave Dunder Mifflin with Michael, but they decided to move in that direction to demonstrate Pam was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> she wants in life. Lieberstein thought of the idea of the final scene in which Michael and Pam's faces go from optimism to concern, because he felt it would anchor the episode. The decision to have Charles choose Stanley as productivity czar and Kevin as receptionist was made by Shure the day before the episode's draft was handed in because he wanted to have Charles make [...] "rookie mistakes, despite all his poise." [...] "Two Weeks" [...] was the second of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba said he did not watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." ...|$|E

500|$|Orci came up {{with the}} idea to start the episode in a church's confessional, while the ambered scene on the bus was {{originally}} scripted to take place on a subway; one of the writers felt the bus [...] "let you see more of the city". Early in the show's creation the writers were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> Fringe could be, and ultimately chose [...] "big crazy event" [...] at the start of each episode that would catapult its plot and drive its characters. They felt the bus scene essentially achieved this. When creating the scene on the bus when the gas canister is released, the crew sat on a bus that was really driving through the streets of New York City; director Frederick Toye called the shooting [...] "Student film style, run and gun". To shoot the three scenes of the bus in the tunnel, the crew looked at a variety of locations before choosing a tunnel near the United Nations headquarters on the east side of Manhattan. As it was a busy area, they had to shoot at night and then attempt to make it appear to be daytime, as the scenes were set during the day. They had a limited schedule to shoot all three scenes, and despite never having seen the tunnel before, the production crews had 8–9 hours to quickly set up the massive set and leave enough time to shoot the scenes before dawn approached. To simulate being encased in amber, the actors had to pretend they were frozen.|$|E
500|$|Seth Gordon {{confirmed}} in July 2011 that talks were underway for a sequel, after the financial {{success of the}} film in the United States, saying: [...] "Yeah, we've definitely discussed it. It's done well in the States, the film has, so that's becoming a more concerted effort now, we're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> the sequel could be." [...] On January 4, 2012, {{it was confirmed that}} a sequel was moving forward, and that Goldstein and Daley would be returning to write the script. New Line was reported to be negotiating with Gordon to return as director, with Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis also expected to return to their roles. On February 27, 2012, it was confirmed that Goldstein and Daley {{were in the process of}} writing the new script. In March 2013, Goldstein and Daley confirmed that they had submitted multiple draft scripts for the sequel, and that production had moved towards finalizing the budget. Later in the same month Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis were confirmed to be reprising their roles, with Foxx negotiating to return. The film will again be produced by Brett Ratner and Jay Stern. In August 2013, it was announced that Gordon would not be returning to direct because of scheduling conflicts and that the studio was actively searching for a replacement. In September 2013, Sean Anders was announced as Gordon's replacement, with John Morris joining the production as a producer. The pair had previously performed a rewrite on Goldstein's and Daley's sequel script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in summer 2013, but began in November 2013. Foxx, Jennifer Aniston, and Kevin Spacey reprised their roles, with Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine joining the cast.|$|E

The show attracted 254,000 viewers {{for its first}} episode broadcast on 11 January 2011. This was half the number of viewers that watched it on Network Ten; the Herald Sun reported {{that it was a}} good result as [...] "bosses were only expecting 133,000." [...] Neighbours became Eleven's most-watched show and the third highest rating show on digital multichannels that night.

2500|$|It {{has become}} popular for hearing parents to teach signs (from ASL {{or some other}} sign language) to young hearing children. [...] Since the muscles in babies' hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs can be a {{beneficial}} option for better communication. [...] Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak. [...] This reduces the confusion between parents when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> their child wants. [...] When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.|$|E
