25|$|Currently <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> {{showing that}} {{lanthanides}} elements {{can be used}} as anticancer agents. The main role of the lanthanides in these studies is to inhibit proliferation of the cancer cells. Specifically cerium and lanthanum have been studied for their role as anti-cancer agents.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> into {{identifying}} ferns, some {{of which}} have grown in the hall since the early 1980s when the roof of the west wing collapsed. The ferns include Osmundastrum cinnamomeum, Ostrich fern, Blechnum nudum and Dryopteris filix-mas with more to be identified.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> that {{indicates}} that intensive teaching (including practice outside of therapy sessions) can improve young children's ability to use semantic compaction accurately. A case study of a 3-year-old girl with cerebral palsy revealed that intensive, systematic training involving the client, family members, therapists, and educational teams can {{make it possible to}} achieve marked progress in early language skills while learning and using a Minspeak device. Learnability of Minspeak systems may heavily depend on the quaility of its teaching and how often it is used with a specific child.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> {{evidence}} that the digit ratio {{of the length of}} the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and ring finger) is somewhat negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long ring finger) towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.|$|E

50|$|Radiotherapists {{are well}} aware of {{possible}} pulmonary toxicity, and take a number of precautions to minimise the incidence of this side effect. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>research</b> efforts to possibly eliminate this side effect in the future.|$|R

25|$|Most {{children}} who have their clefts repaired early enough are {{able to have a}} happy youth and social life. Having a cleft palate/lip does not inevitably lead to a psychosocial problem. However, adolescents with cleft palate/lip are at an elevated risk for developing psychosocial problems especially those relating to self-concept, peer relationships and appearance. Adolescents may face psychosocial challenges but can find professional help if problems arise. A cleft palate/lip may impact an individual’s self-esteem, social skills and behavior. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> dedicated to the psychosocial development of individuals with cleft palate. Self-concept may be adversely affected by the presence of a cleft lip or cleft palate, particularly among girls.|$|E
500|$|Before the First Fleet {{arrived at}} Port Jackson in 1788, {{what is now}} known as Summer Hill {{was part of a larger}} area [...] where people of the Wangal and Cadigal nations lived. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> to show in the greater Sydney region 8000 - 10000 Aboriginal people were resident, {{fluctuating}} on seasons and during tribal conflicts. What is now called the Hawthorne Canal (originally Long Cove Creek) appears to have been the boundary between the Cadigal and Wangal Aboriginal nations. Today there is a small park in Summer Hill, called Cadigal Reserve, located at 1-4 Grosvenor Crescent. A bronze plaque placed by Ashfield Council names the reserve after the Cadigal (Eora) group of Koori people. Iron Cove and the mangrove-lined estuaries of the Long Cove and Iron Cove Creeks would have provided a good source of fish and molluscs, the most common food of the coastal tribes in the Sydney Basin.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the study}} from Old Dominion University, the authors state the {{importance}} of research in this area. [...] "Given the centrality of body image in clinical and subclinical eating disturbances that are so prevalent among women, research on gender and body image has substantial importance." [...] Even though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> being done, {{there is still much}} more work to be done to help individuals who struggle with their body image.|$|E

2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> which {{demonstrates}} examiners {{are unable}} to measure craniosacral motion reliably, as indicated {{by a lack of}} inter-rater agreement among examiners. The authors of this research conclude this [...] "measurement error may be sufficiently large to render many clinical decisions potentially erroneous". Alternative medicine practitioners have interpreted this result as a product of entrainment between patient and practitioner, a principle which lacks scientific support. Whether craniosacral motion can be reliably palpated remains a subject of debate with studies producing mixed results.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{results are}} mixed {{as to whether}} bad weather affects turnout. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> that shows that bad weather can reduce turnout. A 2016 study, however, found no {{evidence}} that weather disruptions reduce turnout. A 2011 study found [...] "that while rain decreases turnout on average, it does not do so in competitive elections." [...] The season and the day of the week (although many nations hold all their elections on the same weekday) can also affect turnout. Weekend and summer elections find more of the population on holiday or uninterested in politics, and have lower turnouts. When nations set fixed election dates, these are usually midweek during the spring or autumn to maximize turnout. Variations in turnout between elections tend to be insignificant. It is extremely rare for factors such as competitiveness, weather, and time of year to cause an increase or decrease in turnout of more than five percentage points, far smaller than the differences between groups within society, and far smaller than turnout differentials between nations.|$|E
2500|$|... "Mommy Track" [...] is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} women who simply disregard their career and professional duties {{in order to satisfy}} the needs of their families. Women are often subject to long work hours that creates an imbalance within the work-family schedule. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>research</b> suggesting that women were able to function on a part-time professional schedule compared to others who worked full-time while still engaged in external family activities. The research also suggests, flexible work arrangements allow for the achievement of a healthy work and family balance. A difference has also been discovered in the cost and amount of effort in childbearing amongst women in higher skilled positions and roles, as opposed to women in lower-skilled jobs. This difference leads to women delaying and postponing goals and career aspirations over a number of years. A large number of women across the country who have vocational/professional certifications and degrees {{have been found to be}} not a part of the working force at the estimated rate more than twice times as male counterparts. Also, the Deloitte Touche, a professional hiring service firm, confirmed that they had recorded dropout rates in each entering class of hires and reported that indeed women's rates were very high compared to males due to mother- and family-related responsibilities.|$|E
