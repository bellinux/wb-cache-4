5|$|In the Nescopeck Creek watershed, {{pitch pine}} – scrub oak forests occur on Arbutus Peak and several barren {{areas in the}} {{southern}} part of watershed. In this type of forest, pitch pine, scrub oak, black oak and chestnut oak are the main trees. Bracken fern, <b>teaberry,</b> black chokeberry, blueberry, and huckleberry are the most common shrubs in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include <b>teaberry,</b> sphagnum moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} habitat in the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the dry-oak mixed forest. Common trees in this habitat include northern red oak, white oak, and chestnut oak. This habitat also contains gray and black birch trees. Pine, hemlock, and {{some types of}} oak trees are found on the higher parts of this habitat. Lower to the ground are huckleberry, <b>teaberry,</b> blueberry, and hawthorn and other plants. The wildflowers in this habitat include wild onion and wild strawberries.|$|E

"In those days--I don't {{know how}} it is now--Pascalville was the {{greatest}} place for <b>teaberries.</b> They used them as a flavor for candy, ice-cream, puddings, cakes, and I don't know what else. They made summer drinks of it, and it was used as a perfume for home-made hair-washes and tooth-powder. So Judith and I and a girl named Dorcas Stone, who was a friend of ours, went to work gathering <b>teaberries</b> in the woods. We worked early and late, and got enough to trade off at the store for the ten yards of chintz with which that gown is made.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I said before, the Pacewalks were poor, and {{although}} they lived well enough, money was scarce with them, and it was seldom {{that they were able}} to spend any of it for clothes. But about this time Judith came to me--I was visiting them at the time--and talked a little about herself, which was uncommon. She said that if she went to Matthias' fine new house, and sat at the head of his table,--and of course that would be her place there, as it was at her mother's table,--she thought that she ought to dress better than she did. 'I do not mean,' she said, 'that I want any fine clothes for company; but I ought to have something neat and proper for everyday wear, and I want you to help me to think of some way to buy it.' So we talked the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best way to do was to try to gather <b>teaberries</b> enough to pay for the material for a chintz gown.|$|R

Wagstaff describes local cuisine as [...] "very British in character with much use made of the homegrown vegetables, local lamb, mutton, beef, and fish". Common between meals are [...] "home made cakes and biscuits with tea or coffee".

2500|$|Alpert's style {{achieved}} enormous {{popularity with}} the national exposure The Clark Gum Company gave {{to one of his}} recordings in 1964, a Sol Lake number titled [...] "The Mexican Shuffle" [...] (which was retitled [...] "The <b>Teaberry</b> Shuffle" [...] for the television advertisements). In 1965, Alpert released two albums, Whipped Cream & Other Delights and Going Places. Whipped Cream sold over 6 million copies in the United States. The album cover featured model Dolores Erickson wearing only what appeared to be whipped cream. In reality, Erickson was wearing a white blanket over which were scattered artfully placed daubs of shaving cream—real whipped cream would have melted under the heat of the studio lights (although the cream on her finger was real). In concerts, when about to play the song, Alpert would tell the audience, [...] "Sorry, we can't play the cover for you." [...] The art was parodied by several groups including one-time A band Soul Asylum and by comedian Pat Cooper for his album Spaghetti Sauce and Other Delights. The singles included the title cut, [...] "Lollipops and Roses", and [...] "A Taste of Honey". The latter won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Going Places produced four more singles: [...] "Tijuana Taxi", [...] "Spanish Flea", [...] "Third Man Theme", and [...] "Zorba the Greek". [...] "Tijuana Taxi" [...] and [...] "Spanish Flea" [...] would be used in the 1966 Academy Award-winning animated short A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature.|$|E
60|$|As {{she reached}} {{the door of the}} house, Cicely Drane was coming out. Involuntarily Miriam threw her arms around her and folded her close to the <b>teaberry</b> gown.|$|E
60|$|She had {{intended}} to find Ralph, and speak to him about Mike's sister; but now she changed her mind. She was wearing the <b>teaberry</b> gown, and she would attend to her own affairs as mistress of the house. If Ralph could be so cruel as to marry Dora, and put her {{at the head of}} everything,--and if she were here at all, she would want to be at the head of everything,--then she, Miriam, would take off the <b>teaberry</b> gown, and lock it up in the old trunk.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} Miriam and Ralph jogged into Thorbury. Miriam, not wearing the <b>teaberry</b> gown, but having its spirit upon her, {{had planned to}} inquire of the grocer with whom she dealt, where she might find a woman such as she needed, but Ralph did not favor this.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am ever {{so glad to}} {{hear that}} story, Miss Panney," [...] she said, [...] "and as that <b>teaberry</b> gown should have been worn by the {{mistress}} of Cobhurst, I intend to wear it myself, every day, as long as it lasts, and if it does not fit me, I can alter it." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>teaberry</b> gown was {{too long}} for Miriam, and too large in every way. She knew that for herself; but hearing Ralph's {{footsteps}} outside, she had a longing {{to know what he}} would say on the subject, so, holding up her skirt to keep herself from tripping, she ran downstairs and called him into the big hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I truly believe," [...] said Miriam to herself, and {{a slight}} flush came on her face, [...] "that {{if she could have}} done it, she would have liked to stay here a week, and wear the <b>teaberry</b> gown all the time and direct everything,--although, of course, I would never have allowed that." [...] With a little {{contraction}} of the brows, she went into the hall, where she heard her brother's step.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Miriam, [...] "because it is a secret; but it {{is nearly}} finished, and as I shall {{have to tell you}} about it very soon, I may as well do it now: I have been {{altering}} Judith Pacewalk's <b>teaberry</b> gown for Cicely. It was altered once for me, and that makes it all the harder to make it fit her now. I am not very good at that sort of thing, and so it has taken me a long time. I expected to have it ready for her when she came back from the wedding trip, but I could not do it. I shall finish it to-day, however, and to-morrow I am going to invest her with it. She is now the head of the house, and it is she who should wear the <b>teaberry</b> gown. Don't tell her, please, until to-morrow; I thought {{it would be nice to}} have a little ceremony about it, and in that case I shall have to have some one to help me." ...|$|E

60|$|Cicely {{appeared}} in the <b>teaberry</b> gown, and if the spirit of Judith Pacewalk hovered o'er the scene, and allowed its gaze to wander from the charming bride, over the happy faces {{of the rest of}} the company, to the half-open door of the dining-room, where shone the radiant face of the proudest cook in the world, it must have been as well satisfied with the fate of the pink garment as it could possibly expect to be.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will see}} Mike before I go, {{and send him}} for Molly Tooney. Molly is a good enough woman, and if I send for her, she will come to you until you have suited yourselves with servants. And now, my dear child, {{where did you find}} that gay dress? Upstairs in some old trunk, I suppose. Stand over there and let me look at you. It is a good forty years since I have seen that gown. Do you know to whom it used to belong? But of course you do not. It was Judith Pacewalk's <b>teaberry</b> gown." ...|$|E
60|$|For Dora and Ralph to marry, Dora and Miriam {{should be}} the best of friends, so that both brother and sister should desire the alliance, and in {{furtherance}} of this happy result, Miss Panney determined to take Dora away with her. She had been at Cobhurst long enough to produce a desirable impression upon Ralph, and if she stayed longer, there was no knowing what might happen between her and Miriam. Dora, {{as well as the}} other, was high-spirited and young, and it was as likely as not that as she showed an inclination to continue to wear the <b>teaberry</b> gown, there would be a storm in which matrimonial schemes would be washed out of sight.|$|E
60|$|Toward {{the close}} of the afternoon, Miriam went up to her room, and {{spreading}} out on the bed the <b>teaberry</b> gown of Judith Pacewalk, she stood looking at it. She intended to put on that gown and wear it. But it did not fit her. It needed all sorts of alterations, and how to make these she did not know; sewing and its kindred arts had not been taught in the schools to which she had been sent. It is true that Miss Panney had promised to cut and fit this gown for her, but Miriam did not wish Miss Panney {{to have anything to do}} with it. That old lady seemed entirely too willing to have to do with her affairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} so," [...] replied the old lady. [...] "In each barrel are two thimblefuls of powder, and half-a-box of Windfall's <b>Teaberry</b> Tonic Pills, {{each one of}} them as big and as hard as a buckshot. They were brought here by a {{travelling}} agent, who sold some of them to my people; and I tell you, sir, that those pills made them so sick that one man wasn't able to work for two days, and another for three. I vowed if that agent ever came back, I'd shoot his abominable pills into him, and I've kept the gun loaded for the purpose. Was this a pill man? I scarcely think he was a fertilizer, because it is rather late in the season for those bandits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dora," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "I am {{now going}} to drive to Thorbury, {{and it will be}} a great deal better for you to go with me than to wait for your brother, for it may be very late in the day before he can come for you. And more than that, it is ten to one that by this time he has {{forgotten}} all about you, especially if his office is full of clients. So please get yourself ready as soon as possible. And, Miriam, if you will come over to see me some morning, and bring that <b>teaberry</b> gown with you, I will alter it to fit you, and arrange it so that you can do the sewing yourself. It is very appropriate that the little lady of the house should wear that gown." ...|$|E
60|$|After dinner Miriam {{went up to}} her room, where {{upon the}} bed lay Judith Pacewalk's <b>teaberry</b> gown. She took off her own school-girl dress, {{and put on the}} pink gown. It {{was the first time she}} had ever worn the clothes of a woman. When she had attired herself in the silken robe which had been so fatal to the {{fortunes}} and life of Judith Pacewalk, it had been slipped on in masquerade fashion, debased from its high position to a mere protection from spilt milk. Miriam had thought of the purple silk when Miss Panney was telling her story, and had said to herself that if the stall in the cow-stable had been ever so much darker and dirtier, and if the milk stains had been more and bigger, the career of that robe would have ended all the more justly.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you see, my dears, Judith Pacewalk {{never wore}} her <b>teaberry</b> gown, in which, I believe, {{she would have}} been {{mistress}} of Cobhurst. When her mother died, not long afterward, everything they owned went to Matthias and his brother Reuben. The Pacewalk farm was sold, and all the personal property of both brothers, including that disastrous box of bones, was brought here, where it is yet, I suppose; and so, my good young people, I imagine you will not wonder that I was surprised to see that pink gown again, having helped, as I did, with every seam, pleat, and gather of it. If you will look at it closely, you will see that there is good work on it, for Judith and I knew how to use our needles a good deal better than most ladies do nowadays." ...|$|E
60|$|Miriam, attired in her <b>teaberry</b> gown, came up {{from the}} Cobhurst kitchen, and walked out toward the garden. She was not in good spirits. She had already found that La Fleur was a woman {{superior}} to influences from any power derived from the wearing of Judith Pacewalk's pink chintz dress. She was convinced that at this moment that eminent cook was preparing a dinner {{for the benefit of}} the Dranes, without any thought of the tastes or desires of the mistress of the house or its master. And yet she could find nothing to say in opposition to this; consequently, she had walked away unprotesting, and that act was so contrary to her disposition that it saddened her. If she had supposed that a bad meal would be the result of the bland autocracy she had just encountered, she would have been better satisfied; but, as she knew the case would be quite otherwise, her spirits continued to fall. Even the meat, that morning, had been ordered without consultation with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "When he had gone, I went {{straight}} upstairs to Judith, {{and said to}} her, if she knew what was good for her, she would get out that <b>teaberry</b> gown {{and put it on}} for supper, and wear it regularly at meals and at all times when it would be suitable as a house gown. 'I shall do nothing of the sort,' she said; 'I got it to wear when I go to Cobhurst, and I shall keep it until then. If I put it on now, it will be a poor-looking thing by spring.' I told her that was all nonsense, and she could wear that and get another in the spring, but {{she shook her head and}} was not to be moved. Now, I would have been glad enough to give her the stuff to make a new gown, but I had hinted at that sort of thing before, and did not intend to do it again, for she was a good deal prouder than she was poor. Nor could I think of telling her what Matthias had said, for not only was she very sensitive, and would have been hurt that he should have talked to me in that way about her, but she would not have consented to dress herself on purpose to please a man's fancy.|$|E
