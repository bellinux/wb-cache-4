25|$|Toxic {{substances}} and poisons (like atropine) can {{significantly reduce the}} range of aperture.

50|$|Phenylephrine {{is used as}} an eye drop {{to dilate}} the pupil to {{facilitate}} visualization of the retina.

50|$|A {{mydriatic}} is {{an agent}} that induces dilation of the pupil. Drugs such as <b>tropicamide</b> {{are used in}} medicine to permit examination of the retina and other deep structures of the eye, and also to reduce painful ciliary muscle spasm (see cycloplegia). Phenylephrine (e.g. Cyclomydril) is used if strong mydriasis is needed for a surgical intervention. One effect of administration of a mydriatic is intolerance to bright light (photophobia). Purposefully-induced mydriasis via mydriatics is also used as a diagnostic test for Horner's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tropicamide</b> is an {{antimuscarinic drug}} that {{produces}} short acting mydriasis (dilation of the pupil) and cycloplegia when applied as eye drops.

Cycloplegic drops are often also used to treat anterior uveitis, decreasing risk of posterior synechiae and decreasing inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye.|$|E
50|$|Dilated fundus {{examination}} or dilated-pupil fundus examination (DFE) is {{a diagnostic}} procedure that employs {{the use of}} mydriatic eye drops (such as <b>tropicamide)</b> to dilate or enlarge the pupil {{in order to obtain}} a better view of the fundus of the eye. Once the pupil is dilated, examiners use ophthalmoscopy (funduscopy) to view the eye's interior, allowing assessment of the retina, optic nerve head, blood vessels, and other features.

50|$|Hydroxyamphetamine is a {{component}} of two controlled (prescription only), name-brand ophthalmic mydriatics: Paredrine and Paremyd.

Around 1997, Akorn, Inc., obtained the rights to both Paredrine and Paremyd, and in 2002, the company reintroduced Paremyd to the market as a fast acting ophthalmic mydriatic agent.|$|E
5000|$|Mydriasis (pupil dilation, e.g. using <b>tropicamide)</b> may be {{required}} to obtain an image of sufficient quality. [...] Stereoscopy may be used to detect retinal thickening.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} <b>tropicamide</b> 1 % (as a cycloplegic mydriatic) and phenylephrine 10 % (as a noncycloplegic mydriatic) on mydriasis, wavefront refraction, and wavefront aberrations. MethodsIn this prospective study, 31 myopic eyes with a large mesopic pupil size were evaluated with an Allegretto Wave analyzer in a natural dilated state, after instillation of <b>tropicamide</b> 1 % or phenylephrine 10 %. Aberrations expressed as Zernike polynomials up to the sixth order were analyzed. Wavefront refractions were compared with subjective manifest refraction. ResultsBoth <b>tropicamide</b> and phenylephrine cause significant mydriasis (p <  0. 001), but phenylephrine induced a larger pupil size than <b>tropicamide</b> under mesopic conditions (p =  0. 029). Compared with the natural state, <b>tropicamide</b> induced a significant hyperopic shift in wavefront refraction (by + 0. 27  ±  0. 09 D; p =  0. 002). In contrast, wavefront refraction did not significantly change when using phenylephrine as the mydriatic (+ 0. 03  ±  0. 10 D; p =  0. 75). Compared with the subjective manifest refraction, wavefront refraction before mydriatics and after phenylephrine showed a significant myopic shift (p <  0. 0125), whereas the wavefront refraction after <b>tropicamide</b> was {{not significantly different from}} subjective refraction. Zernike coefficient C 4 showed a less positive defocus after application of <b>tropicamide</b> (p =  0. 0017). Other aberration coefficients of Zernike polynomials up to the sixth order did not change significantly from before to after <b>tropicamide</b> application. There {{was no significant difference in}} Zernike coefficients up to C 27 before and after phenylephrine. ConclusionPhenylephrine preserves accommodation and provides a larger pupil under mesopic conditions, whereas <b>tropicamide</b> relaxes accommodation and provides an objective wavefront refraction that is closer to the subjective manifest refraction. Neither phenylephrine nor <b>tropicamide</b> causes a significant change in high-order aberrations from the natural state...|$|E

The literature on <b>tropicamide</b> was searched in PsycInfo and Pubmed databases. Considering the absence of peer-reviewed data, results were integrated with a multilingual qualitative assessment of a range of Web sites, drug fora and other online resources (i. e., e-newsgroups, chat rooms, mailing lists, e-newsletters and bulletin boards) : between January 2012 and January 2013, exploratory qualitative searches of more than 100 Web sites have been carried out in English and Italian using generic and specific keywords such as ???legal highs,??? ???research chemicals,??? ???onlinepharmacy,??? ???<b>tropicamide,???</b> ???mydriacil,??? ???tropicacyl,??? ???visumidriatic,??? ???online pharmacies??? and ???<b>tropicamide</b> recreational abuse??? in the Google search engine. Misuse of <b>tropicamide</b> typically occurs through IV injection; its effects last from 30 min to 6 h, and it is often taken in combination with other psychoactive compounds, most typically alcohol, marijuana and opiates.

40|$|Introduction: The {{quality of}} an intra-ocular {{examination}} depends on adequate pupil dilation (mydriasis). Magnitude of dilation depends on sphincter and dilator muscles of pupil. Most frequently used drugs in ophthalmology for mydriasis are parasympathetic antagonists (<b>Tropicamide),</b> sympathetic agonist (Phenylephrine) and combination of Phenylephrine + <b>Tropicamide.</b> This study was planned {{to evaluate and}} compare onset and degree of mydriasis achieved by the above drugs and to study changes in the same in tobacco addicts. Aim: To evaluate and compare the onset and degree of mydriasis achieved by <b>Tropicamide</b> (1 %), Phenylephrine(10 %), <b>Tropicamide</b> (0. 8 %) +Phenylephrine (5 %) combination. To compare the changes in onset and degree of Mydriasis in tobacco addicts. Materials & Methods:This is a descriptive cross sectional study {{carried out in the}} ophthalmology department of PRH, Loni. Total of 52 patients were enrolled for the study and grouped according to the mydriatics used into Group 1 (n= 25) <b>Tropicamide</b> (1 %),Group 2 (n= 18) Phenylephrine (10 %) Group 3 (n= 20) <b>Tropicamide</b> (0. 8 %) + Phenylephrine (5 %) combination and each group were evaluated for onset and degree of dilatation. Each group was further divided into tobacco and non-tobacco addicts. Results & Conclusion: The combination of <b>Tropicamide</b> (0. 8 %) and Phenylephrine (5 %) have the fastest onset of mydriasis, and achieved the highest dilation in 60 min. as compared to <b>Tropicamide</b> (1 %) and Phenylephrine (10 %) alone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Drug {{abuse is}} rarely {{limited to a}} single substance; polydrug use is the norm rather than the exception. In many cases, the misuse of {{potentially}} psychoactive substances can lead to serious intoxications and results in addictive behavior. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 22 -year-old heroin-addicted woman presented in our clinic reporting a 2 -year history of intravenous injection of an eyedrop solution containing 1 % <b>tropicamide,</b> an antimuscarinic agent. She reported injecting <b>tropicamide</b> because it attenuated symptoms and signs of opiate withdrawal and it also has hallucinogenic and euphorigenic effects. Despite the large amounts (up to 1. 5 g), the rapidity of injection, and the long-term use, <b>tropicamide</b> was relatively well tolerated, without life-threatening consequences. An outpatient detoxification program was performed without any sign or symptom caused by discontinuing <b>tropicamide.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The present case claims a role for pharmacological interactions, in addition to rewarding effects, in influencing drug association in polyabuse pattern. Moreover, this case underlines the need for physicians {{to be aware of}} the potential emergence of <b>tropicamide</b> as a drug of misuse, to prevent further harm.
