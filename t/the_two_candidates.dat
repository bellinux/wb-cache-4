5|$|In January 1950, Douglas opened {{campaign}} headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which {{was seen as}} a signal that she was serious about contesting Downey's seat and would not withdraw from the race. Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates; Douglas, who was not a good debater, declined. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> traded charges via press and radio, with Downey describing Douglas's views as extremist.|$|E
5|$|A {{major issue}} in her initial {{election}} was whether <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> would vote to override President George W. Bush's veto of {{an expansion of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program. Tsongas said she would vote to override, and it was reported Ogonowski would uphold the veto. Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but the vote failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to London from Wallsend, {{he attended a}} full meeting of Labour MPs to decide who would become the Party Chairman. This effectively meant choosing the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, because Labour was the largest opposition party in the House of Commons. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> were Ramsay MacDonald and J. R. Clynes, and Hastings, who supported MacDonald, persuaded six new MPs to support him. MacDonald was elected {{by a margin of}} only five votes, and Hastings later regretted his support.|$|E

5|$|In 1586, {{following}} the death of previous Polish king, Stefan Bathory, the Swedish duke Sigismund III Vasa and Habsburg Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria took part in the election to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne. Each of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> had supporters in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with the two opposing sides gathered around pro-Sigismund Chancellor and Great Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski and the Primate of Poland, Stanisław Karnkowski {{on one side and the}} pro-Maximilain Zborowski family on the other. The rivalry between Zamoyski and the Zborowski family dated years past and tensions during the elections ran high.|$|E
5|$|John McCain was {{nominated}} as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin {{as his running}} mate. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008. On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain. Obama won 52.9% {{of the popular vote}} to McCain's 45.7%. He became the first African American to be elected president. Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's Grant Park.|$|E
5|$|Later sources {{suggest that}} {{perceptions}} of legitimacy {{played a part}} in the arguments, as did the relative age of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates.</b> In time, Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at Kingston upon Thames, most likely in 975. There is evidence that the settlement involved a degree of compromise. Æthelred appears to have been given lands which normally belonged to the king's sons, some of which had been granted by Edgar to Abingdon Abbey and which were forcibly repossessed for Æthelred by the leading nobles.|$|E

5|$|The decisive {{battle between}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> was won by Stephen Báthory at Sânpaul on July 8, 1575. In the same year, {{he was elected}} king of Poland, thus a {{personal}} union was formed {{between the two countries}} that lasted until his death in 1586. He left the administration of the principality first to his brother, Christopher Báthory (15751581), and then to his brother's minor son, Sigismund Báthory (15811602), bestowing on them the title of voivode, while he himself took the title of prince.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E
5|$|Mayoral {{elections}} were originally run under a two-round system. If no candidate received {{a simple majority}} of votes in the general election, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> who received the most votes competed in a second runoff election held several weeks later. In 2002, the election system for city officials was overhauled {{as a result of}} a citywide referendum. The new system, known as instant-runoff voting, allows voters to select and rank three candidates based on their preferences. If no one wins more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and second-choice votes (and third-choice votes, if necessary) are counted until a candidate captures the majority. This eliminates the need to hold a separate runoff election and saves money. This was first implemented in the 2004 Board of Supervisors election after two years of preparation. In 2007, the new system was implemented in the mayoral election for the first time.|$|E

5|$|October 2001 {{polls showed}} Ravalomanana ahead of Ratsiraka. Following the December election, {{official}} results put Ravalomanana in first place, with 46 per cent, against Ratsiraka's 40 per cent; without a majority, a run-off {{would be required}} between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates.</b> Ravalomanana, claiming to have won {{a majority in the}} first round, refused to participate in a run-off, instead demanding that the High Constitutional Court review the votes. Ratsiraka's supporters then blockaded the capital, which Ravalomanana's supporters controlled. Ravalomanana declared himself president on 22 February 2002. After a recount, on 29 April 2002 the High Constitutional Court pronounced Ravalomanana the winner of an absolute majority {{in the first round of}} the election, and he was sworn in on 6 May. Ravalomanana dispatched soldiers to bring pockets of resistance under control, with incidents of unrest continuing until Ratsiraka fled into exile on 5 July 2002 after losing control of most of the country's provinces.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{reports on}} {{election}} night, November 4, were that Coleman was leading by over 700 votes, {{but by the}} official results, certified on November 18, 2008, Coleman led by only 215 votes. As <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> were separated by less than 0.5 {{percent of the votes}} cast, the Minnesota Secretary of State, Mark Ritchie, authorized an automatic recount provided for in Minnesota election law. In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion In the recount. On January 5, 2009, the Minnesota State Canvassing Board certified the recounted vote totals, with Franken ahead by 225 votes.|$|E
5|$|The African Union urged Rajoelina, Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka to {{withdraw}} their controversial candidacies, and the European Union responded by suspended funding to the election. The French government sanctioned all three candidates by revoking their French visas, effectively barring them from French territory, and considered freezing their financial {{and real estate}} assets. Following the suspension of election funding, the HAT again pushed back the election date, citing inadequate financial resources. A special electoral court ruled in August 2013 that the candidatures of Rajoelina, Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka were invalid and that Rajoelina and his two chief rivals would {{not be permitted to}} run in the 2013 election. Rajoelina then announced his endorsement of presidential candidate Hery Rajaonarimampianina, who successfully progressed from the first round voting held 25 October 2013 alongside the candidate backed by Ravalomanana, Jean Louis Robinson. The run-off between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> was held on 20 December 2013. Rajaonarimampianina was declared the winner of the election, and Rajoelina officially stepped down on 25 January 2014.|$|E

5|$|With 100 {{percent of}} precincts reporting, initial counts from the {{election}} had Murphy leading by about 60 votes out of over 150,000 cast. Columbia County's Board of Elections amended its tally the following day, reducing Murphy's lead to 25 votes. The lead alternated between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> throughout early recanvassing; {{at one point}} the New York State Board of Elections had listed the election at a zero-vote margin, with each candidate having exactly 77,225 votes. By April 2, Tedisco was ahead by 12 votes. He resigned the position of Assembly Minority Leader on April 5 in preparation for a transition to Congress, and was replaced by Brian Kolb the following day. On April 7, Tedisco was ahead by 97 votes. The close tally meant that absentee ballots would decide the race.|$|E
5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} number of votes for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's number of votes is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the number of votes for <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> with the highest number of votes. If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest number of votes to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the number of votes cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E
5|$|An Ottoman army {{supported}} by Basarab Țepeluș of Wallachia invaded Transylvania and {{set fire to}} Szászváros (now Orăștie in Romania) in late 1479. Stephen Báthory and Paul Kinizsi annihilated the marauders in the Battle of Breadfield on 13 October. Matthias united the command of all forts along the Danube {{to the west of}} Belgrade in the hand of Paul Kinizsi to improve the defence of the southern frontier. Matthias sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, who invaded pro-Ottoman Wallachia in early 1480; Matthias launched a campaign as far as Sarajevo in Bosnia in November. He set up five defensive provinces, or banates, centred around the forts of Szörényvár (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), Belgrade, Šabac, Srebrenik and Jajce. The next year, Matthias initiated a criminal case against the Frankapans, the Zrinskis and other leading Croatian and Slavonian magnates for their alleged participation in the 1471 conspiracy. Most barons were pardoned as soon as they consented to the introduction of a new land tax. In 1481, for a loan of 100,000 florins, Matthias seized the town of Mautern in Styria and Sankt Pölten in Lower Austria from Friedrich Mauerkircher, one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> to the Bishopric of Passau.|$|E

5|$|The all-pairs widest path {{problem has}} {{applications}} in the Schulze method for choosing a winner in multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>candidates</b> it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, {{and the winner is}} the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results of an election using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E
