The new retail format has brought both new opportunities and challenges. By comparing to western developed countries and region, China has not been involving the {{shopping center}} development for quite long time, the industry of shopping center development in China is more behind in terms of shopping center concpet development, design of a shopping center, investment model and the sysmatic professional way of shopping center development. How to lower the risks of shopping center development and have {{it to be a}} sustainable industry becomes a very crucial question to answer now. The paper will discuss those questions through literature review, interview, case study and comparison analysis. After all the research done in the paper, we can draw a few improving suggestions such as the government needs to have good commercial planning from <b>the</b> beginning, <b>the</b> <b>developers</b> <b>shall</b> have a healthy long term business model to support to have good shopping centers both for tenants and customers.

This liability is provided in the statutory standard sale and purchase agreements - Schedules G,H,I and J ('the said agreements'). However, this liability is not clearly spelt out if the housing project is abandoned. Thus, {{in the event of}} abandonment, the purchasers {{may not be able to}} get the protection affordable under defect liability period. Further,the duty to provide lien is not mentioned in Schedules I and J. Due to this lacuna, the rights and interests of purchasers may also not be protected. This paper aims to highlight these problems - defect liability period and the absence of lien in the housing agreements, particularly involving abandoned housing projects in Peninsular Malaysia. This paper is an outcome of several researches done using legal research methodology and qualitative case study research methodology. This paper finds that due to the absence of specific legal provisions on defect liability period and lien, the rights and interests of the purchasers will be denied and they will suffer damage and losses. At the ending part of this paper, the author suggests some recommendations to settle the problems...|$|R

Since <b>developers</b> of Android 4.4 applications do not manage this case, some applications crashed. This issue will be resolved on Android 6.0 because now <b>developers</b> <b>shall</b> handle permission verification before trying to use it.

Finally, we will integrate new Android 6.0 information (protection levels and groups of permission) as new meta-criteria. As a consequence, Kapuer will be easier to maintain.|$|R

40|$|Developers use {{analysis}} tools to help write, debug, and understand software systems under development. A <b>developer’s</b> change to <b>the</b> system source code may affect analysis results. Typically, to learn those effects, <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> must explicitly initiate the analysis. This may interrupt <b>the</b> <b>developer’s</b> workflow and/or <b>the</b> delay until <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> learns <b>the</b> {{implications of the}} change. The situation is even worse for impure analyses — ones that modify the code on which it runs — because such analyses block <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> from working on the code. This paper presents Codebase Replication, a novel approach to easily convert an offline analysis — even an impure one — into a continuous analysis that informs <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> of <b>the</b> implications of recent changes {{as quickly as possible}} after the change is made. Codebase Replication copies <b>the</b> <b>developer’s</b> codebase, incrementally keeps this copy codebase in sync with <b>the</b> <b>developer’s</b> codebase, makes that copy codebase available for offline analyses to run without disturbing <b>the</b> <b>developer</b> and without <b>the</b> <b>developer’s</b> changes disturbing <b>the</b> analyses, and makes analysis results available to be presented to <b>the</b> <b>developer.</b> We have implemented Codebase Replication in Solstice, an opensource, publicly-available Eclipse plug-in. We have used Solstice to convert three offline analyses — FindBugs, PMD, and unit testing — into continuous ones. Each conversion required on average 436 NCSL and took, on average, 18 hours. Solstice-based analyses experience no more than 2. 5 milliseconds of runtime overhead per developer action...|$|R
