5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>showing</b> an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E
50|$|When Mamta {{says that}} Prem and Preeti must stay here after marriage, Prem gets infuriated. They {{get into a}} heated {{argument}} in which Prem tries to make his mother realize her mistake {{by pointing out that}} if not for Vivek, he and Vinod won't be alive. Prem also accuses his mother <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>showing</b> her true face of being a step-mother. This leads to Mamta slapping him, which indicates that she still loves Vivek. Prem ends his conversation by swearing on her most beloved daughter-in-law, Sadhna, whom she brought home with love, that he won't marry Preeti unless the both of them come home. Mamta gets dumbfounded. Prem goes to Preeti's house and tells her father. Pritam tells Prem that he is aware that he would end up in this decision and already told Preeti and assures him that she respects his decision. Prem meets Preeti and she tells him that he respects Vivek and Sadhna just like she does and that they won't get married until they return. She also tells him that she will take care of Sadhna's delivery.|$|E
50|$|In June, Jason celebrates his 28th {{birthday}} and Becky hosts {{a party for}} him in the Rovers. However, she orders a stripper and the party turns to all-out mayhem when Chris Gray (Will Thorp) has a go at Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel). A fight breaks out and this leads to a whole pub brawl, with Jason caught in the middle, things sent flying, the brawl going onto the street and a chair smashing the window. Though Jason is shaken, he is fine. In November 2011, Rosie tells Jason <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>showing</b> a potential buyer around their flat (which they are selling), but they are unaware that the mystery buyer is actually Rosie's ex-kidnapper, John Stape (Graeme Hawley), who has returned to kidnap Rosie as he blames her for his wife, Fiz, being imprisoned for his crimes. Rosie and Jason have a brief argument which leads to her storming off to show 'Mr Chips' around the flat. Meanwhile, Jason informs Kevin that Rosie never returned from the flat viewing and he is concerned. Jason and Kevin hear Rosie's screams and find her bound and gagged in the flat and Kevin chases after John, who then crashes his car and dies. Jason apologises to Rosie for abandoning her and says he'll never do it again. Rosie gets an offer for a show in London however she has to be single to enter the show. She realises she has to follow her career and breaks up with Jason.|$|E

5000|$|Subsequent to {{the above}} story, the rights to Angel {{characters}} were transferred from IDW to Dark Horse Comics, which publishes Buffy. In Angel and Faith (2012), Gunn tells Angel that Illyria is missing but presumed to be safe. She later debuts in Buffy in issue sixteen, {{as part of the}} [...] "Welcome to the Team" [...] story arc. Mid-battle, Buffy finds herself teleported to Los Angeles, where Illyria introduces herself as part of a council which needs Buffy's help due to the consequences of Buffy destroying the seed and stripping the universe of its ambient magic. In a confrontation with the season's villain, Severin, Illyria is stripped of her powers—including her ability to time travel—leaving her mortal and stuck in Fred's physical appearance. She assists Buffy's quest into its final arc, travelling into the Deeper Well alongside Buffy, Willow and Xander. Drawing on her personal experiences in Angel, she convinces Severin—whose powers threaten to rip a hole in time itself—to create a new seed, which will restore magic to the universe. Willow points out to Illyria <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>showing</b> very human compassion, which Illyria herself recognizes. The creation of the new seed creates a powerful discharge, vaporizing Illyria and Severin both. In the follow-up series Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten, Buffy expresses regret for Illyria's death to the demon Eldre Koh. Koh is surprised by this, and tells Buffy that she does not understand Old Ones, suggesting Illyria may yet survive in some form. Later, in the Angel & Faith book, Angel encounters Fred walking the streets of London. They surmise the recreated Seed attempted to bring Illyria back, and in the event, also brought back Fred. Now both Fred and Illyria are alive and cohabit Fred's body.|$|E

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming {{came up with}} the concept of the front cover design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced in the book and wanted this echoed on the cover.

Excerpts from a contemporaneous journal were offered as evidence; Lazarus wrote in it of dating several different men, none of them Ruetten. He reinforced his attack on the forensic evidence, calling as his last witness a fingerprint expert who said that some prints at the crime scene did not match those of Lazarus.|$|R

Conscious <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>showing</b> her beauty to the greatest advantage {{in the eyes of}} a man of taste, she betrayed a little of the embarrassment which Romayne had already noticed at the moment when she gave him her hand.

50|$|An {{inspection}} of the new convalescent home {{by members of the}} Hospital Committee, politicians, the Mayor of Sandgate, the Medical Superintendent of the Brisbane General Hospital, Hicks and others, took place in March 1902. Speeches given as part of the inspection referred to the benefits, both medical and economic, of the Sandgate home, and unbounded satisfaction with the home was expressed by the Committee. In the Annual Report of the Brisbane Hospital for 1910, the home was described as a valuable outwork of the Hospital...providing rest, nourishment and comfort during the days of convalescence of many of the patients. Nurses worked at the convalescent home as part of their general hospital training, and the recollections of a former nurse record that as a first year trainee, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the only nurse at the home together with the Matron, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> how to do dressings and other work which was not normally done until the second year of training.|$|R

[...] Perhaps {{for the first time}} in Telugu {{literary}} history, a prostitute was given a very positive image so much so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> to better the lives of many people during the course of the play. The play is ageless in the sense that its projection of the Indian mindset and psyche is very relevant and applicable in Indian Society today. The play was in some ways way ahead of its time and was very bold in criticizing the popular opinions and practices during that era. It frequently jabs at the male-dominated society of India, by bringing to the forefront certain egoistic idiosyncrasies of a typical Indian male, in an unflattering manner. It also questions the practices of witchcraft, sorcery, and their popular usage in medical practice during that period in India.|$|R

50|$|Saber {{tends to}} be rather silent in social {{situations}} and unwilling to show emotions, as she has suppressed them so strongly and views herself as a knight foremost. However, even though she attempts to hide them, her insecurities {{become more and more}} apparent. Later on in Fate/stay night, Saber begins to open up more and show her emotions more easily, especially to Shiro. A prominent theme in Fate/stay night <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> when <b>she</b> became King Arthur, Saber sacrificed what was most important to her: her humanity. It is implied that during her life before becoming the King of Knights, Arturia was a dreamy, idealistic, innocent young girl. Her developing relationship with Shiro is fundamental to the growth of her character, as he is the first person to view and treat Saber as a fellow human being rather than a weapon or a servant. This is in sharp contrast to Kiritsugu, who only saw her as a magus' tool and refused to openly acknowledge her existence. A comedic aspect about her <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> as having a humongous appetite, finishing large servings of rice within minutes.|$|R

50|$|Great {{controversy}} {{surrounded the}} construction. There were accusations {{of corruption and}} favoritism. The county commissioners ignored calls to stop the project and went ahead with a design by Denver architect William Quayle. It was completed and opened early in 1891. The six-foot (2 m) statue of Lady Justice, {{one of the few}} in the United States showing her without the usual blindfold, was made of pressed stamped zinc in Salem, Ohio, for a cost of $250 ($ in contemporary dollars).The statue's painted silvery exterior reflects the silver mining that was the root of Aspen's prosperity at that time. Why the blindfold was omitted is not known for certain. It has been humorously suggested that the commissioners, given the corruption allegations, decided Justice should be able {{to keep an eye on}} what was going on around her. Another account has it that the miners, who had previously set up their own informal courts to resolve disputes over claims, were reluctant to cede that authority, even to a legitimate governmental body. They therefore paid for the statue themselves and insisted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> without the blindfold but with scales (weight being an impartial measure of mining success), to emphasize that in Aspen justice could be impartial without artificial restraints.|$|R
