40|$|This paper {{describes}} a current differential relay for transformer protection that operates {{in conjunction with}} a core saturation detection-based blocking algorithm. The differential current for the magnetic inrush or over-excitation has a point of inflection at the start and end of each saturation period of the transformer core. At these instants, discontinuities arise in the first-difference function of the differential current. The second- and third-difference functions convert the points of inflection into pulses, the magnitudes of which are large enough to detect core saturation. The blocking signal is activated if the third-difference of the differential current is larger than the threshold and is maintained for one cycle. In addition, a method to discriminate between transformer saturation and current transformer (CT) saturation is included. The performance of the proposed blocking scheme was compared with that of a conventional harmonic blocking method. The test results indicate that the proposed scheme successfully discriminates internal faults even with CT saturation from the magnetic inrush, over-excitation, and external faults with CT saturation, and can significantly reduce the operating <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> of the <b>relay...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cooperative {{diversity}} protocols {{promise a}} new dimension of diversity that provides better communication by engaging nearby relays in forming a ‘virtual’ array of antennas for combined signal transmission. The current incremental cooperative diversity algorithms incrementally select best relay(s) to cooperate based on the channel quality reported by the relays. However, the algorithms do not {{take into consideration the}} fact that the chosen best relay(s) at estimation may not always be best at the time of communication. This is due to the <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> between the <b>relay</b> selection and its transmission of signal (problem of outdated Channel Quality Information). To solve this problem, the concept of channel prediction is introduced and employed whereby each relay determines a predicted value of its Channel Quality Information (CQI) based on its past measurements. The paper therefore develops a novel predictive relay-selection (PRS) cooperative diversity model which seeks to improve Land Mobile Satellite (LMS) communication through prediction protocols. In the model, the chosen best relay is the one with the best predicted CQI value instead of the traditional outdated one. Performance analysis of outage probability and average bit error probability for the newly developed PRS cooperation shows that the PRS cooperation is better than direct and outdated CQI relay communication.

30|$|Synchronism {{checking}} {{might lead}} complicated procedure and malfunction. Therefore, the individual component {{as well as}} the whole system reliability should be considered. Synchronism checking relays have been produced by several companies and applied in the field. In particular, synchronism checking has been used in the reclosing of transmission lines, and no malfunction in synchronism checking has been reported. Also, with the development of digital signal processing technology, it is possible to accurately obtain the differences in voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase angle between two points. Therefore, this paper does not consider the reclosing failure due to the synchronism checking problems. The conventional distribution systems do not consider synchronism checking in reclosing procedure. If the BESS is disconnected from distribution system during fault, the BESS cannot be used for the UPS. In order to increase the utilization of BESS, the BESS should be connected during a fault, so the synchronism checking must be considered as discussed in introduction. The outage time of faulty phase will be increased due to extra time for synchronism checking. However, the extra time for synchronism checking is actually very short due to a development of digital signal technology. In [23], a <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> of synchronism <b>relay</b> using in power networks is specified. Estabilization time of synchronism relay signals is 30  ms. Time for action of output unit of the synchronism relay is 30  ms. Time set in the synchronism relay for checking depends on the setting of operator, which has usually a delay of 100  ms [23]. Therefore, the closing <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> is usually 160  ms, i.e. about 10 cycles at 60  Hz. In our algorithm, the normal power is supplied to the load by BESS after opening of CB. After that, the <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> for synchronism checking between source and load sides is counted. Therefore, in the simulation results, the reclosing is performed within 1 / 2 cycles after fixed dead time (0.5 or 15  s). This is very short <b>time</b> <b>delay.</b> In other words, the increase of outage time of faulty phase at the proposed scheme will be very short comparing with the conventional reclosing scheme. In summary, by applying proposed reclosing scheme, the interruptions of healthy phases will be prevented and hence the reliability will improve. Also, the increase of outage time of faulty phase will not affect to the reliability.|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{conventional}} utility grids, microgrids comprise generators, {{storage devices}} and loads {{at all levels}} of the system. Power generation, distribution and consumption levels are not discrete and power flow may occur at any direction. At any point in time, microgrid may be disconnected from the utility grid and continue its operation under islanding conditions. Furthermore, some microgrids may have changing structures with alternative paths and the coupling point for a device or a part of the microgrid may change due to the altering conditions. Considering all of these challenges, it is required to develop a new protection concept/scheme for a safe and secure operation. Maintaining proper selective operation of relays in these new systems and new dynamic microgrid structures is also a challenge in itself. This requires monitoring the connections and updating <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> of the <b>relays</b> to ensure the desired protection hierarchy in the system. In this paper, a microgrid system is modeled according to the graph theory where the components are represented as nodes. Dijkstra's algorithm, which is famous for shortest-path calculation purposes, is run over the microgrid to determine the relay hierarchy at any point in time. In this manner, regardless of the dynamic changes occurring in the system the hierarchy of network components can be extracted. The implemented algorithm not only ensures proper selective operation under fault conditions but also facilitates the introduction of new connections and new devices to the system. Since the relay hierarchy is detected automatically, even with new connections, this algorithm serves for plug-and-play concepts in electrical networks...|$|R
