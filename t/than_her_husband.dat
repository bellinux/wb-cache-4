Gisela's mother was Gisela of Burgundy, {{a member of the}} Welf dynasty. Born around 985, Gisela was younger <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> whom she survived. She left Hungary in 1045 and died as Abbess of the Niedernburg Abbey in Passau in Bavaria around 1060.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Rodham {{became the}} first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm. From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> During 1978 and 1979, while looking to {{supplement}} their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal. Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Rumours {{of affairs}} did not {{surround}} only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise's presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours {{that the two}} were having an affair. Boehm's assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who {{played a central role}} in comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coke's father, Robert Coke, was a {{barrister}} and Bencher of Lincoln's Inn {{who built}} up a strong practice representing clients from his home area of Norfolk. Over time, he bought several manors at Congham, Westacre and Happisburgh and was granted a coat of arms, becoming a minor member of the gentry. Coke's mother, Winifred Knightley, came from a family even more intimately linked with the law <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> Her father and grandfather had practised law in the Norfolk area, and her sister Audrey was married to Thomas Gawdy, a lawyer and Justice of the Court of King's Bench with links to the Earl of Arundel. This connection later served Edward well. Winifred's father later married Agnes, the sister of Nicholas Hare.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the death}} of Kirchner caused a power vacuum, as Cristina Kirchner had ruled so far as a figurehead, while Néstor Kirchner still managed the {{government}}. She changed {{the style of the}} government making it more authoritarian, and more critical of the U.S.. She broke with allies of her husband, such as the union leader Hugo Moyano, and increased the political clout of the youth wing La Cámpora instead. She also relied on her public image more <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> had. The popularity of the Kirchners had been in a decline at the time of Néstor's death, but after being widowed, Cristina Kirchner's popularity increased greatly. As a result, she won the reelection in the 2011 general elections by a landslide.|$|E

5000|$|Hedda's {{married name}} is Hedda Tesman; Gabler is her maiden name.

5|$|The {{identity}} of the woman {{has also been a}} matter of debate. The inscription which accompanies her image clearly includes her title, despotissa, as well as the word “daughter”. Based on a possible reading of her name as Anna, she has been identified as Anna Neda, the Serbian wife of Michael Shishman, which is in line with the first identification of the despot. Nikolova believes that {{it is possible that the}} woman is Anna Neda even if the despot is her son rather <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> She theorises that Anna Neda settled in Vidin after Michael Shishman's second marriage and owned a personal domain which included Donja Kamenica. Another reading of the inscription deciphers the name of the despotissa as Elena.|$|E
5|$|George visited Russia {{again in}} 1867 {{to meet with}} his sister Dagmar, who had married Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander III) the year before. He was {{determined}} to find a wife {{and the idea of}} an alliance with a Russian grand duchess, born into the Eastern Orthodox Church, appealed to him. Olga fell in love with George, but she was nevertheless anxious and distraught at the thought of leaving Russia. Her father was initially reluctant to agree to their marriage, thinking that at the age of fifteen she was too young and, being close to his daughter, concerned by the distance between Greece and Russia. For her part, Grand Duchess Alexandra was much more enthusiastic <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> and, when some members of the imperial family noted the extreme youth of her daughter, she replied that Olga would not always be as young. Eventually, it was decided that Olga and George would marry when she had reached her sixteenth birthday. Meanwhile, she would continue her schoolwork until her wedding day.|$|E
5|$|Iaukea married Charlotte Kahaloipua Hanks (1856–1936) on April 7, 1877. They had {{met through}} the acquaintanceship of Charlotte's aunt Uwini Auld and Queen Emma. The only {{daughter}} of American businessman Frederick Leslie Hanks and Chinese-Hawaiian Akini, Charlotte was of mixed-Caucasian, Native Hawaiian and Chinese descent. Her father was allegedly {{a relative of}} Nancy Hanks, the mother of President Abraham Lincoln, and had settled in Hawaii after his second visit in 1853. A descendant of the Kahaloipua line of chiefs, her genealogy was considered of a higher rank <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> Her maternal grandfather was the early Chinese businessman Tyhune (i.e. Wong Tai-hoon), who owned the Tyhune Store in downtown Honolulu from the 1830s to the 1850s and invested in sugar, shipping, merchandise, and liquor sales. She inherited lands in Waikiki and Honolulu from her maternal grandmother Wahinekapu, a Hawaiian chiefess and the daughter or sister of Kahanaumaikai, {{who had been a}} recipient of land in the Great Māhele. Charlotte served as a lady-in-waiting for Queen Kapiʻolani, and was a close friend of Liliʻuokalani. During the monarchy, she received the honor of Knight Companion of the Royal Order of Kapiolani.|$|E

Yairah Amit disagrees, however, and argues that the weightiest event from this woman's viewpoint is the death of <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> but that a later editor or editors [...] "sought to show the woman as caring more about the ark <b>than</b> about <b>her</b> own fate, and put in her mouth a national-religious name etymology." ...|$|R

Safire pointed out {{that it would be}} equally incorrect to call her [...] "Miss Ferraro" [...] (as she was married) or [...] "Mrs. Ferraro" [...] (as <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> was not [...] "Mr. Ferraro")—and that calling her [...] "Mrs. Zaccaro" [...] would confuse the reader.|$|R
25|$|The couple {{remained}} {{close and}} {{theirs was a}} happy marriage. They lived in their own large residence in Saint Petersburg, the New Mikhailovsky Palace, which was built for them in 1861.

Grand Duchess Olga, with a stronger personality <b>than</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> was the dominating force in the family. She raised her seven children with an iron hand.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, the law differentiates {{based on}} {{the gender of the}} spouse.
