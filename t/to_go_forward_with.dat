After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E

5|$|The 1987 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} for the Giants. They lost their first two {{games of the season}} before the 1987 NFL Players Strike. As opposed to the players strike five years previous, NFL owners made a decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> replacement players. Unlike other teams such as the Washington Redskins and Houston Oilers, who made specific and elaborate plans to deal with the replacement games, the Giants made no plans. This resulted in the Giants losing all three replacement games, putting their record at 0–5 before the strike was over and the regular players returned. Though the Giants went a respectable 6–4 over their final 10 games, they were out of the playoffs at 6–9. A particular disappointment was the running game, which due to injuries to the offensive line (including tackle Karl Nelson missing the entire season due to Hodgkin's disease) struggled all season. Standouts included tight end Mark Bavaro, who led the team in catches with 55, and three of the Giants linebackers making the Pro Bowl—Taylor, Carl Banks (who was voted the team's MVP by the players), and Carson.|$|E

25|$|Some {{economists have}} criticized the {{efficiency}} of democracy, citing {{the premise of the}} irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information {{in order to make a}} truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country).

25|$|When initial {{assessments}} {{were being}} made for the feasibility of restoring the observatory, both the telescope and observatory were in a poor condition {{as a result of}} years of neglect and an arson attempt by some local children. The telescope is made predominantly from brass and thus suffered minimal corrosion and damage. Most importantly the lens of the telescope survived unscathed allowing for restoration. This was carried out at first by several dedicated parents and governors of the school, amongst them Syd Little. Soon after the basic restoration ideas were raised for a larger project allowing the teaching of astronomy on a larger scale. After getting clearance from the original owners of the telescope {{to go ahead with the}} project, Rossall was given funds from the Lawrence House Trust, an educational charity, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> their plans. The centre had an official opening on 26 September 2006 with Old Rossallian and former Astronomer Royal Sir Francis Graham Smith in attendance.

Courses also range from beginner to advanced to ensure that anybody who wishes to study Astronomy can do so.|$|E
50|$|His longest-lasting {{accomplishment}} {{was being}} {{the architect of}} a compromise that allowed numerous school bond measures <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> His negotiations <b>with</b> State Senator Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach) allowed the State Legislature to break a decade-long legislative logjam and place school bonds on the 1998 and 2000 ballots. In 2002, he sponsored another school bond, AB16, to place an additional $25.35 billion worth of school bonds {{on the ballot in}} November 2002 and then successfully campaigned to pass the bond. Using the framework designed by Hertzberg, California was able to pass over $70 billion in school bonds. For nearly two decades, California state government had been deadlocked with a Democratic State Legislature facing Republican Governors George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson.

40|$|In {{order for}} {{teachers}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> successfully <b>with</b> the middle years reframing of teacher practice in curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment, {{and to stay}} organised in the process, they need a workable way of acting in the middle years site for educational reform. In Chapter 1, Pendergast muses about a shift to {{a new kind of}} teacher identity to accompany Australia's growing acceptance of middle schooling and Australian universities' increasing investment in a specialist area of middle years teacher education. She argues that a new way of doing classroom practice would shape this changing teacher identity. Teachers need to believe that they can engage middle years students in learning and improve their learning outcomes. They need to be hopeful and satisfied about their work and future in a way that restores the stressed out, emotionally and physically exhausted, and cynical teachers found in middle years by Pendergast (Chapter 1). Middle years students need teachers who are sturdy in their everyday identity, efficacy, and resilience, not ones who are burned out heroes of reform. Because teachers are {{the focal point of the}} classroom innovations discussed in later sections, they need to be competent, enthusiastic, and confident that they can continue to grow into effective middle years practitioners.

25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an {{electronic}} camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E

50|$|While an uninsured {{employer}} does face a real problem, such as {{a prospective}} fine, prosecution, or employee injury, or is actually sued, there are steps the employer can take to minimize the consequences.

The goal for the uninsured employer {{is not only to}} achieve resolution to the immediate problem, but also to protect the assets of the firm, and to reach an accommodation with the regulatory agencies that enables the company <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> in compliance <b>with</b> the law. The Uninsured Employer Benefit Trust Fund in CA does not have funding or staff to mitigate the value of an uninsured claim. UEBTF merely pays the claim and all costs as claimed by the Applicant/Plaintiff, and assesses the cost against the uninsured employer. If legal counsel is retained by the uninsured employer, there is at least opportunity to mitigate the value/reimbursement to UEBTF. Additionally, legal counsel can sometimes mitigate the administrative penalties, and negotiate repayment plans that allow the business to continue.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} effect of policies associated with increased openness of the economy {{on the development of}} the agricultural sector, with a focus on adoption of technology. It investigates with the help of econometric tools the determinants of the adoption of technology in Argentina. In addition, it analyzes the possible growth paths that result with the implementation of policies using a recursive dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. During the last 20 years Argentina experienced extraordinary changes in its agricultural production. Both production and productivity increased very significantly as well as exports. One of the main drivers of these changes was the massive incorporation of technological change such as improved seeds, greater use of agrochemicals and machinery and agronomic technologies such as zero tillage. This study analyzes the impact of the economic environment on the adoption of technology. The results confirm the argument that the stability of the economy and liberalization motivates producers to adopt new technology. This motivation can be the consequence of the need to adopt new technology because otherwise producers lose competitiveness in the world market and/or because the stability and transparency of the economy makes producers more comfortable with the idea of innovation. The second major element of the research is the analysis of the impacts that the possible trade agreements that the Argentine government is involved right now, one representing free trade world wide (WTO) and the other a Western hemisphere free trade bloc (FTAA), could have on agriculture. The results leave us with the idea that for the agricultural sector it is worth pushing for the full implementation of free trade in the world rather than trying <b>to</b> only <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a regional free trade agreement. However, this is only true if there is a significant progress in reducing trade barriers and producers subsidies in developed countries. Otherwise the idea of only eliminating trade barriers between the FTAA bloc sounds very appealing with the gains that Argentina can take by better access to a larger market and the increase in bargaining power with outsiders of the bloc...|$|R
