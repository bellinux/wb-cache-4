In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for <b>their</b> <b>grandchildren</b> and other children from surrounding households. The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and children would play or do homework there after school.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{grandparents}} 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their quality of life (QOL) after the diagnosis and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in <b>their</b> <b>grandchild.</b> The following questions were addressed: (a) How do grandparents of children with ALL perceive their current QOL; (b) How do grandparents of children with ALL perceive their current QOL has changed since <b>their</b> <b>grandchild</b> was diagnosed; (c) What specific changes in QOL have grandparents experienced since the diagnosis of ALL in their grandchild; (d) What is the grandparents 2 ̆ 7 overall attitude about life with leukemia; (e) Is there a relationship between the length of time since the diagnosis of ALL in <b>their</b> <b>grandchild</b> and the grandparents 2 ̆ 7 current QOL; (f) Is there a relationship between length of time since the diagnosis of ALL in <b>their</b> <b>grandchild</b> and perceived changes in the grandparents 2 ̆ 7 QOL? Using Roy 2 ̆ 7 s Adaptation Model as a theoretical framework, a descriptive research design was used. A convenience sample of 29 grandparents completed the Varricchio-Wright Impact of Leukemia Questionnaire-Grandparents and a Demographic Information Sheet. Measures of central tendency were used to answer the first two research questions. Grandparents 2 ̆ 7 perceived their current QOL to be good to neither good nor poor. They reported their QOL to be the same as prior to ALL in <b>their</b> <b>grandchild.</b> There was no relationship found between length of time from diagnosis and either current QOL or changes in QOL.

5|$|Parents can {{be either}} the {{biological}} mother or biological father, or the legal guardian for adopted children. Traditionally, mothers were responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family.

5|$|With {{the death}} of her mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, in 1901, Alexandra became queen-empress consort to the new king. Just two months later, her son George and daughter-in-law Mary left on an {{extensive}} tour of the empire, leaving their young children in the care of Alexandra and Edward, who doted on <b>their</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> On George's return, preparations for Edward and Alexandra's coronation in Westminster Abbey were well in hand but just {{a few days before the}} scheduled coronation in June 1902 the king became seriously ill with appendicitis. Alexandra deputised for him at a military parade, and attended the Royal Ascot races without him, in an attempt to prevent public alarm. Eventually, the coronation had to be postponed and Edward had an operation performed by Frederick Treves of the London Hospital to drain the infected appendix. After his recovery, Alexandra and Edward were crowned together in August: he by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, and she by the Archbishop of York, William Dalrymple Maclagan.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Genevieve {{arrives in}} Genoa City with her presumed dead son, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), who is posing as his {{actually}} dead twin brother, Caleb. Genevieve {{and her son}} are working against Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers), her husband and Cane's father, who she believes murdered her daughter by Colin, Samantha. Genevieve later lures Colin to her home where she set up a shrine for Samantha and tries to push him off a balcony because he was abducting <b>their</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> Charlie and Mattie Ashby. Colin is saved from his fall by his wife, Jill Abbott Fenmore (Jess Walton), and at the hospital it is revealed that Colin and Genevieve are still legally married, invalidating his marriage to Jill. Genevieve attempts to bond with Charlie and Mattie, however, Cane's wife Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) is against that as she believes her mother-in-law is dangerous. Colin is put in prison, and his marriage to Genevieve legally ends thereafter. Genevieve then starts flirting with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), leading to a relationship, and Jack also hires her at Jabot Cosmetics. Later, Colin locks Genevieve in the wine cellar at her home, planning an explosion that would kill her and Gloria Bardwell (Judith Chapman). The explosion goes awry when Lily and Genevieve’s unseen housekeeper, Myrna Murdock, ends up as the explosion’s victim. Colin is arrested and deported back to Australia. Myrna is revealed to be Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk), Jack's ex-wife who is still obsessed with him. She (Myrna/Patty) claims she is shy following the explosion and refuses to show her face in public. Soon after, Jack proposes to Genevieve and she accepts, enraging Patty.|$|E
5|$|The {{night after}} WrestleMania, Orton demanded a rematch, {{threatening}} Linda McMahon (Vince's wife) {{as well as}} <b>their</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> McMahon did not grant him the rematch but scheduled a six-man tag team match for the pay-per-view Backlash between Triple H and Shane and Vince McMahon and The Legacy, with a preview that evening between Vince and Orton. However, Raw's general manager at that time, Vickie Guerrero, made their six-man tag team match a WWE Championship match. The stipulation was that if Triple H's team won, he retained the championship, while if The Legacy won, Orton would win the title. As the singles match progressed, Shane and Triple H came to Vince's aid, causing both Rhodes and DiBiase to interfere until a returning Batista appeared and cleared the ring; McMahon then announced that Batista was to replace him in the match at Backlash. At the event, Orton won by pinning Triple H after an RKO and a running punt, leaving Triple H hospitalized according to the storyline. In spite of Triple H's absence, Shane McMahon continued his feud with the group, leading to another match between him and Orton on Raw. After the original match ended in a no contest due to interference, Rhodes and DiBiase won singles matches to be entered into a handicap match with all of The Legacy facing Shane later that night. This match was used to write {{him out of the}} storyline, as The Legacy members used the steel ring steps to shatter his ankle.|$|E

40|$|Grandparents are {{important}} {{sources of support}} to children with disabilities and their families. However, there has been very little published research concerned with grandparents' roles and experiences in relation to <b>their</b> <b>grandchild</b> with disabilities. Existing research is reviewed in the present paper.

40|$|Being a {{grandparent}} is {{an important}} and valued role for many older adults, who often have strong views about the type of grandparent they will be and what they will teach <b>their</b> <b>grandchild.</b> When <b>their</b> <b>grandchild</b> has a disability, grandparents may have to significantly adjust their expectations and interactions. This research explores if and how having a grandchild with a disability influences grandparents’ sense of identity and enactment of the grandparent role. Using qualitative purposive sampling, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 22 grandparents of children with an intellectual and/or physical disability residing in Brisbane, Australia. A thematic analysis identified three key themes characterising grandparent’s views: formation of grandparenting identity, styles of grandparenting, and role enactment.

25|$|According to the Indian Act, status Indian {{women who}} married {{men who were}} not status Indians lost their treaty status, and their {{children}} would not get status. However, in the reverse situation, if a status Indian man married {{a woman who was}} not a status Indian, the man would keep his status and his children would also receive treaty status. In the 1970s, the Indian Rights for Indian Women and Native Women's Association of Canada groups campaigned against this policy because it discriminated against women and failed to fulfill treaty promises. They successfully convinced the federal government to change the section of the act with the adoption of Bill C-31 on June 28, 1985. Women who had lost their status and children who had been excluded were then able to register and gain official Indian status. Despite these changes, status Indian women who married men who were not status Indians could pass their status on only one generation: their children would gain status, but (without a marriage to a full-status Indian) <b>their</b> <b>grandchildren</b> would not. A status Indian man who married a woman who was not a status Indian retained status as did his children, but his wife did not gain status, nor did his grandchildren.|$|E
25|$|The {{mainstream}} Nazi anti-Semitism {{considered the}} Jewry being {{a group of}} people bound by close, so-called genetic (blood) ties, to form a unit, which one could not join or secede from. The influence of Jews was declared to have detrimental impact on Germany, to rectify the discriminations and persecutions of Jews. To be spared from that, one had to prove one's affiliation with the group of the so-called Aryan race. Paradoxical was, that never genetic tests or outward allegedly racial features in one's physiognomy determined one's affiliation, although the Nazis palavered a lot about physiognomy, but only the records of religious affiliations of one's grandparents decided. However, while the grandparents were earlier still able to choose their religion, <b>their</b> <b>grandchildren</b> in the Nazi era were compulsorily categorised as Jews, if three or four grandparents were enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation. This Nazi categorisation as Jews of course included mostly Jews of Jewish descent, but also many Gentiles of Jewish descent, such as Catholics, irreligionists, and Protestants, who happened to have had grandparents belonging– according to the records– to a Jewish congregation. While Jewish congregations in Germany tried– little as they were allowed– to help their persecuted members, the Protestant church bodies ignored their parishioners who were classified as Jews (according to the Nuremberg Laws), and the somewhat less persecuted Mischlinge of partially Jewish descent.|$|E
