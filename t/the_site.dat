Following resolution of creditors' claims, it acquired the freehold title in May 1996. In November 1996 {{plans for the}} redevelopment of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> were submitted and outline consent was received in May 1997. Detailed consent for much of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was granted in August 2000, and the rest in May 2001. The company received full possession of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in 2003. Having purchased <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> Parkview started work on a £1.1billion project to restore the building and to redevelop <b>the</b> <b>site</b> into a retail, housing and leisure complex.|$|E
5|$|A Carmelite priory {{was founded}} in 1354, but was {{demolished}} soon after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> passed to various people and was used for arable farming before a workhouse was built on <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in 1857, subsequently the Friarage Hospital which {{takes its name from}} the friary was built. Following development of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in 2006, archaeologists uncovered the remains of eight monks along with other artefacts.|$|E
5|$|A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga {{received}} 97,847 {{visitors in}} 2011. Visitors to the World Heritage Site are charged a fee (10,000 ariary for foreigners and 400 ariary for locals), which is largely {{used to pay}} for the preservation of <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> The commune of Ambohimanga Rova is a small but thriving rural village that lives on agriculture and services provided to tourists and pilgrims who visit the royal city. Multilingual tour guides can be hired at <b>the</b> <b>site</b> to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been negatively affected at <b>the</b> <b>site</b> {{as a consequence of the}} 2009 Malagasy political crisis; management of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.|$|E
50|$|Several {{websites}} were {{operated by}} GreaterGood {{in association with}} <b>the</b> Hunger <b>Site</b> were reorganized after CharityUSA.com bought GreaterGood. <b>The</b> Child Survival <b>Site,</b> <b>The</b> Kids AIDS <b>Site,</b> and <b>The</b> Landmine <b>Site</b> became rebranded into <b>The</b> Child Health <b>Site.</b> CharityUSA.com then added to the GreaterGood Network of websites by creating <b>The</b> Breast Cancer <b>Site,</b> <b>The</b> Animal Rescue <b>Site,</b> <b>The</b> Rainforest <b>Site,</b> and <b>The</b> Literacy <b>Site.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ribosome}} {{has three}} active sites: <b>the</b> A <b>site,</b> <b>the</b> P <b>site,</b> and <b>the</b> E <b>site.</b> <b>The</b> A <b>site</b> is <b>the</b> {{point of entry}} for the aminoacyl tRNA (except for the first aminoacyl tRNA, which enters at <b>the</b> P <b>site).</b> <b>The</b> P <b>site</b> is where <b>the</b> peptidyl tRNA is formed in the ribosome.

5|$|Access to an air {{ambulance}} base {{is at the}} rear of <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> <b>The</b> <b>site</b> also has a budget-chain hotel located within the service area. In May 2005 it was reported that the southbound services had overnight parking facilities for 100 lorries. This was a chargeable service.|$|E
5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect <b>the</b> <b>site</b> failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around <b>the</b> <b>site</b> to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
5|$|After a gap {{of several}} decades, {{in the early}} 1980s, Vimala Begley studied the {{ceramics}} find of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> and proposed a preliminary version of the chronology of the occupation of <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> At {{the same time she}} started researching on the beads, organized a proper sequential display of the artifacts of <b>the</b> <b>site</b> at the Pondicherry Museum, and brought out an information brochure.|$|E

5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for <b>the</b> <b>site</b> has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit <b>the</b> <b>site</b> clean this up.|$|E

5|$|Another serious fire {{occurred}} on 17 October 1958, when Selwood's tannery in Exeter Street was gutted by fire; <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was subsequently {{used by a}} series of supermarkets.

30|$|When {{we look at}} the {{perceived}} safety of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> in association with their refuge-related characteristics, no significant difference was found among them (F[*]=[*] 0.166, df[*]=[*] 1 – 127, p[*]>[*] 0.5). The results showed that the mean value of all <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> was 4.33. <b>The</b> <b>sites</b> that were predefined as protected (refuge) had a mean perceived safety score of 4.35, while <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> that were predefined as unprotected (not refuge) had a mean perceived safety score of 4.30. In this case, it can be observed that all <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> have high mean perceived safety scores. Thus, we cannot examine the effect of refuge on landscape preferences, and all <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> can be labeled as refuge in the visitors’ perception (F[*]=[*] 1.636, df[*]=[*] 7 – 121, p[*]>[*] 0.05) (Table  3).|$|R
25|$|The {{ribosome}} {{has three}} sites for tRNA to bind. They are <b>the</b> aminoacyl <b>site</b> (abbreviated A), <b>the</b> peptidyl <b>site</b> (abbreviated P) and <b>the</b> exit <b>site</b> (abbreviated E). With {{respect to the}} mRNA, <b>the</b> three <b>sites</b> are oriented 5’ to 3’ E-P-A, because ribosomes move toward the 3' end of mRNA. <b>The</b> A <b>site</b> binds <b>the</b> incoming tRNA with the complementary codon on the mRNA. <b>The</b> P <b>site</b> holds <b>the</b> tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain. <b>The</b> E <b>site</b> holds <b>the</b> tRNA without its amino acid. When an aminoacyl-tRNA initially binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, it is in <b>the</b> A <b>site.</b> Then, a peptide bond forms between the amino acid of the tRNA in <b>the</b> A <b>site</b> and <b>the</b> amino acid of the charged tRNA in <b>the</b> P <b>site.</b> <b>The</b> growing polypeptide chain is transferred to the tRNA in <b>the</b> A <b>site.</b> Translocation occurs, moving the tRNA in <b>the</b> P <b>site,</b> now without an amino acid, to the E site; the tRNA that was in <b>the</b> A <b>site,</b> now charged with the polypeptide chain, is moved to <b>the</b> P <b>site.</b> <b>The</b> tRNA in <b>the</b> E <b>site</b> leaves and another aminoacyl-tRNA enters <b>the</b> A <b>site</b> to repeat <b>the</b> process.|$|R
50|$|Exactly what {{constitutes}} an “acceptable” Four Word Film Review {{is often a}} source of heated debate on <b>the</b> <b>site’s</b> message board. <b>The</b> general rules are listed in <b>the</b> <b>site's</b> FAQ, although their interpretation is ever evolving, subject to both the decisions of <b>the</b> <b>site’s</b> creator/owner, and <b>the</b> interpretation of the MERPs.|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} Ministry of Defence's Project MoDEL, <b>the</b> <b>site</b> became {{surplus to}} {{military}} requirements and was sold in 2007 to be redeveloped for new housing. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> was cleared in 2008 {{and a total of}} 385 new homes were approved for construction.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} GCCS operations, the General Post Office (GPO) {{established}} a training school, and a women's {{teacher training college}} was opened in 1948. The Ministry of Aviation also opened the Navaid training school on part of <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> The GPO had blocks built in the south-east area of <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> and other blocks were adapted from their original conditions for new uses. The CTS division of GCHQ remained on <b>the</b> <b>site</b> within Blocks C and D until 1987. Aerial masts which had been erected by the division became unusable after the nearby train line was electrified, and were removed the year CTS left.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the Motul Ecological Park, <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was used for agriculture, specifically the cultivation of maize. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> has been damaged several times by wildfires caused by uncontrolled stubble burning in 1986, 1987 and again in 1998.

50|$|The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Alaska {{district}} surveyed {{and selected}} {{each one of}} <b>the</b> original <b>sites.</b> It also constructed 11 of <b>the</b> original 31 <b>sites.</b> <b>The</b> selection process required that survey teams test the propagation path by setting up communication towers at each remote site during winter months. Some of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> were easily accessible, but most of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> were far from civilization on remote mountain peaks. 14 tons of equipment were taken by dogsled or helicopter to survey <b>the</b> <b>sites.</b>|$|R

40|$|We have visualized the intranuclear {{topography}} of adenovirus replication and transcription in infected HeLa cells. The {{results show that}} viral DNA replication occurs in multiple foci that are highly organized in the nucleoplasm. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that newly synthesized viral double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced from the replication foci and spread throughout the nucleoplasm, while the single-stranded DNA replication intermediates accumulate in adjacent sites. Double-labelling experiments and confocal microscopy show that replication occurs in foci localized at the periphery of <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> where single-stranded DNA accumulates. The simultaneous visualization of viral replication and transcription reveals that <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of transcription are predominantly separated from <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of replication. Transcription is detected adjacent to the replication foci and extends around <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of single-stranded DNA accumulation. These data indicate that newly synthesized double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced from the replication foci and spread in the surrounding nucleoplasm, where they are used as templates for transcription. Splicing snRNPs are shown to co-localize with <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of transcription and to be excluded from <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of replication. This provides evidence that splicing of viral RNAs occurs co-transcriptionally and that <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of viral DNA replication are spatially distinct from <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> of RNA transcription and processing...|$|R
