40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{the safety of the}} direct {{disposal}} of spent fuel, the corrosion resistance of the waste form spent fuel, {{which is one of the}} technical barriers against the release of radionuclides, was investigated. Decladded pellets of high burnup LWR-UO_ 2 -fuel, but with the cladding beeing present, were exposed to MgCl_ 2 -rich solution. NaCl-solution and DI-water in the temperature range from 90 - 150 under dynamic conditions. The accumulated corrosion times were between 1000 and 1500 days, the intervals, when the leachates were changed, were 250 #+-# 50 days. The corrosion rates are highest, when using MgCl_ 2 -rich solutions and the pH is low (low pH-values were a result of the use of <b>teflon</b> <b>liners,</b> the addition of an acid indicator nuclide solution and N_ 2 -atmosphere). The enhanced corrosion of spent fuel, obtained at these conditions, allows to study the kinetic dissolution behavior of the matrix in a 'time-lapse-experiment'. After a corrosion time of three years, the disintegration of the fuel matrix, associated with increasing reaction rates were observed. Under neutral conditions (use of tantalum liners, no addition of acid indicator nuclide solutions) the release of radionuclides is around one or two orders of magnitude lower. If the reaction temperature is increased from 90 to 150 C the release of radionuclides was found to be 1 or 1, 5 orders of magnitude lower. This effect is more distinct at neutral pH, than observed at acid pH. Spent fuel samples, corroded in MgCl_ 2 -rich solution at 150 C at low pH as well as at high pH were characterized by means of ceramographic/metallographic methods (electron microprobe, optical and scanning electron microscopy). In both cases, a reaction layer of 2 - 3 #mu#m thickness, formed on the surface of the fuel was found. Main compounds of the layer were constituents of the brine, Mg, Cl and S. Especially MgCl_ 2, was formed under neutral conditions. At low pH MgSO_ 4 was formed mainly.

Maximale Korrosionsraten werden in MgCl_ 2 -reichen Salzloesungen bei niedrigen pH-Werten erreicht (Ursachen: Verwendung von Tefloneinsaetzen, Zugabe saurer Leitnuklidloesung, N_ 2 -Atmosphaere). Die erhoehten Brennstoffumsaetze in kurzen Zeiten auf Grund der turnusmaessigen Loesungswechsel sowie der sauren Bedingungen ermoeglichen es, das kinetische Aufloesungsverhalten der Matrix quasi im 'Zeitrafferverfahren' zu untersuchen. Nach einer Korrosionszeit von ca. drei Jahren wird ein beginnender Abbau des Gefuegezusammenhalts, begleitet von zunehmenden Reaktionsraten, beobachtet. Unter neutralen Bedingungen dagegen werden um bis zu zwei Groessenordnungen geringere Freisetzungen von Radionukliden beobachtet. Eine Erhoehung der Korrosionstemperatur von 90 auf 150 C fuehrt nicht zu einer verstaerkten, sondern zu einer um bis zu 1, 5 Groessenordnungen verringerten Auslaugung.

40|$|Engineered Geothermal System (EGS) {{has great}} {{potential}} to supply electricity by harnessing stored thermal energy from high temperature granitic rocks. Since reserves of coal, oil, {{and natural gas}} are being depleted at an increasing rate, this route provides opportunities to generate electrical power without producing greenhouse gas emissions or long lasting nuclear wastes, at a cost that is competitive to those generated from fossil fuels. Australia has {{a vast amount of}} thermal area, though the heat exchange occurs at a significantly greater depth (5 km) to conventional geothermal system. Clearly, the study of fluid-rock interaction is crucial and remains largely poorly addressed and known. A compounding factor is the fact that fundamental processes associated with mineral dissolution and precipitation, and the developed pressure temperature gradient remain poorly understood. Furthermore, a number of issues relating to geothermal geochemistry are required to be considered and explored to ensure safe, economic energy production from the “hot rocks”. Low pH and saline waters at temperatures exceeding 200 °C are highly corrosive. Thus, it is vital to prevent the generation of scaling as the brines cool during transport to the surface. The objectives of this study were to investigate the geochemistry, the fluid-rock interaction, and model the precipitation rate of silica. Experimental work was carried out to observe the fluid-rock interaction, including analysis on the rock to monitor the dissolved elements in the circulating fluid, and the water chemistry after the interaction. The granite samples were analysed using x-ray diffraction and results showed that the rock consist of mainly quartz, albite and K-feldspar. This study concentrated on the dissolution rate of granite by observing the silica concentration in the liquid phase with the aid of previous dissolution rate studies of pure quartz, albite and K-feldspars (Rimstidt and Barnes, 1980; Hellmann, 1994; Worley, 1994; Brantley, 2008; Brown, 2011 b). In order to investigate the fluid-rock interaction in the Cooper Basin geothermal system (i. e. Habanero 3 well), three experimental methods at a laboratory scale were developed. To simplify the process, the gas phases were not introduced to the system. The first method allows the interaction of fluid and rock samples in a closed system where no fluid is required to be replaced (fluid mass is constant) during the experimental period. The experiment is conducted in Teflon lined autoclaves for different interaction periods and the maximum temperature chosen was 220 °C due to the limitation of the <b>Teflon</b> <b>liners</b> used. This method was used firstly to obtain the equilibrium silica concentration at various temperatures. The experimental results showed good agreement with the literature values. The equilibrium silica concentrations obtained from dissolution at 120 °C, 140 °C, 160 °C, 170 °C, 200 °C and 220 °C for 56 days were 56 ± 3 ppm, 94 ± 6 ppm, 137 ± 6 ppm, 175 ± 7 ppm, 282 ± 11 ppm, and 350 ± 28 ppm, respectively. The second observation was the dissolution kinetics in pure water. The SigmaPlot software was used to fit the experimental data and obtain the equilibrium silica concentration and silica dissolution rate constant based on a first order global rate equation by Worley (1994). The results were compared with a compiled quartz dissolution literature values and showed good agreement, however values differ slightly due to the different materials and experimental conditions. The obtained dissolution rate constants were then regressed using the Arrhenius equation describing a kinetic rate constant with an activation energy of 64. 53 kJ/mol. A number of factors affecting the dissolution rate of granite were observed. One factor was the effect of particle size on the dissolution rate of granite. The experimental results agree with literature, which demonstrated that the dissolution rates increased with decreasing granite particle size (increasing the surface area). Another observation undertaken was the effect of electrolyte (250 ppm NaCl solution) on the granite dissolution rate. The results concluded that the dissolution rate in 250 ppm NaCl solution yielded a two-fold increase compared to that in pure water. One other observation was on the effect of pH in granite dissolution rate. The experimental results agree with the literature confirming that the increase of dissolution rates at lower pH was due to the presence of organic acid (acetic acid) in the pH buffer used. At pH above 8 the dissolved silica species that is significant is not solely SiO₂(aq) [(aq) subscript] (H₄SiO₄). The hydrogen atoms from H₄SiO₄ can dissociate and release H₃SiO₄⁻ ion which is very soluble in water. As the pH increase, further hydrogen dissociation is possible to form H₂SiO₄²⁻ which is also soluble in water and thus increasing the silica concentration, leading to an increased dissolution rate. The second method used a closed loop batch flow-through cell that was designed to mimic the circulation of the fluid-rock interaction hence enabling the observation of the changes in the chemical properties of the host rock and circulating fluid that may occur. This method involved two different experimental systems. The first system allows the continuous interaction of the fluid (pure water and 250 ppm NaCl solution) and rock samples at 250 °C (close to the actual geothermal reservoir temperature) to study the dissolution kinetics of silica from the granite for different interaction periods. This system was also used to study the effect of fluid/rock ratio. The experimental results agree with the literature which illustrate a decrease in solid/liquid ratio (increase in fluid/solid ratio) would increase the reaction rate. The second system allows the interaction of fluid and rock samples also in a closed loop batch flow-through cell, using pure water and 250 ppm NaCl solution for 7 days and 28 days, and the fluid is consistently replaced every 24 hours for the specified interaction periods. This system was designed to accelerate the mineral dissolution to observe which minerals were more soluble. SEM results revealed that severe pitting exists {{on the surface of the}} granite, as a consequence of rapid dissolution, and it was observed that fine particles were present between and on the surface of the granite which increased the particles surface area, enhancing the dissolution rate. The SEM back-scatter images revealed albite as the more soluble phase, since more cavities were observed through the albite phases compared to the K-feldspar phases in the granite samples. The third method involved a high pressure open loop flow through system, where fresh water is continuously injected to the system. This system was configured to observe the influence of pressure in rock water interaction. Three pressure conditions at 250 °C were chosen (at vapour pressure, 100 bars, and 200 bars). The experimental results showed that the silica concentration increased with pressure, agreeing with the published literatures. In order to validate the experimental results, the React program from the Geochemist Workbench software was used to simulate the granite dissolution reaction path and generate silica dissolution and silica precipitation rates. The simulation in React is based on the transition state theory model (Rimstidt and Barnes, 1980; Bethke, 1996). The results of the modelling showed consistent plots with the experimental results however generated different values of rate constants and equilibrium silica concentrations. React was also used to calculate the amount or rate of silica precipitation with the assumption that the aperture of the fracture was 10 cm and the surface roughness was 2. For granite dissolution in pure water, the amount of silica that may precipitate was approximately 298 mg/ 28 days, and in 250 ppm NaCl solution is 309 mg/ 28 days. From the available information, the sealing rate from granite dissolution in water was 2. 30 cm/ 1000 years, and that in NaCl solution was 2. 41 cm/ 1000 years. Since this was a simplified model and only the major components of the granite were included, it may have influenced the reaction path calculated by React, affecting the silica concentration output and reaction rate. Another contributing factor may be that the active surface area of the granite in the experiment differs with the BET surface area obtained in this study. In addition, the published reaction rate constant may have different experimental conditions (e. g. different composition of minerals, particle size, duration of experiments, different reactors). As well, the input of the reaction rate constant was allowed for single minerals, and the model may not simulate the exact laboratory experimental conditions. Moreover, this study measured the dissolution of granite solely from the release of silica to the solution. Since the literature published reaction rate constant from pure minerals (e. g. albite), this reaction rate constant may not be the appropriate value to specify the albite component in the granite. In other words, the reaction path of dissolving three pure minerals in water may not be identical to the dissolution mechanism of granite with the same mineral composition. Since the model output resulted in some differences compared to the experimental results, this suggests that modelling and experiments should work together to predict more accurate outputs.

Pressurization of the larger system would lead to compression in the dead-end line, and possible ignition of the <b>teflon</b> <b>liner.</b> The model consists of a large plenum containing oxygen at the desired pressure (500 to 6000 psi). The plenum is connected via a fast acting valve to a stainless steel tube 2 cm inside diameter. Opening times are on the order of 15 ms. Downstream of the valve is an orifice sized to increase filling times to around 100 ms. The total length from the valve to the dead-end is 150 cm. The distance from the valve to the orifice is 95 cm. The models describe the fluid mechanics and thermodynamics of the flow, and do not include any combustion phenomena. A purely thermodynamic model assumes filling to be complete upstream of the orifice before any gas passes through the orifice. This simplification is reasonable based on experiment and computer modeling. Results show that peak temperatures as high as 4800 K can result from recompression of the gas after expanding through the orifice. An approximate transient model without an orifice was developed assuming an isentropic compression process. An analytical solution was obtained. Results indicated that fill times can be considerably shorter than valve opening times. The third model was a finite difference, 1 -D transient compressible flow model. Results from the code show the recompression effect but predict much lower peak temperatures than the thermodynamic model...|$|E
40|$|Altogether 52 {{samples of}} cocoa beans from 20 {{different}} origins and 40 samples of commercial chocolate tablets, chocolates, cocoa powders and instant powders were examined for their zinc content. The determinations {{were carried out}} {{with the aid of}} a flame-ASS after wet ashing in an autoclave with <b>teflon</b> <b>liner.</b> The zinc content of full cream milk chocolate with and without nuts was found to be 11, 6 and 13, 4 mg/kg respectively. Semi-bitter andbitter chocolates contain 17, 2 and 23, 2 mg/kg (mean values). The instant powders examined contained 10, 7 mg/kg, the samples of cocoa powder 42, 8 and 58, 7 mgZn/kg. Chocolate and chocolate tablets with additions and fillings contained 10, 0 and 9, 8 mg/kg. For the purpose of evaluating the total amounts of copper and zinc it is important to establish also the amounts of Cu present since the total loading can be evaluated only on the basis of both elements. It appears from previous investigations (2, 4) on copper contents of raw cocoa that the mean Cu-content amounts to 28, 5 mg/kg. The mean content found in full cream milk chocolate was 5, 8 mg/kg and that found in bitter chocolate 20, 1 mg/kg. The copper content of cocoa powder is between 43, 9 and 67, 5 mg/kg. From this it can be seen that the limit values can be adhered to in finished products whose proportion of cocoa mass is very small such as in full cream milk chocolate with and without nuts, chocolates, chocolate tablets with additions and with fillings. In the case of semi-bitter and bitter chocolate and cocoa powder it will hardly be possible to keep to the limit value because of the high proportions of cocoa mass. Since, however, cocoa powder is usually employed in the manufacture of cocoa-containing beverages, fat-based coatings, cake masses and pudding mixes, cocoa is present in a diluted form. The limit value can therefore be adhered to, provided that other ingredients do not contribute to the existing zinc level. This can be clearly established when considering the zinc content of instant powders...|$|E

Functional oxides and their thin film epitaxy have become increasingly requested and further improvement in the existing technologies of information storage and energy harvesting heavily depends {{on the performance of}} such heterostructures at the nanoscale. Ferroelectric materials show a spontaneous electric polarization, which can be switched repeatedly by applying an external electric field. Since the discovery of ferroelectric BaTiO 3 as the first oxide ferroelectric, the period prior to 1988 was mainly restricted to modelling ferroelectric phase transitions and discovering new ones. However, the focus has been significantly changed in the nineties, when thin films were developed and integrated into semiconductors at the nanoscale. This down scaling and bi-stable polarization of ferroelectrics were attractive in memory devices through ferroelectric random access memory, smart cards etc., and in tunable microwave devices through phase shifters, delay lines, resonators etc., apart from the conventional capacitor applications. Similarly, work on multiferroic {{can be traced back to}} pioneering research in the 1950 s and 1960 s, but there has been a recent resurgence of interest driven by long-term technological aspirations. For more than a decade, BiFeO 3, being a magnetic and a strong ferroelectric material at room temperature, has been renowned as a multiferroic materials that addresses a range of possible applications that no other material class exhibits so far. Out of many possible options, photovoltaic applications are being extensively considered due to the relatively low band-gap (2. 5 eV). These two material systems, BaTiO 3 and BiFeO 3 are widely considered as the model systems for ferroelectric and multiferroic properties and hence epitaxial thin film growth on lattice matched SrTiO 3 substrates by an inexpensive hydrothermal method are considered in this thesis. One of the main requirements of producing high quality epitaxial thin films on SrTiO 3 substrates is the single termination of its surface. To this effect, a novel microwave-assisted hydrothermal etching was successfully applied to the surface preparation of pure and Nb-doped SrTiO 3 single crystals with (100), (110) and (111) orientations. Without the possibility of fluorine contaminations from the <b>Teflon</b> <b>liner</b> and by avoiding the etching chemistry involved with HF widely used, the surface structure appears perfect within the limitations of the in-plane and out-of-plane miscut angles. These results indicate that the utilization of this method, without any corrosive chemicals during the preparation steps, to achieve atomically flat surface with single chemical termination of SrTiO 3 substrates is feasible and compatible with batch processing. This technique is inexpensive, fast, safe, environmentally benign, compatible with batch processes, and showed remarkable reproducibility. Further, this method does not need an ultra-high vacuum environment and long annealing time at high temperatures. The possibility to reduce the etching time significantly avoids the formation of etch pits and holes on the substrate surface. The hydrothermal technique is shown to be a feasible way to obtain good crystalline quality thin films of BaTiO 3 and BiFeO 3. This method is an inexpensive alternative technique, which is defined as any chemical reaction in presence of aqueous solvents conducted at autogenous pressure, which corresponds to the vapor pressure above room temperature and below the critical point, generally lower than 370 °C for water, in a closed system. As for the synthesis of the thin films, two hydrothermal technique modes were employed; conventional hydrothermal for BaTiO 3 and microwave assisted hydrothermal for BiFeO 3. The conventional hydrothermal mode, where the heating process happens by convection at heating rates of 10 °C/min using a stainless steel reactor in a conventional oven; and, the microwave assisted hydrothermal mode, which consists in utilizing a relatively low budget high strength polymer reactor in a microwave oven for which the heating process happens by absorption through water molecules of the 2. 45 GHz radiation which allows a more efficient heating process to synthesize films in less time compared to the conventional process. In the case of BaTiO 3 films, TiO 2 nanoparticles dispersed in the Ba(OH) 2 alkaline solution are used as precursors. The incorporation of H 2 O 2 into precursor solution served as a strong oxidant and catalyst for the uniform nucleation of BaTiO 3 on the substrate surface. Polarization reversal in single phase epitaxial and polycrystalline BaTiO 3 thin films were demonstrated on Nb:SrTiO 3 and Pt/Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 /Si substrates, respectively. Raman scattering studies revealed the necessity of cumulative depositions with 10 min of microwave radiation at a power of 120 W for the single phase formation of BaTiO 3 films. No traces of impurity phases were present according to the x-ray diffraction and Raman scattering results which is primarily due to the absence of mineralizers. Local phase hysteresis of BaTiO 3 thin film on Nb:SrTiO 3 substrate confirms ferroelectricity and 180 o switching. Highly ordered BiFeO 3 thin films were successfully produced by hydrothermal synthesis on SrTiO 3 :Nb (100) substrates. Surfactants were avoided and significantly reduced the concentration of potassium hydroxide (KOH) by a factor of 10 compared to reports in literature to reduce the leakage current. Due to this reduction of mineralizer, leading to less solubility of the precursors and decreasing the reaction rate, deposition time of 18 h were required to grow a 40 nm thin film. As-grown BiFeO 3 films were also annealed at 500 °C under nitrogen flow for better crystallization and to remove hydrogen. For the first time, polarization reversal is demonstrated by successful reduction of electronic leakage. A first demonstration of the bulk photovoltaic effect in hydrothermally grown BiFeO 3 shows that this technique can be used to produce multiferroics for photovoltaic applications. Our experimental results confirm realization of single termination of SrTiO 3 and epitaxial deposition of BaTiO 3 and BiFeO 3 by an inexpensive hydrothermal method with or without microwave radiation. </p...|$|E
