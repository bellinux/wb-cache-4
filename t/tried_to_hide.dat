5|$|His {{frustration}} {{turned to}} depression, and in 1971 Drake was persuaded {{by his family}} to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London.

He knew enough about drugs to worry about their side effects, and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.|$|E
5|$|The {{abolition}} of papal authority made way not for orderly change, but for dissension and violence.

Once Henry knew what was afoot, he acted. Thus {{at the end of}} 1538, a proclamation was issued forbidding free discussion of the Sacrament and forbidding clerical marriage, on pain of death.|$|E

At first the U-boat attempted to flee, and then <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> by lying still. Both {{times it was}} found by sonar.
