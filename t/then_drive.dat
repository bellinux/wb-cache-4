5|$|During {{the night}} of 10/11 April, XLIX Mountain Corps was ordered to bridge the Savinja river at Celje, then advance towards Brežice on the Sava, and LI Infantry Corps was {{directed}} to link up with the 14th Panzer Division which would <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> west to Karlovac. The Italians were expected to commence offensive action by attacking southwards to link up with the 14th Panzer Division {{in the vicinity of}} Karlovac.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{they are}} short of money, {{a group of}} four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> {{the car to the}} bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. The thieves steal as much money as possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E

5|$|Using a {{captured}} Ottoman cannon, Morgan and Alain <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> the Ottomans from Malta and detonate Ottoman weapon caches in {{the nearby}} caves. Inside, they discover that the Ottomans were really interested in a hidden stone library {{telling the story of}} the Lake of the Moon, which contains the Fountain of Youth, a secret Native American relic which is told that it has the ability to give eternal life, and the secret society, called the Circle of Ossus, who seek it for their own gain. Alain orders Morgan to sail to the New World to search for the Lake, but Morgan is attacked by the Pirate Elizabet Ramsey (Lizzie the Pirate) and is forced to land in the Caribbean islands. After re-engaging and defeating Lizzie, Morgan's men find some navigation charts which guide them safely to New Spain.|$|E
5|$|The ambitious goal of Operation Maibaum (Maypole) was {{to destroy}} the Partisan 3rd Corps. Army Group F ordered V SS Mountain Corps to form a {{blockade}} along the Drina to prevent the Partisan force from crossing into Serbia. Operation Maibaum {{was one of the}} largest counter-insurgency operations of World War II and included 7th SS Division and NDH forces. The 13th SS Division was under the command of V SS Corps, and the primary tasks of the division were to capture Tuzla and Zvornik, <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> south parallel with the Drina to meet other Corps elements. The original plan included the parachute insertion of 500th SS Parachute Battalion into the Vlasenica area, but this was cancelled due to unsuitable weather. Flank security was to be provided by the reconnaissance battalion in the Srebrnik area. The deployment south of the Spreča, and therefore outside the security zone, during Operation Maibaum was ordered by the corps commander, Phleps, despite opposition from Sauberzweig. This caused friction between the two that eventually required Himmler's intervention.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E

25|$|The energy {{released}} in the fission process generates heat, some {{of which can be}} converted into usable energy. A common method of harnessing this thermal energy is to use it to boil water to produce pressurized steam which will <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> a steam turbine that turns an alternator and generates electricity.|$|E
25|$|Toulouse {{lies on the}} Garonne, {{which runs}} into the city from the south-west, then turns and exits to the north-west. Just east of the Garonne, the smaller Hers-Mort (Hers) runs past the city from the {{south-east}} to the north-east, forming a narrow corridor. To attack the city from the north, Wellington's main force would have to cross to the east bank of the Garonne, <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> south-east down the corridor between the two rivers.|$|E

50|$|Angel Castro-Alifonso was {{suspected}} of stealing between $4.2 and $7 million dollars from a gang allegedly led by Edsel Torres Gomez. On March 13, 1994, he {{and three other}} people were intercepted by henchmen and Castro-Alifonso was murdered on the spot of multiple shotgun blasts. The three others were <b>then</b> <b>driven</b> to Caguas, where they were tortured and interrogated. They were allegedly made to drink gasoline, and <b>then</b> <b>driven</b> to Cayey, where they were shot and their bodies set on fire. The three bodies were found burned inside a car.|$|R
25|$|After PublixDirect, Publix made {{a second}} attempt in 2010 at {{e-commerce}} {{with the introduction}} of Publix Curbside. Customers had the ability to browse and purchase groceries online, <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> to a participating location where an associate will have selected their items and would bring them out to the buyer's vehicle. Announced as a pilot program with locations in the Atlanta area and Tampa, the program was ended in January 2012 after its performance reportedly did not meet expectations.|$|E
25|$|Loading {{the pods}} was {{accomplished}} {{on a set}} of parallel railway tracks, two tracks {{on either side of the}} aircraft. The front and back halves of the pods were positioned at the end of the tracks on loaders, with the pods below the line of the wings. The aircraft would taxi into position between the rails, and the loaders would then raise the pods into position for locking onto the spars. They would <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> towards the aircraft for mating.|$|E
25|$|Skillful use of {{couriers}} enabled these armies {{to maintain}} contact {{with each other}} and their leadership. Discipline was inculcated during a nerge (traditional hunt), as reported by Juvayni. These hunts were distinctive from hunts in other cultures where they were the equivalent to small unit actions. Mongol forces would spread out in a line, surround an entire region, and <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> all of the game within that area together. The goal was to let none of the animals escape and to slaughter them all.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a maul is not {{properly}} formed if the ball carrier binds on to a teammate from the rear, {{and both of}} them <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> into one or more opponents– or if the ball-carrier breaks off {{from the back of the}} maul, which continues to drive forward. The players in front are either accidentally or deliberately offside and the referee awards either a scrum or a penalty to the opposing side, depending on whether the infringement was viewed as accidental or deliberate.|$|E
25|$|On December 17, 1778, Henry Hamilton {{captured}} Fort Vincennes {{and used}} it as a base to plan a spring offensive against George Rogers Clark, whose forces had recently seized control of much of the Illinois Country. His plans were to assemble five hundred warriors from various Indian nations, including the Cherokee, the Chickasaw, the Shawnee, and others, for a campaign to expel Clark's forces back east, <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> through Kentucky clearing American settlements. McDonald's headquarters at Chickamauga was to be the staging ground and commissary for the Cherokee and the Muscogee.|$|E
25|$|Balancing robots {{generally}} use a gyroscope {{to detect}} {{how much a}} robot is falling and <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum. Many different balancing robots have been designed. While the Segway is not commonly {{thought of as a}} robot, it {{can be thought of as}} a component of a robot, when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform). An example of this use has been as NASA's Robonaut that has been mounted on a Segway.|$|E

25|$|Karel Kaers, the {{youngest}} man {{to win the}} world road championship, also won the Ronde in 1939– without intending to. For him, it was training for Paris–Roubaix. He drove to the Kwaremont hill near Kluisbergen, parked his car, then rode 40km to the start in Ghent. His plan was to ride round the course with his usual training partner, stop when he got to his car, <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> home. Knowing he wasn't riding the whole distance, Kaers jumped clear of the field– again as training– and rode up the Kwaremont with a minute's lead. But his car wasn't there. He pressed on instead and won the race. His manager had driven the car away to save Kaers from temptation.|$|E
25|$|The British {{hoped to}} capture Ahvaz and <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> north into Zagros Mountains passes to reach Qazvin, {{where they would}} link up with British troops in central Iran and Soviet troops from the north. By the early morning of 27 August, the British forces had reached Ahvaz. The Iranians led by General Mohammad Shahbakhti, had {{prepared}} a strong defence. Iranian infantry had entrenched themselves around the city, with artillery support and tanks. Although Iranians had taken heavy losses and their morale was decreasing, {{they were prepared to}} fight hard. The Indian Army advance came to a halt and they were hesitant to cross the Karun River and attack the city. A British attack on the defences around the city were repelled by Iranian tanks and infantry.|$|E
25|$|On {{the right}} {{flank of the}} II Corps (Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob), the 11th (Northern) Division (Lieutenant-General C. L. Woollcombe) was to capture Hessian Trench {{on top of the}} ridge and Stuff Redoubt; if {{possible}} patrols were to be sent forward to take Stuff Trench. The 34th Brigade (Brigadier-General J. Hill) on the right would have to capture Mouquet Farm, advance up the old German second position trenches to Zollern Redoubt and thence to Stuff Redoubt. Two tanks were attached, to move from positions west of Pozières to arrive at Mouquet Farm at zero hour and <b>then</b> <b>drive</b> north onto the second position. On 28 September the Reserve Army issued instructions that Stuff and Schwaben redoubts were to be captured by 29 September and Stuff Trench on 1 October.|$|E
