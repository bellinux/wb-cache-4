40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A {{comprehensive review of}} ERTS- 1 MSS color composite imagery, obtained during the autumnal and vernal phases over the Great Plains Corridor <b>test</b> <b>sites,</b> shows that temporal changes in rangeland vegetation can be manually interpreted. The degree to which manual interpretations {{can be made from}} the MSS color composites appears to be limited primarily by variations in image reproduction quality. The vernal advancement and other phenophase related phenomena are observable from cycle to cycle and within a single frame for rangeland vegetation. Vegetation changes due to environmental conditions among the <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> and among grazing treatments within <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> are readily observable. An investigation has been initiated which will evaluate band-to-band ratios as an index of rangeland vegetation condition. Data currently available from August 1972 through April 1973 for the five southern <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> are being used to characterize band-to-band ratios as a function of quantity and quality of rangeland vegetation at each of the <b>test</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

40|$|Maximization of crop {{productivity}} requires accurate selection and targeting of cultivars for appropriate production areas. The number {{and location of}} <b>testing</b> <b>sites</b> are critical factors that affect the efficiency of and potential gains from breeding. The selected <b>testing</b> <b>sites</b> must {{be representative of the}} conditions of target production areas. Within a large region such as SADC, knowledge of underlying production zones within the region could help not only in choosing appropriate <b>testing</b> <b>sites,</b> but also in objective targeting of cultivars for production (Peterson 1992). The availability of long-term yield data from regional trials conducted in the SADC region over the past decade provides a unique opportunity to identify intra-regional production zones based on grouping of previously used <b>testing</b> <b>sites</b> with respect to their similarities in cultivar response to varying production conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Continued evaluation of autumnal phase and early vernal phase {{data indicate that}} the quality of ERTS- 1 imagery over the Great Plains Corridor <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> are adequate to show relatively small temporal changes in the condition and quantity of vegetation at the several <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> Vegetation changes measured from August through April are observable in reflectance changes recorded by ERTS- 1. Vegetation changes due to grazing treatment and environmental conditions at the <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> are being monitored with ground data and ERTS- 1 data, and appear adequate to complete all phases of the Great Plains Corridor investigation. NASA high flight aerial photography proved to be an indispensable tool for locating the Great Plains Corridor <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> on the computer derived grey maps of ERTS- 1 digital data...|$|R

The city remained relatively unchanged through the Great Depression, with the diversity of industries credited for Marysville avoiding the worst of economic hardship experienced by other nearby communities.

40|$|Introduction: Transplantation of Autologous non-cultured melanocytes {{suspension}} is {{a simple}} yet effective cell-based therapy for vitiligo. Materials and Methods: 20 patients with stable vitiligo were subjected to epidermal cell suspension transplantation using Osslon’s method with some new modifications. Result: The repigmentation at 7 of the <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> (35. 0 %) was excellent. It was good {{for more than half}} of the <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> (55. 0 %). Fair repigmentation was encountered among only 2 (10. 0 %) of the <b>tested</b> <b>sites.</b> None of the <b>tested</b> <b>sites</b> showed poor repigmentation. On the other hand, none of the control sites showed excellent or even good repigmentation. However, repigmentation was fair for nearly 10 % and it was poor for 90 % of the control sites. Conclusion: Autologus non cultured basal -enriched epidermal cell suspension transplantation is an effective, simple and safe method for treatment of stable vitiligo...|$|R
