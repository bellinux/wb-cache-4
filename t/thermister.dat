40|$|Internal−tide {{waves that}} travel great {{distances}} from their origin at ocean topographic features {{have been observed}} {{in the past several}} years by both acoustic tomography and altimetry. These waves have consisted of the lowest vertical modes, and their long temporal and spatial coherence is evident. R. Hendry (1977) using data obtained during the Mid−Ocean Dynamics Experiment (MODE) found the first observational evidence that low−mode internal tides can travel great distances. The MODE array consisted of 16 moorings with <b>thermisters</b> and current meters. Hendry found that the observed M 2 and S 2 internal tides likely originated from the Blake Escarpment, located 700 km to the east. Before the MODE experiment, low−mode internal waves had been expected from theoretical principles to have weak decay (LeBlond 1966), but they were not expected to remain coherent as they traveled distances distances of many wavelengths in the turbulent ocean environment (Wunsch 1975). Two decades after the MODE experiment and Hendry’s result, data from the 1987 Reciprocal Tomography Experiment (RTE 87) in the central North Pacific were used to show that mode− 1 internal tides at semidiurnal frequencies propagate at least 2000 km north from the Hawaiian Ridge (Dushaw, et al. 1995).

40|$|Abstract- This {{research}} {{proposes a}} wireless RFID-based thermal convection type inclinometer design, and relates more particularly to manufacture it on a flexible substrate. The key {{point is to}} integrate both an inclinometer and a wireless RFID antenna on the same substrate, such that the inclinometer is very convenient for usage. Both xenon and carbon dioxide gases were filled in the chamber, and the inner chamber shape was changed from the traditional rectangular to hemi-cylindrical one. The results by using floating and non-floating structures were studied firstly; note that the sensitivity curves by applying the non-floating structure were more linear, so it applied in this paper. To increase the sensitivity, the <b>thermisters</b> were stacked on some materials such as alumina nitride, copper and silicon. Three kinds of stacking height were studied, such as 1, 1. 5 and 2 mm. One can see the combinations of AlN/Xenon are always better. Besides, the xenon gas would not produce oxidization effect to the heater, it is more reliable. If the largest sensitivity is the key consideration, then H 2 = 1. 5 mm is the best choice (0. 4 °C/Degree), but the linear operating range is 45 °. However, If the largest linear operating range is the requirement, then H 2 = 2 mm is the best one (75 °), but the sensitivity is 0. 173 °C/Degree.

Little research, however, has been conducted on spatial aspects of BSCs, such as (micro) climate, biogeomorphology, and model-building for large area assessment and management. This preliminary experiment explores the micrometeorology of both a dry and a wet stand of BSC on a pediment in the Sonoran Desert. A researcher-induced precipitation event was used to simulate an actual precipitation event on a 0. 5 -m 2 plot; another, adjacent plot was left “dry. ” Using a <b>thermister,</b> connected to a datalogger, temperature above, in, and below the BSC was recorded in 5 -min intervals over a 24 -hr period. Simultaneously, using a solarimeter, incoming and outgoing radiation measurements were recorded at the same temporal scale and intervals.

40|$|Flow rate of a fluid {{through a}} pipe line {{is one of}} the most {{important}} variables that are required to be measured and controlled in a process plant in order to obtain better quality product with lesser cost of production. There are various effects, like the effect of energy associated with a flowing fluid through a pipeline, Doppler effect and effect of speed of the fluid suction pump on the flow rate etc. have been utilized in designing the various flow meters. In the anemometer type flowmeter the cooling effect of a flowing fluid on a temperature sensitive resistance, <b>thermister</b> or p-n junction diode is utilized. It has been observed that the transducer output using these flow sensors varies non-linearly with flow rate and hence requires a linearization part in the instrumentation system. In the present paper a modified p-n junction cooling technique has been used to design a flow sensor, which gives an output, varying linearly with flow rate. In the actual installation, the flow head consists of a flow tube made of insulating material like PVC of specified diameter and length with flange joints at both ends. At the middle portion of the flow tube four identical p-n junction diodes with metallic-dissipating surfaces are placed in the same diametrical plane at right angles to each other. The four diodes are arranged to form a bridge configuration supplied with an AC voltage. The rectified DC output voltage across a series resistance is suitably processed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{effects of}} two {{patterns}} of logging on the intragravel environment were studied in three Oregon coastal streams between June 1968 and June 1969. The watershed of one stream (Needle Branch) had been clearcut, {{and that of}} a second stream (Deer Creek) cut in staggered settings in 1966. A third watershed (Flynn Creek) served as an unlogged control. The dissolved oxygen content, biochemical oxygen demand, and temperature of the intragravel water were determined, {{as well as the}} size composition and organic content of the gravel. Changes were evaluated in terms of their effects on the survival of salmonid eggs and alevins. Water samples for analysis of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand were removed from the streambed by means of standpipes. Intragravel water temperature was obtained with a <b>thermister</b> probe forced into the redds and with thermograph probes buried at selected locations in the streambed. Gravel samples were removed from recent redds and from previously used spawning sites ("former redds") with a newly-developed sampler that incorporated dry ice and acetone to freeze an intact core of gravel around an iron pipe. Samples were cut into strata 8. 3 cm in depth and analyzed for size composition by volumetric displacement and for organic content by weight loss upon ignition. Dissolved oxygen in redds of Needle Branch averaged 7. 15 mg/ 1, whereas that in Deer Creek averaged 8. 91 mg/ 1 during 1969. Oxygen levels in Needle Branch redds in 1969 were 37. 4 percent lower than those reported in 1964. Oxygen in Deer Creek redds dropped 12. 7 percent in the same period. Dissolved oxygen at permanent standpipe locations was significantly lower than that in redds and showed greater variability. Oxygen levels were positively correlated with streamflow and negatively correlated with temperature. Organic content of the gravel ranged from 0. 33 to 7. 52 percent by weight; less than 3 percent of the organic material was larger than 6. 35 mm. The quantity of organic material was directly related to the amount of fine sediment in the sample. Recent redds in Needle Branch contained significantly less organic debris than did former redds. However, the organic content of redds in Needle Branch did not differ statistically from that in Deer and Flynn Creeks. The biochemical oxygen demand of the intragravel water averaged 1. 95 mg/ 1 for the three streams; differences among streams were not statistically significant. Stratification of fine sediment was evident in many redds, but a definite pattern of stratification could not be detected. Gravel size composition in Needle Branch did not differ statistically from that of the other streams. Recent redds in Needle Branch contained significantly less sediment than did former redds. Intragravel water temperature lagged from 2 to 6 hours behind surface temperature in attaining the diurnal maximum. Water temperature decreased with depth in the gravel in Needle Branch and Deer Creek on clear days, but the intragravel water was almost isothermal in Flynn Creek. Fluctuation in intragravel water temperature occurred as early as March, and maxima as great as 19. 7 °C were recorded prior to complete emergence of coho salmon. Surface and intragravel temperatures reflected the amount of shade over the stream surface. Survival to emergence of coho salmon appeared to be little affected by the observed changes in the intragravel environment...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 In 1996, Beach et al. first {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} mounting an echo-sounder on a Waverunner to measure nearshore beach profiles. This thesis discusses the Coastal Profiling System, {{an extension of the}} original work, which has been utilized to measure nearshore bathymetry at selected sites along the coasts of North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington. Position of the Coastal Profiling System is accurately measured five times per second using a differential global positioning system (DGPS), while depth below the hull is measured by an acoustic echo-sounder. Surveys can be conducted in waves up to 3 m and in depths of 1 - 15 m. The effects of waves, tides, and set-up are eliminated by the co-collection of position and depth data. In October 1997, extensive testing of the system took place at the SandyDuck ' 97 field experiment in Duck, NC. Nearshore bathymetric surveys were taken simultaneously by the Coastal Research Amphibious Buggy (CRAB) and the Coastal Profiling System (CPS). Comparison of the CPS with CRAB measurements interpolated to the same locations showed a mean bias of 4. 6 cm too shallow in the vertical and standard deviations about the bias of 5. 5 cm. The largest differences occur over the steeply sloping flanks of sand bars. The bias statistic, of central interest to these tests, is confused by the potential of boat tilt and by possible errors in the CRAB data itself. In July & August 1998, the system was tested as a tool for long-term coastal monitoring by the Southwest Washington Coastal Erosion Study in a regional morphology monitoring program (Ruggiero et al., 1997). A 2 - 3 km section in approximately the center of each of the four sub-cells of the Columbia River littoral cell, and an anomalous fifth site, was surveyed to map the morphology of each region. Alongshore-averaged profiles were decomposed into underlying AX[superscript m] profiles and deviations from this equilibrium profile. The mean of the exponents was close to 2 / 3 with m= 0. 70, but ranged between sites from 0. 56 to 0. 79. Shape parameters between 0. 027 and 0. 038 were estimated. Nearshore slopes (0 - 1 km cross-shore) were calculated from the exponential profile in the dissipative range with a minimum of 0. 0067 and a maximum of 0. 0089. However, no correlation was seen between the shape parameters and the 1 km nearshore slopes. An analysis of the deviations of the alongshore-averaged profiles from the equilibrium profile provided an objective method to determine sand bar positions from zero-down-crossings. Each site was characterized by a minimum of two sand bars in 2 - 6. 5 m (NAVD 88) depths with heights of 0. 2 - 2 m, lengths of 164 - 949 m and volumes of 48 - 534 m³/m. An additional bar in the swash zone between the + 1 m elevation and 1 m depth contour was resolved in some cross-shore profiles. The crest of the bar largest in height was located at 3 - 4. 5 NAVD 88 m at four of the five sites suggesting the profiles vary on similar cross-shore length scales amongst the sub-cells. A series of surveys in April, June, and October 1998 at the northern most site in Ocean City, WA demonstrated onshore bar migration and seaward accretion of the foreshore. This seasonal response was further quantified between August and October at Fort Canby. Three nearshore profiles surveyed by Willard Bascom et al. (1954) in the 1940 s were reoccupied to compare the shape of the morphology 50 years ago to present. These profiles demonstrate accretion of approximately 2 m elevation gains in the nearshore and 26 - 165 m of shoreline change. Although the Coastal Profiling System is a highly accurate, mobile and efficient method to obtain nearshore profiles, several improvements have been suggested. Future modifications to the system should include an increase in the precision of the echo-sounder measurements, higher sampling rates, and improvement of the user interface. Additional components may include an onboard navigation system, a <b>thermister</b> to measure temperature and salinity, and a motion sensor to measure roll and pitch of the vehicle...|$|E
