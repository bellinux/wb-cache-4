40|$|Delocalization of {{production}} and diversification {{of the sources of}} offer in the global market place <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> rights in major consumption centres, namely the European Union in a new light. A review <b>of</b> policies for <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> rights in <b>the</b> EU, USA and China, reveals major differences regarding <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> rights and <b>the</b> existence of gaps, and in particular the implementation of effective legislation in this regard. As such, the risks associated with imports have become a major concern in the European Union. The consumer has – one can say – {{a central role in the}} globalization process, which justifies the measures aimed at its protection. Although worldwide there are major differences in the degree of market regulation in matters <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> rights, <b>the</b> trend is the continuous adaptation of the offer to the requirements of global demand. However, one can still find significant gaps which translate into risks specific to the consumers in developed countries, namely in the EU. An important issue arises from this radical change of the localization {{of production}} centres in relation to the main consumption centres. While in the developed world, consumer rights protection has reached high levels both by creating an appropriate legislative framework and through consumer awareness and activism regarding their rights, in areas where much of the offer comes from the Western market (China, India, etc.) modern mentality on <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> rights is just emerging. A major requirement is therefore the provision of a status <b>of</b> the <b>consumer</b> compatible with the benefits and risks of globalization, a status defined by safety and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> imports. This paper confirms the thesis that, ultimately, the main factor counteracting the risks in matters <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> rights is <b>the</b> <b>consumer,</b> its awareness <b>of</b> its rights...|$|R

5000|$|Because state commissioners are {{the main}} regulators, the CFPB is {{unlikely}} to assume {{a leadership role in}} retirement investment regulation without further legislation and possibly a US constitutional amendment transferring insurance lawmaking power to the federal government. In 2011, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners identified [...] "the single most significant challenge for state insurance regulators is to be vigilant in <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers,</b> {{especially in light of the}} changes taking place in the financial services marketplace", and the CFPB may help fill this void. Many have argued the state-based system of insurance regulation (including insurance-like products such as annuities) is highly economically inefficient, results in uneven and non-portable insurance plans, artificially shrinks risk pools (especially in smaller states) resulting in higher premiums, limits mobility of brokers who have to re-certify in new states, complicates the needs of multi-state business, and should be replaced with a national insurance regulator or national insurance charter option as has taken place with the regulation of securities and banking.|$|E
50|$|Based {{upon the}} Québec civil code and the Loi sur la {{protection}} du consommateur every merchant {{is responsible to}} uphold the legal guarantee of a product. This legal guarantee protects the consumer from: purposefully hidden malfunctions, defaults {{that could not be}} readily identified at the moment of purchase, the guarantee that the item purchased can be used for its stated uses and finally guarantees a reasonable life expectancy based on the price paid. This guarantee survives even when the initial purchaser sells his goods to another person. A merchant cannot ask a consumer to pay any fees or shipping charges in order to be eligible to receive their legal guarantee. The office for <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> does not take a particular stance towards extended warranties. However, they recommend that consumers should be vigilant and question themselves whether the warranty really adds anything to the already applicable legal warranty. Finally they point out that the number of consumers who go to court against merchants {{in order for them to}} apply the legal warranty is almost proportional to the number of consumers who take legal means against a merchant for failing to respect extended warranties they have sold.|$|E
50|$|Concerns over {{food safety}} led to {{numerous}} regulations throughout the world. German food regulations released in 1882 stipulated {{the exclusion of}} dangerous minerals such as arsenic, copper, chromium, lead, mercury and zinc, which were frequently used as ingredients in colorants. In contrast to today, these first laws followed the principle of a negative listing (substances not allowed for use); they were already driven by the main principles of today's food regulations all over the world, since all of these regulations follow the same goal: <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> from toxic substances and from fraud. In the United States, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 reduced the permitted list of synthetic colors from 700 down to seven. The seven dyes initially approved were Ponceau 3R (FD&C Red No. 1), amaranth (FD&C Red No. 2), erythrosine (FD&C Red No. 3), indigotine (FD&C Blue No. 2), Light Green SF (FD&C Green No. 2), Naphthol yellow 1 (FD&C Yellow No. 1), and Orange 1 (FD&C Orange No. 1). Even with updated food laws, adulteration continued {{for many years and}} this, together with more recent adverse press comments on food colors and health, has continued to contribute to consumer concern about color addition to foodstuffs.|$|E
