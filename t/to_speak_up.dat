Willow attends a meeting of the campus Wicca group, hoping to meet others who share her interest in studying witchcraft, but is disappointed when they only talk about bake sales. Willow raises the subject of spells but is chastised for pandering to the stereotype about witches performing magic.

5|$|The DAP {{sought to}} {{pressure}} Robert Lau Hui Yew over the government's proposed Goods and Services Tax, {{arguing that the}} tax would increase prices for consumers in one of Malaysia's poorest states. The DAP, through its leader Lim Kit Siang also pressured Hui Yew <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> against the government's education policy, claiming that Hui Yew's choice to have his children educated overseas demonstrated his {{lack of confidence in}} Malaysian education. On education, the DAP also criticised SUPP's involvement in the sale of the Laila Taib College, previously known as United College Sarawak, to the Yayasan Sarawak (Sarawak Foundation) for the price of one ringgit, when the local Chinese population had donated money to fund the college's building.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful crew resource management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew Resource Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew Resource Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Research {{suggests}} that "silence", i. e., not voicing safety concerns, is common among {{health care professionals}} (HCPs). Speaking up about patient safety is vital to avoid errors reaching the patient and thus to prevent harm and also to improve a culture of teamwork and safety. The aim of our {{study was to explore}} factors that affect oncology staff's decision to voice safety concerns or to remain silent and to describe the trade-offs they make. METHODS In a qualitative interview study with 32 doctors and nurses from 7 oncology units we investigated motivations and barriers <b>to</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> towards co-workers and supervisors. An inductive thematic content analysis framework was applied to the transcripts. Based on the individual experiences of participants, we conceptualize the choice to voice concerns and the trade-offs involved. RESULTS Preventing patients from serious harm constitutes a strong motivation <b>to</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> but competes with anticipated negative outcomes. Decisions whether and how to voice concerns involved complex considerations and trade-offs. Many respondents reflected on whether the level of risk for a patient "justifies" the costs of <b>speaking</b> <b>up.</b> Various barriers for voicing concerns were reported, e. g., damaging relationships. Contextual factors, such as the presence of patients and co-workers in the alarming situation, affect the likelihood of anticipated negative outcomes. Speaking up to well-known co-workers was described as considerably easier whereas "not knowing the actor well" increases risks and potential costs of <b>speaking</b> <b>up.</b> CONCLUSIONS While doctors and nurses felt strong obligation to prevent errors reaching individual patients, they were not engaged in voicing concerns beyond this immediacy. Our results offer in-depth insight into fears and conditions conducive of silence and voicing and can be used for educational interventions and leader reinforcement...|$|R
25|$|One {{important}} aspect of shyness is social skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly assume children are fully capable of effective social interaction. Social skills training is not given any priority (unlike reading and writing) and as a result, shy students are not {{given an opportunity to}} develop their ability to participate in class and interact with peers. Teachers can model social skills and ask questions in a less direct and intimidating manner in order to gently encourage shy students <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> in class, and make friends with other children.|$|E
25|$|After the crash, {{airlines}} began enacting {{policies to}} ensure {{that at least one}} older, more seasoned crew member was on board planes at all times. They also began reappraising the traditional unwritten rule that the captain had ultimate authority on a flight and could not be questioned. From that point onward, first officers were encouraged <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> if they believed a captain was making a mistake. Finally, as this was the first major accident involving a low-cost carrier, the FAA started paying more strict attention to low-cost airlines, many of which were engaging in risky operating practices to reduce costs.|$|E
25|$|Su Ze (died 223), {{courtesy}} name Wenshi, was {{an official}} of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period of China. Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty, he started his career as the Administrator of various commanderies in northwest China and is best known for governing Jincheng Commandery (covering parts of present-day Gansu and Qinghai) between 215 and 220. During his tenure, he rebuilt the war-torn commandery, gained the support of local non-Han Chinese tribes, opened up trade along the Hexi Corridor, and suppressed rebellions in the neighbouring Xiping, Wuwei, Jiuquan and Zhangye commanderies. After the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Su Ze served in the Cao Wei state under its first ruler, Cao Pi, as a Palace Attendant. An upright and outspoken man, he did not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> when he disagreed with Cao Pi, who became wary of him. In 223, Su Ze died of illness while travelling to present-day Shandong to assume a new appointment.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979, there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In the modern Bahá'í community of New Zealand the Bahá'ís have multiplied their interests internally and externally. Aside from major themes there have also been individual work done in variety of topics - for example post-traumatic stress syndrome. Additionally the community has continued to advocate with the New Zealand government <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> on behalf of the persecuted Bahá'ís in Iran.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} several years Sara is abused by Miss Minchin and the other servants, except for Becky. Amelia deplores how Sara is treated but is too weak <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> about it. Sara is starved, worked for long hours, sent out in all weathers, poorly dressed in outgrown and {{worn-out}} clothes, and deprived of warmth or a comfortable bed in the attic. Despite her hardships, Sara is consoled by her friends and uses her imagination to cope, pretending she is a prisoner in the Bastille or a princess disguised as a servant. Sara also continues to be kind and polite to everyone, including those who treat her badly. One day she finds a coin in the street and uses it to buy buns at a bakery, but despite being very hungry, she gives most of the buns away to a beggar girl dressed in rags who is hungrier than herself. The bakery shop owner sees this and wants to reward Sara, but she has disappeared, so the shop owner instead gives the beggar girl bread and warm shelter for Sara's sake.|$|E
