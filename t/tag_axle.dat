5000|$|The {{original}} 74-minute TV movie used a <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> 1955 Peterbilt 281. It {{was destroyed}} in the film's climactic crash scene. A 2nd 281, a 1960 with <b>tag</b> <b>axle,</b> was prepared as a backup, but went unused. It has {{been in and out}} of its Duel [...] "make-up" [...] since. The surviving truck also made a cameo in the beginning of the 2004 movie Torque.|$|E

5000|$|Holiday Rambler Corporation is an American {{corporation}} which primarily manufactures recreational vehicles. It {{was founded}} in 1953. In 1961, Holiday Rambler’s introduction of aluminum body framing ushered {{in a new era}} of lighter, stronger and more durable recreational vehicles (RVs). This aluminum frame (Alumaframe) became the standard for lighter and stronger RVs for 40 years. Holiday Rambler was also responsible for many firsts; built-in refrigerators, holding tanks and aerodynamic radiused corners. As Holiday Rambler moved into motorhomes, they were the first with <b>tag</b> <b>axles</b> and the kitchen slide-out revolutionized [...] "interior engineering" [...] in the field. Holiday Rambler was sold to Harley-Davidson in 1986 and later in 1996 to the Monaco Coach Corporation where its future, then under Navistar International Corp., was difficult in 2010 as it was for most motorhome manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Trailways drivers and maintainers {{referred}} to 'Round' (01 and 05 Old Look) Eagles and 'Square' (05 New Look and 07) Eagles {{based on the}} body design. The 01 Eagles had the drive axle ahead of the <b>tag</b> <b>axle.</b> The 05 and 07 Eagles had the <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> ahead of the drive axle which made them 'interesting' to drive. The front suspension was very soft {{with a lot of}} travel, and since the <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> torsion bar (mounted crosswise) was also pushing the front end up, some drivers said it was like driving a diving board when while driving on certain road surfaces. The front end went up and down at every expansion joint in the road and sometimes the driver had to grip the steering wheel hard to remain seated. On the other hand, Eagles had almost no body roll in curves or corners, unlike buses with air suspension which gave the feeling they were about to tip over when turning. All older Eagles had suspension seats for their drivers and some drivers would take the hydraulic jack from the tool kit and set it up under their seat to stop its vertical motions.|$|E
5000|$|Peterbilt model numbers {{traditionally}} {{started with}} a [...] "2" [...] for single drive rear axle <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> models, and with a [...] "3" [...] for dual drive rear axle model from 1939 until 1981 with the 362. Peterbilt eliminated this distinction in the late 1970s.|$|E
50|$|A dead axle, {{also called}} a lazy axle, {{is not part}} of the drivetrain, but is instead free-rotating. The rear axle of a front-wheel drive car is usually a dead axle. Many trucks and {{trailers}} use dead axles for strictly load-bearing purposes. A dead axle located immediately in front of a drive axle is called a pusher axle. A <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> is a dead axle situated behind a drive axle. Dead axles are also found on semi trailers, farm equipment, and certain heavy construction machinery serving the same function. On some vehicles (such as motorcoaches), the <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> may be steerable. In some designs the wheels on a lazy axle only come into contact with ground when the load is significant, thus saving unnecessary tire wear.|$|E
50|$|After 1986 {{when the}} series was bought by Glenn Donnelly of DIRT (Drivers Independent Race Tracks) the GATR trucks became highly {{modified}} with the bodies being cut and lowered, losing the <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> and shedding more than 2,000 pounds in weight. The last sanctioned GATR race in the US was in July 1993 at Rolling Wheels NY.|$|E
50|$|The {{coach was}} 40 feet long, eight {{feet wide and}} almost 11 feet tall. It weighed 26,100 {{unloaded}} and 34,485 loaded. Unlike the future Scenicruiser, the GX-2 had its driving wheels {{at the very back}} of the coach. The intermediate <b>tag</b> <b>axle,</b> also called the dead axle, differed in having two wheels instead of four later.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1988, Blue Bird gave {{both the}} front and rear-engine All American school buses their first {{redesign}} since the late 1950s. The last Forward Control Wanderlodges were sold {{at the end of}} the 1989 model year. In 1991, the rest of the Wanderlodge lineup (two pushers; single and <b>tag</b> <b>axle)</b> received extensive exterior facelifts to look even less like school buses.|$|E
50|$|The K94IB, K114IB and K124IB {{were the}} {{standard}} coach and intercity bus chassis with a rigid front axle. Like the K EB type, they were available as two-axle (4x2), tri-axle (6x2) and tri-axle with steered <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> (6x2*4), {{and on the}} Latin American market also as quad-axle (8x2). The K94IB was quite rare, {{as it was in}} may ways in direct competition with the L94IB as an intercity bus.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} a {{tri-axle}} K94UB (K94UB6x2/4LB) was produced in 2000. In Hong Kong, the K94UB has been fitted with a Volgren CR224LD 12m double-deck bodywork and is currently in operation with Citybus in Hong Kong. It {{is equipped with a}} 260 hp Euro III engine (which was uprated to 300 hp before entering service) and a hydraulically (ZF - RAS) steered <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> in front of the drive axle.|$|E
50|$|The K94EB, K114EB and K124EB {{were the}} only 4-series chassis with {{independent}} front suspension, being the primary choice for premium coaches. They were available as two-axle (4x2), tri-axle (6x2) and tri-axle with steered <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> (6x2*4). A normal tri-axle coach would have the full designation of K124EB6x2NI, {{but because of the}} independent front suspension it was also available as K124EB6x2LI with low front, which made it possible to have a gangway between the front wheel arches and a low driving position, making it suitable for use in double-decker coaches.|$|E
50|$|Volvo Buses India Pvt Ltd in Hosakote, {{near the}} city of Bengaluru, started {{production}} of the Volvo B7R bi-axle coaches since 2000. At present, they offer the Volvo 9400 range. In addition to the standard 12 m 9400 (B7R or B9R chassis), they offer since 2012 also the 13.7 m tri-axle 9400XL (B9R 6x2 chassis) and the luxurious 14,5 m tri-axle 9400PX (B11R 6x2 chassis).The 9400PX is provided with a steerable <b>tag</b> <b>axle</b> to help it handle tight corners.The latter being the first on the new light-weight Volvo PX platform.|$|E
5000|$|During its lifespan, {{the first}} {{generation}} of the Transit Home/Wanderlodge saw relatively modest mechanical changes. For 1977, to improve the fuel economy and low-speed performance of the Wanderlodge, Blue Bird introduced the Caterpillar 3208 diesel V8, which replaced the Ford gasoline engines entirely after 1978. [...] In 1982, a rear-engine version of the Wanderlodge was introduced with a Detroit Diesel 6V92 (an 8V92 became an option in 1986). [...] In contrast to the All American Rear Engine, Blue Bird built the chassis for the rear-engine Wanderlodge, which was also fitted with a rear <b>tag</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The classic narrow-nose {{butterfly}} hood Peterbilt {{made from}} 1954 until 1976. The truck was made notorious {{with the public}} {{with the release of}} Steven Spielberg's 1971 thriller Duel, which featured a 1950s Peterbilt 281. (This truck was not a 351 because it had one <b>tag</b> <b>axle.)</b> The 351 was also available after 1971 in a setback front axle (SBFA) configuration (Peterbilt's first such design) aimed at the east coast market. Nicknamed [...] "The Autocar Fighter" [...] by some staff. The design of the companion trucks made way for later models, as the 351 SBFA evolved into the 353.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, design {{improvements}} {{came with}} the updated versions, PD-4108 (35 ft) and PD-4905 (40 ft) both with a 24-volt electrical system. The driver's controls were updated for both. The biggest complaint about the 4905 and 4903, from the drivers’ point of view, was that the extra 5 ft of length was all between {{the front and rear}} axles. It was very easy to scrape the baggage compartment doors on tight turns. The 4905s looked just like 4108s but with three baggage compartments. Some 4905s had a <b>tag</b> <b>axle,</b> with a single extra wheel on each side, located in the third baggage compartment, but it was forward of the drive axle, so turning radius was not affected.|$|E
5000|$|The Galaxy 300T was {{introduced}} in 1979. It was built on a Renault or Volvo chassis, with a DAF or MAN engine. It was also offered later on DAF or Scania chassis. An integral version was available from 1982. In 1984 the Panoramic 350T {{was introduced}}, also as a unibody coach or on others’ chassis. It achieved modest success as an export model luxury touring coach, primarily in the United States because of its relatively low price. The main difference between European and North American LAG coaches was the third (<b>tag)</b> <b>axle</b> on the latter. The lavatory’s position was also optional in America, {{as it could be}} located mid-ship on the lower level, or {{at the rear of the}} passenger area. In either instance it reduced passenger capacity by four, rather than the more common two seats. In 1989 the 3-series was replaced by the EOS 100.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, some {{semi-trailer}} trucks {{have eight}} tires on three axles on the tractor; these {{are known as}} six-wheelers or [...] "six leggers", with either the center or rear axle having single wheels which normally steer {{as well as the}} front axle and can be raised when not needed (i.e. when unloaded or only a light load is being carried; an arrangement known as a <b>TAG</b> <b>axle</b> when it is the rear axle, or mid-lift when it is the center axle). Some trailers have two axles which have twin tires on each axle; other trailers have three axles, of which one axle can be a lift axle which has super-single wheels. In the UK, two wheels bolted to the same hub are classed as a single wheel, therefore a standard six-axle articulated truck is considered to have twelve wheels, even though it has twenty tires. The UK also allows semi-trailer truck which have six tires on two axles; these are known as four-wheelers.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{power unit}} was the Leyland 0.680 rated {{at up to}} 200 bhp with the Leyland 0.600 with outputs from 125-140 bhp as an option, these were mounted {{vertically}} and transversely at the rear. The front axle was a Worldmaster unit and the rear {{was similar to the}} Worldmaster unit but with the driving head inverted. Leyland Self-Changing Gears Pneumocyclic transmission was offered in 4 or 5-speed versions, with electric or pneumatic control. Drive was transmitted from engine to gearbox through either a centrifugal clutch or in later models via a fluid-friction coupling which enabled a solid connection at higher road speeds. An Eaton two speed driving head to the axle was optional. For the Australian market only a third <b>tag</b> <b>axle,</b> mounted ahead of the rear axle, was also offered. This was based on the Worldmaster rear axle but without a driving head, and was fitted into a suspension system based on that of the Albion Reiver 6x2 lorry. The purpose was to reduce axle loading. Most of the 6x2 Lions went to the Western Australian Government Railways and had passenger and cargo bodies fitted.|$|E
