5|$|Several {{authorities}} had included the northern pika as a subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> pika. However, in 1973, Nikolai Vorontsov and Elena Ivanitskaya, {{pointed out the}} difference between their chromosome numbers. In 1980, Vladimir Sokolov and V. N. Orlov treated them as separate species, with their ranges overlapping in the Khenteii and Khangai Mountains in Mongolia. It is believed that after glaciation, the ancestors of <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> pika were restricted to {{the borders of the}} Sayan and Altai glaciers, as well as the periglacial region of the major North Asiatic glaciation. The American pika and the collared pika were also included as subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> pika, by A.I. Argyropulo in 1948, A.A. Gureev in 1964, and G.B. Corbet in 1968. However, in 1981, M.L. Weston found out that they were morphologically different from <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> pika. In 1986, Corbet and J.E. Hill treated them as separate species. O. a. sushkini was formerly considered a subspecies of the Pallas's pika, but is now a subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> pika. The Helan Shan pika and the Hoffmann's pika were formerly included as a subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> pika, but are now considered an independent species based on their chromosome number, morphology, and bioacoustic behaviour.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, <b>the</b> <b>Alpine</b> chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). <b>The</b> <b>Alpine</b> chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Alpine</b> chough lays its eggs {{about one}} month later than its relative, {{although}} breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour. The first-year survival rate of the juvenile red-billed chough is 72.5 percent, and for <b>the</b> <b>Alpine</b> it is 77%. The annual adult survival rate is 83–92% for Alpine, but is unknown for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|The most {{predominant}} {{plant species}} in <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> zone around the pass are the grass species {{adapted to the}} harsh climate. Other alpine flora, such as moss and lichens on the rocks, and wildflowers in season, make appearances. Shrubs that survive among them include strawberry, snowberry, willows and bog birch. Animals in <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> zone include ptarmigans, small burrowing species like pika, marmots, and pocket gopher, and mountain goats.|$|E

5|$|The {{rippling}} preep and whistled sweeeooo {{calls of}} <b>the</b> <b>Alpine</b> chough {{are quite different}} from the more typically crow-like chee-ow vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed chough.

In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in <b>the</b> <b>Alpine</b> chough showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{twice as}} {{powerful}} as <b>the</b> <b>Alpine,</b> the Tiger is only about twenty per cent heavier, but the extra weight of the larger engine required some minor suspension modifications.

5|$|Both choughs {{occupied}} {{more extensive}} ranges in the past, reaching to more southerly and lower altitude areas than at present, with <b>the</b> <b>Alpine</b> chough breeding in Europe {{as far south}} as southern Italy, and both the decline and range fragmentation continue. Red-billed choughs have lost ground in most of Europe, and Alpine choughs have lost many breeding sites in the east of the continent. In the Canary Islands, the red-billed chough is now extinct on two of the islands on which it formerly bred, and <b>the</b> <b>Alpine</b> was lost from the archipelago altogether.|$|E

5|$|Several {{animal species}} inhabit Level Mountain, notably brown bears, wolves, long-tailed jaegers, caribou, {{mountain}} goats, ptarmigans, moose, long-tailed ducks and Stone sheep. Wolves occupy valleys and use <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> areas for hunting and denning. Also common in <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> are brown bears, which are potential predators of newborn caribou calves. The caribou at Level Mountain form a herd {{that is part}} of a larger population ranging west of the Dease River and north of the Stikine River into Yukon. More than 400 caribou were identified at Level Mountain in 1978, although the Ministry of Environment and Parks considered the herd to be declining due to poor recruitment. By 1980, the caribou population was estimated to have been roughly 350.|$|E

5|$|The female's {{fecundity}} is low, as {{with other}} pikas inhabiting talus piles, {{and the size of}} litters decreases as the elevation increases. A.F. Potapkina observed a seasonal {{increase in the number of}} offspring per litter. On average, the female of the western Altai Mountains produces two litters, while in the northwestern Altai and the western Sayan Mountains she produces 2.7 litters—with 10% producing up to three litters in the latter case. In 1984, G.I. Makushin and G.I. Orlov determined the average annual mortality rate of <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> pika to be 53% for populations living in forests and 41% for those living in <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> zones—most of them aged between one and three years. The annual population density fluctuations of most populations were insignificant.|$|E

5|$|Tree growth above those patches is curtailed by <b>the</b> <b>alpine</b> {{climate of}} the pass. It is {{characterized}} by severe changes in temperature, high winds and the deep winter snow. The resulting short growing season is made even shorter by the thin soil.|$|E
5|$|Where the two chough species occur together, {{there is}} only limited {{competition}} for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst <b>the</b> <b>Alpine</b> chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, <b>the</b> <b>Alpine</b> chough mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Where the {{two species}} occur in the same mountains, <b>the</b> <b>Alpine</b> species tends to breed at a higher {{elevation}} than its relative, since it is better adapted for a diet at high altitudes.|$|E
