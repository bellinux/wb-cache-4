5000|$|Scott {{warns that}} the most tragic [...] "state episodes" [...] in recent history {{originates}} with a genuine desire to improve the human condition. These tragic state episodes begin with an authoritarian state implementing policies reflecting high modernist ideals amidst a weak civil society. While Scott is not categorically opposed to high modernism or legibility, he warns that a false perception of human knowledge and social engineering is a dangerous combination. As a result, the negative implications of legibility should be thoroughly considered when contemplating networked advocacy plans, {{even if they are}} well-intentioned. The anonymity of data is one area of concern that deserves special attention. If states seek to impose their scientific beliefs, and methods for making populations legible, what does <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> ICTs whose very purpose is to lower the cost of collaboration and information? The prior literature discussed here has shown that digital technologies and platforms can be leveraged for collective and social benefits, can hold state’s accountable, or can provide modalities of governance in areas where no state seemingly exists. ICTs have the ability to play a very different role when examined against a backdrop of James Scott and population legibility, one that aims for control and repression rather than liberation and collaboration. This raises the possibility for the state to use ICTs for purposes that are enslaving, quite the opposite of liberating. One of the problems with such state initiated standardization, even when done with the best of intentions, is that it robs a community of its very ability to resist to this state imposition and control, and even total authoritarian repression. Another problem arises from, {{in the case of a}} digital and abundant information environment, who controls the data? If the state also has a total monopoly over the information environment, then control and manipulation in this day and age become as easy as pressing a button, wiretapping a phone call, or locating political dissidents to within mere feet of their physical location represented on a GIS map. As Scott states, the technologies and capabilities now available to “enhance the legibility of a society to its rulers have become vastly more sophisticated, but the political motives driving them have changed little - appropriation, control, and manipulation remain the most prominent (77).” ...|$|E

5000|$|A leading {{proponent of}} {{educational}} modernization, Brumbaugh oversaw {{reform of the}} teacher training curriculum {{for the state of}} Louisiana. After the American Invasion of Puerto Rico, then a wealthy overseas province of Spain, and the Treaty of Paris of 1899, Brumbaugh was charged with implementation of an American-style educational system in Puerto Rico. What did <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> the Island? At that time, and since the early 1500s the Island's educational system was based in Castilian Spanish. By order of King Ferdinand the Catholic, every church had to have a School Parish and all children were to be educated -"in letters and numbers, in science and Faith"- up to 6th grade. There had been a close coordination between the civil authorities and the Catholic Church parish schools and since the mid 1700s Puerto Rico had a semi-public school system. Around the 19th century education was modernized and the Civil authorities took over a greater role, with the aid of the Church. By the 1880s every Mayoralty had its own Education Board, coordinated with the island's Education Ministry, and with that of Spain's. When Brumbaugh took over, Puerto Rico's alphabetization (literacy?) levels in the urban centers was about 98%. The first thing done by Gen. Brooks, the newly appointed military occupation governor (by President McKinley) was to fire and deport the entire priesthood that managed parishes and their schools, who at the time depended on the civil government for their salaries. 36 of the 74 Island parishes and parish schools were left without a priest and teacher. Upon taking over, the first thing Martin G. Brumbaugh did was to dissolve the entire Education Ministry that had been in place for centuries. Then Brumbaugh had the entire public school faculty, most of whom were trained professors of either Antillean or Peninsular Spanish origins, fired and deported. He then brought from the US a great number of Anglophone school teachers, including his cousin Dr. D. Brumbaugh, considered more [...] "friendly to the American cause". The problem was that the American school teachers spoke only English, and the island's primary language was Spanish, with great numbers of French and Italian speakers. In less than 18 months, after Brumbaugh took over, school absenteeism shot up to 98% with the ensuing performance collapse of a population that spoke one language and the teachers another. Those children who did go to school were punished for speaking Spanish, and put down for their culture. The next thing Brumbaugh did, with the backing of the US Military Government, was to change the entire curriculum, to [...] "Americanize it". He re-wrote the entire Puerto Rican history curriculum, sanitized it and purged from it any data threatening to the [...] "American cause". In addition, he began to edit and doctor data so as to exacerbate anything political or social by the former Spanish Authorities, making it negative, out of context and proportion, in a national humiliation process that caused tremendous public outrage and protests. To this day, the island's educational system is still suffering from Brumbaugh's [...] "reforms". After he left Puerto Rico he held lecturer positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University. In 1906, he became superintendent of the Philadelphia Public Schools and gained statewide recognition for his performance in this role.|$|E
