5|$|Critics in {{the media}} noted BA's build quality faults, such as {{inconsistent}} gaps between trim sections and joints, although other commentators praised the interior design and craftsmanship. In the used car market, BA Falcons tend <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> poor depreciation rates, due to influxes of ex-fleet models entering the second-hand market {{and because of the}} cost of fuel.|$|E
5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> quantum triviality issues. This {{is one of the}} motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s {{job losses}} due to {{industrial}} restructuring caused New York City, including Manhattan, <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> economic problems and rising crime rates. While a resurgence {{in the financial}} industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through the decade and into {{the beginning of the}} 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) {{have few}} instances; {{there is one}} example of a generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> poor stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.|$|E

5|$|Pack {{breeding}} {{early in}} its development {{led to a}} level of genetic variation, so the hereditary conditions of more popular breeds are not common in the AWS. The breed however is known <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> eye issues including cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy. Inheritance is suspected in both conditions, with the average age of cataract onset at under one year old.|$|E
5|$|The castle's exposed {{position}} {{causes it}} <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> penetrating damp and periodic restoration {{work has been}} necessary. The stone tiles on the roof were replaced by slate in 1972, a major programme was carried out on the Keep in 2007 and interior conservation work was undertaken in 2011 to address problems in Lady Bute's Bedroom, where damp had begun to damage the finishings.|$|E
5|$|A {{site for}} a church had been set aside on the estate from the outset, and in 1884 Plumbe {{submitted}} designs for a church and mission hall. The mission hall opened in March 1885 with room for 350, and soon began <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> overcrowding. The people of Noel Park started a fund {{to pay for the}} church, which was consecrated on 1 November 1889 as St Mark's.|$|E

Arriving at her office, Mulder finds Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) waiting inside, having been selling the contents of the digital tape. Krycek escapes through a window while Jeraldine is shot by a group of men coming down the hallway. Mulder unlocks the handcuffs and escapes.

5|$|Double Live {{was to be}} {{the last}} Butthole Surfers album to feature Nervosa, who left early in 1989. Shortly after leaving, she was {{diagnosed}} with an aneurysm, and was forced to undergo brain surgery. She further began <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> strobe light-induced seizures. In 1991, Nervosa (who has gone by Teresa Taylor since her retirement) had a small role in Richard Linklater's film Slacker. She was employed at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired as recently as 1995.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E

5|$|Four years later, in 1798, a M.Tessier of Versailles {{hospital}} contacted Percy {{to notify}} {{him that a}} patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could {{find some way to}} remove it. Percy, however, recognised him as suffering from advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Imelda Marcos was {{instrumental}} in the 1980 exile of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., who had suffered a heart attack during his imprisonment. Martial law in the Philippines was later lifted in 1981 but Ferdinand Marcos continued to be president. While her husband began <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> lupus, she effectively ruled in his place. Aquino returned in 1983 but was assassinated at the Manila International Airport upon his arrival. With accusations against her beginning to rise, Ferdinand created the Agrava Commission, a fact-finding committee, to investigate her, ultimately finding her not guilty.|$|E

5|$|Part of the {{original}} Middlesex County Council office building that stood on site was incorporated into the new Civic Centre. The centre's clock tower is the only visible section from the old building. The Uxbridge Cricket Club Ground and Uxbridge fire station were relocated {{as part of the}} new development, which became controversial owing to its size and cost. Areas of the building, particularly the council chambers, continue <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> poor acoustics.|$|E
5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E
