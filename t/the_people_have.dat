Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had the right to a speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor.|$|E
5|$|My {{situation}} is most critical, not from anything the enemy can do, {{but from the}} disposition of the people– The Population, believe me is essentially bad– A full belief possesses them that this Province must inevitably succumb– This Prepossession is fatal to every exertion– Legislators, Magistrates, Militia Officers, all, have imbibed the idea, and are so sluggish and indifferent in all their respective offices that the artful and active scoundrel is allowed to parade the Country without interruption, and commit all imaginable mischief... What a change an additional regiment would make {{in this part of}} the Province! Most of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> lost all confidence– I however speak loud and look big.|$|E

5|$|We {{believe that}} it is the {{inalienable}} right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

25|$|Malachi also criticizes his {{audience}} for questioning God's justice. He reminds them that God is just, exhorting {{them to be}} faithful as they await that justice. Malachi quickly goes on {{to point out that}} <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> not been faithful. In fact, the people are not giving God all that God deserves. Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, so <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been neglecting to offer their full tithe to Elohim. The result of these shortcomings is that the people come to believe that no good comes out of serving God.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Kenneth Wheare has theorized that Parliament obtains the {{necessary}} constituent power {{to bring a}} constitution into force simply {{by virtue of the}} election of its members into office. Since the constitution is a representation of the will of the people, and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> exercised their will to elect MPs as their representatives, the Parliament has the requisite constituent power to enact the constitution. The hiatus was also solved when Parliament made the RSIA retrospective to 9 August 1965.|$|E
25|$|The core of Deuteronomy is the {{covenant}} that binds Yahweh and Israel by oaths of fidelity (Yahweh and Israel each {{faithful to the}} other) and obedience (Israel obedient to Yahweh). God will give Israel blessings of the land, fertility, and prosperity so long as Israel is faithful to God's teaching; disobedience will lead to curses and punishment. But, according to the Deuteronomists, Israel's prime sin is lack of faith, apostasy: contrary to the first and fundamental commandment ("Thou shalt have no other gods before me") <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> entered into relations with other gods.|$|E

25|$|All {{nations in}} the Darkness series are monarchies with the {{exception}} of Kuusamo, in which seven princes have a hereditary power-sharing arrangement.

There are foreign ministers, but no prime ministers and no cabinets - a foreign minister evidently reporting directly to the King. None of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> family names, even if they are members of the nobility. To the extent that monarchs are limited in their power, the limitation comes mainly from hereditary aristocracies which still maintain many privileges of feudal times.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1995 that a {{constitutional}} reform recognized such cultural leaders, {{but they have not}} been fully restored to previous powers, as so much of society has changed. In the pre-colonial era, all the Acoli believed in the same superior being, lubanga, through an intermediary deity, known as the jok-ker, which meant ‘the ruling deity’. Killing of a person was prohibited but if it took place, negotiations for blood money were led by the victim's family, with agreement followed by rituals of a reconciliation ceremony to restore the killer to the community, and to bring peace between clans. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> important rituals for cleansing homes and sites, to welcome back people who have been away a long time, to clear spirits from places where killings have occurred, and to welcome people who have been captive.|$|E
