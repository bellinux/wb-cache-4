The Coulomb balance {{electrometer}} requires {{experience to}} be understood; but I think it a very valuable instrument {{in the hands of}} those who will take pains by practice and attention to learn the precautions needful in its use. Its insulating condition varies with circumstances, and should be examined before it is employed in experiments. In an ordinary and fair condition, when the balls were so electrified as to give a repulsive <b>torsion</b> <b>force</b> of 100° at the standard distance of 30°, it took nearly four hours to sink to 50° at the same distance; the average loss from 400° to 300° being at the rate of 2°.7 per minute, from 300° to 200° of 1°.7 per minute, from 200° to 100° of 1°.3 per minute, and from 100° to 50° of 0°.87 per minute. As a complete measurement by the instrument may be made in much less than a minute, the amount of loss in that time is but small, and can easily be taken into account.|$|E

After the {{levelling}} of {{the instrument}} and adjustment of the glass thread, the blocks which determine {{the place of the}} carrier ball are to be regulated (1181.) so that, when the carrier arrangement is placed against them, the centre of the ball may be in the radius {{of the instrument}} corresponding to 0° on the lower graduation or that {{on the side of the}} electrometer, and at the same level and distance from the centre as the repelled ball on the suspended torsion lever. Then the torsion index is to be turned until the ball connected with it (the repelled ball) is accurately at 30°, and finally the graduated arc belonging to the torsion index is to be adjusted so as to bring 0° upon it to the index. This state of the instrument was adopted as that which gave the most direct expression of the experimental results, and in the form having fewest variable errors; the angular distance of 30° being always retained as the standard distance to which the balls were in every case to be brought, and the whole of the torsion being read off at once on the graduated circle above. Under these circumstances the distance of the balls from each other was not merely the same in degree, but their position in the instrument, and in relation to every part of it, was actually the same every time that a measurement was made; so that all irregularities arising from slight difference of form and action in the instrument and the bodies around were avoided. The only difference which could occur in the position of anything within, consisted in the deflexion of the torsion thread from a vertical position, more or less, according to the force of repulsion of the balls; but this was so slight as to cause no interfering difference in the symmetry of form within the instrument, and gave no error in the amount of <b>torsion</b> <b>force</b> indicated on the graduation above.|$|E

30|$|The low {{incidence}} of delayed union and non-union {{in our study}} might be attributed to stable anatomic reduction and limited soft tissue stripping, or due to small number of cases. Some authors reported loss of reduction {{with the use of}} tension-band technique as a result of K. wires become loose end and migrate proximally (Mack and Szabo 2005). On the other hand many authors did not agree with the frequency of this complication and reported that with the proper surgical techniques, wire migration was not a problem (Kinik and Mergen 1999). In our study we did not see any wire migration or loss of reduction. Tension-band fixation of the medial malleolar fractures has been described or referred to previously by many authors (Muller et al. 2000; Finsen et al. 1989). Ostrum and Litski recently demonstrated the biomechanics advantages of the tension-band over other fixation techniques for medial malleolus. When resisting pronation forces and applying compression force tension-band were four times stronger than malleolar screw (Ostrum and Listsky 2008). This might explain the faster union rate we were achieved in group 2 patients (mean of 9.4  weeks) as compared with group 1 patients (mean of 11.8  weeks). Rovinsky in his study showed that the tension-band is more technically advantageous over other types of fixation for fixation of small fragment fracture of medial malleolus and is not recommended for the fixation of vertical fracture (Rovinsky et al. 2000). We agree with these results as in our study we fixed few vertical fractures with horizontally directed malleolar screws but we excluded them from the comparison groups. Screw fixation alone may provide poor stability against <b>torsion</b> <b>forces</b> (Savage et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2005). This may requires an additional point of fixation, which may be a second screw or a Kirschner wire. Dr. Jones in his study disagrees with these results and showed that single screw fixation had similar results to double screw fixation (Jones 1997). In the current study we use additional point of fixation (second screw and K wire) in two cases in which the fragment was large and tend to rotate as screw fixation alone may provide poor stability against <b>torsion</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|R

This paper discusses bearing stiffeners’ contribution in enhancing double-symmetric I-sections’ torsion capacity. Based on the Saint Venant’s formula torsion stresses are carried solemnly by the section, neglecting the stiffeners’ contribution. However, these stiffeners exhibit significant rotational deformation with the I-section in warping, indicating development of internal forces, restraining the warping. Therefore, the negligence of stiffeners’ contribution in Saint Venant’s torsion formula {{has to be}} revised. Torsions within the stiffeners are the Saint Venant’s and torsion-shear-stresses induced by bending. Assuming out-of-plane stresses neglected, normal and bending-shear torsion stresses are zero, leaving only the Saint Venant’s. From equilibrium at the stiffener –to-flange’s-joint, the stiffeners’ natural boundary conditions equation can be obtained. Their presence leads to a rotational-torsion function differentiation along the beam, between stiffeners. But since all points have identical internal <b>torsion</b> <b>forces,</b> the disturbed differential torsion warping equations are identical. Using the geometrical and natural boundary conditions equation the mathematical-rotational-torsion-solution for each field along the beam is obtained.

However, recent structural design codes neglect the contribution of concrete because of cracking. This paper reports {{on the results of}} an experimental and numerical investigation into the torsional capacity of concrete beams reinforced only by longitudinal rebars without transverse reinforcement. The experimental investigation involves six specimens tested under pure torsion. Each specimen was made using a cast-in-place concrete with different amounts of longitudinal reinforcements.
