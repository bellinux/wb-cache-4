In one incident, he <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Paeonians (originally from Thrace), who Darius {{had brought to}} live in Phrygia, {{to return to their}} homeland. Herodotus says that his only purpose in doing this was to vex the Persian high command.|$|E
5|$|Though the Republican {{legislative}} candidates {{won more}} popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite {{the bitterness of}} the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1860, with William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron looming as rivals for the nomination. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency. In January 1860, Lincoln <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed Lincoln for president.|$|E

25|$|Another notable {{action of}} his term was a strict new ethics law. When campaigning for {{re-election}} in 2006, Blagojevich said that if his ethics law had existed when former governor George Ryan had been in office, Ryan's corruption might not have occurred. Blagojevich also signed a comprehensive death penalty reform bill that was written by then-Senator Barack Obama and the late U.S. Senator Paul M. Simon. Organized labor and African Americans were Blagojevich's staunchest political supporters. In 2008, he <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> African-Americans that he sometimes considered himself the first African American governor of Illinois.|$|E
500|$|Another decisive {{limitation}} in the German-Japanese alliance {{were the}} fundamental {{differences between the}} two nation's policies towards Jews.

500|$|Television cameras {{broadcast}} {{to the nation}} the scenes of fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and police dogs attacking unprotected demonstrators. [...] Such coverage and photos were given credit for shifting international support to the protesters and making Bull Connor [...] "the villain of the era". President Kennedy <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> people at the White House that The New York Times photo made him [...] "sick".

Currie, Allen and Sloan all {{expressed}} regret. Rowe felt vindicated, claiming the affair as evidence that his scans were correct. Rowe published a Brief Communication in Nature in 2001 describing his findings. He concluded that, apart from the top part, several specimens {{had been used to}} complete the fossil: a first for the left femur, a second for the tibiae, a third for both feet and at least one more for the tail, which alone consisted of five separate parts.|$|E
500|$|On April 15, Keyes {{confirmed}} his split from the Republican Party and {{his intention to}} explore the candidacy of the Constitution Party. He lost his bid for the party's nomination, however, coming in second to 2004 CP vice presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin at the party's national convention in Kansas City, Missouri, on April 26, 2008. During the convention, the party's founder, Howard Phillips, gave a controversial speech in which he referred to Keyes as [...] "the Neocon candidate" [...] who [...] "lingered in the Republican Party until a week ago." [...] Following the defeat, Keyes held an interview with Mike Ferguson in which he compared his defeat to an abortion.

50|$|Stories {{were used}} to deter and correct certain behaviours. For example, a story may be <b>told</b> to <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> {{children}} that when you whistle during the night, you will encounter a spirit being (seha). This was meant to scare the children not to whistle during the night to avoid disclosing their location to an enemy. The stories were normally given by the elders (grandfathers) near a bonfire. Grandmothers also gave stories to the children before bedtime.|$|R

500|$|In July 1936, the Spanish Civil War {{started after}} an {{attempted}} coup d'état by {{parts of the}} Spanish Army against {{the government of the}} Second Spanish Republic. At the same time, the Spanish anarchists, fighting against the Nationalist forces, started an anarchist revolution. Goldman was invited to Barcelona and in an instant, as she wrote to her niece, [...] "the crushing weight that was pressing down on my heart since Sasha's death left me as by magic". She was welcomed by the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) organizations, {{and for the first time}} in her life lived in a community run by and for anarchists, according to true anarchist principles. [...] "In all my life", she wrote later, [...] "I have not met with such warm hospitality, comradeship and solidarity." [...] After touring a series of collectives in the province of Huesca, she <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> workers: [...] "Your revolution will destroy forever [...] that anarchism stands for chaos."
