5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> are necessary for a bike to balance itself. They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts {{the ground in front}} of the steering axis, and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated. Bicycle dynamics was named 26 of Discovers 100 top stories of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Against Hampshire, Ring took 1/19 as {{the home}} team made 195 after being put into bat on a drying pitch. He made a duck as Australia {{collapsed}} to 117 <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> by 78 runs, {{the first time the}} tourists had conceded a first innings lead during the English summer. Ring was not required to bat in the Australian second innings, as Hampshire were bowled out for 103 in 42.5 overs and Australia then reached their target of 182 to win by eight wickets. Ring had a final chance to push for Test selection in the innings win over Sussex, the last match before the First Test. He bowled only two wicketless overs as the pacemen skittled the hosts for 86, and did not bat as Australia amassed 5/549 declared. He then took three consecutive wickets as Sussex fell from 5/98 to 8/109 before eventually being bowled out for 138. Ring ended with 3/42 from 13 overs.|$|E

5|$|At the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{began his}} title defence by beating Robin Hull 10–4 {{in the first}} round. Playing Joe Perry in the second round, O'Sullivan was behind {{for the first two}} sessions, but {{recovered}} to win the match 13–11. Up against Shaun Murphy in the 16th World Championship quarter-final of his career, O'Sullivan took 13 of the last 14 frames to win the match 13–3, with a session to spare. He defeated Barry Hawkins 17–7 in the semi-finals, also with a session to spare, to reach his sixth World Championship final. Facing Mark Selby in the final, O'Sullivan began strongly, taking a 10–5 lead, but lost 10 of the next 12 frames <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> 12–15. He went on to lose 14–18, his first ever defeat in a World Championship final. At around 1:30a.m., on their way home from the final, O'Sullivan and his six-year-old son were involved in a car crash. Neither O'Sullivan nor his son were injured. After the World Championship, a new ranking system took effect, based on a two-year rolling prize money list rather than ranking points. This meant that O'Sullivan ended the season ranked number 4.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the ranges of coyotes and gray wolves overlap, {{interference}} competition and predation by wolves has been hypothesized to limit local coyote densities. Coyote ranges expanded during the 19th and 20th centuries following the extirpation of wolves, while coyotes were driven to extinction on Isle Royale after wolves colonized the island in the 1940s. One study conducted in Yellowstone National Park, where both species coexist, concluded that the coyote population in the Lamar River Valley declined by 39% following the reintroduction of wolves in the 1990s, while coyote populations in wolf inhabited areas of the Grand Teton National Park are 33% lower than in {{areas where the}}y are absent. Wolves have been observed to not tolerate coyotes in their vicinity, though coyotes have been known <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> wolves to feed on their kills.|$|E

5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{final game}} of the round {{featured}} intrastate rivals Duke and North Carolina in their third meeting of the season. In the first quarter, the Blue Devils jumped out to an early lead and survived a two-man-down penalty, but the Tar Heels scored four unanswered goals to briefly take the lead in the second quarter. Late in the final period, North Carolina rallied from a four-point deficit <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> by one goal, 12–11. As time expired, a shot by Sean Delaney missed high over the goal, and Duke defeated North Carolina for the third time of the year. The Blue Devils' Zach Howell scored a career-high three goals and Tewaaraton Trophy finalist Ned Crotty tallied twice and had six assists. The Duke defense held Carolina's leading scorer, Billy Bitter, to just two assists.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its {{operational}} history, the Tu-142 demonstrated significant capabilities. On , four Tu-142s shadowed {{a foreign}} submarine in the Barents Sea; {{one of the}} aircraft {{was reported to have}} maintained continuous contact for 2 hours and 55 minutes. In 1975, a Tu-142 managed <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> a Soviet submarine for 3 hours and 16 minutes. On , a group of five Tu-142s tracked a US submarine in the Philippine Sea; one of the Tu-142s reportedly trailed the submarine for 4 hours and 5 minutes. Soviet Tu-142s, besides operating domestically, were sent to friendly overseas bases in Angola, Cuba, Ethiopia, Vietnam, and Yemen. In the early 1990s, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Soviet fleet of Tu-142s was handed to the Russian Navy, although the Ukrainian Air Force gained a few Tu-142s that had been left in its territory. Ukrainian Tu-142s were later dismantled {{as a result of the}} bilateral START I treaty signed between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1991, which came into effect in late 1994.|$|E

5|$|Woods {{began his}} 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) {{where he started}} off well, but {{struggled}} on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out {{in the second round}} by missing a 5-foot putt, Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT National, <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Carrick for the second season in a row was a shock starter at Wembley for the 2011 FA Community Shield. After {{initially}} being ruled out through injury by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the pre-match build up, Carrick was named in the starting eleven for the game on 7 August 2011. In the first half, United fell behind to a Joleon Lescott header and a long range Edin Džeko strike <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> 2–0 at half time. Carrick was then substituted at the interval and replaced by youngster Tom Cleverley. However United went on to turn the game around and prevail 3–2 winners. The day after the Shield match, Carrick pulled out of England's friendly match against the Netherlands to rest a niggling injury. He was replaced in the squad by Tom Cleverley. On 18 December, Carrick scored his first goal for United for 70 games when he advanced from his own half of the pitch after cutting out Joey Barton's square ball, past a couple of defenders and firing low past the keeper. He eventually won the Man of the Match award. On 4 January 2012, Carrick played his 250th match for Manchester United in all competitions in a 3–0 away defeat to Newcastle United. He celebrated his Jubilee in a 3–2 away victory against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup third round. On 14 January 2012, Carrick scored for United in a 3–0 home win against Bolton. In the 83rd minute, Carrick notched his first goal at Old Trafford since January 2010. He curled a left-footed effort past Ádám Bogdán into the bottom corner. On 16 February 2012, in a Europa League 2–0 away win against Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena, Carrick played his 500th match in all competitions. Carrick also showed his class when he thundered a shot from 30 yards against the post in a 2–0 win against QPR on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|Neither team {{scored a}} {{touchdown}} in the first quarter, instead both scoring field goals, which extended into the first score of the second quarter. Later in the quarter, Matt Forté scored on a 53-yard run, allowing the Bears to take the 10–6 lead. However, after a David Akers field goal, the Lions would score three unanswered touchdowns, all within 3 minutes, 26 seconds: Micheal Spurlock's 57-yard punt return led to Matthew Stafford's 1-yard run, while Jay Cutler was intercepted by Glover Quin, which set up Stafford's 2-yard pass to Calvin Johnson; finally, the Lions scored after Reggie Bush found a hole and hurdled over Bears' safety Major Wright {{en route to a}} 37-yard touchdown. The 27 points scored in the quarter was the most by the Lions since September 30, 2007 against the Bears. The Bears ended the half with a field goal, but continued <b>to</b> <b>trail</b> 30–13. After the Bears kicked a field goal in the third quarter, Cutler was intercepted again, this time by Louis Delmas. However, Chicago regained possession after Stafford's pass to Johnson was kicked and caught by Wright. Three plays later, Cutler was sacked by Ndamukong Suh, and fumbled; the ball was picked up by Nick Fairley, who ran four yards for the touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Akers kicked another field goal to put the Lions up 40–16. Afterwards, the Bears began to mount a charge, with Cutler throwing a 14-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery with less than four minutes in the game, followed by a two-point conversion on another pass to Jeffery. With 43 seconds remaining, a ten-yard pass to Earl Bennett and a two-point conversion off a throw to Brandon Marshall drew the Bears within eight points, but the eventual onside kick was recovered by Lions receiver Kris Durham, allowing the Lions to clinch the 40–32 victory.|$|E
