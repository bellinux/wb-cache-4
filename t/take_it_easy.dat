5|$|On 19 May 2014, {{the news}} {{reported}} that McCartney had been bedridden on doctor's orders {{due to an}} unspecified virus, which forced him to cancel a sold-out concert tour of Japan that was scheduled to begin later in the week. The tour would have included {{a stop at the}} famed Budokan Hall. McCartney also had to push his June US dates to October, as part of his doctor's order to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to make a full recovery. However, he resumed the tour with a high-energy three hour appearance in Albany, New York, on 5 July 2014. On 14 August 2014, McCartney performed the final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California before its demolition. It was the same venue that the Beatles played their final concert in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Peart {{got a job}} in Lakeside Park, in Port Dalhousie on {{the shores}} of Lake Ontario, which later {{inspired}} a song of the same name on the Rush album Caress of Steel. He worked on the Bubble Game and Ball Toss, but his tendency to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> when business was slack resulted in his termination. By his late teens, Peart had played in local bands such as Mumblin’ Sumpthin’, the Majority, and JR Flood. These bands practiced in basement recreation rooms and garages and played church halls, high schools and roller rinks in towns across Southern Ontario such as Mitchell, Seaforth, and Elmira. They also played in the northern Ontario city of Timmins. Tuesday nights were filled with jam sessions at the Niagara Theatre Centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} covered {{several times in}} 1965, {{including}} a version by The Turtles on their album It Ain't Me Babe and a version by The Walker Brothers on their album <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>Easy</b> with The Walker Brothers. Los Angeles band The Leaves covered the song on their 1966 album Hey Joe and Joan Baez included it on her 1968 album of Dylan covers Any Day Now. A version by singer/songwriter Turley Richards became a minor hit in 1970 (US #84). It was also covered in 1993 by Judy Collins on Judy Collins Sings Dylan... Just Like a Woman. Eric Clapton covered the song on during Bob Dylan's 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration. Other musicians who have covered the song include Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Jackson Browne, Ricky Nelson, Buck Owens, Bridget St. John, Eliza Gilkyson, and Les Fradkin.|$|E

25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{made it a point to}} <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and he was not going to hurt her.|$|E
500|$|Triggered by {{the death}} of Krusty's father, Lisa becomes obsessed with {{protecting}} her own father, [...] Homer, from getting hurt. She wraps him in bubble wrap, which ends up saving his life when Otto's school bus plows into the garden. Eventually Marge and Bart talk some sense into Lisa, that while it is nice of her to be concerned for her father, she should not force Homer to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> on himself and just let him live his life.|$|E
500|$|In early May 1967, Taylor {{announced}} that Smile had been scrapped, but the Beach Boys were still under pressure and {{a contractual obligation}} to record and present an album to Capitol. On June 2, Brian declared to his bandmates {{that most of the}} material recorded for Smile was now off-limits. According to Carl, [...] "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of it instead. We're just going to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy.</b> I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was Smiley Smile." [...] In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". He says: [...] "I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things ... And we had so much fun. The Smiley Smile era was so great, it was unbelievable. Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great. I didn't have any paranoia feelings." [...] Carl described the end product as [...] "a bunt instead of a grand slam".|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{positive}} comment was made by Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph: [...] "If I were him, I'd <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> {{for the next few}} months. If I were a West End producer, I'd book this sharpish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Artist Nick Cardy, a {{colleague}} at the Eisner studio, said Powell [...] "came in later when I was doing [...] 'Lady Luck'. He was sitting behind me. He would help a kid {{around the block}} — tell a newcomer to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> {{and that sort of}} thing".|$|E
2500|$|Vandersloot {{became a}} {{basketball}} star at Kentwood High School in her hometown. Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at Central Washington University who is 6inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either {{before or after}} the team's practice. He would later say, [...] "I did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her. I'd put my hand in her face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.' [...] " [...] She eventually reached the point where she regularly beat her coach off the dribble.|$|E
60|$|But Jerry {{knew the}} way well, {{so he did}} not mind the darkness. He let the team go their own gait, and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> in the rick {{on a couple of}} horse blankets.|$|R
60|$|Two {{men still}} {{remained}} on guard. The others <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy,</b> and did {{very much as}} they pleased. All waited for Riley and the others to return with Fetter, bringing in old Benson as a prisoner.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{found it}} hard to believe that the punch could have floored a man like Liston. Hall of Fame {{announcer}} Don Dunphy said, [...] "Here was a guy who was in prison and the guards used to beat him over the head with clubs and couldn't knock him down." [...] But others contend that he wasn't the same Liston. Dave Anderson of the New York Times said Liston [...] "looked awful" [...] in his last workout before the fight. Liston's handlers secretly paid sparring partner Amos Lincoln an extra $100 to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> on him. Arthur Daley of the New York Times wrote that Liston's handlers knew he [...] "didn't have it anymore." [...] These comments don't accord with the fact that Liston easily beat Amos Lincoln three years later in 1968, knocking him out inside two rounds.|$|E
2500|$|Nina Wadia has praised Womack and Wallace {{for their}} [...] "acting skills" [...] during the storyline. Wadia told The Sun: [...] "Sam and Jessie were amazing {{and it all}} got taken away from them because people made it out like a real baby had died. It's a soap. It's portraying fictional characters!" [...] Marc Elliott added: [...] "The storyline got whipped up into a massive frenzy. It's not {{representative}} in any way, shape or form of mothers {{who have lost their}} babies." [...] EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer has also praised the plot for its [...] "great acting". In an interview with <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>Easy,</b> asked whether the show's bosses handled the storyline well, Palmer replied: [...] "I think they did. I know there's been loads of bad press, but something like that {{is always going to be}} sad to watch and it will upset people. But at the end of the day, it's a drama and it's not real. I think it got blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, things like that do happen in real life. Babies get swapped and snatched in hospitals. I'm sure that any parent who has lost a child will find even talking about their experience very difficult, let alone watching it being acted out on television. Even my daughter got upset but she is only 9 so maybe I shouldn't have let her watch it. I just didn't realise it was going to be so heart-wrenching, which was down to the great acting." ...|$|E

60|$|Several days, {{including}} Sunday, passed, {{and the six}} cadets <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy.</b> <b>It</b> snowed part of the time, so {{that they}} went out hunting only once. On that trip they managed to get several more rabbits and four quail, but that was all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Compeyson <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> as a {{good riddance}} for both sides. Him and me was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own book,--this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> after Bemis left me. Had a game {{of tennis}} at the Blanchards' as I came along, dinner at the club, and strolled up here with the fellows. Got a headache, and don't feel up to much." ...|$|R

I'm her brother, and perhaps ought to be a little modest in sich matters; but I an't a bit, and let out jist what I think. Blossom's a di'mond, if there be di'monds on 'arth." ...|$|E
60|$|After many {{instructions}} {{they took}} {{a view of the}} embankment. Their walk had tired the photographer, who was rather stout, and he proposed that they rest. Near at hand was a section shed with some lumber piles, and there they <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In a 2016 {{interview}} Kotka {{talked about}} her running background: [...] "I have always loved outdoor life and kept active with skiing, biking, hiking, diving, yoga but not running. But in 2010 I signed up to run Lidingöloppet as a challenge and got obsessed with trail running while practicing for it. That was my thing! Then I <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> in 2012, 2013 and in January 2014 I decided to go all in. Train more focused. It {{was a little too}} focused in 2015. I ran a lot and got injured. In 2016 I <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> and now I seem to have found a formula that works. It is more fun than ever to run and my body thrives." ...|$|R

60|$|Besides the fish, {{they had}} chicken sandwiches, cake, pie, {{and half a}} dozen other things to eat, and coffee, and water from a {{sparkling}} spring to drink. When they had finished, they <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for a while, and then fished some more, and went strolling.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must bathe your ankle with liniment," [...] cried Belle. [...] "I'll {{get some}} for you," [...] and soon she {{presented}} Roger with the stuff.

50|$|Coppi {{also won}} the last {{mountain}} stage, stage 21, and increased his lead to more than 31 minutes.
