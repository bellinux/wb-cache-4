Determining <b>the</b> optimal <b>sequence</b> of <b>join</b> operations in query optimization leads to exponential complexity.

40|$|Mouse mammary {{tumor virus}} (MMTV) {{has long been}} implicated in mouse mammary carcinogenesis, {{and it is now}} well {{established}} that the long terminal repeat (LTR) contains regulatory sequences responsible for glucocorticoid-mediated induction of viral RNA. However, we have demonstrated previously that androgens as well as glucocorticoids can regulate MMTV RNA in the S 115 mouse mammary tumor cell line. To determine if androgens act directly on the LTR in these cells, plasmids were constructed with <b>the</b> MMTV LTR <b>joined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coding <b>sequences</b> of genes not normally expressed in the cells. Following transfection of these chimeric genes into S 115 cells, we show that the expression of the genes is regulated by both androgens and glucocorticoids. Furthermore, hormonal regulation is also conferred by the LTR on the neighboring guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) gene. Thus, androgens can act on the LTR of MMTV when the appropriate receptors are present in the cells, and this interaction can influence the expression of additional adjacent genes...|$|R

In this paper: we introduce the SNJoin (or Sensor-Network Join) operator that is specially designed for dynamicallyconfigured large-scale sensor networks. SNJoin is a multi-way join operator that scales with respect to the number of data-streaming sources without compromising the output rate. Moreover: in a sensor field with hundreds or thousands of sensors. every single sensor does not have <b>to</b> participate in <b>the</b> <b>join.</b> Insteatl: bundles of sensors that experience the same environmental condit,ions may join with each other. <b>The</b> SNJoin operator <b>joins</b> sensor data partially and updates its result the arrival of new <b>joining</b> tuples. introduce <b>the</b> SNJoin * operator as the distributed variation of the SNJoin operator. The ultimate goal of the SNJoin * operator is <b>to</b> shift <b>the</b> <b>join</b> query processing from the centralized data stream management system (DSMS) to the sensor-network level. To avoid unnecessary communication cost, the SNJoin * operator accepts relevance feedback to tune query processing to sensors that show similar behavior. The relevance feedback is computed based on <b>the</b> <b>join</b> output <b>to</b> guide <b>the</b> <b>join</b> probing <b>sequence</b> <b>to</b> sensors that are more likely <b>to</b> <b>join.</b> Experiment. al studies illustrate the performance gains of <b>the</b> proposed multi-way <b>join</b> operators. ...|$|R
40|$|Rap 1 small GTPases {{interact}} with Rap 1 -GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM), {{a member of}} the MRL (Mig- 10 /RIAM/Lamellipodin) protein family, to promote talin-dependent integrin activation. Here, we show that MRL proteins function as scaffolds that connect <b>the</b> membrane targeting <b>sequences</b> in Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins. The MRL proteins bound directly to talin via short, N-terminal sequences predicted to form amphipathic helices. RIAM-induced integrin activation required both its capacity to bind to Rap 1 and to talin. Moreover, we constructed a minimized 50 -residue Rap-RIAM module containing the talin binding site of RIAM <b>joined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> membrane-targeting <b>sequence</b> of Rap 1 A. This minimized Rap-RIAM module was sufficient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to mediate integrin activation, {{even in the absence of}} Rap 1 activity. We identified a short talin binding sequence in Lamellipodin (Lpd), another MRL protein; talin binding Lpd sequence <b>joined</b> <b>to</b> a Rap 1 membrane-targeting sequence is sufficient to recruit talin and activate integrins. These data establish the mechanism whereby MRL proteins {{interact with}} both talin and Ras GTPases to activate integrins...|$|R
40|$|In the LDL-receptor gene, a large {{rearrangement}} causing hypercholesterolemia {{was detected}} in three apparently unrelated families living in northern Italy. In all probands, binding, internalization, and degradation of 125 I-LDL measured in skin fibroblasts {{were found to}} be 40 %- 50 % of control values, indicative of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Southern blot analysis revealed that the probands were heterozygous for a large (25 -kb) deletion of the LDL-receptor gene eliminating exons 2 - 12. The affected subjects possessed two LDL-receptor mRNA species: one of normal size (5. 3 kb) and one of smaller size (3. 5 kb). In the latter mRNA, <b>the</b> coding <b>sequence</b> of exon 1 is <b>joined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coding <b>sequence</b> of exon 13, causing a change in the reading frame and thereby giving rise to a premature stop codon. The receptor protein deduced from <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> of <b>the</b> defective mRNA is a short polypeptide of 29 amino acids, devoid of any function. Tracing these three families back to the 17 th century, we found both their common ancestor and the possible origin of the mutation, in a region which is called "Lomellina" and which is located in southwest Lombardy, near the old city of Pavia. Therefore we named the mutation "FH-Pavia. ...|$|R

Lyt- 3 is {{expressed as a}} heterodimer with Lyt- 2, and this complex {{is considered to be}} a homologue of the human Leu- 2 /T 8 (CD 8) that has been postulated to be a receptor for the class I major histocompatibility complex.

Analysis of the predicted amino acid <b>sequence</b> indicates that <b>the</b> Lyt- 3 polypeptide has a 21 -amino acid leader peptide, and the mature protein consists of an NH 2 -terminal region of 146 amino acids, a transmembrane region of 27 residues, and a C-terminal region of 19 amino acids. The NH 2 -terminal 110 residues show clear homology to the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin variable region sequences. In addition, Lyt- 3 has 11 residues that have strong homology <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>joining</b> region <b>sequences</b> of <b>the</b> T-cell receptor and the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. The presence of immunoglobulin variable- as well as joining-region-related sequences in Lyt- 3 further supports the idea that these molecules may be recognition molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin super gene family...|$|R
40|$|Literary {{orientation}} and stylistic novelty used by Beihaghi in writing his history {{has made this}} work a distinguishable work among all historical works of Persian language. This work bears many advantages with regard to both Persian prose and historiography. It is also an ethical and educational work. Since {{one of the important}} features of this eraâs prose is the using of verses and hadiths, the authors of this article aim to investigate descriptively-analytically the stylistic and rhetorical art of Beihaghi with regard to using verses and hadiths in this work. Thus, two main questions are raised: 1) regarding the kind of using verses and hadiths in the prose of that era, which methods have been used more by him? 2) have such verses and hadiths had other functions and usages and how much have they added to the stylistic significance and art of him? The results of this study show that, more than being a decorative element prevalent in that era, these verses and hadiths have been used for political, moral and instructive functions as well as analyzing the personality of people, suspension etc. In this study, some instances of using verses which <b>join</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> of prose without any distance and have moral instructive function are pointed out as the most prominent methods of using verses and hadiths...|$|R

There is an orchestral {{intonation}} of 36 bars {{before the}} explosive {{entrance of the}} chorus. Each of these bars is a single stress of lower tones, weakening {{till the end of}} the bar. These bass beats are accompanied by the remaining instruments of higher tunes, by legato singing the prospective theme. The last six bars of the orchestral intro produce a robust crescendo, arriving to shouting forte initial three bars of the chorus, where <b>the</b> chorus <b>joins</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long <b>sequence</b> of deep stresses by Herr, Herr, Herr.

Finally, the entire A section is repeated."Herr, unser Herrscher" [...] and [...] "O Mensch, bewein dein Sünde groß" [...] are very different in character. The latter is full of torment in its text, but a serenely majestic piece of music.

40|$|Rapid {{desensitization}} of ligand-gated {{ion channel}} receptors {{can alter the}} apparent activity of receptor modulators, as well as make detection of fast-channel activation difficult. Investigation of the antagonist pharmacology of ATP-sensitive homomeric P 2 X 3 receptors is limited by agonist-evoked fast-desensitization kinetics. In the present studies, chimeric receptors were created using <b>the</b> coding <b>sequence</b> for <b>the</b> N-terminus and the first transmembrane domain of either the nondesensitizing human P 2 X 2 a or fast-desensitizing P 2 X 3 receptor <b>joined</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> encoding <b>the</b> extracellular loop, second transmembrane domain, and C-terminus of the other receptor (designated P 2 X 2 – 3 and P 2 X 3 – 2, respectively). These clones were stably transfected into 1321 N 1 astrocytoma cells for biophysical and pharmacological experiments using both electrophysiological and calcium-imaging methods. Chimeric P 2 X 2 – 3 and P 2 X 3 – 2 receptors were inwardly rectifying and agonist responses showed desensitization properties similar to the wild-type human P 2 X 2 a and P 2 X 3 receptors, respectively. The P 2 X 2 – 3 chimera displayed an agonist pharmacological profile similar to the P 2 X 3 wild-type receptor being activated by low concentrations of both ATP and α,β-meATP. In contrast, the P 2 X 3 – 2 chimera had markedly reduced sensitivity to both agonists. The P 2 X 3 receptor antagonists TNP-ATP and A- 317491 were shown to be potent, competitive antagonists of the P 2 X 2 – 3 chimera (Ki= 2. 2 and 52. 1 nM, respectively), supporting the hypothesis that rapid receptor desensitization can mask the competitive antagonism of wild-type homomeric P 2 X 3 receptors...|$|R
