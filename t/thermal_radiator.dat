40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide final results of a {{pointing}} stability analysis for external payload attachment sites (PAS) on the International Space Station (ISS). As a specific example, the pointing stability requirement of the SAGE III atmospheric science instrument was examined in this paper. The instrument requires 10 arcsec stability over 2 second periods. SAGE 3 will be mounted on the ISS starboard side at the lower, outboard FIAS. In this engineering analysis, an open-loop DAC- 3 finite element model of ISS was used by the Microgravity Group at Johnson Space Flight Center to generate transient responses at PAS to a limited number of disturbances. The model included dynamics up to 50 Hz. Disturbance models considered included operation of the solar array rotary joints, <b>thermal</b> <b>radiator</b> rotary joints, and control moment gyros. Responses were filtered to model the anticipated vibration attenuation effects of active control systems on the solar and <b>thermal</b> <b>radiator</b> rotary joints. A pointing stability analysis was conducted by double integrating acceleration transient over a 2 second period. Results of the analysis are tabulated for ISS X, Y, and Z Axis rotations. These results indicate that the largest excursions in rotation during pointing occurred due to rapid slewing of the <b>thermal</b> <b>radiator.</b> Even without attenuation at the rotary joints, the resulting pointing error was limited to less than 1. 6 arcsec. With vibration control at the joints, to a maximum 0. 5 arcsec over a 2 second period. Based on this current level of model definition, it was concluded that between 0 - 50 Hz, the pointing stability requirement for SAGE 3 will not be exceeded by the disturbances evaluated in this study...|$|E
40|$|The International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) {{has chosen}} dust {{mitigation}} technology as a Global Exploration Roadmap (GER) critical technology {{need in order}} to reduce life cycle cost and risk, and increase the probability of mission success. NASA has also included Particulate Contamination Prevention and Mitigation as a cross-cutting technology to be developed for contamination prevention, cleaning and protection. This technology has been highlighted due to the detrimental effect of dust on both human and robotic missions. During manned Apollo missions, dust caused issues with both equipment and crew. Contamination of equipment caused many issues including incorrect instrument readings and increased temperatures due to masking of <b>thermal</b> <b>radiators.</b> The astronauts were directly affected by dust that covered space suits, obscured face shields and later propagated to the cabin and into the crew's eyes and lungs. Robotic missions on Mars were affected when solar panels were obscured by dust thereby reducing the effectiveness of the solar panels.

40|$|A {{pressurized}} lunar rover {{is necessary}} for future long-term habitation of the moon. The rover {{must be able to}} safely perform many tasks, ranging from transportation and reconnaissance to exploration and rescue missions. Numerous designs were considered in an effort to maintain a low overall mass and good mobility characteristics. The configuration adopted consists of two cylindrical pressure hulls passively connected by a pressurized flexible passageway. The vehicle has an overall length of 11 meters and a total mass of seven metric tons. The rover is driven by eight independently powered two meter diameter wheels. The dual-cylinder concept allows a combination of articulated frame and double Ackermann steering for executing turns. In an emergency, the individual drive motors allow the option of skid steering as well. Two wheels are connected to either side of each cylinder through a pinned bar which allows constant ground contact. Together, these systems allow the rover to easily meet its mobility requirements. A dynamic isotope power system (DIPS), in conjunction with a closed Brayton cycle, supplied the rover with a continuous supply of 8. 5 kW. The occupants are all protected from the DIPS system's radiation by a shield of tantalum. The large amount of heat produced by the DIPS and other rover systems is rejected by <b>thermal</b> <b>radiators.</b> The <b>thermal</b> <b>radiators</b> and solar collectors are located {{on the top of the}} rear cylinder. The solar collectors are used to recharge batteries for peak power periods. The rover's shell is made of graphite-epoxy coated with multi-layer insulation (MLI). The graphite-epoxy provides strength while the thermally resistant MLI gives protection from the lunar environment. An elastomer separates the two materials to compensate for the thermal mismatch. The communications system allows for communication with the lunar base with an option for direct communication with earth via a lunar satellite link. The various links are combined into one signal broadcast in the S-band at 2. 3 GHz. The rover is fitted with a parabolic reflector disk for S-band transmission, and an omnidirectional antenna for local extravehicular activity (EVA) communication. The rover's guidance, navigation, and control subsystem consists of an inertial guidance system, an orbiting lunar satellite, and an obstacle avoidance system. In addition, the rover is equipped with a number of external fixtures including two telerobotic arms, lights, cameras, EVA storage, manlocks, a docking fixture, solar panels, <b>thermal</b> <b>radiators,</b> and a scientific airlock. In conclusion, this rover meets all of the design requirements and clearly surpasses them in the areas of mobility and maneuverability...|$|R
