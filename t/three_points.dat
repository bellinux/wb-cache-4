40|$|We {{construct}} the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> function involving an axial vector current and two energymomentum tensors for four dimensional conformal field theories. Conformal symmetry determines {{the form of}} this <b>three</b> <b>point</b> function uniquely up to a constant factor if the necessary conservation conditions are imposed. The gravitational axial anomaly present on a curved space background leads to a non-zero contribution for the divergence of the axial current in this <b>three</b> <b>point</b> function even on flat space. Using techniques related to differential regularisation which guarantee that the energy-momentum tensor is conserved and traceless, we calculate the anomaly in the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> function directly. In this way we relate the overall coefficient of the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> function to {{the scale of the}} gravitational axial anomaly. We apply our results to the examples of the fermion and photon axial currents...|$|R
40|$|In {{this note}} {{we present a}} simple method of {{constructing}} general conformally invariant <b>three</b> <b>point</b> functions of operators of various spins in three dimensions. Upon further imposing current conservation conditions, we find new parity violating structures for the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> functions involving either the stress-energy tensor, spin one currents, or higher spin currents. We find that all parity preserving structures for conformally invariant <b>three</b> <b>point</b> functions of higher spin conserved currents can be realized by free fields, whereas there is at most one parity violating structure for <b>three</b> <b>point</b> functions for each set of spins, which is not realized by free fields.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to compare and unveil efficiency of electro-hydraulic control (EHR) system to mechanical <b>three</b> <b>point</b> hitch regulation in mouldboard ploughing. Increase of working velocity and <b>three</b> <b>point</b> hitch automatic regulation activity decreased depth of ploughing at both regulation systems but electro-hydraulic system done it more accurately since deviation from default value was 10 % less than at mechanical regulation system. Electro-hydraulic <b>three</b> <b>point</b> hitch control system decreased wheel slip up to 30 % in comparison to mechanical regulation system. Net energy requirement at mechanical <b>three</b> <b>point</b> hitch regulation system spent 3 % more energy than electro-hydraulic control system. If wheel slip reduction influenced by electro-hydraulic control system would be added one could account on greater energy savings than previously mentioned value. The greatest working rates were achieved at the greatest working velocity (8, 0 km h- 1), while exactly at that velocity the greatest working rate increase of 3, 8 % influenced by electro-hydraulic <b>three</b> <b>point</b> hitch control was noticed...|$|R
