500|$|While {{other films}} {{tend to use}} only one {{storyboard}} artist, Jumper required six, who each worked on an individual action sequence. The artists were given specific instruction on {{the rules of the}} teleportation used in the film, to ensure accuracy in the storyboarding. One of them, Rob McCallum, reflected on the instructions: [...] "I was just thinking, 'How would a guy that can teleport fight?' So you were really pushing yourself to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> inventive, cool, spectacular ways that you could use this jumping talent that these characters have." ...|$|E
500|$|... nstead of {{rewriting}} the game, I thought, well maybe {{it should be}} dwarves instead. And it should be real-time to combat the [...] problem. Now, you'd be digging out minerals in a mountain, combating threats inside, and making little workshops. Then I thought, well, how should the high score list work? We really like to keep records of plays. Not just high score lists, but expansive logs. So we'll often <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> ways {{to play with the}} idea. This time, the idea was to let your adventurer come into the fortress after you lose and find the goblets you've made, and journals it generates.|$|E
500|$|Homer and Bart <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a {{way that}} Duncan can make money to help offset the costs of keeping him. Bart discovers that Duncan is a fast runner and {{suggests}} {{that he should be}} a racehorse. Homer enters Duncan at the Springfield Downs race track, with Bart as the jockey. However, a frightened Duncan loses his first race as he refuses to leave the stall until all other horses have finished. Homer and Bart find a strategy for Duncan to win by turning him into a frightening horse named [...] "Furious D", complete with dyed hair and one of Lisa's bracelets for a nose ring. He intimidates the other horses and wins several races. Homer is soon invited by the losing jockeys to have a beer in their lounge, which {{turns out to be a}} secret lair. The jockeys reveal themselves to be crazy, arrogant elf-based creatures and demand Homer to have Duncan lose the upcoming race, threatening to eat Homer's brain if he refuses to comply. Though frightened at first, Homer changes his mind due to his loyalty to his son and his horse as well as his own pride, vowing to deal with those [...] "murderous trolls".|$|E

500|$|It {{had first}} been {{thought that the}} dwarfs would be {{the main focus of}} the story, and many {{sequences}} were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White. For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat 'like gentlemen'. A partially animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a [...] "lodge meeting" [...] in which they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This also was cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story. The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by Ward Kimball, who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio, however Disney persuaded him to stay by promoting him to supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket in his next feature Pinocchio (1940).|$|E
500|$|Foremost of the disorienting effects, {{to critics}} and scholars, is Whedon's use {{of sound and}} silence. While Buffy {{performs}} CPR, she cracks one of Joyce's ribs with a startling snap. After Buffy vomits on the floor, she stands in the back doorway listening to life carrying on: children playing, someone practicing a trumpet, and birds singing. Long pauses between dialogue create gaps that turn awkward as the characters <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> what to say, made especially notable in a series famous for its rapid banter. The transition between the Christmas dinner scene and the living room scene is abrupt, {{and the sound of}} Buffy and Joyce shouting because they dropped a pie on the floor carries over into the silence of Joyce's lifeless face and Buffy standing alone in the living room. This effect is also used when shifting between Buffy's alternate version of her mother being [...] "good as new" [...] in the hospital and the paramedics trying to revive her. In the car on the way to Willow's dormitory, Anya is shot by a camera mounted on the front bumper, separated from the audience by the windshield. Xander, driving, faces the other way; neither of them speak and only the sound of the car can be heard. Joyce Millman at Salon.com writes of the sound issues, [...] "The effect was almost Bergmanesque in its starkness. The spooky stillness and the long, spacey pauses in conversation as characters struggled to articulate their feelings exaggerated the sense of time elongating and standing still." ...|$|E
2500|$|Welles would {{occasionally}} return to Woodstock, {{the place he}} eventually named {{when he was asked}} in a 1960 interview, [...] "Where is home?" [...] Welles replied, [...] "I suppose it's Woodstock, Illinois, if it's anywhere. I went to school there for four years. If I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a home, it's that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 2015 {{documentary}} Listen to Me Marlon, Brando {{shared his}} thoughts on playing a death scene, stating, [...] "That's a tough scene to play. You have to make 'em believe that you are dying ... <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the most intimate moment you've ever had in your life." [...] Brando's favorite actors were Spencer Tracy, John Barrymore, Fredric March, James Cagney and Paul Muni.|$|E
2500|$|All of {{the movie}} themes and mini-games were {{conceived}} by the creative-design team, which they decided the movie themes would have an old B-movie feel. Trowers notes {{the making of the}} mini-games to be [...] "quite an organic process": [...] "Sometimes we'd have a movie and we'd say OK, we want the player to do this in the scene, which is the action we want, so <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a game idea for this. But other times we'd be thinking, [...] "Oh, you know what, we got this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions we can get out of it, {{how are we going to}} use it in movies?" [...] So it was really a three-way process, trying to figure out what we could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movie—it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways." [...] There had also been a few more movie ideas, but they were left out of the game.|$|E
