40|$|The present {{industrial}} {{practice of}} ac to dc rectification uses diode or <b>thyristor</b> <b>bridges</b> which are harmonic polluters and poor power factor sources. The research of this thesis is directed towards exploiting fast, gate-turn-off semiconductor switching devices and PWM techniques {{in order to}} develop a new generation of rectifiers with nearly sinusoidal current waveforms operating at unity or even leading power factor. The scope of the investigation is restricted to the Boost rectifier (as opposed to Buck) which has bilateral power transfer capability through bidirectional current flow in the dc link. The stand-alone, Boost Type PWM Voltage Regulated Rectifier was originally conceived as being Direct Current Controlled. The work of the thesis advances the control methodology by replacing the inner hysteresis current feedback loop by Indirect Current Control, which uses the standard sinusoidal PWM technique. In the process, the cost of two expensive high quality current transducers is avoided. Furthermore, Sinusoidal PWM has more predictable characteristics harmonics for filter design on harmonic elimination purposes. The thesis addresses the problem of upscaling the voltage and current ratings of the rectifiers.

40|$|Abstract. Belt {{conveyors}} are {{a dominant}} mean of transport in modern open-pit mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are usually driven by three-phase induction slip-ring motors of a nominal voltage of 6 kV and nominal power from 200 to 1000 kW. Efficiency of the transport {{system is the}} crucial parameter {{of the level of}} economical exploitation of an open-pit mine as a whole. The main problem which prevent optimal transport-system efficiency is insufficient synchronization between the production and transport capacities. Since the conveyors in the open-pit mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina are mainly driven by three-phase induction slip-ring motors, the most appropriate solution to control the conveyor speed (the speed of the drive motors) is to use a subsynchronous constant torque cascade with a static voltage and frequency converter. The basic elements of the subsynchronous cascade are a diode bridge rectifier and a <b>thyristor</b> inverter <b>bridge,</b> as well as a power transformer whose nominal power depends on the control range and which sends electricity back to the power grid.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} modeling, {{simulation}} {{and implementation of}} Load Commutated SCR based current source Inverter (LCI) fed squirrel cage induction motor drive with sinusoidal voltage and sinusoidal current. In the proposed system, the induction motor is fed by an LCI. A three level diode clamped voltage source inverter (VSI) is connected at the motor terminal with ac chokes connected in series with it. The VSI currents are controlled {{in such a manner}} that it injects the reactive current demanded by the induction motor and the LCI for successful commutation of the SCRs in the LCI. Additionally, it absorbs the harmonic frequency currents to ensure that the induction motor draws sinusoidal current. As a result, the nature of the motor terminal voltage is also sinusoidal. The concept of load commutation of the SCRs in the LCI feeding an induction motor load is explained with necessary waveforms and phasor diagrams. The necessity of reactive compensation by the active filter connected at the motor terminal for the load commutation of the thyristors, is elaborated with the help of analytical equations and phasor diagrams. The requirement of harmonic compensation by the same active filter to achieve sinusoidal motor current and motor voltage, is also described. Finally, to achieve the aforementioned induction motor drive, the VA ratings of the active filter (VSI) and the CSI with respect to VA rating of the motor, are determined theoretically. The proposed drive scheme is simulated under idealized condition. Simulation results show good steady state and dynamic response of the drive system. Load commutation of the SCRs in the LCI and the sinusoidal profile of motor current and voltage, have been demonstrated. As in LCI fed synchronous motor drives, a special mode of operation is required to run up the induction motor from standstill. As the SCRs of the LCI are load commutated, they need motor terminal voltages for commutation. At standstill these voltages are zero. So, a starting strategy has been proposed and adopted to start the motor with the aid of the current controlled VSI to accelerate until the motor terminal voltages are high enough for the commutation of the SCRs in the LCI. The proposed drive is implemented on an experimental setup in the laboratory. The IGBT based three level diode clamped VSI has been fabricated following the design of the standard module in the laboratory. A generalized digital control platform is also developed using a TMS 320 F 2407 A DSP. Two, three phase <b>thyristor</b> <b>bridges</b> with necessary firing pulse circuits have been used as the phase controlled rectifier and the LCI respectively. Appropriate protection scheme for such a drive is developed and adopted to operate the drive. Relevant experimental results are presented. They are observed to be in good agreement with the simulation results. The effect of capacitors connected at the output of the LCI in the commutation process of the SCRs in the LCI is studied and analyzed. From the analysis, it is understood that the capacitors form a parallel resonating pair with filter inductor and the motor leakage inductance, which results in an undesired oscillation in the terminal voltage during each of the commutation intervals leading to commutation failure. So, in the final system, the capacitors are removed to eliminate any chance of commutation failure of the SCRs in the LCI. It is shown by experiment that the commutation of the SCRs takes place reliably {{in the absence of the}} capacitors also. The commutation process is studied and analyzed without the capacitors to understand the motor terminal voltage waveform of the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The {{new concept}} of Multi-Level Current Reinjection (MLCR) {{combines}} {{the advantages of}} DC ripple reinjection, multi-level conversion and soft-switching technique. Taking advantage of the soft-switching technique which uses zero current switching for the main <b>bridge</b> switches, <b>thyristor</b> based MLCR current source converter (CSC) is proposed. This concept adds self-commutation capability to thyristors and produces high quality line current waveforms. Various thyristor based MLCR CSC topologies have been simulated extensively using PSCAD/EMTDC in this thesis and their performance characteristics investigated. Questions have been raised about the ability to force the main thyristors off using the reinjection bridge in a real-world implementation, where there are inevitable stray capacitances and inductances which may influence the thyristor turn-off; and simulation switching models may not represent the switching characteristics fully or accurately.

The work detailed in the thesis compares the performance of single-phase <b>thyristor</b> <b>bridge</b> converters under different control strategies; considering in particular the efficiency, ac side power factor and harmonic content of the current and voltage waveforms. Extensive practical investigations were performed, in which, analogue and digital control circuits were developed to provide the drive signals necessary for a converter {{to operate in the}} different control modes for: a) A series -connected fully-controlled double <b>thyristor</b> <b>bridge</b> (used mainly in traction applications) operating under sequence control and; b) A fully controlled single-bridge operating under sequence and conventional control. A novel pulse-width modulation control strategy was developed for the single-bridge converter, using gate turn-off thyristors as the switching elements, whereby output voltage control is obtained by variation of the modulation index. Turn-on and turn-off signals for the power devices were obtained using an analogue control circuit. The advantages and disadvantages of this switching strategy compared with conventional and sequence control were studied, and results clearly showed that an improved input power factor and lower supply current and load voltage harmonics were all obtained. Mathematical models for single and double bridge converters operating under sequence and conventional control were developed using tensor techniques. Using these models, computer programmes were written in Fortran 77 on the University mainframe computer, to assemble automatically and solve the network equations as the converter topology changes. In addition, analytical models were also developed {{on the assumption that the}} load current is completely smooth.
