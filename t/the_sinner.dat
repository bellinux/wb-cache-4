5|$|Ben Daniels (born David T Daniels on 10 June 1964) is an English actor. Initially {{a celebrated}} stage actor, Daniels was {{nominated}} for an Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actor for Never <b>the</b> <b>Sinner</b> (1991), the Evening Standard Award for Best Actor for 900 Oneonta (1994), Best Actor in the M.E.N. Theatre Awards for Martin Yesterday (1998), and won the 2001 Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the Arthur Miller play All My Sons.|$|E
5|$|Kalasutra (thread of Time/Death): The Bhagavata Purana assigns this hell to {{a murderer}} of a brahmin (the Hindu priestly caste), while the Devi Bhagavata Purana allocates {{it for a}} person who disrespects his parents, elders, {{ancestors}} or brahmins. This realm is made entirely of copper and extremely hot, heated by fire from below and the red hot sun from above. Here, <b>the</b> <b>sinner</b> burns from within by hunger and thirst and the smouldering heat outside, whether he sleeps, sits, stands or runs.|$|E
5|$|Byard {{moved to}} New York City {{in the early}} 1960s. His first {{recording}} as a leader, the solo piano Blues for Smoke, was recorded there on December 16, 1960 (but not released in the United States until 1988). Also in 1960, Byard first played with the bassist Charles Mingus. He recorded extensively with Mingus in the period 1962–64 (including on the important albums on Impulse! Records – Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus and The Black Saint and <b>the</b> <b>Sinner</b> Lady), and toured Europe with him in 1964. Byard also made recordings as a sideman between 1960 and 1966 with Eric Dolphy, Booker Ervin, Roland Kirk, and Rivers. His performance on Dolphy's Outward Bound put Byard {{at the forefront of}} modern jazz.|$|E

50|$|After {{successfully}} crossing this river, <b>the</b> <b>sinners</b> reach <b>the</b> terrifying Southern Gate of the City of Yama. In this City <b>the</b> <b>sinners</b> {{along with}} <b>the</b> souls with good deeds are {{judged by the}} Lord of Justice (Yama or Yamaraja). <b>The</b> <b>sinners</b> are taken to hell and the better souls are taken to heaven.|$|R
60|$|Conclusion Fifth, A fifth {{conclusion}} is, it is <b>the</b> sensible <b>sinner,</b> <b>the</b> self-bemoaning <b>sinner,</b> <b>the</b> self-judging <b>sinner,</b> <b>the</b> self-abhorring <b>sinner,</b> and <b>the</b> self-condemning <b>sinner,</b> whose prayers prevail with God for mercy. Hence I infer, {{that one}} reason why men make so many prayers, and prevail no more with God, is because their prayers are rather the floatings of Pharisaical fancies, than the fruits of sound sense of sin, and sincere desire of enjoying God in mercy, and in {{the fruits of the}} Holy Ghost.|$|R
5|$|Daniels won the Best Supporting Actor {{award at}} the Whatsonstage.com Theatregoers' Choice Theatre Awards and the 25th Laurence Olivier Awards in 2001 for his {{performance}} in the Arthur Miller play All My Sons. He was first nominated for the latter award earlier in his career, in 1991, for his performance as murderer Richard Loeb in the play Never <b>the</b> <b>Sinner</b> at the Playhouse Theatre. In 2008, Daniels fulfilled a lifetime ambition {{when he made his}} Broadway début, headlining as the Vicomte de Valmont in a revival of Les Liaisons Dangereuses. The show opened on 1 May 2008. Daniels was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for his role.|$|E

The Saint and <b>the</b> <b>Sinners</b> {{started out as}} a typical mid 60's garage/dance band before evolving into a soul/horn band, not unlike Wilmer & the Dukes (another regionally popular band). The Saint and <b>the</b> <b>Sinners</b> fought it out with both The Dukes and The Monterays on the local dance circuit.|$|R

25|$|Free Grace Theology is {{distinguished}} by its soteriology or doctrine of salvation. Its advocates believe that God justifies <b>the</b> <b>sinner</b> on the sole condition {{of faith in}} Christ, not righteous living. Their definition of faith involves belief, trust, and conviction that Jesus {{is the only way}} to salvation.|$|E
25|$|Young {{taught that}} the {{doctrine}} was ideally to be a voluntary choice by <b>the</b> <b>sinner,</b> and, when non-voluntary, should {{be carried out}} with love and compassion. Young considered it more charitable to sacrifice a life than to see them endure eternal torment in the afterlife. In a full Mormon theocracy, the practice would be implemented by {{the state as a}} penal measure.|$|E
50|$|The Lost Highway deal did {{not come}} to be, however, as the band's {{representative}} at the label was fired and things subsequently fell through. <b>The</b> <b>Sinners</b> still had an opening slot on Lucinda Williams' ongoing tour, a slot that was fairly open-ended. Without a label backing them up, however, it was almost financially impossible for <b>The</b> <b>Sinners</b> to hit <b>the</b> road. Instead, Ford accepted an invitation to join Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, relegating <b>The</b> <b>Sinners</b> to an indefinite hiatus.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sinner's</b> Prayer, as {{popularly known}} today, has roots in Protestant Christianity. Some affirm that it evolved, {{in some form}} or another, during {{the early days of the}} Protestant Reformation, as a {{reaction}} against the Roman Catholic dogma of justification by means of meritorious works. Others believe it originated as late as the eighteenth century revival movement. [...] However, Paul Harrison Chitwood, in his doctoral dissertation on the history of <b>the</b> <b>Sinner's</b> Prayer, provides strong evidence that <b>the</b> <b>Sinner's</b> Prayer originated in the early twentieth century.|$|R
25|$|So the {{function}} of satisfaction for Aquinas is not to placate a wrathful God or {{in some other way}} remove the constraints which compel God to damn sinners. Instead, {{the function}} of satisfaction is to restore a sinner to a state of harmony with God by repairing or restoring in <b>the</b> <b>sinner</b> what sin has damaged. This is Aquinas' major difference with Anselm. Rather than seeing the debt as one of honor, he sees the debt as a moral injustice to be righted.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} that the Court of Chancery was acting, here, in its most ancient role, that of a court of conscience. This entailed the moral law applied to prevent peril to {{the soul of the}} wrongdoer through mortal sin. The remedy was given to the plaintiff (the Crown, in this case) to look after the wrongdoer's soul; the benefit to the plaintiff was only incidental. This is also the explanation for specific performance, which compels <b>the</b> <b>sinner</b> to put matters right. The whole conception is mediæval in origin.|$|E
25|$|The Franks murder has {{inspired}} works of film, theatre, and fiction, including the 1929 play Rope by Patrick Hamilton, performed on BBC television in 1939, and Alfred Hitchcock's {{film of the}} same name in 1948. A fictionalized version of the events formed the basis of Meyer Levin's 1956 novel Compulsion and its 1959 film adaptation. In 1957, two more fictionalized novels were released: Nothing but the Night by James Yaffe and Little Brother Fate by Mary-Carter Roberts. Never <b>the</b> <b>Sinner,</b> John Logan's 1988 play, was based on contemporary newspaper accounts of the case, and included an explicit portrayal of Leopold and Loeb's sexual relationship. The documentary series Behind Mansion Walls also did a story on Leopold and Loeb's crimes.|$|E

When a soul of an adult arrives at the river, Datsue-ba forces <b>the</b> <b>sinners</b> to take off their clothes, and Keneō hangs these clothes on a {{riverside}} branch that bends to reflect the gravity of the sins. Various levels of punishment are then performed by the pair. For those who steal, for example, Datsue-ba breaks their fingers, and together with Keneō, she ties <b>the</b> <b>sinner's</b> head to <b>the</b> <b>sinner's</b> feet.|$|R
25|$|One of the grafters, an {{unidentified}} Navarrese (identified by early commentators as Ciampolo) is {{seized by the}} demons, and Virgil questions him. <b>The</b> <b>sinner</b> speaks of his fellow grafters, Friar Gomita (a corrupt friar in Gallura eventually hanged by Nino Visconti (see Purg. VIII) for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape) and Michel Zanche (a corrupt Vicar of Logodoro under King Enzo of Sardinia). He offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers {{into the hands of}} the demons, and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch. Alichino and Calcabrina start a brawl in mid-air and fall into the pitch themselves, and Barbariccia organizes a rescue party. Dante and Virgil take advantage of the confusion to slip away.|$|E
25|$|Some Protestants confess {{their sins}} in private prayer before God, believing this suffices to gain God's pardon. However {{confession}} to another is often encouraged {{and in some}} sects or denominations required when a wrong {{has been done to}} a person as well as to God. Confession is then made to the person wronged and also to God, and is part of the reconciliation process. In cases where sin has resulted in the exclusion of a person from church membership due to unrepentance, public confession is often a prerequisite to readmission. <b>The</b> <b>sinner</b> confesses to the church his or her repentance and is received back into fellowship. In both cases there is a required manner to the confessions: for sins between God and Man and for sins between Man and Man.|$|E

There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) {{for the sake of}} small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell).
