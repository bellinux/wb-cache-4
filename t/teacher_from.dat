40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on an {{investigation}} of the benefit evoked by the ICT supported connected instruction between the Child Diagnostic Institute (the DDU) and the tribal school of a pupil, who comes to DDU for a voluntary diagnostic stay (DDP). The aim of this work is to determine an interest in this project among <b>teachers,</b> both <b>from</b> DDU and <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> primary schools, whose pupils attended the DDU. The method of research is an online survey among <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> DDU and <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> schools outside the Diagnostic Institute who have experience with the DDU clients. The results are evaluated separately for <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> DDU and <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> other primary schools that have experiences with those pupils...|$|R

5|$|Cascioferro {{never went}} to any school. When still young, Cascioferro married a <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> Bisacquino, Brigida Giaccone, who {{instructed}} him {{how to read and}} write. He was inducted into the Mafia in the 1880s. He worked as a revenue collector as a young adult, using the position as a cover to carry out his protection racket. His criminal record began with an assault in 1884 and progressed through extortion, arson, and menacing, and eventually to the kidnapping of the 19-year-old Baroness Clorinda Peritelli di Valpetrosa in June 1898, for which he received a three-year sentence.|$|E
30|$|When bad {{schools are}} made more attractive, market entry {{patterns}} change predictably. More mid experience <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> good schools enter the transfer market. Just as importantly, this suppresses search of mid experience <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> bad schools {{by more than}} 10 percentage points. These large changes in mid experience teachers’ propensity to search has ripple effects for other types of teachers. The focused attention on bad schools leads {{to a reduction in}} the likelihood of entry into the transfer market of low and high experienced <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> bad schools. In contrast, low and high experienced <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> good schools are induced to search more.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} affective, normative, and continuance commitment of teachers to their profession and their organization, and turnover intentions. Hong Kong teachers (N = 1060) from religious and non-religious, English medium and Chinese medium of instruction, and band 1 and band 2 schools participated. <b>Teachers</b> <b>from</b> religious schools were higher in affective commitment to organization while <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> non-religious schools were higher in normative commitment to profession. <b>Teachers</b> <b>from</b> EMI and band 1 schools were higher in affective and normative commitments while <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> CMI and band 2 schools were higher in turnover intentions...|$|R
30|$|Bad {{schools have}} the highest probabilities of {{matching}} with teachers {{with low levels of}} experience (39.91 % with <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> bad schools and 55.21 % with <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> good schools). They also stand a good chance of matching with <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> good schools, especially those with low levels of experience. This is consistent with the high search rate of these teachers for bad schools, as was seen in Table 4. In addition, because <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> good schools outnumber those from bad schools by more than 6 to 1, even a small fraction of <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> good schools seeking to move to a bad school will make matching relatively easy from the school-side. Good schools can more easily match with <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> bad schools, but they spend almost no time searching in these markets. Summing across all experience levels, good schools spend only 11.69 % of their search time for <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> bad schools. Yet even if good schools search in the low experience, bad school origin market, their chance of matching stands at 62 %. Again, this is indicative of the high degree of search friction in the teacher transfer labor market. These probabilities affect the schools’ search decisions. Bad schools search mostly for mid-level and highly experienced <b>teachers</b> originating <b>from</b> both bad and good schools (77.03 % of their search time). Good schools focus mostly on mid-level and highly experienced <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> good schools (75.06 % of their search time). Again, this confirms the utility parameters on the school side from Table 4.|$|R

This marked Afghanistan's return to {{international}} sporting events {{after the fall of}} the Taliban regime. The Afghan delegation consisted of 12 officials (11 men and one woman) and 44 competitors (40 men and four women) participating in seven different sports. The Afghanistan national football team played its first international match since the 1984 AFC Asian Cup qualification phase. An English <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> Kabul, Roia Zamani, won a bronze medal in the 72kg middleweight class of taekwondo without winning a single match. Zamani was the only medalist from the Afghan side and the first Afghan medalist in 20 years. None of the remaining athletes advanced past the qualifying stages, and as such did not win any medals.|$|E
5|$|Belcourt {{returned}} to Quebec, but was quickly {{sent out to}} serve at a parish at Rustico, Prince Edward Island. Arriving there in November 1859, the priest performed his first baptism among the local people the following month. Belcourt built a parish hall out of stone (which was used into the 1950s) and established the Farmers' Bank of Rustico. He founded a high school, where he taught until recruiting a <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> Montreal to the island. The priest created a study group, the members of which had to agree to be teetotalers. He established a parish library, built {{with the assistance of}} 1,000 French francs a year from Emperor Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon I. In October 1865, Belcourt resigned from his position at the parish at Rustico, and {{returned to}} Quebec for some weeks.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{her family}} {{connections}} and high-profile militant action, Margaret Mackworth, the 2nd Viscountess Rhondda, {{is probably the most}} well-known Welsh suffragette. Her mother Sybil Thomas and Merthyr Ironmaster's wife, Rose Mary Crawshay, were both well connected suffragists whose work is well documented. Millicent Mackenzie {{and to a lesser extent}} Amy Dillwyn are remembered more for connections outside the sphere of women's suffrage, but were both important Welsh activists for the cause. The majority of suffragists either working in Wales or Welsh suffragists who were active outside the country are many but poorly documented. Alice Abadam, a renowned speaker and activist, was the daughter of the High Sherriff of Carmarthenshire. She later became the chairperson of the Federated Council of Suffrage Movements. Rachel Barrett, a science <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> south Wales, rose to prominence within the WSPU and was chosen by Annie Kenney to assist in running the WSPU national campaign from 1912. She was also assistant editor of The Suffragette.|$|E

5|$|Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by {{the mostly}} white {{minority}} government of Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia) from the United Kingdom in 1965, the southern African country entered {{a period of}} international isolation as an unrecognised state under Ian Smith. Black nationalist movements, backed by communist powers and themselves variously Marxist–Leninist, launched military campaigns to overthrow Rhodesia's government and bring majority rule to the country; the main nationalist groups were the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), which was Chinese-backed, mostly Shona and influenced by Maoism, and the rival Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), which was largely Ndebele, more orthodoxly Marxist–Leninist {{and supported by the}} Warsaw Pact and associated nations, prominently Cuba. Each nationalist group fielded a guerrilla army—ZANU's was called the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), while ZAPU's was the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). ZAPU was led by Joshua Nkomo, a trade unionist from Bulawayo in Matabeleland, while ZANU was headed from 1975 by a former <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> Mashonaland, Robert Mugabe.|$|E
5|$|In April 1979, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, a <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> Phoenix, Arizona, {{whose father}} had founded a large beer distributorship. They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, {{which she did}} in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The {{settlement}} included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain's children did not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.|$|E
5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are with a <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results—one from McKenna, the other from the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E

5|$|McKellen and {{his first}} partner, Brian Taylor, a history <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> Bolton, began their {{relationship}} in 1964. Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in Narrow Street, Limehouse. In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and acording to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. Mathias later directed McKellen in Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease on The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.|$|E
5|$|Music {{was not a}} {{priority}} at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} team, {{made up of}} some of {{the most}} distinguished men in their fields, included representatives from the United States, Denmark, Norway and France, as well as from Britain and its Empire. Only two, however, had previous polar experience: Alistair Forbes Mackay, the expedition's medical officer, had visited Antarctica with Sir Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod expedition in 1907–09, and had been one of the party of three to discover the location of the South Magnetic Pole. Another Nimrod veteran, the 46-year-old James Murray, was Stefansson's oceanographer. Among the younger scientists were William Laird McKinlay (1889–1983), a 24-year-old science <b>teacher</b> <b>from</b> Glasgow who was recommended by the Scottish explorer William Speirs Bruce, and Bjarn Mamen (1893–1914), a 20-year-old skiing champion from Christiania, Norway, who was taken on as a forester, despite lacking scientific experience.|$|E

40|$|The {{curriculum}} of the Swedish school system explains how the transitions between the preschool {{class and the}} pre-school should be. The co-operation between the organisations should aim for a long term perspective with the students learning process in mind (Lgr 11).

The aim with my study is to examine how the <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> the different organizations relate to knowledge and how {{they look at the}} students social interactions. Also how the transition between the pre-school and the pre-school class is viewed from their point of view.   How do the <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> the different organisations comprehend knowledge?

How do the <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> the different organisations work and interact in terms of the transition between the pre-school and the pre-school class? The study that has been made is about the transitions between the pre-school and the pre-school class. It´s been investigated by doing interviews with <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> both the pre-school and the pre-school class. The result from these is that the <b>teachers</b> <b>from</b> the different organisations have the same view about knowledge and social interactions.
