5|$|Although these mounted {{troops have}} been {{described}} as cavalry, <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> armour were similar to those of foot soldiers, and they did not fight as an organised group in the way that cavalries are normally understood to have done.|$|E
5|$|At 04:00 on {{the morning}} of 2 January, Viet Cong scouts around the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi {{reported}} hearing the sounds of truck and boat engines, so Hoang issued an alert order which prompted his troops to pick up <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> hurry to their foxholes. Most of the women, children, and old men in both hamlets fled and hid in the nearby swamps as soon as the order was issued.|$|E

5000|$|The Beetle dragons {{are shaped}} nothing like mythical dragons but are {{described}} as [...] "myriopods".

5|$|They were {{captured}} by the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 206th Mechanized Infantry Regiment of the NK 105th Armored Division. The North Korean troops marched their prisoners down the hill after taking <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> valuables. In a nearby orchard, they tied the prisoners' hands behind their backs, took some of their clothing and removed their shoes. They told the American POWs {{that they would be}} sent to the prisoner-of-war camp in Seoul if they behaved well.|$|E
5|$|Spirits {{were high}} during the unit's brief {{training}} period {{as the men}} enjoyed playing sports, observing the country scenery and experiencing the night-life of the nearby capital. They were not adequately trained, receiving only a basic medical examination, a few days' fitness training and a cursory explanation of proper conduct in the bush. They expressed surprise when instructed to paint stripes of camouflage green on <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> combat boots in the Rhodesian fashion, having never before {{heard of such a}} practice.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State's {{military}} arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 {{to avoid}} armed {{conflict with the}} Soviets and a civil war. Over {{the next few years}} the communists solidified their hold on Poland, falsifying elections, persecuting the opposition and eliminating it as a political power. Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) that refused to lay down <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> surrender to the communist regime continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated.|$|E

50|$|Dungeon levels also {{frequently}} include locked doors which require a specific key to unlock. Unlike most key-like items in earlier Guild Wars dungeons (such as gears in Sorrow's Furnace), these keys are not {{carried by the}} player.

5|$|While {{camouflage}} tricks are {{in principle}} limitless, both cost and practical considerations limit {{the choice of}} methods and {{the time and effort}} devoted to camouflage. Paint and uniforms must also protect vehicles and soldiers from the elements. Units need to move, fire <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> perform other tasks to keep functional, some of which run counter to camouflage. Camouflage may be dropped altogether. Late in the Second World War, the USAAF abandoned camouflage paint for some aircraft to lure enemy fighters to attack, while in the Cold War, some aircraft similarly flew with polished metal skins, to reduce drag and weight, or to reduce vulnerability to radiation from nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|While {{officers}} were typically {{allowed to leave}} their ships—with two notable exceptions—civilian technicians (some of them British), machinists, and other integral crewmen were not given the same opportunity. These exceptions came on Minas Geraes, whose {{officers were}} surprised but had time to draw <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> defend themselves. The ship's captain, , {{was killed in the}} fighting along with several loyal and rebel crewmen. Any other bloodshed was much more limited: on the cruiser Bahia, the only officer aboard was killed after he shot a rebel crewman, and one lieutenant on São Paulo killed himself.|$|E
5|$|A third band of crusaders reached Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia) {{and began}} plundering the region. These were soon routed by the locals. A fourth army came to Moson {{in the middle}} of June. Coloman did not allow them to leave the region, either because he had learnt of their {{troublesome}} behavior during their journey, or he had realized that their movement across Hungary could jeopardize the stability of the local economy. To seize food and wine, the crusaders made frequent pillaging raids against the nearby settlements. Coloman decided to attack them, but the commanders of the army convinced him to persuade the crusaders to surrender <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> money, promising them that they would be supplied with food during their journey. After the crusaders were disarmed, Coloman's troops attacked and massacred them near Pannonhalma in early July.|$|E

5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
5|$|By 9March1968, the U.S. {{facility}} {{on top of}} Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite {{the gravity of the}} situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of U.S. personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages. Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration. Inside the facility, U.S. technicians immediately grabbed <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> ran into trenches and bunkers, thereby abandoning the very equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the U.S. technicians returned to their positions.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as omens, or portents. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse {{that occurred during}} a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides put down <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> declared peace {{as a result of}} the eclipse. The exact eclipse involved remains uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor. An eclipse recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece, which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an annular eclipse of the Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC. Alternatively, a partial eclipse was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC. Herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The date of the eclipse (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.|$|E

5|$|In late December 1696 the Chak'an Itza {{attacked}} the large Kejache mission town of Pak'ek'em; they abducted {{almost all the}} inhabitants and burned the church. The demoralised Spanish garrison at Chuntuki buried <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> ammunition and retreated five leagues (approximately 13miles or 21km) back towards Campeche. From late December 1696 {{to the middle of}} January 1697 Ursúa sent parties of soldiers and workmen along the road towards the lake; the first group was commanded by Pedro de Zubiaur and had instructions to begin building a galeota, a large oar-powered warship. This group was followed by reinforcements bringing supplies, including light and heavy weapons, gunpowder and food. On 23 January Ursúa left Campeche with more soldiers and muleteers, bringing the total number of soldiers arriving as reinforcements to 130. The Spanish fortified their positions at Ch'ich' and deployed heavy artillery for its defence.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{soldiers}} marched from Shanghai to Nanking at a breakneck pace, rapidly defeating {{pockets of}} Chinese resistance. By December 9 {{they had reached}} {{the last line of}} defense, the Fukuo Line, behind which lay Nanking's fortified walls. On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanking, and after less than two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city. Before fleeing, Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege, but by this time Nanking was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point. Most of Tang's units simply collapsed, their soldiers often casting off <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> uniforms in the streets in the hopes of hiding among the city's civilian population.|$|E
5|$|The French column surrenderd on {{the promise}} that the {{officers}} would not be stripped, but they all remained as prisoners of war and surrendered <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> money to the Catalans. Juigné, with 136 other wounded soldiers and a German captain, remained in Olot to receive medical treatment, but he died shortly after. French losses amounted to 251 or 260 men killed–32 of them officers– and 826 prisoners, as opposed to 7 men killed and 5 wounded on the miquelets side. The figures are well known, as the French intendant of Girona, René Desgrigny, {{wrote a letter to}} Olot's aldermen asking for the number and rank of the prisoners to exchange them when possible. In this letter, Desgrigny noted that Monsieur Juigné was lucky to be dead, as the defeat would probably have cost him dearly. The 690 unscathed French prisoners were brought first to Vic and later to Barcelona, where they arrived on 15 March. Their entrance was seen by a large crowd and the Spanish Viceroy, the Marquis of Gastañaga.|$|E

5|$|The Mahdists withdrew to the {{fortified}} town of Rejaf, while Chaltin's column {{marched in}} pursuit for seventeen miles until the occupied town was sighted at about one-thirty in the afternoon. A battery of artillery pieces fired on the Belgians {{as they came}} within range, but the effect was negligible. As the Belgians approached, a hidden force of Mahdists emerged from a ravine near {{the bank of the}} Nile and attacked Chaltin's flank. The commandant realized the threat in time and repulsed the attack without much loss. Chaltin's companies then turned to begin the attack on the town. For several hours Chaltin's companies pushed through the streets and houses of Rejaf, forcing the Mahdists back until by seven o'clock they had been nearly expelled entirely. Only the citadel remained occupied, but by dawn the next morning the remaining Mahdist forces retreated, leaving behind <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> munitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} of these {{occurred}} in Jayuya in {{what became known}} as El Grito de Jayuya (Jayuya Uprising). Nationalist leader Blanca Canales led the armed nationalists into the town and attacked the police station. A small battle with the police occurred; one officer was killed and three others were wounded before the rest dropped <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> surrendered. The nationalists cut the telephone lines and burned the post office. Canales led the group into the town square where the illegal light blue version of the Puerto Rican Flag was raised (it was against the law to carry a Puerto Rican Flag from 1898 to 1952.) In the town square, Canales gave a speech and declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. The town was held by the nationalists for three days.|$|E
5|$|The mounted {{police were}} {{established}} to be an armed force, primarily due to the perceived threat from the First Nations on the prairies. The police were initially equipped with the Snider-Enfield Carbine Mark III and the Snider-Enfield Short Rifle, but these were single-shot breechloaders, and inferior to the repeating weapons already being used by Indian groups in the United States. These were replaced with the Winchester Model 1876 repeating rifle from 1878 onwards, but the new guns proved quite delicate and did not perform effectively during the 1885 rebellion. In 1895, the force began to replace the ageing Winchesters with the Lee-Metford Magazine Carbine, but these weapons did not perform as well as hoped. The program was halted and instead the Lee-Enfield Magazine Rifle Mark I was introduced in 1902 as the standard police small arm. The very limited supplies of ammunition held by the force meant {{that the police had}} few opportunities to practice with <b>their</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>and</b> as a result their marksmanship was typically quite poor.|$|E
