5|$|In September 1998, Bowie {{launched}} an Internet service provider, BowieNet, developed {{in conjunction with}} Robert Goodale and Ron Roy. Subscribers to the dial-up service were offered exclusive content, {{as well as a}} BowieNet email address and Internet access. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> closed by 2006.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, TruJet {{commenced}} nonstop {{flights from}} Chennai to Mysore. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> introduced {{as part of}} the central government's Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik plan, which aims to increase air connectivity between the smaller cities and towns of India.|$|E
5|$|The {{losses of}} the spring {{campaign}} had weakened the Luftwaffe before the Battle of Britain. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> forced to wait until it had reached acceptable levels before a main assault against the RAF could be made.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> mainly {{music and}} movie streaming. There are two {{subscription}} tiers: The Freemium (free) and Premium (paid) offerings. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> available on Web and via mobile apps.|$|R
30|$|Data initiation. During this stage, all the {{variables}} required by <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>are</b> initialised. Values for the initialisation are either {{obtained from the}} vehicle infrastructure or <b>are</b> calculated when <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> initiated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{general rule}} for {{determining}} the place of supply {{is the place where}} the supplier of <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>is</b> established (or [...] "belongs"), such as a fixed establishment where <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> supplied, <b>the</b> supplier's permanent address, or where the supplier usually resides. VAT is then charged at the rate applicable in the member state where the place of supply of <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>is</b> located and is collected by that member state.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> held on 4 February 1708 in the Marienkirche, the town's largest church. The score {{indicates}} that Bach deployed his musicians in different {{locations in the}} building. He composed another cantata for the occasion the following year, but it is lost.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{operated on}} a charter basis. Having closed {{down over the}} winter, <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> resumed as a scheduled service on 13 April 1949. During 1949, two aircraft carried 2,700 cars. By 1950 the figures had risen to 3,850 cars and 1,000 motorcycles and other vehicles with passengers totalling 15,000. In that year, a London driver offered a London-Paris taxi service. Silver City Airways had estimated that they would carry nearly 7,000 cars in 1953, but this figure was reached in 1951. The three aircraft had to be doubled to six to cope. Over 13,000 vehicles were carried, with 42 return flights daily at peak times. The time between Lympne and Le Touquet was 18 minutes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> rebranded as The Witch Way in 2005 to {{coincide}} with the introduction of new vehicles. It had previously been branded as The X43 and before then was unbranded. Between 1982 and 1986 the route was known as Timesaver, with buses carrying dedicated liveries.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>services.</b> <b>The</b> type <b>is</b> INTERNAL if <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> {{provided}} by xinetd, RPC when it based on Remote procedure call, they are commonly listed in the /etc/rpc file, or it can <b>be</b> UNLISTED when <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> neither in <b>the</b> /etc/services nor in the /etc/rpc files.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plan was}} folded into the RTA's master plan in May 2016. [...] <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> {{estimated}} to cost $11-$19 million to operate annually, and $130 million in capital costs to start. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> scheduled to begin in 2022.|$|R
5000|$|KTC also {{operates}} {{special services}} for schools, at their convenience and needs. <b>The</b> <b>services</b> <b>are</b> operated on <b>the</b> monthly passes issued {{to the students}} based on the amount collected by the school management. <b>The</b> <b>services</b> <b>are</b> offered to <b>the</b> following schools: ...|$|R
5|$|The ship's silver {{service was}} {{commissioned}} {{by the state of}} South Carolina and was presented on 11 April 1910. After South Carolina was withdrawn from service in 1922, <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> given to the South Carolina chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution for display at the Old Exchange. Following the outbreak of World War II, <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> hidden {{in the basement of the}} Old Exchange for safekeeping. In 1947, they were retrieved and sent to the South Carolina Governor's Mansion, where they are currently on display.|$|E
5|$|YouTube is an American video-sharing website {{headquartered}} in San Bruno, California. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> created by three former PayPal employees—Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—in February 2005. Google bought {{the site in}} November 2006 for US$1.65billion; YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries.|$|E
5|$|A further {{survey in}} late 2015 by {{watchdog}} Transport Focus, found that satisfaction levels had increased; 89% of passengers {{surveyed said they}} were either ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ satisfied with their overall journey, up from 83% in 2013, but still {{below the national average}} of 92%. It also found that 58% felt <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> value for money. The national average rating for value for money on all tram networks was 69%.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>services</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} {{held in the}} Emu Plains Community Centre, {{which served}} the congregation well until the growing numbers meant that the space was no longer sufficient. On 23 October 2005, <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>were</b> moved {{just down the road}} to Melrose Hall.|$|R
50|$|As of 2016 <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> used by 1.3M paying households, {{more than}} any other digital movie <b>service</b> in Taiwan. <b>The</b> MOD粉絲團 <b>service</b> <b>is</b> {{operated}} by Chunghwa Telecom.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>service</b> {{penetration}} {{for a free}} Wi-Fi <b>service</b> <b>is</b> {{assumed to}} be 20 % when <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> offered as a stand-alone service and 18 % when <b>the</b> free Wi-Fi <b>service</b> <b>is</b> offered {{in conjunction with a}} competing video-on-demand <b>service.</b> <b>The</b> <b>service</b> penetration for <b>the</b> video-on-demand <b>service</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be 3 %. All crew members will switch at once to the new crew communication system.|$|R
5|$|According to Graham Spinardi in {{his book}} From Polaris to Trident (1994), STRAT-X was a {{response}} by the U.S. Department of Defense's Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Lloyd Wilson, to the U.S. Air Force; <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> demanding a large ICBM called the WS-120A. Spinardi suggests that STRAT-X was allowed to proceed so it could terminate the study for such a missile. Funding for the WS-120A would not be released by Secretary McNamara, and plans for such a missile were canceled in 1967.|$|E
5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, surprising many observers. His attendance at <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular {{with members of the}} Klan, who felt that he had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E
5|$|After the {{abolition}} of the GLC in 1986 the responsibility for operating <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the Secretary of State for Transport, who contracted the then London Borough of Greenwich to run the service. Asset ownership and operating rights were subsequently transferred to Transport for London (TfL) on the establishment of the Greater London Authority, but the London Borough of Greenwich continued to operate the ferry on behalf of TfL.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>service</b> of Phoenix <b>is</b> {{extended}} to WAP, which facilitates news messages transferred through the mobile technology (SMS and MMS). <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>is</b> charged.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{insurances}} healthcare <b>services</b> <b>are</b> {{provided to}} <b>the</b> insured persons through either direct or free schemes. In the direct scheme <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>are</b> provided by medical establishments {{which have a}} previous convention with the insurance network. In the free scheme, <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>are</b> provided by entities with no previous conventions, with the insured person advancing the payment and then being reimbursed by the insurance.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Service</b> <b>is</b> {{structured}} hierarchically with {{a defined}} system of supervision. The highest ranking position within <b>the</b> <b>Service</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Chief of By-law followed by Program Managers, Coordinators, Supervisors, and Officers. At the current {{moment in time}} there are no formal ranking structure for the officers.|$|R
5|$|Afterward, the {{airfield}} {{was used by}} charter flights carrying foreign tourists and by flights transporting dignitaries to the city, such as Jawaharlal Nehru. The Indian Air Force operated training flights at the airport as well. In 1985, regional airline Vayudoot commenced thrice weekly flights from Bangalore using its Dornier Do 228 aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> inaugurated by famous Indian writer R. K. Narayan. At the time, Mysore Airport consisted solely of a grass airstrip and a one-roomed terminal with one toilet. Because of low passenger loads, the flights ended in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Godley {{died at the}} age of 90 in a {{rest home}} at Oxford on 6 March 1957. His remains were cremated after a funeral service at Woodland St. Mary's Church in Berkshire was held on 14 March 1957. A {{memorial}} service was held at the Royal Military Chapel at the Wellington Barracks in London on 21 March 1957. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> attended by a representative of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>was</b> inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist {{sections of the}} train. This distinction applied to both living and dead passengers. Intended to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment rather than to provide different facilities, the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, the {{telephony}} {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>is</b> not itself hosted in the cloud, although {{the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>service</b> may well <b>be.</b>|$|R

50|$|Although most of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> design {{principles}} {{support each}} other in a positive manner, however, in case of service abstraction and service discoverability principle, there exists an inversely proportional relationship. This is because as more and more details about <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>are</b> hidden away from <b>the</b> <b>service</b> consumers, less discoverable information is available for discovering <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> This could <b>be</b> addressed by carefully recording <b>the</b> <b>service</b> meta-information so that the inner workings of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>are</b> not documented within this meta-information.|$|R
