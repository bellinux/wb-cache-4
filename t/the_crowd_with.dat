5|$|Lord Nelson {{stayed at}} {{temporary}} lodgings in New Bond Street between 1797 and 1798, and again from 1811 to 1813. Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford lived in Bond Street and was unhappy {{about the presence}} of the Bond Street Loungers. Already notorious for a violent and abusive temper, on 7 October 1801 he refused invitations to join in celebrations of peace between Britain and France (which led to the Treaty of Amiens), resulting in an altercation with several Loungers at his doorstep. Camelford retreated upstairs and fired upon <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> a pistol.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} meeting began local magistrates called on the {{military}} authorities to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him, and to disperse the crowd. Cavalry charged into <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915 Dyer {{was through}} with Australia, the New Zealand Truth {{reporting}} that he had left by 4 December, and by Christmas Eve the American press were already announcing his arrival in the States. In January, Dyer was in San Francisco, where he fought local boxer Bob McAllister, losing on points in a four-round contest. He then travelled to the East Coast and to New York, and on 6 May 1916 {{he was back in}} the ring, in a ten-round fight with local boxer Tommy Maloney. The fight went the distance ending in a draw, though local newspapers gave the decision to Maloney. After the fight Dyer entertained <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> an operatic song.|$|E

5|$|On June 9, Reagan's casket {{was removed}} from the presidential library and driven in a {{motorcade}} to NAS Point Mugu in Oxnard, California; it was the same airfield Reagan flew into and out of during his presidency when visiting his California ranch. SAM 28000, one of the two Boeing 747-200s, which usually serves the president as Air Force One, arrived to transport the casket to Washington. Thousands of people gathered to witness the plane's departure. Just before she boarded the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft, Nancy Reagan waved to <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> her military escort at her side. The plane lifted off at about 9:40am PST.|$|E
5|$|Players earn {{credits for}} {{knocking}} out opponents, scoring points, and impressing <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> violence and skill. The credits {{can be used}} towards player enhancements such as black market performance-enhancing drugs. A crowd meter displays audience support, which boosts the player's team abilities when filled. IGN found the game to heavily rely on teamwork. Computer players on teams rated with low teamwork will not take initiative to pursue the disc or to help teammates in need. This attribute can be raised {{over the course of}} a game. Players can call plays including physical offense, fast offense, neutral, defense, and goal defense.|$|E
5|$|When Woods was 13 years old, {{he played}} in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major {{national}} junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke. As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> his skills and potential. Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is named}} Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and {{must make a}} speech at an {{association}} meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Before he leaves, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him {{tips on how to}} give public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> a passionate yet unorthodox speech, which Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) videotapes from the back. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.|$|E
5|$|In late May Philadelphia {{hosted the}} Middle States tournament at its Germantown Cricket Club; Cochet {{advanced}} to the semifinal where Tilden's superiority proved to be his undoing. Cochet then sailed home to France and consequently missed the US Pro Tennis Championships. He chose instead to gather money in exhibition matches in Havana, Haiti, and Martinique on his way home. In France the official tour continued in Bayonne in August, where Cochet dropped his two singles matches to Tilden and Keith Gledhill {{in front of a}} home crowd. A Marseilles team event was scheduled in September where Cochet lost to Tilden, equalized against Gledhill and lost again in the doubles with Plaa to the Americans, who took the final victory as well. Two weeks later in a single-elimination tournament at Cochet's native Lyon Football Club he almost delighted <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> home victory but Tilden stole the second and third set to spoil the feat. Cochet subsequently suffered from an illness and missed the following events. Throughout the season Cochet earned a total of $17.381.|$|E
5|$|Many fans {{hoped to}} see him play for Italy at Euro 2004, or with the 2004 Olympic squad that {{eventually}} managed a Bronze medal, {{but this was not}} to be the case. However, he was given an international send-off by Trapattoni at age 37 in a friendly match against Spain on 28 April 2004, in which he wore the number 10 shirt for the final time, as well as the captain's armband for part of the match. Although Baggio entertained <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> his creativity and skill, he was unable to score, despite winning a free-kick from which Vieri's equalising goal arose. The match finished 1–1 and Baggio was given a standing ovation after being substituted off for Fabrizio Miccoli. This was Baggio's 56th and final match for Italy, {{and it was the first}} time an Italian footballer's career had been celebrated this way since Silvio Piola retired.|$|E

25|$|In {{the week}} before the match, 40 trade unions staged a 24-hour strike, protesting against the proclamation.

25|$|Some {{regarded}} female gladiators of {{any type}} or class as a symptom of corrupted Roman appetites, morals and womanhood. Before he became emperor, Septimius Severus may have attended the Antiochene Olympic Games, which had been revived by the emperor Commodus and included traditional Greek female athletics. His attempt to give Rome a similarly dignified display of female athletics was met by <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>with</b> ribald chants and cat-calls. Probably as a result, he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 AD.|$|E
