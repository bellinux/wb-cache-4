Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003) {{indicates}} Potter was venturing into new territory in creating a tale with a large human presence (Lucie). Potter's artistic uncertainty is evident in her attempt to establish a relationship between clothes and the social and animal selves of humans and animals. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle wears human clothing while the neighbourhood animals wear and shed only their skins. Logically, Kutzer points out, all the animals should wear either human clothing or only their skins. She believes Peter Rabbit's blue jacket {{is used in the}} tale as a gimmick to remind the reader that other Potter books exist for purchase, and a gimmick that disrupts Potter's artistic intent. If Peter wears human clothing then why do the other animals wear only their skins? The issue of animal clothing versus human clothing is further confused when Mrs. Tiggy-winkle sheds her human clothing {{at the end of the}} tale to reveal herself a hedgehog who may or may not be able to shed her skin as well. If she can shed her skin, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> she wearing human clothes? [...] Kutzer believes these questions remain unanswered and erode the tale's logic.|$|E

Well, sir, that {{is for you to}} settle. The marriage service gives you authority; so does the law of the land. John could lock up Mrs. Lillie till she learned her lessons; he could do any of twenty other things that no gentleman would ever think of doing, and the law would support him in it. But, because John is a gentleman, and not Paddy from Cork, he strokes his wife's head, and submits.|$|E

'It seems to me,' she said, 'that one who is so constantly engaged in observing and encouraging the growth and development of plants should himself grow and develop. Roses of one year are generally better {{than those of the}} year before. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> not the gardener better?' To these words she immediately added, being a woman of kind impulses, 'But {{in the case of a}} good gardener, such as you are, I've no doubt he does grow better, year by year.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The Bishop {{has just}} spoken of a {{condition}} of things which {{none of us can}} deny, and which ought not to exist; that is, the lust of gain--a lust which does not stop short of the penitentiary or the jail to accomplish its ends. But we may be sure of one thing, and that is that this sort of thing is not universal. If it were, this country would not be. You may put this down as a fact: that out of every fifty men, forty-nine are clean. <b>Then</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it, you may ask, that the forty-nine don't have things the way they want them? I'll tell you why it is. A good deal has been said here to-night about what is to be accomplished by organization. That's just the thing. It's because the fiftieth fellow and his pals are organized and the other forty-nine are not that the dirty one rubs it into the clean fellows every time.|$|E

60|$|The riches in this {{shape of}} fiction are {{effectively}} inestimable, {{if we consider}} {{what has been done}} in the short story, and is still doing everywhere. The good novels may be easily counted, but the good novelle, since Boccaccio began (if it was he that first began) to make them, cannot be computed. In quantity they are inexhaustible, and in quality they are wonderfully satisfying. <b>Then,</b> <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it that so very, very few of the most satisfactory of that innumerable multitude stay by you, as the country people say, in characterization or action? How hard it is to recall a person or a fact out of any of them, out of the most signally good! We seem to be delightfully nourished as we read, but is it, after all, a full meal? We become of a perfect intimacy and a devoted friendship with {{the men and women in}} the short stories, but not apparently of a lasting acquaintance. It is a single meeting we have with them, and though we instantly love or hate them dearly, recurrence and repetition seem necessary to that familiar knowledge in which we hold the personages in a novel.|$|E
60|$|We have to ask, <b>then,</b> <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> it {{that this}} recent {{movement}} in England, which has honestly appeared to many a renascence of patriotism, {{seems to us}} to have none of the marks of patriotism--at least, of patriotism in its highest form? Why has the adoration of our patriots been given wholly to qualities and circumstances good in themselves, but comparatively material and trivial:--trade, physical force, a skirmish at a remote frontier, a squabble in a remote continent? Colonies are things to be proud of, but for a country to be only proud of its extremities is like a man being only proud of his legs. Why is there not a high central intellectual patriotism, a patriotism {{of the head and}} heart of the Empire, and not merely of its fists and its boots? A rude Athenian sailor may very likely have thought that the glory of Athens lay in rowing with the right kind of oars, or having a good supply of garlic; but Pericles did not think that this was the glory of Athens. With us, on the other hand, there is no difference at all between the patriotism preached by Mr. Chamberlain and that preached by Mr. Pat Rafferty, who sings 'What {{do you think of the}} Irish now?' They are both honest, simple-minded, vulgar eulogies upon trivialities and truisms.|$|E
