5|$|One {{beneficial}} effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling {{of the former}} USS Spiegel Grove. Spiegel Grove was sunk in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary {{in an attempt to}} create an artificial reef. However, the ship turned over and landed on the bottom upside down. Efforts <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> ship were partially successful, bringing it onto its starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing Spiegel Grove into its intended upright position.|$|E
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency <b>to</b> <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E

25|$|Still Life {{springs from}} a {{meditation}} upon {{the myth of}} Sisyphus, who was sentenced to a weird kind of immortality: he would roll a huge rock {{up to the top}} of a mountain, only for the rock to roll back down.

25|$|The Sidewinder missile uses small control {{surfaces}} {{placed at the}} rear of the missile with spinning disks on their outer surfaces and these are known as rollerons. Airflow over the disks spins them to a high speed. If the missile starts <b>to</b> <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> gyroscopic force of the disks drives the control surface into the airflow, cancelling the motion. Thus, the Sidewinder team replaced a potentially complex control system with a simple mechanical solution.|$|E
25|$|A {{biscuit cutter}} {{a tool to}} cut out a biscuit from bread dough in a {{particular}} shape before they are put into an oven to bake. On May 11, 1875, Alexander P.

It was later issued on November 30, 1875.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{investigation}} board the capsizing of Finn-Baltic was {{a direct result of}} cargo shifting, caused by the bottom layer of the ore concentrate becoming saturated with water and liquefying. When the vessel encountered heavy seas and began <b>to</b> <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> cargo in the forward part of the hold shifted, resulting in a permanent list of roughly two degrees. When the crew attempted to turn the combination against the wind, a standard procedure in such situation, the remaining cargo moved as a single mass due to the centrifugal force, sliding against the port side coamings and capsizing the vessel.|$|E
25|$|The club's {{penultimate}} game of {{the season}} was against Siena, a game in which Parma needed three points to keep their faint hopes of European football alive and set a new club record for consecutive Serie A wins. The first half was tepid with neither side managing a shot on target, but opportunities were nonetheless to be had for both sides. The match continued in much the same manner in the second half until Sebastian Giovinco netted a spectacular volley from 25 metres out after 67 minutes. Parma got a second and sealed victory in injury time after Sergio Floccari took advantage of defensive sloppiness <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> ball into an empty net.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, {{the silicon}} ring tourniquet, or elastic ring tourniquet, was {{developed}} by Dr. Noam Gavriely, {{a professor of medicine}} and former emergency physician. The tourniquet consists of an elastic ring made of silicone, stockinet, and pull straps made from ribbon that are used <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> device onto the limb. The silicone ring tourniquet exsanguinates the blood from the limb while the device is being rolled on, and then occludes the limb once the desired occlusion location is reached. Unlike the historical mechanical tourniquets, the device reduces the risk of nerve paralysis. The surgical tourniquet version of the device is completely sterile, and provides improved surgical accessibility due to its narrow profile that results in a larger surgical field. It {{has been found to be}} a safe alternative method for most orthopedic limb procedures, but it does not completely replace the use of contemporary tourniquet devices. More recently the silicone ring tourniquet has been used in the fields of emergency medicine and vascular procedures. Recently, Feldman et. al. reported 2 cases of pulmonary embolism after silicon ring tourniquet application in patients with traumatic injuries. The serious and potentially fatal complication was reported involving procedures performed on the lower limb when silicone ring tourniquet was used for exsanguination on the affected limb.|$|E

[...] Jarrah changed tactics at 09:59:52 and pitched the nose of the airplane up and down to disrupt the assault.|$|E
500|$|Historically, the {{elephants}} {{were under the}} constant control of a driver or mahout, thus enabling a ruler to grant a last-minute reprieve and display merciful qualities. Several such exercises of mercy are recorded in various Asian kingdoms. The kings of Siam trained their elephants <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> convicted person [...] "about the ground rather slowly so {{that he is not}} badly hurt". The Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great is said to have [...] "used this technique to chastise 'rebels' and then in the end the prisoners, presumably much chastened, were given their lives". On one occasion, Akbar was recorded to have had a man thrown to {{the elephants}} to suffer five days of such treatment before pardoning him. Elephants were occasionally used in trial by ordeal in which the condemned prisoner was released if he managed to fend off the elephant.|$|E

A ninth plate, only [...] thick and [...] wide, was bolted over the butt joints of the innermost layer of armor. Glass portholes in the deck provided natural light for {{the interior of the}} ship; in action these were covered by iron plates.|$|E

[...] A penalty scored by Robert Pir√®s was enough to secure three points against Manchester City. The midfielder wasted a second penalty in the second half, choosing to recreate a spot kick executed by Johan Cruyff and Jesper Olsen for Ajax. Having attempted <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> ball towards onrushing Henry, Pir√®s inadvertently flicked the ball twice, enabling referee Mike Riley to award a free-kick to Manchester City. Although both players were scrutinised by Chelsea manager Jos√© Mourinho, they were commended by Cryuff for showing a desire to try something different.
