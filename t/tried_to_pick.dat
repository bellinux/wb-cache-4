5|$|A Ganapatya legend {{recalls how}} the creator-god Brahma, the preserver-god Vishnu and the dissolver-god Shiva, the Divine Mother Devi and the Sun-god Surya {{mediated}} at Morgaon {{to learn about}} their creator and their purpose of existence. Ganesha emerged before them in form of an Omkara flame and blessed them. Another legend records that when Brahma created his son Kama (desire), he became a victim of desire and lusted for his own daughter Sarasvati (Goddess of learning). Upon invocation {{by all of the}} deities, the sacred Turiya Tirtha river appeared and Brahma bathed in her waters to cleanse his sin of incest. Brahma then came to Morgaon to worship Ganesha, carrying water from the river in his water pot. Entering the Ganesha shrine, Brahma stumbled and water fell from the pot. When Brahma <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up, it was turned into the sacred Karha river, that still flows at Morgaon.|$|E
5|$|On the June 21 {{episode of}} Raw, after Ted DiBiase fired Virgil, Maryse became DiBiase's new {{personal}} assistant. At Money in the Bank, on July 18, Maryse accompanied DiBiase in his Money in the Bank ladder {{match for the}} WWE Championship contract, which she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> the briefcase, but was stopped by John Morrison. Along with DiBiase, Maryse was announced as a mentor for Brodus Clay for the fourth season of NXT on November 30. On Raw, on December 13, Maryse {{was involved in a}} battle royal to determine the winner of the Diva of the Year Slammy Award, but was eliminated by Natalya. Clay traded his mentors, Maryse and DiBiase, for Alberto Del Rio on the January 25, 2011 episode of NXT. In late September 2010, Maryse was involved in an storyline with Goldust, in which he stole the Million Dollar Championship from DiBiase, and lost a subsequent mixed tag team match against Goldust and Aksana on October 26.|$|E

But they could not break through towards Pegu, and had to retreat.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} drive {{of the second}} half, New England had a 4th-and-2 and chose to punt. However, after the play had been run, Patriots' head coach Bill Belichick {{challenged}} that New York had too many players {{on the field and}} replay confirmed that was the case as Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn was unable to get to the sidelines as the ball was being snapped. Therefore, referee Mike Carey reversed the play, and the Giants were penalized 5yards for having too many players on the field, giving the Patriots a first down. The Patriots then drove to the Giants' 25, but Strahan sacked Brady for a 6-yard loss on third down. Then on 4th-and-13, with the ball on the Giants' 31, Belichick decided against a long field goal attempt by Stephen Gostkowski and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up a first down instead. Brady's pass to Jabar Gaffney was incomplete as it went {{out of the back of}} the end zone and the Giants took over on downs.|$|E

25|$|At this point, the Broncos offense {{finally managed}} to get moving, picking up a first down {{for the first time}} in the game at 10:37 and moving the ball to the Seattle 35-yard line. But on third-and-13, Manning was hit by Seahawks {{defensive}} end Cliff Avril as he tried to throw a pass to Moreno, causing a high short floater that was intercepted by linebacker Malcolm Smith and returned 69 yards for a touchdown. After Seattle's kickoff, Denver mounted a drive to the Seahawks' 19-yard line, aided by Demaryius Thomas's 19-yard reception on third-and-5. With just over a minute left in the half, Denver faced fourth-and-2. Rather than kick a field goal, they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up a first down, but Manning's pass was incomplete and the score would remain 22–0 at the end of the half. The 22-point deficit was the largest faced by the Broncos all season. It was also the third-largest halftime deficit in Super Bowl history, and the previous two were also against the Broncos – the Redskins led the Broncos 35–10 in Super Bowl XXII and the 49ers led the Broncos 27–3 in Super Bowl XXIV.|$|E
25|$|Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer's 23-yard {{completion}} to Karl Williams {{on third}} down and 1 {{set up the}} first score of the game, Michael Husted's 22-yard field goal with 5:25 {{left in the first}} quarter. The Lions received a huge scoring opportunity when Williams fumbled a punt {{at the end of the}} next drive. Lions linebacker Matt Russell got to the ball first, but instead of falling on the ball, he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up and run with it. Instead of grabbing the ball, he accidentally batted it out of bounds, allowing the Bucs to keep possession on the Lions 11-yard line. Taking full advantage of their second chance, Tampa Bay subsequently drove 89 yards in 17 plays, taking 8:50 off the clock and converting three third downs, one from a 12-men on the field penalty against Detroit. Dilfer finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Horace Copeland that put the team up 10-0. Later on, Buccaneers cornerback Anthony Parker intercepted a pass from Mitchell and returned it 19 yards to the Lions 20-yard line, setting up Husted's 43-yard field goal that gave the team a 13-0 lead at the end of the half. Tampa Bay had a chance to increase their lead even more before halftime with a drive to the Lions 43, but Ron Rice intercepted a pass from Dilfer on the last play of the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match of}} the event {{featured}} Ricky Steamboat defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Ric Flair. Terry Funk, Pat O'Connor and Lou Thesz were the special judges in the match in case the match went to the full 1-hour time limit. Flair started the match by performing a Shoulder Block. Flair and Steamboat competed for longer than half hour and exchanged momentum throughout the match. In the final moments of the match, Steamboat delivered a Superplex to Flair and applied a Double Chickenwing but Flair wrapped his legs into the ropes. Flair was smashed into the turnbuckle and Steamboat climbed the top rope. Flair fell into the ropes and Steamboat fell {{down on the floor}} which hurt his leg. Flair suplexed Steamboat back into the ring and began attacking his injured knee. Flair applied a Figure Four Leglock until Steamboat caught the ropes. Flair tried to attack Steamboat's knee but Steamboat delivered a Karate Chop and an Enzuigiri. Steamboat <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> Flair to perform a Scoop Slam but his leg was hurt, allowing Flair to pin Steamboat with an Inside Cradle to win the title. After the match, Flair showed respect to Steamboat by shaking hands with him. One of the judges of the match, Terry Funk challenged Flair for the title but Flair turned down the title match, causing Funk to attack Flair and perform a Piledriver on him through the judges table.|$|E

Tom {{and the other}} judges (Susan Yeagley, Frank Medrano, Worth Howe) all {{immediately}} agree Trish should win, but Leslie insists on further discussion.

After the pageant ends, Leslie makes a speech congratulating Susan anyway, and claiming the [...] "Susans" [...] {{of the world will}} carry on, even when they lose to the [...] "Trishes" [...] of the world. Dave approaches Leslie at the pageant and asks her again on a date. When she hesitates, he tells her she should call him if she changes her mind. As Dave leaves, he bumps into Trish, who he pushes past without much notice, impressing Leslie. They set up a date the next day and Dave tries to impress Leslie by showing he has memorized the names of all the female politicians in her photographs. Meanwhile, Tom has <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up girls at the pageant by giving him his house keys with none of them showing up, but he reveals that he has been robbed twice.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, in an interview, Pusha T {{spoke on}} the {{inspiration}} behind the album title. [...] "Basically, I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> a title that embodied who I am as an artist. I wanted people to understand like Pusha is everything that I really, really am. Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire. It {{was one of the}} more prominent catch phrases that he said {{at the end of that}} series. He was basically saying, I am who I am, I stand on my name I live this. I really felt that embodied my presence in the rap game." [...] Pusha T announced the new title of his album in November 2012, along with Spin reporting that his album had been pushed back until 2013. On March 19, 2013 Pusha T said that the album would include 13 songs and that he had already finished 11 of those songs.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{idea for}} Kingdom Hearts {{began with a}} {{discussion}} between Shinji Hashimoto and Hironobu Sakaguchi about Super Mario 64. They were planning to make a game with freedom of movement in three dimensions like Super Mario 64 but lamented that only characters as popular as Disney's could rival a Mario game. Tetsuya Nomura, overhearing their conversation, volunteered to lead the project and the two producers agreed to let him direct. A chance meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevator—Square and Disney had previously worked {{in the same building}} in Japan—allowed Hashimoto to pitch the idea directly to Disney. Nomura struck down a number of proposals from Disney in order to pursue his own concept featuring an original character not based on a Disney property. The production team consisted of over one hundred members from both Square and Disney Interactive. The game began development in February 2000 and originally focused more on the gameplay with a simple story to appeal to Disney's target age range. After executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi told director Tetsuya Nomura the game would be a failure if it did not aim for the same level as the Final Fantasy series, Nomura began to develop the story further. When choosing the Disney worlds to include in the game, Nomura and his team <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> worlds that had distinctively different looks. They also tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting. Thanks to support from Disney's then-president and current chairman and chief executive Bob Iger, the team had few restrictions on which worlds they could use from the Disney franchises. However, they tried to remain within each character's boundaries set by their respective Disney films. In June 2013, Nomura stated {{the name of the game}} came from him thinking about Disney Theme Parks, especially Animal Kingdom. However, Nomura could not get the IP with just Kingdom, so the development team began to think about [...] "heart" [...] as a core part of the story, so they decided to combine the two to form Kingdom Hearts.|$|E

2500|$|Right halfback Dave Allerdice was {{the scoring}} leader for Michigan, {{tallying}} 18 points on three field goals, four extra points, and a touchdown. [...] He also made {{good use of}} the on-side kick for long gains and had two 40-yard runs that set up Michigan touchdowns. Michigan outscored Ohio State, 21 to 0, in the first half.

[...] Ohio State's only points came on a touchdown late in the second half.

Then after forcing a punt, the Eagles drove 74 yards, including an 11-yard scramble by Brunner on 3rd and 11, to score on his 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver John Mistler. Henry muffed the ensuing kickoff, and as he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up, he lost the ball while being hit by Mike Dennis.

2500|$|Nanda's once mighty empire {{had been}} reduced to a strip of coastal Lower Burma (Pegu and the Irrawaddy delta). The former vassal rulers now {{effectively}} ignored the high king as inconsequential, instead now saw each other as rivals. It was a natural return to multilateral relations among the smaller states that had existed before the rise of Toungoo Empire. Concerned by Nyaungyan's takeover of Upper Burma, Thado Dhamma Yaza III of Prome decided to invade the upcountry. But he was assassinated on [...] by one of his advisers. Toungoo <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> off Prome but the new ruler of Prome, Yan Naing, fended off Toungoo's attacks. In the middle Tai country too, chaos reigned. Lan Na and Lan Xang were locked in conflict. Lan Na's own vassals (Nan, Chaing Saen, Chiang Rai) were in revolt. Siam began to intervene the upcountry affairs in 1598, gaining Lan Na c. 1601/02 but chaos continued on the Lan Na countryside.|$|E
2500|$|Wentzel {{was often}} {{asked how he}} managed to put his {{subjects}} at such ease while photographing them. [...] He observed that he read as many ethnographic studies of a region as possible, to avoid making culturally insensitive errors. He also <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up {{a few words of}} the local language, and be as courteous as possible. He said that he often made friends with the people he was photographing. [...] "After we got to be friends, I would just back up and take the picture. That was a good part of my technique," [...] he said. He also brought a small musical box along with him, which helped to ease suspicion and win friends (especially among children). His choice of equipment also influenced his style. Wentzel told an interviewer in 1999 that, while in Africa, he used only lightweight 35 mm film cameras such as a Nikon or an Olympus OM-2. For more formal portraits, however, he used an 85mm portrait lens and Kodachrome film. When printing his photographs, he preferred the Ilfochrome process (which turned photographic slides into prints) and the gelatin silver print process.|$|E
