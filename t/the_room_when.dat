The plane hit the apartment owned by Dr. Parviz Benhuri {{and his wife}} Ilana, the latter of whom was seated in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> the plane crashed and sustained shrapnel injuries and burns. Her housekeeper was also present and helped her escape.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions on the walls of <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>When</b> the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always took care of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|Lazard {{turns to}} Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. She tells them of Michelle's claims {{that a man}} had {{attacked}} Barbala, {{even though she was}} the only person in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly glitches, displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris — who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>When</b> the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is something wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E

25|$|Many Jews sway {{their body}} {{back and forth}} during prayer. This {{practice}} (referred to as shoklen in Yiddish) is not mandatory, {{and in fact the}} kabbalist Isaac Luria felt that it should not be done. In contrast, the German Medieval authority Maharil (Rabbi Jacob Molin) linked the practice to a statement in the Talmud that the Mishnaic sage Rabbi Akiva would sway so forcefully that he ended up at the other side of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> praying (Talmud tractate Berachot).|$|E

25|$|According to {{psychologist}} B. F. Skinner, phobias {{are controlled}} by escape and avoidance behaviors. For instance, a student may leave <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> talking {{in front of the}} class (escape) and refrain from doing verbal presentations because of the previously encountered anxiety attack (avoid). Major avoidance behaviors could include an almost pathological/compulsive lying behavior in order to preserve self-image and avoid judgement in front of others. Minor avoidance behaviors are exposed when a person avoids eye contact and crosses his/her arms to avoid recognizable shaking. A fight-or-flight response is then triggered in such events.|$|E

The room's hardwood floor was installed diagonally which was expensive at the time.

Sebastian quickly invites Alicia to dinner the {{following}} night at his home, where he will host a few business acquaintances. Devlin and Captain Paul Prescott of the US Secret Service (Louis Calhern) tell Alicia to memorize the names and nationalities of everyone there. At dinner, Alicia notices that a guest becomes agitated {{at the sight of a}} certain wine bottle, and is ushered quickly from <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>When</b> the gentlemen are alone at the end of the dinner, this guest apologizes and tries to go home, but another of the Nazi group insists on driving him (to his death).|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Washbrook was {{appointed}} Lancashire's first ever professional captain, a role he held on till 1959, {{when he was}} awarded a second benefit, which raised £1,520. Washbrook {{was appointed}} a Test selector in 1956. After England had lost the Second Test against Australia at Lord's, to go one-nil down in the five match series, the 41-year-old was asked by his fellow selectors to leave <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>When</b> he returned, they {{asked him if he}} would play in the Third Test at Headingley. Washbrook made 98, sharing a stand of 187 with Peter May, after England had been reduced to 17 for three. England won the game, and Washbrook stayed in the team, scoring just 6 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, in which Jim Laker took his record-breaking 19 wickets as England went two-one up. The Fifth Test at The Oval saw Washbrook's last Test innings, a duck, but with the game drawn, England had won the Ashes.|$|E

25|$|As a baby, Harry was in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> Voldemort's fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort's soul {{had been}} {{weakened}} and destabilised by his continuous murders {{and the creation}} of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort's soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead {{is a direct result of}} this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort's mental and emotional states, allowing the reader to eavesdrop on the series' primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry's forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry's frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, is really the trapped bit of soul yearning to depart from Harry's body and rejoin its master's soul.|$|E
25|$|The third act {{begins on}} the upper floor of the house, where a masked man {{is seen in the}} previously-hidden room taking a money bag from a safe. When Dale finds the room, the man flees, leaving her and the money locked inside. The others find her there, unconscious. Anderson reappears and accuses Wells of {{stealing}} the money and killing Richard. Cornelia begins to present an alternative theory, but is interrupted when the unknown man comes upstairs and Anderson asks him about his amnesia. Cornelia says that she sees a man on the roof, and most of the group leaves to look for him. Cornelia uses the distraction to tell Dale, Jack and the unknown man that she thinks the money is still in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>When</b> they search for the money, Jack finds the body of Courtleigh Fleming, who was killed only recently. As Cornelia, Dale and Jack argue about what has happened, the unknown man locks the door and orders them to be quiet. When the masked man sneaks in through a window, the unknown man apprehends him and reveals that he, the unknown man, is the real Detective Anderson; the Bat (the masked man) had pretended to be Anderson.|$|E

500|$|Biographer Heike Görtemaker {{noted that}} {{women did not}} play {{a big role in}} the {{politics}} of the Third Reich. Braun's political influence on Hitler was apparently minimal. She was never allowed to stay in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> business or political conversations took place, and was sent out of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>when</b> cabinet ministers or other dignitaries were present. She was {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. In his post-war memoirs Hoffmann characterized Braun's outlook as [...] "inconsequential and feather-brained"; her main interests were sports, clothes, and the cinema. By all accounts, she led a sheltered and privileged existence and seemed uninterested in politics. One instance when she took an interest was in 1943, shortly after Germany had fully transitioned to a total war economy. Among other things, this meant a potential ban on women's cosmetics and luxuries. According to Speer's memoirs, Braun approached Hitler in [...] "high indignation"; Hitler quietly instructed Speer, who was armaments minister at the time, to halt production of women's cosmetics and luxuries rather than instituting an outright ban.|$|E
500|$|The Atomic Energy Commission {{decided that}} the {{implosion}} concept could be declassified for the trial, and limited all discussion to the weapons used in World War II (fearing that Greenglass may have seen prototypes for future weapons while at Los Alamos).

She was something. She was good." [...] David DeVorkin, curator of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, wrote a history of manned scientific ballooning. In DeVorkin's view, the Piccards' [...] "entrepreneurship and subsequent success" [...] in ballooning was due to [...] "their enormous persistence…and considerable confidence, pluck, and luck".|$|E
