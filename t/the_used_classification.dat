The central ray of the hand is affected and usually appears without proximal deficiencies of nerves, vessels, tendons, muscles and bones in contrast to the radial and ulnar deficiencies. The cleft hand appears as a V-shaped cleft situated in the centre of the hand. The digits at the borders of the cleft might be syndactilyzed, and one or more digits can be absent. In most types, the thumb, ring finger and little finger are the less affected parts of the hand. The incidence of cleft hand varies from 1 in 90,000 to 1 in 10,000 births depending on <b>the</b> <b>used</b> <b>classification.</b> Cleft hand can appear unilateral or bilateral, and can appear isolated or associated with a syndrome.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} {{that enables the}} use of existent classification inductive learning systems on problems of regression. We achieve this goal by transforming regression problems into classification problems. This is done by transforming the range of continuous goal variable values into a set of intervals that will be used as discrete classes. We provide several methods for discretizing the goal variable values. These methods are based on the idea of performing an iterative search for the set of final discrete classes. The search algorithm is guided by a N-fold cross validation estimation of the prediction error resulting from using a set of discrete classes. We have done extensive empirical evaluation of our discretization methodologies using C 4. 5 and CN 2 on four real world domains. The results of these experiments show the quality of our discretization methods compared to other existing methods.

40|$|Quite often, {{in order}} to derive {{meaningful}} insights, accounting researchers have to analyze large bodies of text. Usually, this is done manually by several human coders, which makes the process time consuming, expensive, and often neither replicable nor accurate. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, we perform a feasibility study investigating the applicability of computer-aided content analysis techniques onto the domain of accounting research. Krippendorff (1980) defines an algorithm’s reliability as its stability, reproducibility and accuracy. Since in computer-aided text classification, which is inherently objective and repeatable, the first two requirements, stability and reproducibility, are not an issue, this paper focuses exclusively on the third requirement, the algorithm’s accuracy. It {{is important to note}} that, although inaccurate classification results are completely worthless, it is surprising to see how few research papers actually mention the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>used</b> <b>classification</b> methodology. After a survey of the available techniques, we perform an in depth analysis of the most promising one, LPU (Learning from Positive and Unlabelled), which turns out to have an F-value and accuracy of about 90 %, which means that, given a random text, it has a 90 % probability of classifying it correctly. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The gold {{standard}} for evaluating cognitive impair-ments in HIV-infected patients is to administer an extensive neuropsychological assessment. This may, however, be time-consuming and hence not always feasible in the clinic. Therefore, several brief screening tools have been developed. This study determined {{the validity of the}} Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the HIV Dementia Scale (HDS) in detecting cognitive impairment using both the Frascati and cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND) criteria to classify cognitive impairment in HIV- 1 infected patients. The MoCA, HDS, and an extensive neuropsychological assessment, cov-ering nine cognitive domains, were administered in a group of 102 HIV-infected patients who were all on cARTand virolog-ically suppressed for at least 1 year. Results show that the areas under the curve (AUCs) for both the MoCA and the HDS were statistically significant, using both the Frascati and the CIND criteria as {{gold standard}}. However, the AUCs for the MoCA and HDS did not differ significantly, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>used</b> <b>classification</b> criteria (Frascati: z= 0. 37, p= 0. 35; CIND: z=− 0. 62, p= 0. 27).

40|$|AbstractBreast {{cancer is}} {{considered}} {{as the second}} leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Early detection of cancer is crucial {{in order to reduce}} its negative effects. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important modality in the detection of breast cancer in daily practice. However, routine breast MRI has a moderate specificity that may increase its false positive rates. Therefore, automated detection techniques of malignancy can provide an important tool for clinicians. In this study, different data classification methods were examined to classify breast tumors screened using contrast enhanced MRI. The used data set included 20 subjects categorized clinically into two groups; benign and malignant tumors. MRI scans were first preprocessed to extract imaging features. Then two classification methods were exploited to differentiate between the two tumor's categories using the extracted features. <b>The</b> <b>used</b> <b>classification</b> methods were K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The results show a relatively significant classification accuracy compared with pathological analysis, and also the calculated resubstitution error. In summary, the proposed automatic classification techniques can be used as noninvasive diagnostic tools for breast cancer, with the capability of decreasing false positive errors associated with regular MRI diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Tree species {{information}} {{is essential for}} forest studies such as forest meteorology, botany and ecology, and across the relevant fields new techniques efficient for classifying tree species are desperately demanded. For this requirement, the state-of-the-art remote sensing technology of static terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) shows the potential of handling it, since TLS can represent tree structures in details. However, the literature review suggests that the endeavors of introducing TLS into tree species classification are still in shortage. Aimed at this technical gap, this study attempted TLS for distinguishing four typical boreal tree species, i. e. Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European aspen (Populus tremula) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). After a theoretical comparison of the generic mechanisms of TLS- and airborne laser scanning (ALS) -based forest mapping, explicit tree structure (ETS) feature parameters, rather than conventional ALS-derived statistical-sense feature parameters, were proposed and derived from TLS point clouds. Then, based on a support-vector-machine (SVM) classifier, the specific classification was operated in a leave-one-out-for-cross-validation (LOOCV) mode. Tests indicated that the proposed TLS-based ETS feature parameters and <b>the</b> <b>used</b> <b>classification</b> algorithm can be validated for implementing the task of classifying the four tree species (the maximum total accuracy reaches 90. 00 % and the robust total accuracy reaches 77. 5 %). Overall, as a leading endeavor, this study has developed a procedural frame for TLS-based tree species classification...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} practice guideline for distal radius fractures (DRF) has 29 recommendations; however, {{none of these}} recommendations were given a “strong” rating owing to limited strength of the evidence. Therefore, determining effective evidence-based treatment of patients with DRFs is crucial. To conduct best evidence clinical trials, and to properly compare results, {{there must be a}} consensus on the use of inclusion criteria and of outcome measures. This thesis aimed to investigate a critical component of the methodology used in DRF research, which might help us {{to improve the quality of}} future research. We therefore focused on an underappreciated aspect of methodology: assessment tools used for diagnosis and trial eligibility in patients with DRFs, and the quality of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). It appeared that <b>the</b> <b>used</b> <b>classification</b> systems have serious limitations and in our systematic review we found limited to no evidence for any of the measurement properties of the PROMs. This led us to perform a study following the COSMIN standards to ensure high methodological quality. Based on our results we now have strong evidence that both the PRWE and the DASH questionnaires have good content validity and are reliable and internally consistent instruments for the assessment of patients with distal radius fractures. Furthermore, we showed that spectrum bias has significant influence on the intra-observer agreement of distal radius fracture treatment plans. Finally, we show that is prudent to look more closely at methodological limitations of published research, especially the underappreciated and under-recognized methodological limitations discussed in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Surface {{electromyography}} (sEMG) signals {{have been}} used in numerous studies for the classification of hand gestures and movements and successfully implemented in the position control of different prosthetic hands for amputees. sEMG could also potentially be used for controlling wearable devices which could assist persons with reduced muscle mass, such as those suffering from sarcopenia. While using sEMG for position control, estimation of the intended torque of the user could also provide sufficient information for an effective force control of the hand prosthesis or assistive device. This paper presents the use of pattern recognition to estimate the torque applied by a human wrist and its real-time implementation to control a novel two degree of freedom wrist exoskeleton prototype (WEP), which was specifically developed for this work. Methods Both sEMG data from four muscles of the forearm and wrist torque were collected from eight volunteers by using a custom-made testing rig. The features that were extracted from the sEMG signals included root mean square (rms) EMG amplitude, autoregressive (AR) model coefficients and waveform length. Support Vector Machines (SVM) was employed to extract classes of different force intensity from the sEMG signals. After assessing the off-line performance of <b>the</b> <b>used</b> <b>classification</b> technique, the WEP was used to validate in real-time the proposed classification scheme. Results The data gathered from the volunteers were divided into two sets, one with nineteen classes and the second with thirteen classes. Each set of data was further divided into training and testing data. It was observed that the average testing accuracy in the case of nineteen classes was about 88 % whereas the average accuracy in the case of thirteen classes reached about 96 %. Classification and control algorithm implemented in the WEP was executed in less than 125 ms. Conclusions The results of this study showed that classification of EMG signals by separating different levels of torque is possible for wrist motion and the use of only four EMG channels is suitable. The study also showed that SVM classification technique is suitable for real-time classification of sEMG signals and can be effectively implemented for controlling an exoskeleton device for assisting the wrist. </p...|$|E
