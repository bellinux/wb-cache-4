To prevent negative fluids to enter the temple, several rules were established: for example, those who perform the worship are not allowed to wear jewelry or makeup in the building.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke is {{situated}} {{on a bed}} of cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and loamy soil, inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages, the new {{structures}} of the town were gradually built away from the junction adjacent to the rivers to slightly higher ground because of a rising river. Alluvial silt deposited in <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small rivers - a familiar result of deforestation in the rivers' upper watersheds - had raised <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rivers and extended the floodplain.

5|$|Middle Devonian basaltic {{volcanic}} {{rocks are}} found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics {{and the other}} two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain. Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney. Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. Boulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> Fishing Creek {{contains}} red {{and brown}} shale in some places. Other {{parts of the}} watershed lie over gray sandstone or conglomerates. There are numerous deposits of iron ore, limestone and marble in the watershed of Fishing Creek. Most of the rock in the watershed, including the Trimmers Rock Formation and Catskill Formation, is from the Devonian Period, {{but some of the}} northernmost tributaries have watersheds on rock from the Mississippian Period, such as the Huntley Mountain Formation and Burgoon sandstone. The creek is a freestone stream although its water is colder than that of most eastern freestone streams.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{standards}} and enrollment numbers at the Baltimore City College (B.C.C.) after reaching {{a high of}} near 4,000 boys by the mid-1960s went {{through a period of}} decline first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, with the rapid opening of newer additional high schools both in the outreaches of the city along with the rapidly expanding suburbs in surrounding Baltimore County. Two in the city system were Northwestern in 1965 and Northern in the following year. Three high schools were completed and opened all at one time in September 1971, with Southwestern, Walbrook and a massive huge complex nearby to City in Clifton Park on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the old reservoir off Harford Road, Lake Clifton. The 'A' and 'B' courses were slowly dying out and unfortunately discontinued by 1973, and a single academic track was offered.|$|E
5|$|In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, {{feeding on}} algae, diatoms or detritus, {{but in a}} few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into {{submerged}} wood and {{can be a problem}} for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has {{a significant impact on the}} primary producers, the plants and algae, on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> streams and rivers.|$|E
5|$|Newark Penn Station, {{situated}} {{just east}} of downtown, is the city's major train station. It is served by the interurban PATH train (which links Newark to Jersey City and Manhattan), three NJ Transit (NJT) commuter rail lines, and Amtrak service. It was designed by McKim, Mead & White and completed in 1935. One mile north, the Newark Broad Street Station is served by two NJT commuter rail lines. The two train stations are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark Penn Station to Newark's northern communities and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield. Built in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the Morris Canal, the light rail cars run underground in Newark's downtown area. The city's third train station, Newark Liberty International Airport, connects the Northeast Corridor to the airport via AirTrain Newark. Bus service in Newark is provided by New Jersey Transit, CoachUSA contract operators and DeCamp in North Newark.|$|E

5|$|Sewage outfalls {{into the}} lake are {{proposed}} to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main feeders {{into the lake}} and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation {{as well as the}} control of fish proliferation {{to reduce the risk of}} death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand {{and water}} to make mud mortar. They {{obtained}} most of the material from canyon deposits, {{but some of the}} clays may have been collected {{from the base of the}} cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> Chaco Wash.|$|E

5|$|The canal {{was absorbed}} by the British Waterways Board in 1962. The Conservators carried out an annual {{inspection}} in 1965, the first since 1947, but had to use a motor coach {{for most of the}} journey, as the locks were unusable. With the passing of the Transport Act 1968, the canal was classified as a remainder waterway – little more than a drainage channel. Only essential maintenance to keep it safe was to be carried out. Soon afterwards, part of the cutting wall between West Street and Albert Street collapsed, and although <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the canal was cleared to ensure water could reach the dock, the towpath remained blocked for another nine years. Bridgwater Docks, which had been used by a small amount of coastal shipping, were finally closed in 1971: the connection at the docks was stopped up, and the British Waterways Board were granted permission to cease maintaining the canal for navigation.|$|E
5|$|The model jet {{used for}} wide shots of Goldfinger's Lockheed JetStar was painted {{differently}} {{on the right}} side to be used as the presidential plane that crashes at the film's end. Several cars were provided by the Ford Motor Company including a Mustang that Tilly Masterson drives, a Ford Country Squire station wagon used to transport Bond from the airport to the stud ranch, a Ford Thunderbird driven by Felix Leiter, and a Lincoln Continental in which Oddjob kills Solo. The Continental had its engine removed before being placed in a car crusher, and the destroyed car had to be partially cut so that <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the Ford Falcon Ranchero in which it was deposited could support the weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} was strongly opposed by both environmentalists {{as well as}} local residents. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is strongly dependent on tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. Diversion of the glacier-fed Kootenay River would have resulted in the Columbia River becoming much deeper and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At {{the opposite end of the}} scale, it would dry <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin in a few years. As a result, this proposed river diversion was never undertaken.|$|E
