5|$|When the dwarves take {{possession}} of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, an heirloom of Thorin's dynasty, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town's destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. <b>Thorin</b> refuses and, having summoned his kin from the Iron Hills, reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but <b>Thorin</b> is intransigent. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien's works show much {{influence}} from Norse mythology, reflecting his lifelong passion for {{those stories and}} his academic interest in Germanic philology. The Hobbit is no exception to this; the work shows influences from northern European literature, myths and languages, especially from the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda. Examples include the names of characters, such as Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, Dwalin, Balin, Dain, Nain, <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield and Gandalf (deriving from the Old Norse names Fíli, Kíli, Oin, Glói, Bivör, Bávörr, Bömburr, Dori, Nóri, Dvalinn, Bláin, Dain, Nain, <b>Þorin</b> Eikinskialdi and Gandálfr). But while their names are from Old Norse, the characters of the dwarves are more directly taken from fairy tales such as Snow White and Snow-White and Rose-Red as collected by the Brothers Grimm. The latter tale may also have influenced the character of Beorn.|$|E
5|$|Gandalf reappears to warn all of an {{approaching}} army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. <b>Thorin</b> is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies. Bilbo accepts {{only a small portion}} of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Map of the Lonely Mountain": This melody {{is heard}} in [...] "The Fellowship of the Ring" [...] when Gandalf takes a gander at the Map of the Lonely Mountain at Bag-End. It appears {{several times in}} The Hobbit, and is {{connected}} to <b>Thorins</b> theme.|$|R
50|$|Château des Jacques is a wine {{producer}} {{located in}} Moulin-à-Vent, {{in the north}} of the Beaujolais region. The 88 hectares of vineyards are spread over six appellations located in Moulin-à-Vent, Morgon, Chénas and Fleurie. Vineyards included in the domaine's holdings include: Grand Clos de Rochegrès, Clos du Grand Carquelin, Champ de Cour, La Roche, Clos des <b>Thorins,</b> La Rochelle and Côte du Py.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} between the Battle of Five Armies and the War of the Ring, {{possibly}} spurred by his interaction with <b>Thorins</b> company, Beorn emerged from his reclusion, and rose to become {{a leader of the}} woodmen living between the Anduin river and the fringes of Mirkwood. As stated by Glóin in The Fellowship of the Ring, the Beornings also [...] "keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock." ...|$|R
5|$|Bilbo Baggins, the titular protagonist, is a respectable, {{reserved}} hobbit. During his adventure, Bilbo often {{refers to}} {{the contents of his}} larder at home and wishes he had more food. Until he finds a magic ring, he is more baggage than help. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves. During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key moments in the story. <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield, the proud, pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo {{to get him out of}} trouble, but he proves himself a mighty warrior. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.|$|E
25|$|Several of the dwarves in the Peter Jackson film {{adaptation}} of The Hobbit, namely <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield, Kíli and Fili, speak with Yorkshire accents.|$|E
25|$|The Great Goblin was a Goblin {{leader who}} lived in the Misty Mountains during the Third Age, as recounted in The Hobbit. His {{followers}} captured <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield, Bilbo and company during the Quest of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, and took them to their underground stronghold, Goblin-town. When he found the group was carrying Orcrist, an Elf-made blade which had killed many Goblins, he gave orders for them to be imprisoned and tortured. He tried to attack <b>Thorin,</b> but was slain by Gandalf. His death incites the Goblins to go after the company.|$|E
50|$|Dormons {{career in}} music {{promoting}} began on 17 May 1988 when, {{along with a}} group of friends (including Ian Carvell, Stephen Cookson, David Jarvis and Haydn Wood), they put on The Brilliant Corners at the Rumble Club in Grosvenor Park Rec hall in Tunbridge Wells. The Rumble Club, as a music venue went on to use various premises in the area, including The Watson Hall, Langton, The Hand & Sceptre in Southborough, and the lower floor of the former Winchester pub on Nevill Street, Tunbridge Wells (now the <b>Thorins</b> wine bar). Jason has said that he and his friends put on shows because they were fed up with the cost and travel of going to London to watch bands.|$|R
25|$|Several days later, <b>Thorin</b> {{learns that}} with the demise of Smaug, an army of men and wood-elves are heading towards the Lonely Mountain to claim back their own lost treasures. Determined to keep {{everything}} for the dwarves, he sends a raven to his cousin Dáin, asking for support. Meanwhile, he tasks Bilbo with finding the Arkenstone, a treasure of great importance. Bilbo does so, but sneaks out of the mountain with it, and, {{in an effort to}} prevent the upcoming battle, gives it to Bard and Thranduil, who are leading the army of men and elves. They offer to return the Arkenstone to <b>Thorin</b> if he gives them their treasures, but he refuses, denouncing Bilbo as a traitor. The next day, Dáin's army arrives, and a battle seems unavoidable. However, before the conflict begins, Gandalf appears, revealing the imminent arrival of an army of goblins and wargs, led by Bolg. <b>Thorin</b> agrees to join with Bard and Thranduil as the Battle of the Five Armies begins.|$|E
25|$|In Dale, both King Brand and King Dáin II Ironfoot were killed, {{and were}} succeeded by their sons Bard and <b>Thorin</b> III Stonehelm. They sent their emissaries to the {{crowning}} of Elessar, {{and were in}} alliance with Gondor until their Kingdoms ended.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} film, , the {{audience}} sees only his legs, wings, and tail, and his eye, which is showcased {{in the final}} scene of the film. Smaug is a topic of discussion among the White Council as Gandalf's reason to support <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield's quest.|$|E
25|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films {{take place in the}} fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). The films also expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at Dol Guldur, and the pursuit of Azog and Bolg, who seek vengeance against <b>Thorin</b> and his ancestors.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} islands {{appear to}} have been Cair Andros, on the borders of Ithilien and Tol Brandir in Nen Hithoel. Carrock, in the north was where the Eagles deposited <b>Thorin</b> and Company. There was also an eyot, where the Fellowship rested during their travel between Lórien and Parth Galen.|$|E
25|$|Giants are {{referred}} to {{only a few times}} by Tolkien, leading some readers to debate whether they existed at all or if they were simply Ents or metaphorical descriptions of the power of nature. Stone-giants of the Misty Mountains are said to lob stones at <b>Thorin</b> and Company in The Hobbit.|$|E
25|$|With the {{destruction}} of the Balrog, the way was at last clear for the Longbeards to reclaim the Dwarrowdelf however, and it is told that a few centuries into the Fourth Age, Durin VII – a descendant (some sources say the son) of <b>Thorin</b> III Stonehelm – at last led his people back to their longed-for ancient homeland, retrieving what they could of Khazad-dûm's once-mighty riches.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Gimli the Dwarf, {{who fought}} in that battle, {{established}} a colony of Durin's folk there. Aglarond lay {{in front of a}} huge and very beautiful cave system, which proved irresistible to him. Gimli became known as 'the Lord of the Glittering Caves', although this new realm was presumably under the overlordship of <b>Thorin</b> Stonehelm, his kinsman and heir of the lordship of all Durin's Folk. The dwarves of Aglarond restored the Hornburg following the War of the Ring, and it became a fortress they shared with the Rohirrim.|$|E
25|$|In The Hobbit film series, Azog is {{depicted}} as a 8 feet 5 inches tall, pale white orc hailing {{from the city of}} Gundabad, with a white warg as his steed. He is portrayed by Manu Bennett in all three films in an expanded role from the original tale, {{and is one of the}} primary antagonists of the films. Azog is also, unlike most orcs, shown to only speak in the Black Speech of Mordor and has sworn to wipe out the line of Durin. He is killed during the Battle of the Five Armies, in which he and <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield mortally wound each other.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that {{after the fall of}} Angmar at the Battle of Fornost the Angle became home to the remainder of the Dúnedain, and the Rangers of the North established several villages there, where their people lived until the resurrection of the northern Kingdom under King Elessar {{at the end of the}} Third Age. But northern Rhudaur remained wild and dangerous for the rest of that Age: Arador was slain there by hill-trolls in T.A. 2930, and his son Arathorn II fell in battle with orcs in T.A. 2933. In T.A. 2941, trolls captured the company of <b>Thorin</b> at the start of The Hobbit.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins as}} Gandalf (voiced by Jim Ward) {{arrives in the}} Shire to invite Bilbo Baggins (Michael Beattie) on an adventure. Bilbo declines, but invites Gandalf to tea the next day. When Gandalf returns, he is {{accompanied}} by thirteen dwarves who are going on a quest to the Lonely Mountain to win back their kingdom. Led by <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield (Clive Revill), they plan to reclaim their treasure from the dragon who stole it, Smaug. Gandalf tells them they will need a thief to complete their mission, and he volunteers Bilbo, who promptly faints. When he is unconscious, Bilbo dreams of the possibilities of heroism in such a quest, and upon waking, decides to join the dwarves.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf leaves after {{showing the}} group the {{path through the}} forest and warning them never to leave it. After several days, however, the dwarves are running low on supplies, and see a group of Wood Elves enjoying a feast. They run into the forest towards the elves, but become lost and separated. Bilbo {{encounters}} Corwin (Michael Ensign), a man from Lake-town, whose party has been killed by the Great Spiders living in the forest, and who have also taken the dwarves. Bilbo is able to rescue them, {{but as soon as}} he does so, the dwarves are captured by Wood Elves and placed in the dungeons of Thranduil, who wants to know why they are in the forest. <b>Thorin,</b> however, refuses to say anything, enraging Thranduil. Using the ring, Bilbo enters Thranduil's hall, where he meets Lianna. With her assistance, he is able to free the dwarves by sealing them into barrels which are sent down the river to Lake-town.|$|E
500|$|The {{overcoming}} {{of greed}} and selfishness {{has been seen}} as the central moral of the story. Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from {{one or more of the}} characters' simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels, it is only by the Arkenstone's influence upon <b>Thorin</b> that greed, and its attendant vices [...] "coveting" [...] and [...] "malignancy", come fully to the fore in the story and provide the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone—a most ancient relic of the dwarves—and attempts to ransom it to <b>Thorin</b> for peace. However, <b>Thorin</b> turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises and [...] "at your services" [...] he had previously bestowed. In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure to help those in greater need. Tolkien also explores the motif of jewels that inspire intense greed that corrupts those who covet them in the Silmarillion, and there are connections between the words [...] "Arkenstone" [...] and [...] "Silmaril" [...] in Tolkien's invented etymologies.|$|E
500|$|Gandalf tricks Bilbo into {{hosting a}} party for <b>Thorin</b> and his band of dwarves, who sing of {{reclaiming}} the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug. When the music ends, Gandalf unveils a map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition's [...] "burglar". The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic form}} {{of the story is}} that of a quest, told in episodes. For the most part of the book, each chapter {{introduces}} a different denizen of the Wilderland, some helpful and friendly towards the protagonists, and others threatening or dangerous. However the general tone is kept light-hearted, being interspersed with songs and humour. One example of the use of song to maintain tone is when <b>Thorin</b> and Company are kidnapped by goblins, who, when marching them into the underworld, sing: ...|$|E
500|$|In Jackson's {{adaptation}} of the prequel, , Lee reprises his role as Saruman the White, even though Saruman {{does not appear in}} the novel. Saruman, Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond appear {{at a meeting of the}} White Council in Rivendell (loosely based on material from the Appendices), which discusses the mysterious Necromancer encountered by Radagast the Brown. Gandalf believes (correctly) that the Necromancer is Sauron resurgent, but Saruman dismisses this idea. Saruman also disapproves of the quest to reclaim the Dwarf kingdom of Erebor because it will wake the sleeping dragon Smaug, though Gandalf and Galadriel fear that if Sauron reappears, Smaug will join his forces eventually. [...] Gandalf presumed that Saruman would disapprove, so he had <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield and company leave Rivendell before the council began. [...] In the final film of the trilogy, , Saruman and Elrond accompany Galadriel to Dol Guldur where they engage the resurrected Nazgûl in battle. After dispatching the Ringwraiths, Saruman and Elrond assist as Galadriel uses the power of her Ring to fight Sauron and banishes him from the fortress back to Mordor. Although Elrond insists that they need to hunt down Sauron, Saruman tells him to remain with Galadriel, who is severely weakened after the battle with Sauron, while he takes care of the Dark Lord.|$|E
500|$|His restive nature, however, did not diminish. As a young man, Saint-Just was [...] "wild, handsome, [...] transgressive". Well-connected and popular, {{he showed}} a special affection toward {{a young woman}} of Blérancourt, Thérèse Gellé. She was the {{daughter}} of another wealthy notary, a powerful and autocratic figure in the town; he was still an undistinguished adolescent. He is said to have proposed marriage to her; she is said to have desired it. Though no hard evidence exists regarding their relationship, official records show that on 25 July 1786, Thérèse was married to Emmanuel <b>Thorin,</b> the scion of a prominent local family. Saint-Just was out of town and unaware of the event, and tradition portrays him as brokenhearted. Whatever his true state, it is known that {{a few weeks after the}} marriage he abruptly left home for Paris – without an announcement, but not without gathering up a pair of pistols and a good quantity of his mother's silver. His venture turned short when his mother had him seized by police and sent to a reformatory (maison de correction) where he stayed from September 1786 to March 1787. Chastened, Saint-Just attempted to begin anew: he enrolled as a student at the School of Law, Reims University. After a year, however, he drifted away from law school and returned to his mother's home in Blérancourt penniless, without any occupational prospects.|$|E
500|$|Eva Birthistle plays Captain Kate Marshall, a [...] "crack commando" [...] {{who oversees}} Section 20's {{military}} personnel. She and Stonebridge have an affair. The actress {{was taken by}} the script, and although she was cast for the role, she had not done action in her past acting career, and felt it would be a [...] "fun experience" [...] to play the character. When Birthistle went through military training, her goal was [...] "just to keep up with everybody and not give up, pass out, throw up or cry." [...] Rhashan Stone plays Major Oliver Sinclair, Grant's right-hand man who helps her gather intelligence. Mealing called their working relationship as [...] "very strong" [...] and [...] "simpatico." [...] Sinclair is the section's second-in-command. Michelle Lukes plays Sergeant Julia Richmond, one of the newer recruits of Section 20. Lukes describes her character as [...] "exceptionally bright and technically brilliant," [...] with the ability to speak seven languages. Jimi Mistry plays the antagonist Latif, the terrorist mastermind behind Project Dawn. Richard Armitage returns as John Porter, the protagonist of the original Strike Back series, in the first episode. Originally, Armitage's role in the series was not clarified when production was announced. In January 2011, the Herald Sun reported he dropped out of the series because he would be playing <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield in The Hobbit films. However, it was later reported he would return for the second series in a secondary rather than primary role.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Quest of Erebor" [...] in Unfinished Tales elaborates {{upon the}} story behind The Hobbit. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and <b>Thorin</b> Oakenshield, a Dwarf-king in exile, in the inn of the Prancing Pony in Bree.
