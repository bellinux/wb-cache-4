5|$|Adilabad, a fort {{of modest}} size, {{built on the}} hills {{to the south of}} Tughlaqabad was {{provided}} with protective massive ramparts on its boundary around the city of Jahanpanah. The fort was much smaller than its predecessor fort, Tughlaqabad fort, but of similar design. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in its evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort for conservation has recorded that two gates, one with barbicans between two bastions on the south-east and another on the south-west. Inside, it, separated by a bailey, is a citadel consisting of walls, bastions and gates within which lay the palaces.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Cogan was {{succeeded by}} Francis Day (1643–1644), Thomas Ivie (1644–1648) and Thomas Greenhill (1648–52 and 1655–58). At {{the end of}} Greenhill's term in 1652, Fort St George was {{elevated}} to a Presidency, independent of Bantam and {{under the leadership of}} the first president, Aaron Baker (1652–1655). However, in 1655 <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort was downgraded to an Agency and made subject to the factory at Surat, until 1684.

5|$|April 1794 was a {{month of}} fevered {{activity}} {{on both sides of}} the English Channel as Villaret and Howe made their final preparations for the coming campaign. The slow French convoy had departed American waters on 2 April, and British convoys destined for the Empire had sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May. Howe used his whole force to provide them with protection as far as the Western Approaches, and on 5 May sent the frigates HMS Latona and HMS Phaeton close in to Brest to ascertain <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French—they reported that Villaret's battlefleet was still in harbour.|$|E

5|$|In 1936 {{the bridge}} was {{designated}} an ancient monument.

5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} French word kilo, a {{shortening}} of kilogramme, was imported into the English language {{where it has}} been used to mean both kilogram and kilometre. While kilo is acceptable in many generalist texts, for example The Economist, its use is typically considered inappropriate in certain applications including scientific, technical and legal writing, where authors should adhere strictly to SI nomenclature. When the United States Congress gave the metric system legal status in 1866, it permitted {{the use of the word}} kilo as an alternative to the word kilogram, but in 1990 revoked <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word kilo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twelfth}} century {{education}} in the Faroe Islands {{was provided by the}} Catholic Church. The Church of Denmark took over education after the Protestant Reformation.

Initially education was administered and regulated by Denmark. In 1979 responsibilities on educational issues started transferring to the Faroese authorities, a procedure which was completed in 2002.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} St Peter's church, {{the remains of}} which stand in modern Castle Park, may have been another minster, {{possibly}} with 8th-century origins. By the time of Domesday the church held three hides of land, which was a sizeable holding for a mere parish church. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1052 Harold Godwinson took ship to Brycgstow and later in 1062 he took ships from the town to subdue the forces of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn of Wales, indicating <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town as a port.|$|E

5|$|Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically {{distinct}} from their forerunners in the Paleozoic.
