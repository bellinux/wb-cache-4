5|$|Librarians at Valley Library {{began using}} <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> in March 2010 to {{communicate}} with some library patrons, and earlier started to loan out Amazon's Kindle reader. In April, the school started allowing students to use the library 24-hours-a-day from Sunday through Thursday to test whether there was enough demand to allow 24-hour access on a permanent basis. The program {{was sponsored by the}} Associated Students of Oregon State University and paid for by university technology funds, and was {{due in part to the}} closure of some computer labs that had been 24-hour study areas.|$|E
5|$|Shinkai {{said the}} OVA was {{inspired}} by Dracula and Laputa. He stated that production took seven months to complete. He said another inspiration was his frequent sending of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> to his wife when he was working.

40|$|U. S. {{courts have}} been slow to embrace new technologies. This is {{especially}} true when it comes to service of process. With people in the United States relying heavily on cell phones and <b>text</b> <b>message</b> technology, <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> offer a unique method for serving process. <b>Text</b> <b>messages</b> would be useful for serving a defendant when the defendant cannot be located. Further, <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> are sent almost instantaneously and are inexpensive. In addition, unlike e-mail, <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> do not require Internet access. Given these advantages, this Note examines whether <b>text</b> <b>message</b> service of process is constitutional. It argues that <b>text</b> <b>message</b> service of process is not per se unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the current technological limitations of <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> counsel against using <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> to serve process at this time. Assuming that these limitations are ultimately fixed, this Note then proposes a legal framework for permitting <b>text</b> <b>message</b> service of process...|$|R

40|$|Message {{classification}} is a text classification {{task that}} has provoked {{much interest in}} machine learning. One aspect of message classification that presents a particular challenge is the classification of short <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> This paper presents an assessment of applying a case based approach that was developed for long <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> (specifically spam filtering) to short <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> The evaluation involves determining the most appropriate feature types and feature representation for short <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> and then comparing {{the performance of the}} case-based classifier with both a Naıve Bayes classifier and a Support Vector Machine. Our evaluation shows that short <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> require different features and even different classifiers than long <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> A machine learner which is to classify <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> will require some level of configuration in these aspects...|$|R

5|$|In late December, the {{government}} began restoring services gradually. The websites for Xinhua and the People's Daily, two state-controlled media outlets, were made accessible on 28 December, the web portals Sina.com and Sohu.com on 10 January 2010, and 27 more websites on 6 February. But access to websites was only partial: for instance, users could browse forums and blogs but not post on them. China Daily reported that limited e-mail services were also restored in Ürümqi on 8 February, although a BBC reporter writing at approximately the same time said e-mail was not accessible yet. <b>Text</b> <b>messaging</b> on cell phones was restored on 17 January, {{although there was a}} limit to how many messages a user could send daily. Internet access was fully restored in May 2010.|$|E

Soderbergh does not use type-cast pharmaceutical executives or politicians as villains, but instead portrays bloggers such as Krumwiede in a negative light. Social media {{plays a role in}} Krumwiede's accusations against Dr. Cheever and in Emhoff's daughter's attempts to carry on a relationship with her boyfriend through <b>text</b> <b>messaging.</b> Other responses in the movie, such as Emhoff's appropriating a shotgun from a friend's abandoned house to protect his home from looters, imposition of federal quarantines and curfews, the allocation of vaccines by lottery, inadequate federal preparation and responses, and use of bar-coded wristbands to identify the inoculated highlight the complex tensions between freedom and order in responding to a pandemic.

This study aimed to determine if <b>text</b> <b>message</b> reminders about oral hygiene have an influence {{on the level of}} compliance. In this prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, 42 orthodontic patients were assigned to a <b>text</b> <b>message</b> or control group. Parents of patients assigned to the <b>text</b> <b>message</b> group received a reminder <b>text</b> <b>message</b> one weekday each week. Oral hygiene compliance was measured using bleeding index, modified gingival index, plaque index, and visual examination of white spot lesion development at baseline (T 0), two appointments after baseline (T 1), and four appointments after baseline (T 2). Bleeding index, modified gingival index, and plaque index scores were significantly lower in the <b>text</b> <b>message</b> group than the control group at T 2. A <b>text</b> <b>message</b> reminder system is effective for improving oral hygiene compliance in orthodontic patients...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> {{has given rise}} to a number of French {{language}} research topics. First, databases of natural <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> have been created in multiple Francophone countries in an effort to link the texters' characteristics with the linguistic markers of the <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> Many studies have focused on textisms (changes in spelling as compared to the traditional written code), creating repertoires of spelling processes and classifying them into typologies. With regard to linguistic aspects, a few studies have analyzed vocabulary and syntax. Sociolinguistic aspects have also been studied, taking into account the relationship among textisms, age, and gender. To address the question of whether <b>text</b> <b>message</b> writing is a threat to spelling, several studies have analyzed the link between <b>text</b> <b>message</b> writing and traditional writing. Finally, {{a number of studies have}} focused on the production processes of <b>text</b> <b>message</b> writing.

30|$|Participants were {{randomly}} assigned to one of three separate 7 -day ESM campaigns conducted throughout the semester. Throughout the 7 -day ESM campaign each participant received a total of 43 <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> The SMS program delivered <b>text</b> <b>message</b> surveys 6 times a day between 6 : 00  am and 1 : 00  am. One of the seven days was randomly chosen to incorporate a seventh <b>text</b> <b>message</b> survey sent overnight between the hours of 1 : 00  am and 6 : 00  am. Each day the SMS program generated a randomized schedule for each individual subject that distributed the daily <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> across six time windows of 3 – 4  hours, with a minimum of 20  minutes between <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> For example, the first <b>text</b> <b>message</b> was sent within the time window of 6 : 00  am to 9 : 00  am, the second was sent during the window of 9 : 00  am and 12 : 00  pm. A return <b>text</b> <b>message</b> was considered valid data so long as it was received before the subsequent <b>text</b> <b>message</b> had been sent. If it was not received by that time, it was considered a missed response. Participants who completed the ESM portion of the study received a $ 10 incentive; students who responded to 75 % or more <b>text</b> <b>message</b> surveys received an additional $ 50.|$|R
