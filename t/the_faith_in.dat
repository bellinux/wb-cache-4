5|$|Each town in {{the colony}} was {{considered}} a single church congregation; in later years, {{some of the larger}} towns split into two or three congregations. Church attendance was mandatory for all residents of the colony, while church membership was restricted to those who had converted to <b>the</b> <b>faith.</b> <b>In</b> Plymouth Colony, it seems that a simple profession of faith was all that was required for acceptance. This was a more liberal doctrine than some other New England congregations, such as those of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where it was common to subject those seeking formal membership to strict and detailed cross-examinations. There was no central governing body for the churches. Each individual congregation was left to determine its own standards of membership, hire its own ministers, and conduct its own business.|$|E

25|$|The parish {{church of}} St John the Baptist, with its tower and spire, was built between the late 12th century and early 15th century {{replacing}} a Saxon building that had stood since 685 AD. The first church {{had been established}} when Aldhelm obtained a grant from Pope Sergius I to establish a foundation of mission priests to spread <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Selwood Forest. By {{the second half of}} the 11th century the church was under the control of Regenbald. Nothing remains of the original church apart from some fragments of masonry.

Adil finished as the second-highest wicket-taker in the President's Trophy, the four-day domestic competition, taking 54 wickets at 17.88. Those numbers earned him a place in the Pakistan squad for the Test series in South Africa, and when Junaid Khan and Umar Gul were both unavailable for the Centurion game, Adil walked in for his Test debut in a three-man Pakistan pace attack that had a combined prior experience of two Tests.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{of these}} active {{interventions}} into Nubian affairs, the Mameluks also {{put a lot}} pressure on the Christians inside their borders. The patriarch of Alexandria was forced to cancel the dispatchment of priests to Alwa, which was problematic, since Alodia, like the other Coptic nations of Africa, was dependent upon Egyptian bishops. The consequential deterioration of Christian faith is attested by Portuguese sources from the early 16th century. A traveller and companion of Francisco Álvares, who visited Nubia in around 1500, states that the Nubians considered themselves Christian, but were so lacking in Christian instruction {{that they had no}} actual knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>faith.</b> <b>In</b> 1520, Nubian ambassadors reached Ethiopia and asked the emperor for priests. They claimed that no more priests could reach Nubia because of wars between Muslims, leading to a decline of Christianity in their land.|$|E

25|$|Cyril {{was once}} again banished from Jerusalem by the Arian Emperor Valens in 367. St. Cyril was able to return again at the {{accession}} of Emperor Gratian in 378, after which he remained undisturbed {{until his death in}} 386. In 380, St. Gregory of Nyssa came to Jerusalem on the recommendation of a council held at Antioch in the preceding year. He found <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> accord with the truth, but the city a prey to parties and corrupt in morals. Cyril's jurisdiction over Jerusalem was expressly confirmed by the First Council of Constantinople (381), at which he was present. At that council he voted for acceptance of the term homoousios, having been finally convinced that there was no better alternative. His story is perhaps best representative of those Eastern bishops (perhaps a majority), initially mistrustful of Nicaea, who came to accept the creed of that council, and the doctrine of the homoousion.|$|E
25|$|Leo's {{writings}} (both the sermons and the letters) {{are mostly}} concerned with theological {{questions concerning the}} person of Jesus Christ (Christology) and his role as mediator and savior (Soteriology), which is partially connected to the Council of Chalcedon in which Roman legates participated in Leo's name. Subsequently, through numerous letters addressed to bishops {{and members of the}} imperial family, Leo incessantly worked for the propagation and universal reception of <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Christ as defined by Chalcedon, also {{in the eastern part of}} the Roman empire. Leo defends the true divinity and the true humanity of the one Christ against heretical one-sidedness. He takes up this topic also in many of his sermons, and over the years, he further develops his own original concepts. A central idea around which Leo deepens and explains his theology is Christ's presence in the Church, more specifically in the teaching and preaching of the faith (Scripture, Tradition and their interpretation), in the liturgy (sacraments and celebrations), in the life of the individual believer and of the organized Church, especially in a council.|$|E
25|$|In the 8th and 9th centuries {{the land}} was under the Counts of the Zürichgau. The low-lying land along Lake Zürich was {{relatively}} easy to reach and was settled throughout the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages, the Muotathal area was used by seasonal herders but {{there were very few}} permanent settlements. Küssnacht was first mentioned in the 9th century, but it is likely that there were earlier settlements. The forests around Einsiedeln were lightly settled. A visit of the Irish monks, Gallus and Columbanus in 611 is mentioned in the Gallusviten. However, their missionary efforts were unsuccessful in Schwyz. In the late 7th century Christianity began to spread into the region. The church at Tuggen was first built around 680/700, while the Aisleless church at Schwyz was built after 700. In the following centuries, the monasteries at Säckingen, St. Gallen and Reichenau all became centers of spreading <b>the</b> <b>faith.</b> <b>In</b> 948, Einsiedeln Abbey was consecrated on the site of Saint Meinrad's murder in 861 in a high valley near Schwyz. When Einsiedeln Abbey was founded, it was granted many farms, villages and isolated churches helping to spread Christianity into the high valleys.|$|E
