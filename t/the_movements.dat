5|$|As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other {{structures}} dedicated to observing <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> of celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> of Venus. At Copán, {{a pair of}} stelae were raised to mark {{the position of the}} setting sun at the equinoxes.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the reasons {{of the success of}} nonviolent protest in <b>the</b> Civil Rights <b>Movement.</b> <b>The</b> author argues that <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> could achieve its objectives because <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> adopted nonviolence as its guiding principle, several civil rights organizations were involved in <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> <b>the</b> black churches provided <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> with masses of supporters and participants, the nonviolent rhetoric of <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> converted public opinion, and the media coverage forced Americans to deal with the racial problem. egyetemiangol nyelv és irodalo...|$|R

50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the unity of}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> was challenged. Eventually the Evangelical revival led by Fredrik Gabriel Hedberg split from <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> and was {{organized}} separately. Simultaneously <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> entered a time of crisis when originally sympathetic clergymen distanced themselves from <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> as protest against Paavo Ruotsalainen, but especially N.G. Malmberg, whom they accused of sinful living. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> lingered on as a popular movement supported and organized independently by adherents among the peasant population.|$|R

5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of <b>the</b> <b>movements,</b> although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing the uniqueness of <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> {{such as those of}} the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E
5|$|Stellar {{rotation}} is {{the angular}} motion {{of a star}} about its axis. The rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star, or by timing <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> of active features on the surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{intent of}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> was to obtain public support (money and votes) to elect officeholders who would repeal these liberal statutes. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> was unsuccessful. In retrospect, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> {{was part of}} the ongoing culture war.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> Occupy <b>Movement</b> {{began in}} <b>the</b> fall of 2011, Socialist Alternative became active within <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> {{in cities across}} the country.

5|$|The {{numbering}} of <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> {{shown here}} is {{in accordance with}} the Novello vocal score (1959), edited by Watkins Shaw, which adapts the numbering earlier devised by Ebenezer Prout. Other editions count <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> slightly differently; the Bärenreiter edition of 1965, for example, does not number all the recitatives and runs from 1 to 47. The division into parts and scenes is based on the 1743 word-book prepared for the first London performance. The scene headings are given as Burrows summarised the scene headings by Jennens.|$|E

5|$|All {{movements}} {{are written in}} D major, but Reger often modulates. <b>The</b> <b>movements</b> follow each other without a break.

5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} to coordinate <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may {{also lead to}} inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle.

5|$|Elsewhere, the kabuki theater {{tradition}} in Japan employs ritualized representations of {{violence on the}} stage. While kabuki is technically theater and not dance, <b>the</b> <b>movements,</b> for example, of the sword-fighting termed tachimawari in kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, and elaborate fight scenes are so deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of overlap between theater and dance.|$|E
