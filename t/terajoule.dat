50|$|The {{explosive}} {{yield of}} a nuclear weapon {{is the amount of}} energy released when that particular nuclear weapon is detonated, usually expressed as a TNT equivalent (the standardized equivalent mass of trinitrotoluene which, if detonated, would produce the same energy discharge), either in kilotons (kt—thousands of tons of TNT), in megatons (Mt—millions of tons of TNT), or sometimes in terajoules (TJ). An explosive yield of one <b>terajoule</b> is 0.239 kt of TNT. Because the accuracy of any measurement of the energy released by TNT has always been problematic, the conventional definition is that one kiloton of TNT is held simply to be equivalent to 1012 calories.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, Nepal {{has been}} {{focusing}} on the exploitation of its huge water resources to produce hydro power. Demand side management and energy conservation {{was not in the}} focus of government action. In 2009, bilateral Development Cooperation between Nepal and the Federal Republic of Germany, has agreed upon the joint implementation of “Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme”. The lead executing agencies for the implementation are the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS). The aim of the programme is the promotion of energy efficiency in policy making, in rural and urban households {{as well as in the}} industry.Due to the lack of a government organization that promotes energy efficiency in the country, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) has established the Energy Efficiency Centre under his roof to promote energy conservation in the private sector. The Energy Efficiency Centre is a non-profit initiative that is offering energy auditing services to the industries. The Centre is also supported by Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit.A study conducted in 2012 found out that Nepalese industries could save 160,000 Megawatt hours of electricity and 8,000 <b>Terajoule</b> of thermal energy (like diesel, furnace oil and coal) every year.

There are the cases also of above mentioned discharges on the ground. The value of the energy transferred to the earth can comprise to several <b>terajoule.</b> Events are accompanied by the emission of the waves of ultra-low frequency. Their study has the significant interest from many points of view. The essence of the observed irregular phenomena consists of the electromechanical conversion of the energy excesses of natural electricity into mechanical and thermal energy of cyclones, typhoons and other natural cataclysms. The ionosphere can retain only the specific quantity of energy. Otherwise, it discards the surpluses of electricity through the atmosphere or transforms them into the energy of storms, in that number and inside the Earth. By using the part of the natural electricity for useful purposes it is possible to govern the weather of planet. Causing the artificial breakdowns of the ionosphere it could be possible to arrange the discharge of the controlled aqueous sediments at the necessary points of the globe. It could be possible as well to attempt to regulate the climate of planet and to decrease the amplitudes of the magnetic storms, earthquakes and hurricanes...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the influence of urban heat island (UHI) under the Hanoi Master Plan 2030 on the energy consumption for space cooling in residential buildings. The weather conditions under the current and future status (master plan condition) simulated in the previous study (Trihamdani et al., 2014) were used and cooling loads in all the residential buildings in Hanoi over the hottest month were estimated under the simulated current and future conditions by using the building simulation program, TRNSYS (v 17). Three most typical housing types in the city were selected for the simulation. The cooling loads of respective housing types were obtained {{in each of the}} districts in Hanoi. The results show that the total cooling loads over June 2010 is approximately 683 <b>Terajoule</b> (TJ) under the current status, but it is predicted to increase to 903 TJ under the master plan condition. The increment is largely due to the increase in number of households (203 TJ or 92 %), but partially due to the increase in urban temperature, i. e. UHI effect (17 TJ or 8 %). The increments in new built-up areas were found to be larger than those in existing built-up areas. The cooling load in apartment is approximately half of that in detached house, which is approximately half of that in row house. Moreover, it was seen that although sensible cooling loads increased with the increase in outdoor temperature, the latent cooling loads decreased due to the decrease in absolute humidity and the increase in air temperature...|$|E

40|$|The soundscape of the Southern Ocean is {{dominated}} by sea ice, icebergs and marine mammals. Sea ice, with its highly absorbent snow cover creates {{one of the most}} quiet acoustic environments on earth. Large table icebergs, on the other hand, weighing up to 100. 000. 000. 000 tons and moved by ocean currents can accumulate kinetic energy in the <b>terajoule</b> range which is occasionally released on collisions with other bergs, the ice shelf or the continental shelf. This creates some of the loudest events in the worlds oceans. However, the largest contribution to the underwater sound budget make marine mammals, blue whales in particular. The Perennial Acoustic Observatory in the Antarctic Ocean is continuously monitoring the underwater sound below the Eckstroem ice shelf, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica since 2005. Live streaming is available at www. awi. de/PALAOA. Additionally, an array of moored autonomous recorders deployed throughout the Weddell Sea provides basin wide sampling of acoustic data. We observe a large variability in the acoustics due to the transient nature of all the influences mentioned above: Sea ice is highly dynamic, very large icebergs are singular events and most marine mammals are migratory species - and are again influenced by the ice. So detailed knowledge of the ice situation is essential to understand the acoustics. Apparently simple questions like the population counts of certain marine mammal species are still answered with surprisingly high uncertainty yet, some estimates differ by an order of magnitude. One of the reasons is that animal counts in the polar regions are typically conducted on ship based surveys. Few ships will enter ice covered areas, however, which results in dramatic undersampling of these. And for species, like the Antarctic Minke whale which are known to populate mainly the pack ice this is fatal in terms of prediction. But as most marine mammal species are vocalizing, passive acoustic monitoring is a modern tool for density estimates. Our acoustic recordings in fact contain a wealth of information about these animals. Frequent high resolution ASAR imagery by ENVISAT and RADARSAT provided by the www. PolarView. aq portal enables a precise view on the ice conditions on top of our recorders. So we can determine the influence of ice to the presence of animals. Particulary, comparing densities in ice covered and no ice situations allows to extrapolate from the ship based open water counts to animal numbers in the ice...|$|E
40|$|The Southern Ocean {{is one of}} {{the most}} diverse soundscapes of earth. The {{dynamics}} of the cryosphere i. e. sea ice, glaciers and icebergs create unique acoustic conditions. During polar winter the snow covered sea ice shields the ocean from atmospheric influences, suppresses the creation of waves and resembles an almost perfect acoustic absorber, thus creating one of the quietest environments of all oceans. On the other hand, large table icebergs calved from the enormous ice sheet of the Antarctic continent are the largest moving objects on earth and can accumulate kinetic energy in the <b>terajoule</b> range when driven by circumpolar currents. This energy is eventually released when these giants collide with the continental or ice shelves - events that create some of the loudest sounds in the sea which can be detected thousands of kilometers away. However, these are singular events which occur only few times per year. Typically the acoustic environment is dominated by the vocalizations of marine mammals. Most remarkable, the chorus of blue whales represents the spectral peak of the acoustic spectrum, audible almost during every single minute of the year despite the remaining population of blue whales in the Southern Ocean is just 2300 animals – compared to about 350. 000 in the pre whaling area 100 years ago. The second largest source of acoustic energy are Antarctic Minke whales - the main target of today’s scientific whaling. The relation between these animals and a sound of formerly unknown origin was just recently identified in 2013. Long term acoustic monitoring of this ecosystem thus can yield easy indicators for the population development of these animals. In 2005 we set up the autonomous PALAOA observatory on the Eckström ice shelf, an acoustic array deployed through bore holes into the ocean under a 100 m thick ice sheet. In 2009 we started to add long term deep water acoustic recorders to most of the oceanographic moorings that are deployed throughout the Weddell Sea, creating a basin wide acoustic array with 20 nodes at the moment. An international project will extend this to a circum- Antarctic installation during the next years, aiming to infer the complete spatio-temporal distribution of the Antarctic great whales. While the long term recorders are typically recovered every three years and their data are analyzed offline, the PALAOA data is streamed live via satellite to the lab and the public internet. This allows to direct field parties immediately to the seaside when interesting acoustic events are detected. Additional sensors provide related information that helps to interpret the acoustics. An AIS receiver monitors all ship traffic in the area to analyze human impacts. A CTD probe delivers oceanographic data. Meteorology and webcams make local weather and ice conditions accessible. Relating the acoustics to the medium and large scale ice situation is possible through high resolution ASAR images, provided by several satellites. All this data is collected in a database at the Alfred Wegener Institute and published in the PANGAEA data center. Live audio stream and historical data are available via www. awi. de/palaoa...|$|E
