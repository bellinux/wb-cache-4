5|$|With over 400 active volcanos, Io is {{the most}} geologically active object in the Solar System. Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, {{some of which are}} taller than Earth's Mount Everest. Unlike most {{satellites}} in the outer Solar System (which have a <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of ice), Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core.|$|E
25|$|In his patent, Kilby also {{mentions}} {{the use of}} metallization layer. However, Kilby favored <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> layers of different metals (aluminium, copper or antimony-doped gold) and silicon monoxide instead of the dioxide. These ideas were not adopted {{in the production of}} ICs.|$|E
25|$|Zone 4: This is {{the final}} zone in most species. It is filled with {{digestive}} fluids, and readily absorbs nutrients released from the insects {{by the work of}} the digestive enzymes and bacteria in the pitcher fluid. Along with more digestive glands, this zone features a <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of coarse downward pointing hairs, which makes escape from the digestive fluids impossible.|$|E

25|$|The {{wall of the}} mihrab {{is covered}} with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have {{a wide variety of}} plant and {{geometric}} patterns including the stylized grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817-838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862-863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylized five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.|$|E
500|$|The fruit bodies (mushrooms) {{have several}} {{distinguishing}} characteristics that facilitate identification, including thick, white, mucilaginous stipes, and white to pale cream, convex caps that measure [...] The gills are white, widely spaced, {{and have a}} fused or decurrent attachment to the stipe. Spores are smooth, ellipsoid, and measure about 9–15 by 6–9 micrometres. The smooth and white stipes are [...] long and [...] thick, {{and covered with a}} <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of gluten.|$|E
2500|$|River buffalo prefer deep water. Swamp buffalo {{prefer to}} wallow in mudholes which they make with their horns. During wallowing, they acquire a <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of mud. Both are well adapted to a {{hot and humid}} climate with {{temperatures}} ranging from [...] in the winter to [...] and greater in the summer. Water availability is important in hot climates, since they need wallows, rivers, or splashing water to assist in thermoregulation. Some breeds are adapted to saline seaside shores and saline sandy terrain.|$|E

He rattled and clanked a little, as he moved, but in the main he seemed to be most cleverly constructed, and his appearance was only marred by the <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of polishing-paste that covered him from head to foot.|$|E
60|$|But, alas! {{the face}} of the Scarecrow and many {{portions}} of his body bore great blotches of putz-pomade; for the Tin Woodman, in his eagerness to welcome his friend, had quite forgotten the condition of his toilet and had rubbed the <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of paste from his own body to that of his comrade.|$|E
6000|$|Close to {{the temple}} a large fire was kindled, in which stones were heated red hot.

60|$|The gift {{of seeing}} {{ourselves}} as others see us is, as the poet indicates, vouchsafed to few men. Lord Belpher, not {{being one of}} these fortunates, had not the slightest conception how intensely revolting his personal appearance was at that moment. The red-rimmed eyes, the growth of stubble on the cheeks, and the <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of mud which had resulted from his rambles in the ditch combined to render him a horrifying object.|$|E
60|$|On {{arriving}} {{at home he}} related his adventure to his family, and early the next morning, accompanied by two neighbors, John White Corwell and Abner Raiser, returned to the spot. They found the body of old man Baker hanging by the neck {{from one of the}} beams of the bridge, immediately beneath the spot where the apparition had stood. A <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of dust, slightly dampened by the mist, covered the floor of the bridge, but the only footprints were those of Mr. Cummings' horse.|$|E
60|$|His only attire was a grey {{flannel shirt}} {{and a pair of}} dark trousers, both of which were torn in places and {{saturated}} with rain. Of his face I could see little, for it was half hidden by the hair, matted with dirt and rain, and by his bushy whiskers and beard, ragged and unkempt. His feet were bare and black with a <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of mud; hence his soft, stealthy tread. Altogether, he was a gruesome object, as he lay a huddled heap against the wall, muttering to himself some unintelligible jargon.|$|E

60|$|This was the {{handsome}} offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made; {{and it was}} the more singular in his case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig's head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of powder.|$|E
60|$|The reptile commences by patiently watching, {{until an}} unfortunate animal strays near {{to where it}} is lying, when it darts upon it, encircles it in its massive coils, and crushes it to death in an instant. Then it squeezes the body and broken bones into a shapeless mass; after which it licks the carcass all over, and covers it with a <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of saliva. Having thus {{prepared}} its mouthful, the anaconda begins at the tail and gradually engulfs its victim, while its elastic jaws, and throat, and stomach are distended sufficiently to let it in; after which it lies in a torpid state for many weeks, till the morsel is digested, when it is ready for another meal. A horse goes down entire, but a cow sticks at the horns, which the anaconda cannot swallow. They are allowed to protrude from its mouth until they decay and drop off.|$|E
60|$|The {{night and}} the snow came on together, and dismal enough they were. There was no sound to be heard but the howling of the wind; for {{the noise of the}} wheels, and the tread of the horses' feet, were {{rendered}} inaudible by the <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of snow which covered the ground, and was fast increasing every moment. The streets of Stamford were deserted as they passed through the town; and its old churches rose, frowning and dark, from the whitened ground. Twenty miles further on, two of the front outside passengers, wisely availing themselves of their arrival at one of the best inns in England, turned in, for the night, at the George at Grantham. The remainder wrapped themselves more closely in their coats and cloaks, and leaving the light and warmth of the town behind them, pillowed themselves against the luggage, and prepared, with many half-suppressed moans, again to encounter the piercing blast which swept across the open country.|$|E

6000|$|Hunterleys {{quenched}} his thirst at {{a roadside}} café, sitting out upon {{the pavement and}} drinking coarse red wine and soda-water. Then he bought a packet of black cigarettes and continued his journey. He was within sight of Monte Carlo when for the twentieth time he had to step {{to the far side}} of the pathway to avoid being smothered in dust by an advancing automobile. This time, by some chance, he glanced around, attracted by the piercing character of its long-distance whistle. A high-powered grey touring car came by, travelling at a great pace. Hunterleys stood perfectly rigid, one hand grasping the wall by the side of which he stood. Notwithstanding his spectacles and the <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of dust upon his clothes, the solitary passenger of the car was familiar enough to him. It was the man for whom this plot had been prepared. It was Paul Douaille, the great Foreign Minister into whose hands even the most cautious of Premiers had declared himself willing to place the destinies of his country! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{king and}} his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers. They were then {{saturated}} with tar. At {{this stage of the}} process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flu. A <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king, and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo.|$|E
60|$|For hours {{there was}} no stir in the shelter, save when a horse pawed the ground impatiently, or when Hunting Dog rose {{two or three times}} to put fresh sticks on the fire. It seemed to Tom when he woke that it ought to be nearly morning. He took out his watch, and {{by the light of the}} fire made out to his {{surprise}} that it was but ten o'clock. The turmoil of the wind seemed to him to be as loud as before, and he pulled the blankets over his shoulder again and was soon sound asleep. When he next woke, it was with the sensation of coldness in the face, and sitting up he saw that the blankets and the ground were covered with a <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of fine snow. There was a faint light in addition to that given by the embers of the fire, and he knew that morning was breaking. His movement disturbed his uncle, who was lying next him. He sat up and at once aroused the others.|$|E
