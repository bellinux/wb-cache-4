5|$|In the {{following}} season, Cousy made further progress. Averaging 7.7 assists per game, {{he won the}} first of his eight consecutive assists titles. These numbers were made {{despite the fact that the}} NBA had not yet introduced the shot clock, making the game static and putting prolific assist givers at a disadvantage. Powered by Auerbach's quick fastbreak-dominated tactics, the Celtics won 46 games and beat the Syracuse Nationals 2–0 in the 1953 NBA Playoffs. Game 2 ended 111–105 in a 4-overtime thriller, in which Cousy had a much-lauded game. Despite having an injured leg, he scored 25 points after four quarters, scored 6 of his team's 9 points in the first overtime, hit a clutch free throw in the last seconds, and scored all 4 of Boston's points in the second overtime. He scored 8 more points in the third overtime, among them a 25-ft. buzzer beater. In the fourth overtime, he scored 9 of Boston's 12 points. Cousy played 66 minutes, and scored 50 points after making a still-standing record of 30 free throws in 32 attempts. <b>This</b> <b>game</b> <b>is</b> regarded by the NBA as one of the finest scoring feats ever, in line with Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game. However, for the third time in a row, the Knicks beat Boston in the next round.|$|E
5|$|New {{additions}} to the gameplay include the combat grapple, a ranged-grab maneuver which, depending on the weapon, can pull Kratos towards foes or force them away—necessary at certain points in the game, with Kratos riding harpies across chasms—and a simple grab-with-bare-hands allowing him to use a weak foe as a battering ram. Kratos can now rapidly switch among the four primary weapons in battle, continuing the same attack combination. Other extra features include the addition of ten Godly Possessions, often hidden near defeated foes and providing additional abilities (e.g., unlimited magic) during bonus play. The challenge mode in <b>this</b> <b>game</b> <b>is</b> called the Challenge of Olympus (seven trials) and is unlocked after the game's completion. This mode requires players to complete a series of specific tasks—for example, killing all enemies without using weapons before time runs out. The player may unlock additional rewards, such as bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters and environments, by completing the game's difficulty levels and the challenge mode. A new mode, the Combat Arena, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose opponents to hone playing skills.|$|E
5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of <b>this</b> <b>game</b> <b>is</b> available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the correct answer into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|E

5|$|In the story-driven Scenario Campaign mode in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Tekken 6, Lars is made {{into the central}} character. After the infiltration of a Mishima Zaibatsu-run laboratory goes awry, {{and a number of}} Jack robots overwhelm Lars' rebel squadron, he loses his memory and begins to seek out his true purpose. Joined by a robot named Alisa Bosconovitch, Lars travels the world trying to find his own identity. Along the way, he meets a Tekken Force lieutenant who tries to enlist him to help the cause once more. Lars' memory is restored on encountering his father Heihachi Mishima at his compound, at which point he also rediscovers his purpose: to stop Jin. He resumes his role {{as the leader of the}} rebel Tekken Force army and infiltrates G Corporation, and eventually meets Mishima Zaibatsu himself and encounters his half-nephew, Jin. Before he can fight Jin at Zaibatsu headquarters, it is revealed that Alisa has been acting as Jin's surveillance unit and has been monitoring Lars' movements around the world. This results in Lars and Alisa becoming enemies. At this point, a warrior named Raven offers to accompany Lars, and together the two pursue Jin into the desert, where he intends to awaken the ancient beast Azazel. At Azazel's Temple, Raven and Lars defeat the newly-awoken Azazel, and encounter Alisa and Jin again. Lars disables Alisa and engages Jin in battle, in revenge for his treatment of Alisa. During the fight, Azazel reappears and Jin turns his attention to the monster. Jin destroys Azazel, seemingly at the cost of his own life. Lars then brings the disabled Alisa to his partner and adoptive brother Lee Chaolan, who offers to restore her. After leaving Alisa with Lee, and parting company with Raven, Lars gets a call summoning him for a new mission. Lars' role in <b>this</b> <b>game</b> <b>is</b> also briefly shown in the manga Tekken Comic, and the novel Tekken: The Dark History of Mishima.|$|E
