In the real world, a radar tracker typically faces a combination of all of these effects; this has {{led to the development of}} an increasingly sophisticated set of algorithms to resolve the problem. Due to the need to form radar tracks in real time, usually for several hundred targets at once, the deployment of radar tracking algorithms has typically been limited by the available computational power.|$|E

Since this problem is a particular case of the general problem of parametrizing all the stabilizing controllers of a stable perturbation of a (infinite-dimensional) stabilizable plant, this problem is studied in its generality. Within the fractional representation approach to synthesis problems, we give an elementary proof {{for the existence of}} a general parametrization of all the stabilizing controllers of a stabilizable plant which does not necessarily admit doubly coprime factorizations. Only the knowledge of a (finite-dimensional) stabilizing controller is required. If the plant admits doubly coprime factorizations, then this parametrization yields the Youla-Kučera parametrization.

40|$|Multiple target {{tracking}} concerns {{the estimation of}} an unknown and time-varying number of objects (targets) as they dynamically evolve over time from a sequence of measurements obtained from sensors at discrete time intervals. In the Bayesian filtering framework the estimation problem incorporates natural phenomena such as false measurements and target birth/death. Though theoretically optimal, the generally intractable Bayesian filter requires suitable approximations. This thesis is particularly motivated by a first-order moment approximation known as the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter. The emphasis in this thesis is on the further development of the PHD filter for handling more advanced target <b>tracking</b> <b>problems,</b> principally involving multiple group and extended targets. A group target {{is regarded as a}} collection of targets that share a common motion or characteristic, while an extended target is regarded as a target that potentially generates multiple measurements. The main contributions are the derivations of the PHD filter for multiple group and extended target <b>tracking</b> <b>problems</b> and their subsequent closed-form solutions. The proposed algorithms are applied in simulated scenarios and their estimate results demonstrate that accurate tracking performance is attainable for certain group/extended target <b>tracking</b> <b>problems.</b> The performance is further analysed with the use of suitable metrics.
