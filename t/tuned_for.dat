5|$|Large {{sections}} of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt 1969 Dodge Charger. It {{appears to have been}} <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> performance. A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate the car in the chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E
5|$|Strategic Air Command {{found itself}} in an uncomfortable position; bombers had been <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> {{efficiency}} at high speeds and altitudes, performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms. Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in the long-range role, SAC had introduced the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance {{in comparison to the}} B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.|$|E
5|$|This {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution {{to one of the}} most vexing problems of the era, designing an aircraft that was effective at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Subsonic lift is created by the airflow around the wing following streamlines, but supersonic lift is generated by shock waves at points of critical curvature. No single design could offer high performance for both regimes. The blown disk could attack this problem by being laid out for supersonic performance only, and then using jet thrust to modify subsonic airflow into a semblance of a normal wing. The resulting design would be <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> high supersonic performance, have reasonable subsonic performance, and would also offer VTOL, all in a single design.|$|E

25|$|The Birdcage 75th {{is built}} on the carbon fiber chassis of a Maserati MC12 GT1 race car and shares many components, most notably the engine. The Birdcage 75th is powered by the Ferrari/Maserati F140 V12 engine from the MC12 and the Enzo, mid mounted at 65°. The engine has been <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> the Birdcage {{and as a result}} {{produces}} around 700brake horsepower.|$|E
25|$|Much code written {{today is}} {{intended}} to run on as many machines as possible. As a consequence, programmers and compilers don't always {{take advantage of the}} more efficient instructions provided by newer CPUs or quirks of older models. Additionally, assembly code <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> a particular processor without using such instructions might still be suboptimal on a different processor, expecting a different tuning of the code.|$|E

25|$|NABTS was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} protocol by the Canadian Department of Communications, with their industry partner Norpak, for the Telidon system. It {{was similar to the}} European World System Teletext (WST, aka CCIR Teletext System B), but differences between the European and North American television standards and the greater flexibility of the Telidon standard {{led to the creation of}} a new delivery mechanism that was <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> speed.|$|E
25|$|Cruisers are styled after American {{machines}} {{from the}} 1930s {{to the early}} 1960s, such as those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, and Excelsior-Henderson. Harley-Davidsons largely define the cruiser category, and large-displacement V-twin engines are the norm, although other engine configurations and small to medium displacements also exist. Their engines are <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> low-end torque, making them less demanding to ride {{because it is not}} necessary to shift as frequently to accelerate or maintain control.|$|E

It differed {{in the use of}} iron heads for durability, camshafts <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> increased low-end torque, and intake silencers to decrease drive-by noise (only in engines used in luxury-brand cars).|$|E
25|$|Suspension was a MacPherson strut {{arrangement}} at the front, {{anchored by}} lower alloy L-arms. The wide spacing of the mounting points, compliant bushings and a perimeter subframe gave the model a cushioned yet precise ride with relaxed handling {{that could be}} <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> different markets or model derivatives such as the later MG ZT. The rear suspension, {{after a period of}} uncertainty during development, was eventually a version of BMW's Z-Axle arrangement first featured on the 1988 Z1 sports car.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, D {{algorithms}} can {{be designed}} for important algorithms (e.g., sorting, FFTs, and matrix multiplication) to be optimal cache-oblivious algorithms–they use the cache in a probably optimal way, in an asymptotic sense, regardless of the cache size. In contrast, the traditional approach to exploiting the cache is blocking, as in loop nest optimization, {{where the problem is}} explicitly divided into chunks of the appropriate size—this can also use the cache optimally, but only when the algorithm is <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> the specific cache size(s) of a particular machine.|$|E

25|$|In Indian {{classical}} music and Indian light music, the mandolin, which bears {{little resemblance to}} the European mandolin, is usually tuned E–B–E–B. As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian {{classical music}}, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C–G–C–G, which corresponds to sa–pa–sa–pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style. This tuning corresponds to the way violins are <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> carnatic classical music. This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra, dance music popular in Punjabi culture.|$|E
25|$|OSPF was {{the first}} widely {{deployed}} routing protocol that could converge a network in the low seconds, and guarantee loop-free paths. It has many features that allow the imposition of policies about the propagation of routes {{that it may be}} appropriate to keep local, for load sharing, and for selective route importing more than IS-IS. IS-IS, in contrast, can be <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> lower overhead in a stable network, the sort more common in ISP than enterprise networks. There are some historical accidents that made IS-IS the preferred IGP for ISPs, but ISP's today may well choose to use the features of the now-efficient implementations of OSPF, after first considering {{the pros and cons of}} IS-IS in service provider environments.|$|E
25|$|Juddering, shuddering and moaning: This {{is caused}} by an {{irregular}} and unstable flow from the second stage, It {{may be caused by}} a slight positive feedback between flow rate in the second stage body and diaphragm deflection opening the valve, which is not sufficient to cause free-flow, but enough to cause the system to hunt. It is more common on high-performance regulators which are <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> maximum flow and minimum work of breathing, particularly out of the water, and often reduces or resolves when the regulator is immersed and the ambient water damps the movement of the diaphragm and other moving parts. Desensitising the second stage by closing venturi assists or increasing the valve spring pressure often stops this problem. Juddering may also be caused by excessive but irregular friction of valve moving parts.|$|E

25|$|The MIPS MT {{architecture}} {{also allows}} {{the allocation of}} processor cycles to threads, and sets the relative thread priorities with an optional Quality of Service (QoS) manager block. This enables two prioritization mechanisms that determine {{the flow of information}} across the bus. The first mechanism allows the user to prioritize one thread over another. The second mechanism is used to allocate a specified ratio of the cycles to specific threads over time. The combined use of both mechanisms allows effective allocation of bandwidth to the set of threads, and better control of latencies. In real-time systems, system-level determinism is very critical, and the QoS block facilitates improvement of the predictability of a system. Hardware designers of advanced systems may replace the standard QoS block provided by MIPS Technologies with one that is specifically <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> their application.|$|E
25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine <b>tuned</b> <b>for</b> LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.|$|E
