25|$|Forestry in India is a {{significant}} rural industry and a major environmental resource. India {{is one of the}} ten most forest-rich countries of the world along with the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan. Together, India and these countries account for 67 percent of <b>total</b> <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> of the world. India's forest cover grew at 0.22% annually over 1990-2000, and has grown at the rate of 0.46% per year over 2000-2010, after decades where forest degradation was a matter of serious concern.|$|E

50|$|Chichawatni city is the {{headquarters}} of a Pakistani forest division. The local <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> is called Chichawatni Reserved Forest. During the War of Independence of 1857, local people fought against the British in this forest. In World War II, many foreign prisoners were brought here to be confined in this forest.

50|$|Specific climatic conditions, {{as well as}} the {{geological}} diversity in the region, create conditions for a heterogeneous natural vegetation and differentiation of altitude belts. The region is home to multiple plant communities. The abundance of forests in the region is linked to 25 different tree species, with multiple subspecies. The forests have an important function in increasing water storage and reducing soil erosion as well as in maintaining biological diversity. The <b>total</b> <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> in the catchment is 1'157 km2 or around 27% of the territory of the region.|$|R
5|$|About 17.8 percent——of the <b>total</b> <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> of Vietnam was sprayed {{during the}} war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many <b>areas.</b> Many defoliated <b>forest</b> <b>areas</b> were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|R

40|$|Forest in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) covers 56, 285, 000 ha (5 % of European <b>total</b> <b>forested</b> <b>area).</b> <b>Forest</b> {{cover in}} CEE makes 30 % of land use. Almost 50 % {{of the forest}} under study is formed by {{coniferous}} species and only 30 % by deciduous ones. Forest younger than 60 years old grows on 57 % of that area. These factors, together with climate conditions cause that on {{the main part of}} CEE middle forest fire risk is noted. Between 1991 and 2001 some 387, 680 fires burning 757, 000 ha were noted in CEE. The most hazardous situation is observed in Poland where over 60 % of fires and burns happen. Forest Research Institute in Warsaw has prepared a method of emission calculation based on the Polish experience. As the type of forest and environmental condition in the described area are similar, some calculations on emissions from neighbor countries, based on FAO’s forest fire statistics were elaborated...|$|R

Two large reservoirs, namely Barna Reservoir and Ratapani Dam (Barrusot lake) are among the major waterbodies adjacent to or inside the sanctuary.|$|E
40|$|Deforestation {{literature}} commonly associates rising {{commodity prices}} with forest loss. Informal interviews in Manabí, Ecuador suggested that corn crops from forest conversion are often abandoned before harvest. Medium-resolution satellite imagery {{was used to}} formally measure the conversion of forest to cornfields. Between 2000 and 2005, despite a 185 % increase in real domestic corn prices, coastal Ecuador experienced a 2. 2 % increase in <b>total</b> <b>forested</b> <b>area.</b> This observed <b>forest</b> gain contradicts the widely cited FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment deforestation rates. A multi-disciplinary approach brings into question the utility of national level patterns in sub-regional decision-making. When conducting future research, scholars must consider the original scale of measurement before applying past deforestation estimates...|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} way {{forest resource}} managers influence growth and yield is {{to manipulate the}} mixture of species and number (density) and distribution (stocking) of individuals that form the canopy of the stand. Species composition {{of much of the}} boreal forest in North America already differs greatly from its pre-exploitation state. There is less spruce and more hardwoods in the second-growth forest than in the original forest; Hearnden et al. (1996) calculated that the spruce cover type had declined from 18% to only 4% of the <b>total</b> <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> in Ontario. Mixedwood occupies a greater proportion of Ontario's second-growth forest (41%) than in the original (36%), but its component of white spruce is certainly much diminished.|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the ecological footprint method is proposed for assessing the environmental performances of urban transportation systems. The method, starting from {{the knowledge of the}} composition of the running vehicular fleet, is here applied to a southern Italian province. It represents a synthetic indicator of the environmental pressure exerted by the system also matching the pollutant emissions with the carrying capacity of the site. Particularly, the <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> needed to absorb the CO 2 emissions of the system is compared with the <b>total</b> <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> of the province. The results of the case-study indicates the yearly maximum distance that each vehicle of the fleet can cover in order for their emissions to be absorbed by the surrounding <b>forested</b> <b>area.</b> Specifically, if all cars of the fleet would travel for 10, 000 km/year, 97 % of the <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> would be involved. Thanks to its features, this indicator can be usefully adopted for ranking different transportation options. Therefore, it could allow local administrations to environmentally hierarchize alternative plans concerning urban transportation choices...|$|R
