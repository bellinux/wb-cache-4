Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be." [...] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.|$|E

When Gilligan turned in his script, he told series creator Chris Carter that the episode was [...] "the best work I'm ever gonna [...] do for you." [...] Carter retorted that the writers for the show should always [...] "better yourself" [...] by trying to out-do their last scripting effort.

He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T.R.M.Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments {{were published in the}} press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying, [...] "The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do was to defend those peckerwoods.

500|$|During {{the second}} half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.", [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through.

500|$|When Dragon Ball began, it was {{loosely based}} on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Xuanzang. Toriyama {{continued}} to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but {{over the course of}} time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a [...] "nearly-pure fighting manga" [...] later on. He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of. In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama admitted, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy." [...] Speaking of his manga in general, he said, [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through.

500|$|In 2011, manga {{critic and}} editor of Viz's editions of the series Jason Thompson said that: [...] "Dragon Ball {{is by far the}} most {{influential}} shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every Shōnen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways." [...] Explaining its basic formula of [...] "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, [...] a few jokes" [...] became the model for other shōnen series, such as Naruto. Thompson cited the artwork as influential, pointing out that popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball had the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that he says still continues. Commenting on Dragon Balls global success nearly two decades after it ended, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy. The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers." ...|$|E

500|$|Takei {{declared}} {{it was not}} a decrease on the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a [...] "fatigue" [...] he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being [...] "normalized" [...] by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical shōnen aspects and losing its originality. In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008, with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, [...] "After making the readers [...] so much for this, the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do was to disappoint them". He thought the ending was a [...] "huge responsibility". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something [...] "fun," [...] as it was different from scratch.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Record, Carr stated he wanted to entertain the reader, while also staying faithful to the time period.

[...] "The one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to show was that people back then are a lot more like people today than we realize," [...] said Carr.

2500|$|The Black Keys began {{recording}} Turn Blue in January 2013 at Key Club in Benton Harbor, Michigan, {{during a}} break from their El Camino Tour. The studio had a rare Flickinger recording console custom built for Sly Stone that the band liked, and the location had been recommended by fellow rock band the Kills. For Turn Blue, {{just as they did}} for El Camino, the Black Keys entered the studio without having written any songs. Auerbach said, [...] "Every morning we got to the studio, we'd start from scratch {{and by the end of}} the day we'd have a new song and that was really it." [...] The group spent 12 days at Key Club, sleeping above the studio and not once leaving the building. During these sessions, [...] "Gotta Get Away", [...] "It's Up to You Now", and the first half of [...] "Fever" [...] were recorded. Carney said that while in Michigan, the group was still trying to write hooky songs like they did for El Camino: [...] "we were still on that singles <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> [...] to let the record just breathe, and I think [...] wanted the songs to move along... There were some moments that got a little tense." [...] Carney added, [...] "We were kind of playing it safe. So we put the sessions on hold." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, Miller {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to make Fury Road and that the film was never going to involve Gibson: [...] "There's a real hope. The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do is another Mad Max, but this script came along, and I'm completely carried away with it." [...] The film's screenplay was co-written with cult British comic creator Brendan McCarthy, who also designed many of the new characters and vehicles. Miller again confirmed his intention to make another Mad Max at the 2007 Aurora filmmaker initiative. However, he {{stated that he}} thought Gibson would not be interested in the film because of his age. Heath Ledger was reportedly considered for the lead before his death in 2008. On 5 March 2009, it was announced that an R-rated 3D animated feature film was in pre-production and would be taking much of the plot from Fury Road, although Gibson would not be in the film and Miller was looking for a [...] "different route", a [...] "renaissance" [...] of the franchise. Miller cited director Akira Kurosawa as an inspiration for {{what he wanted to do}} with the franchise. Miller was also developing an action-adventure tie-in video game based on the fourth film, along with God of War II video game designer Cory Barlog. Both projects were expected to take two to two-and-a-half years, according to Miller, with a release date of either 2011 or 2012. Fury Road was going to be produced at Dr. D Studios, a digital art studios founded in 2008 by Miller and Doug Mitchell.|$|E
