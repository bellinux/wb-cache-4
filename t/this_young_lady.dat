25|$|The {{paths of}} Teng and his {{childhood}} friend Leah cross once again. This time, Teng {{realizes that he}} is in love with <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> who comes from a rich family. But things turn out difficult for Teng to confess his love for Leah because the young lady has an arrogant boyfriend.|$|E
2500|$|... “During {{the late}} visit of Red Cloud {{and his party}} to New York, {{they went to the}} Olympic Theater to witness the funny {{pantomime}} of Humpty Dumpty. The Herald says: They stalked into the theater cool as a cucumber, and took orchestra chairs without saying a word.... The wild Indian is a stolid being naturally. He does not believe in manifesting astonishment or surprise at anything, but the ballet was too much for their gravity. Before Blue Horse was half an hour in the theater he had fallen desperately in love with a shapely girl who performed as a coryphee in the ballet. <b>This</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> saw the affection beaming visibly out of the eyes of Blue Horse, and it touched her heart so deeply that she jumped three times as high in every movement as her salary would permit.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was sheer Insolence in you, I tell you,' said Mr Boffin, 'even {{to think}} of <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady.</b> <b>This</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> was far above YOU. <b>This</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> {{was no match for}} YOU. <b>This</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> was lying in wait (as she was {{qualified}} to do) for money, and you had no money.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{with her}} present, with her future, when they change like <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's,</b> I suppose {{everything}} else changes. How {{do you say}} it in America? She lets him slide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{beg your}} pardon,’ Otto cut in. ‘You were {{addressing}} me. In virtue of what circumstance am I to render you {{an account of}} <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady’s</b> conduct? Are you her father? her brother? her husband?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I presume, in {{the first}} place," [...] began Mr. Prendergast, [...] "that this lady here is your legal wife, and <b>this</b> <b>younger</b> <b>lady</b> your {{legitimate}} daughter? There is no doubt I take it as to that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How dare you, sir,' said Mr Boffin, 'tamper, {{unknown to}} me, with <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady?</b> How dare {{you come out}} of your station, and your place in my house, to pester <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> with your impudent addresses?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] said Mr. Bucket. [...] "Because you'll {{come to that}} if {{you don't}} look out. Why, {{at the very moment}} while I speak, I know what your mind's not wholly free from {{respecting}} <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady.</b> But shall I tell you who <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> is? Now, come, you're what I call an intellectual woman--with your soul too large for your body, if you come to that, and chafing it--and you know me, and you recollect where you saw me last, and what was talked of in that circle. Don't you? Yes! Very well. <b>This</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> is that young lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What are you, I {{should like}} to know,' pursued Mr Boffin, 'that you were to have the audacity to follow up <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady?</b> <b>This</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> was looking about {{the market for a}} good bid; she wasn't in it to be snapped up by fellows that had no money to lay out; nothing to buy with.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{like the}} plan,' said Mr. Pickwick; 'but as I see no other, {{and as the}} {{happiness}} of <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> whole life is at stake, I adopt it. I shall be sure to be there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How do you {{reconcile}} that, with <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> being a weak-spirited, improvident idiot, {{not knowing}} what was due to herself, flinging up her money to the church-weathercocks, and racing off at a splitting pace for the workhouse?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You hold strong cards, Mr. Arnold Greatson," [...] he said, [...] "but I {{see their}} backs only. How do I {{know that you}} speak the truth? From whom have you learnt the story of <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> antecedents?" ...|$|R
60|$|Even {{then and}} there Morris could not help a smile; really <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> was very original.|$|E
60|$|Rollo, {{observing that}} <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> {{appeared}} {{not to be}} particularly afraid of him, thought he would accost her.|$|E
60|$|LORD CAVERSHAM. And if you don’t make <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> {{an ideal}} husband, I’ll {{cut you off}} with a shilling.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] Otto cut in. [...] "You were {{addressing}} me. In virtue of what circumstance am I to render you {{an account of}} <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> conduct? Are you her father? her brother? her husband?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Remember,' said Mr. Pickwick, with beaming eyes, 'we {{met her at}} our {{excellent}} and hospitable friend's, Winkle. It would be an ill return to tamper lightly, and without due consideration, with <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> affections. I'll not allow that, sir. I'll not allow it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by this intrusion, sir? How dare you force your way into my house in my absence? How dare you {{encourage}} my servants to disobey my orders? How dare you imperil <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> health by coming here to talk with her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Mitchy smiled, [...] "about its ramifications. <b>This</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> has a {{tremendous}} friendship--and in short it's all very complicated." ...|$|E
60|$|Then muttering {{something}} {{beneath his}} breath about ladies {{in general and}} <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> in particular, the Colonel departed with speed.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{understand}} that <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> is quite beneath yourself in life. She {{lives with her}} mother in a little cottage, without servants,--" ...|$|E
60|$|Bernard noted this, {{wondering}} how it bore upon {{his theory of}} a spiteful element in his companion. Of course Blanche was silly; but, equally of course, <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> perception of it was quickened by Blanche's having married a rich man whom she herself might have married.|$|R
60|$|Sir John. Madam, <b>this</b> fair <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> {{begs the}} honour {{to be known}} to you.|$|R
60|$|Louise {{dropped her}} fork with a clatter, disclosing, in <b>this</b> well-bred <b>young</b> <b>lady,</b> an unusual degree of excitement.|$|R
60|$|RAINA. To {{neither of}} them. <b>This</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> (introducing Louka, who faces them all proudly) {{is the object}} of Major Saranoff's {{affections}} at present.|$|E
6000|$|... "If somebody," [...] he said, [...] "does {{not attend}} <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> within a minute, I shall make a {{personal}} complaint to Mr. Thorn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{take your}} advice {{if you take}} mine to leave another {{business}} alone, that of <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> and her father, but not otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I called," [...] {{said the}} large-featured {{woman with a}} voice equally pronounced, [...] "in {{reference}} to a request from you, which, though perhaps unconventional in the extreme, I {{have been able to}} meet by the intervention of <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> company. My name on this card may not be familiar to you--but I am 'Dorothy Dewdrop.'" ...|$|R
60|$|No one who {{was present}} at the inquest failed to be charmed with the {{appearance}} and conduct of <b>this</b> beautiful <b>young</b> <b>lady.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do {{not believe}} it is her fault, poor child,' said Albert. 'Martindale has set <b>this</b> haughty <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> to keep guard over her--' ...|$|R
6000|$|Emily {{introduced}} Mrs. Ellmother to Francine. [...] "It may {{be worth}} your while," [...] she hinted, [...] "to hear what <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> has to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't you? Or won't you? What {{else could}} you have made <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady</b> out to be, if she had listened to such {{addresses}} as yours?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay,' {{returned}} the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; 'you have more fortitude than this, I am sure. Do you know <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady,</b> sir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I mention no names, Julia,' replied Mr Wititterly; 'and {{nobody is}} injured. I merely mention the {{circumstance}} {{to show that}} you are no ordinary person, that there is a constant friction perpetually going on between your mind and your body; and that you must be soothed and tended. Now let me hear, dispassionately and calmly, what are <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> qualifications for the office.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be it so," [...] {{answered}} Tyrrel. [...] "Indeed, {{the proposal}} {{you have just}} made indicates that his pretended claim on <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>lady's</b> hand is entirely, or almost entirely, dictated by motives of interest, since you are of opinion {{that he would be}} contented to separate from her society on the very marriage day, provided that, in doing so, he was assured of the Nettlewood property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, and don't you think, old feller,' remonstrated Mr. Weller, 'that if you {{let your}} master take in <b>this</b> here <b>young</b> <b>lady,</b> you're a {{precious}} rascal?' ...|$|R
