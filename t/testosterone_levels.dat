5|$|The female is mildly {{aggressive}} to her suitors during estrus, {{and will}} often lunge at males, usually {{after a long}} period of being approached and followed. Vocalizations during mating include a whistling sound, most commonly by the female, usually during June and August, coinciding with female estrus. Other vocalizations recorded during estrus include chittering and growling. The <b>testosterone</b> <b>levels</b> of the males are seasonal, with peaks coinciding with female estrogen peaks.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, <b>testosterone</b> <b>levels</b> are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E

40|$|Background Patients with {{homozygous}} {{beta thalassemia}} require regular transfusions which {{will lead to}} iron deposition in tissues including testicles. Objective This study aimed to evaluate testicular function in syn- thesizing testosterone by measuring free <b>testosterone</b> <b>level.</b> The correlation between free <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> and transferrin satura- tion was evaluated. Methods This was a cross sectional study. Sampling was done consecutively. Free <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> was measured by radioim- munoassay in 20 homozygous beta thalassemic patients receiv- ing regular transfusions and compared to 20 healthy subjects. Results Fourteen out of 20 patients showed free <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> below the reference range. Out of 20 thalassemic patients, one patient’s serum was not enough for transferrin saturation determi- nation. Among the 19 patients, 18 had transferrin saturation above 55 %, 1 less than 55 %, while all healthy subjects had normal trans- ferrin saturation. A {{significant difference was found}} between the two groups, both in the free <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> (p= 0. 001) and trans- ferrin saturation (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Testosterone was {{the most}} {{important}} androgen secreted into the blood in males. It was responsible for development of secondary male sex characteristics and its measurements are helpful in evaluating the hypogonadal states. Decreasing of testosterone in males started in middle age, about 45 – 59 years old. It is responsible of decreasing muscle mass and strength, increasing of body fat especially abdominal fat and gynecomastia, less of libido and sexual intercourse frequency, increase of erectile dysfunction. Objective: The objective of this study was conducted stimulation on acupuncture reproduction point to increase <b>testosterone</b> hormone <b>level</b> in elder’s men. Methods: The study used non randomized experiment pre- post test without control group design, the samples was 40 older men, about 50 – more than 70 years old. The stimulation on acupuncture point CV- 4, Sp- 6, LV- 3, and ST- 36, on older men were given five times per week, for ten treatments, before treatment each patient was determined the concentration of testosterone hormone and after ten times acupuncture treatment. Results: 15 old men, have increased <b>testosterone</b> <b>level,</b> 20 old men have decreased <b>testosterone</b> <b>level,</b> and 16 old men have no changes in libido after ten times acupuncture treatment. Not all responder after therapy acupuncture ten times at reproduction point have increased of hormone testosterone. Most of 50 – 69 year men have increased <b>testosterone</b> <b>level.</b> Men above 70 year have no changes <b>testosterone</b> <b>level.</b> There were 24 old men have changes in libido without increased <b>testosterone</b> <b>level.</b> Conclusion: acupuncture may used as alternative therapy to increased <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> and libido for elderly men.   Key words: Acupuncture, testosterone hormone, old men</p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: A high {{body mass}} index (BMI) and a low <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> were {{recently}} reported to be prognostic factors for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence following radical prostatectomy (RP). The goal {{of this study was}} to clarify their relationship and influences on biochemical recurrence after RP. Methods: We analysed 126 patients whose data, including the pre-operative BMI and pre-operative serum total <b>testosterone</b> <b>level,</b> were available. All patients underwent RP at our institution between March 1998 and April 2006 without any adjuvant therapy or pelvic lymph node metastasis. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the multivariate analysis regarding PSA recurrence for the variables of age, operation period, BMI, clinical stage, PSA, Gleason’s sum, pre-operative serum total <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> and margin status. Results: There were no internal correlations among the parameters we used, even between BMI and the total <b>testosterone</b> <b>level.</b> The total <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> was not different between two BMI groups (BMI, 26. 4 and 26. 4 kg/m 2 : the cut-off is the mean þ 1 SD). BMI, PSA and Gleason’s sum were found to be independent predictors for PSA recurrence through the multivariate analysis. PSA recurrence-free survival rates at 2 years were 77 % for BMI, 26. 4 kg/m 2, and 31 % for BMI 26. 4 kg/m 2 (P 0. 002, log-rank test, 95 % CI: 1. 489 – 7. 726). Conclusions: The current study suggests that high BMI independently contributes to PSA recurrence but that the total <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> does not. Although the mechanism by which obesity promotes PSA recurrence in RP patients has not been established, careful observation is needed for patients with high BMI...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAimsPrevalence of {{hypogonadism}} {{is largely}} {{unknown in the}} general population and population of diabetics in Arab countries including Jordan. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of hypogonadism among men with type 2 diabetes in Jordan and determine its associated factors. MethodsThis cross-sectional study included a total of 1049 consecutive men with type 2 diabetes who attended the National Center for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Genetics (NCDEG) in Amman, Jordan, in the period from August 2008 to February 2009. Data were collected from medical records and using a pre-structured questionnaire. Clinical characteristic, anthropometric measurements and laboratory measurements were obtained. Hypogonadism was defined as total testosterone < 3 ng/ml. ResultsOverall, 36. 4 % of patients with diabetes had total <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> < 3 ng/ml and 29 % had symptoms of androgen deficiency. Of those with serum <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> < 3 ng/ml, 80. 2 % had symptoms of androgen deficiency. About 16. 9 % of those with serum <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> < 3 ng/ml had primary hypogonadism and 83. 1 % had secondary hypogonadism. Age, monthly income of less than 500 JD, obesity, and neuropathy were significantly associated with low serum total <b>testosterone</b> <b>level.</b> ConclusionsThe prevalence of hypogonadism among men with type 2 diabetes in Jordan is high. This urgently calls for implementing early and universal screening programs irrespective of symptoms of androgen deficiency to detect those who have low serum total <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> at any early stage and to supplement testosterone accordingly...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{chlorpyrifos}} exposure {{reduction in}} the serum <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> is demonstrated by Joshi et al. (2007). Our result is focusing the same light. Similar observation was noted by Zidan (2009), who revealed that there is significant alteration in chlorpyrifos methyl, diazinon and profenofos treated male rat testosterone. He also stated that testosterone is the principal male hormone produced by the interstitial Leydig cells of testes. Thus testes {{are responsible for the}} synthesis of the male sex hormones; so the decrease in <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> might be due to an extensive damage of Leydig cells. Besides, disorders of male genital function (hypogonadism) are manifested by a decrease in plasma <b>testosterone</b> <b>level.</b> Hypogonadism may occur with faulty seminiferous tubular function or defective Leyding cell function and this leads to aridity through decreased production of spermatozoa (Zidan 2009).|$|R

40|$|Background: According to the World Health Organization, {{road traffic}} crashes {{represent}} the single {{leading cause of}} death for young people. Road traffic crashes are largely preventable, yet the precise mechanisms underlying individual driving risk remain relatively unidentified. Some risky drivers are over-represented among those involved in serious and fatal road traffic crashes, including those who misuse alcohol. Understanding what drives their risk taking is a key to developing evidence-based and effective prevention programs. Research focusing on the causes of risky driving has examined neurobiological markers of risk taking, such as cortisol, serotonin, and adrenaline. The steroid hormone testosterone has received substantial attention in relation to risk taking, but not specifically related to driving behaviour. Testosterone has been associated with sensation seeking and impulsivity, two consistent correlates of risky driving. Furthermore, interactions between testosterone and alcohol in relation to sensation seeking and impulsivity have been observed, potentially making testosterone a specific factor in driving while impaired with alcohol. In this experiment, four hypotheses were tested: H 1) Young drivers with higher <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> show higher mean speed in simulation than young drivers with lower testosterone level; H 2) Alcohol moderates the relationship between <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> and mean speed; H 3) Sex moderates the relationship between <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> and mean speed; H 4) Sensation seeking and impulsivity mediate the relationship between <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> and mean speed under alcohol. Methods: This study {{is part of a larger}} between-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled experiment. Eleven male and eleven female drivers aged 18 - 34 years were recruited and their saliva assayed for endogenous <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> using radioimmunoassay. Participants also responded to questionnaires assessing sensation seeking and impulsive personality characteristics, and performed two driving simulation tasks, one at BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0 % (no-alcohol condition) and another at a positive BAC of 0. 02 % - 0. 05 % (i. e., alcohol condition). Results: H 1 was not supported by the findings; young drivers with higher <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> did not report higher simulated speed than young drivers with lower <b>testosterone</b> <b>level,</b> p >. 05. H 2 was supported. A significant alcohol X testosterone interaction was detected (p =. 04; partial Eta-squared =. 20). Specifically, young drivers with higher <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> reported higher mean speed than drivers with lower <b>testosterone</b> <b>level,</b> but only after alcohol consumption. Sex was not a significant moderator of the relationship between <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> and simulated speed (p >. 05). Neither sensation seeking nor impulsivity mediated the relationship between <b>testosterone</b> <b>level</b> and simulated speed under alcohol (p >. 05). Conclusion: Interaction between testosterone hormone and alcohol may be one mechanism contributing to risky driving under legal BAC (in Canada. 05). H 2 a été soutenue par les résultats. Une interaction significative entre l'alcool et la testostérone a été détectée (p =. 04; Eta-carré partielle =. 20). Plus précisément, les jeunes conducteurs ayant un niveau élevé de testostérone ont démontré une vitesse en simulation plus élevée que ceux ayant un niveau plus faible et ce dans la condition alcool, mais pas à la ligne de base. Le sexe n'était pas un modérateur significatif de la relation entre le niveau de testostérone et la vitesse en simulation (p >. 05). Ni la recherche de sensations, ni l'impulsivité n'avait un effet médiateur sur la relation entre le niveau de testostérone et la vitesse en simulation après consommation d'alcool (p >. 05). Conclusion: L'interaction entre la testostérone et l'alcool pourrait être un mécanisme contribuant à la conduite à risque avec un taux d'alcoolémie sous la limite légale (au Canada < 0. 08 %). En pratique, les résultats de cette étude peuvent aider à élaborer des programmes éducatifs, basés sur l'âge et le sexe, afin de mieux informer les jeunes conducteurs sur les facteurs neurobiologiques qui peuvent affecter leur aptitude à conduire...|$|R
