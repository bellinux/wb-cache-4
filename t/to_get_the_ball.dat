5|$|The {{teams were}} as evenly matched {{in the third}} quarter as they had been in the first, with Vanderbilt gaining only two first downs. Soon after the start of the fourth quarter Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for a 25-yeard return to Georgia's 40-yard line. Two long pass {{attempts}} failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith sneaked in behind Ryan, rushing to recover the 25-yard onside kick from scrimmage. Smith jumped up <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from a horde of Bulldogs after they let it bounce, and raced for a 15-yard touchdown. After he added an extra point, the game ended in a 7–7 tie.|$|E
5|$|Towers {{scored the}} first Welsh try, which was {{converted}} by Jim Webb. The Natives {{replied with a}} spirited run by Ellison, but he failed {{to break through the}} Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half-way line, which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E
5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This made it very hard for defenders to mark them.|$|E
25|$|When {{dribbling}} past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble {{with the}} hand farthest from the opponent, {{making it more difficult}} for <b>the</b> defensive player <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> It is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.|$|R
50|$|Clemente {{eventually}} hit a Baltimore Chop towards {{first with}} first baseman Skowron and Coates trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at <b>the</b> same {{time at the}} cut of the infield grass. Clemente's speed forced Skowron to just hold onto <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as Coates, after trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>ball,</b> could not make it to first base in time to cover. The high chopper allowed Virdon to score, cutting the Yankee lead to 7-6. Hal Smith followed with a three-run home run to give the Pirates a 9-7 lead. Ralph Terry relieved Coates and got the last out.|$|R
50|$|Hoppers {{contain the}} paintball supply for a marker, much as {{magazines}} contain the ammunition {{on a regular}} rifle. With few exceptions, hoppers are all mounted above the marker, and most use gravity as <b>the</b> ultimate force <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> in <b>the</b> marker. That is to say, if most hoppers are turned upside down, the marker will not be fed with balls and will cease to fire.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{in the middle of}} the bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E
5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E
6000|$|Twice at golf he lamed {{himself for}} over a week, showing a novice how to [...] "drive"; and at cricket on one {{occasion}} I remember seeing his middle stump go down like a ninepin {{just as he was}} explaining to <b>the</b> bowler how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> in straight. After which he had a long argument with the umpire as to whether he was in or out.|$|R
50|$|However, most {{competitions}} {{other than}} the NBA, WNBA, Euroleague Company (all entire game) and the UAAP (in the final two minutes of a game and overtime in UAAP only) use the alternating possession rule to settle all jump <b>ball</b> situations after <b>the</b> opening tip. This uses a possession arrow on the scorekeeper's table. Whenever such a jump <b>ball</b> situation occurs, <b>the</b> team whose basket that the possession arrow is currently pointing <b>to</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>The</b> arrow then swaps {{to point to the}} other team. At the start of the game, the arrow points to the team that lost the opening tip.|$|R
5000|$|Water polo players {{use this}} style of kick so their hands can be free to shoot, pass, dribble and control <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Water polo players need to perfect the eggbeater kick to have success. Goalkeepers {{must be able to}} do this {{especially}} as they need to have <b>the</b> power <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bandy {{is played}} on ice, using a single round ball. Two teams of 11 players each compete <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{into the other}} team's goal using sticks, thereby scoring a goal.|$|E
25|$|He {{was one of}} few Sri Lanka bowlers in the 1980s {{who could}} get the ball to {{anything}} above medium pace, {{and he was also}} said to have the ability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to swing out.|$|E
25|$|Gottlieb's Humpty Dumpty, {{introduced}} in 1947, {{was the first}} game to add player-controlled flippers to keep {{the ball in play}} longer, adding a skill factor to the game. The low power flippers required three pairs around the playfield <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to the top.|$|E
50|$|He {{is known}} for his role at the 2008 CONCACAF Men's Pre-Olympic Tournament; he was a {{substitute}} in the last match against Haiti, when he, along Luis Angel Landín and César Villaluz, missed easy goals. Santiago missed a shot from nearly 2 meters from goal with no keeper and was unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> several times in crosses from his teammates.|$|R
5000|$|On January 21, 2015, Brad Johnson {{admitted}} to bribing ball boys {{to alter the}} footballs used during the game. According to Johnson: [...] "I paid some guys off <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> right. I went and got all 100 footballs, and they took care of all of them." [...] He also stated that he [...] "did nothing wrong", and that he talked to Rich Gannon beforehand and both agreed that they preferred not to use <b>the</b> slick, brand-new <b>balls</b> that <b>the</b> league provided for the game.|$|R
50|$|<b>To</b> help <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> rolling for <b>the</b> SWH, “she {{opened a}} fund with £100 {{of her own}} money.” By the next month, she had her first £1,000. The goal was £50,000.|$|R
25|$|Oakland managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{back for}} a chance to drive for a go-ahead touchdown, but J. T. Thomas made a clutch {{interception}} and returned the ball 37 yards to the Raiders 24. Harris then scored on a 21-yard rushing touchdown to put the game away.|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the second}} quarter, it seemed Miami would finally break the {{scoreless}} tie when their cornerback Don McNeal blocked a punt from Chuck Ramsey, allowing the Dolphins <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on the New York 20-yard line. But with time running out, Schroy intercepted his second pass {{of the day and}} the game remained scoreless at halftime.|$|E
25|$|In certain game situations, when {{a runner}} is on {{first and the}} batter bunts the ball or hits the ball softly, which causes the third baseman to rush in <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and throw to first base, the catcher must cover third base so that the runner from first base does not advance to third base on the play and this then forces the third baseman to cover home plate.|$|E
50|$|Leaving their long-standing {{friendship}} in the dug-out, Fred and Barney {{lead their}} teams {{right into the}} championship. When Barney stays with Fred, they sleep together that night. The next morning, a tired Fred and Barney take off and try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> park as fast they could only to be pulled over by a short police officer who ends up taking them to Judge Shale.|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent the}} {{opposing}} offense from gaining {{yards on the}} ground, a defense might put more emphasis on their run defense. This generally involves placing more players close {{to the line of}} scrimmage <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> carrier more quickly. This strategy is often used when the opposing offense only needs to gain a few yards to make a first down or score a touchdown.|$|R
5000|$|On January 21, 2015, Johnson later {{admitted}} to bribing ball boys {{to alter the}} footballs used during the Super Bowl. According to Johnson: [...] "I paid some guys off <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> right. I went and got all 100 footballs, and they took care of all of them."

25|$|Footvolley {{was created}} by Octavio de Moraes in the 1970s. It {{is a mix of}} {{football}} and volleyball, where the players must use their feet and head <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> over the net and into the opponent's side, and is played on the beaches. It {{is one of the most}} popular beach sports in Brazil. Footvolley started out with 5 players on each team but later got cut to 2 players on each team and is still so to this day.|$|E
25|$|Skee ball is {{a common}} game found in arcades {{and one of the}} first {{redemption}} games. Skee ball is similar to bowling except it is played on an inclined lane and the player aims <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to fall into a hole rather than knock down pins. The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible by rolling balls up an incline and into the designated point value holes. Skee ball was invented and patented in 1909 by J.D. Estes of Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|A cutter is a fast {{ball that}} is spinning, that is, a {{delivery}} that is rotating around the opposite axis to the seam instead {{of keeping the}} seam straight. While this rotation is nowhere near as much as that achieved by a spin bowler, the small variations it can produce are still {{enough to make a}} batsman uncomfortable due to the speed of the ball. Cutters can be an effective way for a seam bowler <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to move {{if he or she is}} not receiving much assistance from the pitch.|$|E
5000|$|Sticky Sticky Bang Bang (ハリツキバンバン) - A {{player from}} one team is {{suspended}} from a rope wearing a sticky suit {{as one of}} their teammates throws sticky <b>balls,</b> and <b>the</b> other shoots tennis balls from an air gun, both attempting to stick <b>balls</b> to <b>the</b> suit. Two players from the opposing team hold ropes attached to the hanging player and jerk them left and right during <b>the</b> game, attempting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>to</b> miss. <b>The</b> team with <b>the</b> most <b>balls</b> stuck to their partner's sticky suit in two minutes wins. The title is a play on Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.|$|R
2500|$|The {{essence of}} swing bowling is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> cricket <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> deviate {{sideways}} {{as it moves}} through the air towards or away from the batsman. To do this, the bowler makes use of five factors: ...|$|R
50|$|The game {{opened with}} the large crowd {{spilling}} out onto the oval forming a human boundary line, these people got to see a Collingwood side that were more determined <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> first and run their Geelong opponents off their feet. A tight first term in which the Magpies didn't allow the Cats to play their usual dominant game. A few fiery incidents occurred but Umpire McMurray was soon on top of it.|$|R
25|$|With 2:36 {{left and}} with all three timeouts, Hostetler and the Giants began driving again. He hit Mark Bavaro for {{nineteen}} yards on the first play and later hit Stephen Baker for thirteen more on a second down {{to set up a}} short run by Ottis Anderson for two yards and a first down. The Giants called two running plays <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{to the middle of the}} field, and with four seconds left Bahr was called on to try to win the game. His kick went through the uprights as time ran out and the Giants won 15–13.|$|E
25|$|New York {{responded with}} a drive to the Oilers 3-yard line. Facing fourth down and inches, running back Freeman McNeil tried to advance the ball but was tackled for no gain. Late in the game, New York had another chance to score when safety Lonnie Young forced a fumble while sacking Moon and Tony Stargell {{recovered}} for the Jets on the Oilers 26-yard line, but they turned it over on downs again. With just over a minute left, New York managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back for one last drive, but McDowell intercepted a pass from O'Brien on the game's final play.|$|E
25|$|Six and Out - If {{you hit it}} {{over the}} fence you're out and you have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> The 6 runs are usually not awarded to the batsman unless agreed to by both teams. This rule is {{especially}} popular in small backyards (where the rule may be applied to any ball that lands over the fence - not just 6's), and encourages the batsman to exercise control and restraint by aiming for 4's instead of 6's. Six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out, even if no damage is evident.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{traditional}} football, one players from each team manoeuvre <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> past their opponents <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to goal. Each team has 13 players, but only five players {{are on the}} court at one time. The player with <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> can swim with it or pass <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to his team players. Meanwhile, the opponents will try to take <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from <b>the</b> other player or intercept a pass.And at last the team which has the maximum scores will win.|$|R
50|$|While his range factor {{demonstrates}} {{his superior}} speed and ability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> Shindle {{was not as}} talented at handling <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> once he got to them. In 1890, Shindle played shortstop for Philadelphia in the Players League and was charged with 122 errors (119 at shortstop and 3 at third base). Shindle's 122 errors in 1890 are tied (with Herman Long in 1889) for the all-time record for most errors by a major league player at any position.|$|R
50|$|An {{all around}} athlete, Mullin had great range and ability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> He contributed 1244 assists as a pitcher, the 7th highest total of any pitcher {{in major league}} history, behind legends such as Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Walter Johnson. His career record of 2.56 assists per game also ranks 7th in major league history for pitchers. He had a career-high 163 assists in 1904 and twice {{led the league in}} assists by a pitcher.|$|R
