5|$|Later inhabitation of Southcote was {{discovered}} at Anslow's Cottages {{south of the}} Kennet, where excavation suggests that a Bronze Age waterfront was made on {{a branch of the}} river. A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England—now known as English Heritage—detailed the discovery of fragments of <b>twined</b> basketry at Anslow's Cottages, showing that eel or fish traps were used on the river near Southcote. Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to the trap suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century. Later discoveries, made in the 1980s during gravel extraction in the area, also uncovered evidence of a landing stage or jetty on the river channel.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, iron oxides, hematite, limonite, gypsum, and azurite. <b>Twined</b> sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W.

40|$|Although some {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} {{on the extent of}} handedness bias in <b>twining</b> vines, the proximate and ultimate causes of handedness preference in the plant kingdom have long remained unexplained. Studies on the distribution of <b>twining</b> handedness have shown a nearly universal preference for unidirectional, species-specific <b>twining,</b> the majority of which is counter clockwise (CCW). To investigate the origin of the CCW bias, the evolution of <b>twining</b> direction was studied. Additionally, the potential advantages to CCW <b>twining</b> and the effects of environmental cues and regional variation on <b>twining</b> were probed using a vine facultative in <b>twining</b> direction, Solanum dulcamara (Solanaceae, Nightshade Family). To determine the causes of handedness in <b>twining</b> vines, the relationships between chiral cellular components, other plant enantiomorphies and <b>twining</b> were investigated. Mapping of <b>twining</b> handedness onto an angiosperm phylogeny revealed multiple evolutionary origins of <b>twining</b> habit and handedness, potentially indicating multiple determinants of handedness. CCW <b>twining</b> plants were shown to have tighter coils than clockwise (CW) <b>twining</b> plants, and the choice of <b>twining</b> habit, though not direction, was influenced by the location of seed Oligin. Finally, the direction of circumnutation (rotational growth pattern observed in developing seedlings and shoots), spiral phyllotaxy (leaf arrangement), xylem helices, and cortical microfibrils (cytoskeletal elements known to form helices) were not associated with the handedness of the vine...|$|R

2500|$|Indian funk is a loose term {{describing}} {{the style of}} rock and roll which is sometimes blurred into the realms of pop and other genres. Whereas Indian fusion may only incorporate Indian styles into rock, or rock into Indian forms of music, Indian funk can be broadly defined as what rap-metal is to heavy metal - an infusion of elements from rap, reggae, pop and dance genres that some might consider to not be 'true' rock. Groups originating in South Asian communities in Western countries like Britain are noted for this style, with bands such as Swami and Asian Dub Foundation using elements of UK garage, UK bhangra and hip-hop, such as synthesizers, rap vocals and turntables. Also based in the UK, Botown take an approach inspired by Funkadelic with a large lineup of live musicians to blend Bollywood music with soul and funk.

At the point of each type of <b>twine’s</b> ultimate tensile strength, it is apparent that polypropylene is a stronger material. With approximately an ultimate tensile strength of 270 MPa, it has more than 100% more tensile strength than that of sisal <b>twine</b> which has an ultimate tensile strength of 100 MPa. The two <b>twines</b> broke differently, however, as it {{can be seen in the}} two videos. Polypropylene <b>twine</b> had a straight break, where all of its fibers broke at once; this resulted in the straight line dropping to zero on the graph. The sisal <b>twine</b> broke in a different fashion. As the force load increased on the <b>twine</b> sample, individual fibers that were carrying the load broke and new ones became engaged. Thus was created the popping noises in the video; these properties directly correlate to the strength properties. Because all the fibers are engaged at once in polypropylene, it gives the <b>twine</b> high strength; the downside is that all the fibers break at once. Because only certain fibers in sisal <b>twine</b> carry the force of the load at one time, it doesn’t have as high of a strength as polypropylene <b>twine.</b> It does, however, allow the <b>twine</b> to stay intact much longer as each new fiber becomes engaged.|$|R
