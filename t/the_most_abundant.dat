5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> iron isotope 56Fe is of {{particular}} interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis. Since 56Ni (14 alpha particles) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires a great deal more energy. This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe. As such, iron is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> element in the core of red giants, and is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>abundant</b> metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth.
