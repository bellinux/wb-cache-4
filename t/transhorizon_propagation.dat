40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{details about}} the <b>transhorizon</b> <b>propagation</b> of 2 GHz radio waves over the sea during sub-refractive atmospheric conditions. Sub-refraction {{is perhaps the most}} rare of the four refractive conditions (ducting, super-refraction, normal refraction and sub-refraction), but nevertheless cannot be ignored when assessing the performance of a radio link. Specifically, for a 50 km, low-altitude, over-sea radio path in the British Channel Islands, an attempt has been made to model the propagation conditions during periods of sub-refraction, and the results compared with experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|Long-range, over-the-horizon (<b>transhorizon)</b> {{radio wave}} <b>propagation</b> is {{considered}} for {{the case of the}} Moon. In the event that relay satellites are not available or otherwise unwarranted for use, transhorizon communication provides for a contingency or backup option for non line-of-sight lunar surface exploration scenarios. Two potential low-frequency propagation mechanisms characteristic of the lunar landscape are the lunar regolith and the photoelectron induced plasma exosphere enveloping the Moon. Although it was hoped that the regolith would provide for a spherical waveguide which could support a trapped surface wave phenomena, it is found that, in most cases, the regolith is deleterious to long range radio wave propagation. However, the presence of the plasma of the lunar exosphere supports wave propagation and, in fact, surpasses the attenuation of the regolith. Given the models of the regolith and exosphere adopted here, it is recommended that a frequency of 1 MHz be considered for low rate data transmission along the lunar surface. It is also recommended that further research be done to capture the descriptive physics of the regolith and the exospheric plasma so that a more complete model can be obtained. This comprehensive theoretical study is based entirely on first principles and the mathematical techniques needed are developed as required; it is self-contained and should not require the use of outside resources for its understanding...|$|R
