5000|$|A further {{provision}} {{is the creation}} of the Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> <b>for</b> Sustainable Development.

Unlike the Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> established by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and extended by the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015, the Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> <b>for</b> Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> of the 2003 Act which allows crofting communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{responses}} to the consultation the Scottish Government presented the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to the Scottish Parliament on 22 June 2015. The Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 16 March 2016, and received Royal Assent on 22 March 2016 becoming Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016. The most radical and controversial provision of the act was the creation of the Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> <b>for</b> Sustainable Development. This permitted Scottish Ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Like the Crofting Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> and the Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> abandoned or derelict land, the Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> <b>for</b> Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a third party to purchase land on the same basis.|$|R
