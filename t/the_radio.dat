5|$|Over {{the next}} month, Frail {{observed}} that the luminosity of <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> source fluctuated significantly {{from day to day}} but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> scintillations became less {{noticeable}} until they ceased altogether. This implies that <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> source significantly expanded {{in the time that}} had passed since the burst was detected. Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> source had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> engineers' concern with external static.

To <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference.
