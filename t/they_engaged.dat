5|$|On the Confederate {{right flank}} {{a total of}} six {{batteries}} engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by-one instead of in unison, and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire. Moreover, <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> the Union artillery later than the guns of the left flank, so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved.|$|E

5|$|The land {{offensive}} {{began on}} July 25, when 1,300 infantry soldiers led by Major General Nelson A. Miles disembarked {{off the coast}} of Guánica. After controlling the first skirmish, the Americans advanced to Coamo, where <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> Puerto Rican and Spanish troops in battle. The battle concluded when the allied soldiers retreated after the battle left two dead on their side, and four on the American side. The United States was able to seize control of Fajardo on August 1, but was forced to withdraw on August 5 after a group of 200 Puerto Rican–Spanish soldiers led by Pedro del Pino gained control of the city, while most civilian inhabitants fled to a nearby lighthouse. The Americans encountered larger opposition as they advanced towards the main island's interior. <b>They</b> <b>engaged</b> in two crossfires in Guamani River and Coamo, both of which were inconclusive as the allied soldiers retreated. A battle in San Germán concluded in a similar fashion with the Spanish retreating to Lares.|$|E
5|$|In March 1951, {{along with}} {{half a dozen other}} newly badged Glosters, Large was sent to B Company's {{position}} in the low hills above the Imjin River. The Glosters, as part of the 29th Brigade, were defending routes through the valley that could potentially be used by the Chinese in a southbound offensive towards Seoul. On 22 April 1951, <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> with Chinese troops in the Battle of Imjin.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1528, Montejo left Conil {{for the city of}} Chauaca, which was {{abandoned}} by its Maya inhabitants under cover of darkness. The following morning the inhabitants attacked the Spanish party but were defeated. The Spanish then continued to Ake, where <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> in a major battle, which left more than 1,200 Maya dead. After this Spanish victory, the neighbouring Maya leaders all surrendered. Montejo's party then continued to Sisia and Loche before heading back to Xelha. Montejo arrived at Xelha with only 60 of his party, and found that only 12 of his 40-strong garrison survived, while the entire garrison at Pole had been slaughtered.|$|E

5|$|Kasuga and Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, but only played a minor role {{as they were in}} the rear of the Japanese battleline. During the battle, the ship's {{executive}} officer was Kantarō Suzuki, later Prime Minister of Japan. Kasuga was not significantly damaged, although she was hit three times with 11 crewmen wounded. Kasuga fired 33 ten-inch shells along with an unknown number of eight-inch shells during the battle. After the battle the sisters returned to Pigeon Bay where <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> the Russian fortifications.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after this, however, Chinese infiltrators began {{appearing}} {{regularly in the}} undermanned 2nd Company's area, and by 15 May, Queen discovered the Chinese were moving in force to Hill 581, several miles from their position, from which the Chinese could fortify and attack Hill 258. Queen led the platoon on a sneak attack of the Chinese force on 17 May, covered by 7th Division artillery fire. At 15:00, <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> the surprised Chinese, conducting a double envelopment supported by continued artillery fire. By 17:00, the Rangers secured Hill 581 from the Chinese, who suffered 50 killed and 90 wounded in the attack.|$|E

5|$|The Rzucewo culture (named {{after the}} village near Puck where the discoveries took place) {{developed}} from northern {{populations of the}} Corded Ware culture as an offshoot specialized in exploitation of the sea resources and lasted in parallel with their mother culture for a comparable period of time. Their settlements consisting of characteristic sea erosion reinforced houses were located along the Bay of Gdańsk and east of there. <b>They</b> <b>engaged</b> in fishery and hunting, especially of seals, then numerous along the Baltic coast. The Rzucewo culture people produced in special shops the widely used and traded amber decorative items.|$|E
5|$|The {{flotilla}} {{was ordered}} back to Felixstowe in Autumn 1942. Their first {{contact with the}} enemy was on the night 14/15 September when <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> a small convoy off the Hook of Holland. They followed a convoy that was escorted by four Flak trawlers almost into harbour before inflicting considerable damage to it. For this, Hichens was awarded a second Bar to his DSC. Other members of the flotilla were awarded a DSC, two DSMs and a MID.|$|E
5|$|The {{third major}} action Hichens was {{involved}} in during this period was the action during the night of 21/22 April 1942, off Ostend, when <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> six E boats, forcing the superior force to scatter and run for port after severely damaging one boat and causing slight damage to the others. After this action the E boats were moved to a safer harbour to operate from. Hichens was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) following this engagement.|$|E

5|$|When the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia in April 1941, Lukačević {{became a}} leader of Chetniks in the Sandžak region and joined the {{movement}} of Draža Mihailović. While the Chetniks were an anti-Axis movement in their long-range goals and did engage in marginal resistance activities for limited periods, they also pursued almost throughout the war a tactical or selective collaboration with the occupation authorities against the Yugoslav Partisans. <b>They</b> <b>engaged</b> {{in cooperation with the}} Axis powers to one degree or another by establishing modi vivendi or operating as auxiliary forces under Axis control. Lukačević himself collaborated extensively with the Italians and the Germans in actions against the Yugoslav Partisans until mid-1944.|$|E
5|$|After their {{commissioning}} {{into the}} German fleet, all four ships {{served in the}} II Division of IBattle Squadron. Two of the ships, Nassau and Posen, {{took part in the}} inconclusive Battle of the Gulf of Riga in 1915, during which <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> the Russian pre-dreadnought Slava. The four Nassau-class ships took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916; they suffered only a handful of secondary battery hits and limited casualties. In early 1918 Rheinland and Westfalen were sent to Finland to support the White Finns in their civil war, but Rheinland ran aground off the Åland Islands in April and was severely damaged. At the end of World War I, the four ships were seized as war prizes by the victorious Allied powers and sold for scrapping.|$|E

5|$|As the SS Panzer Corps {{began to}} emerge from the city, <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> Soviet units {{positioned}} directly southwest of the city, including the 17th NKVD Brigade, 19th Rifle Division and 25th Guards Rifle Division. Attempts by the Red Army to re-establish communication with the remnants of the 3rd Tank Army continued, although in vain. On 14–15 March these forces were given permission to withdraw to the northern Donets River. The Soviet 40th and 69th armies had been engaged since 13 March with the Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division, and had been split by the German drive. After the fall of Kharkov the Soviet defense of the Donets had collapsed, allowing Manstein's forces to drive to Belgorod on 17 March, and take it by the next day. However, weather and exhaustion forced Manstein's counterstroke to end soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|At about 2:00 pm the French {{attacked}} Castel Ceriolo {{and delayed}} {{the advance of}} Schellenberg’s column by attacking its tail. Aided by Frimont, Ott defeated Monnier and forced two-thirds of his command to retreat to the northeast. About the same time, Marengo had fallen to the Austrians, forcing Napoleon's men into a general retreat. As Austrian troops crossed the Fontanone, their guns bombarded the French infantry in the vines. In a bid to further delay Schellenberg’s advance, Bonaparte committed his main Guard battalion and its artillery, which moved to flank the column. After driving off Austrian dragoons {{with the aid of}} GdB Champeaux’s remaining cavalry (under Joachim Murat), <b>they</b> <b>engaged</b> the head of the column. After a 15-minute firefight around 4:00 pm the Guard were surprised and destroyed by Frimont’s cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Local rebel commanders were {{generally}} suspicious of outside Arab military leaders, such as al-Qawuqji, {{and of the}} AHC, particularly after {{many members of the}} latter joined the Damascus-based Central Committee of Jihad following the AHC's dissolution by the authorities in October 1937. The Central Committee had been founded in late 1937 by Izzat Darwaza, and officially served as the revolt's political leadership, fundraising body and arms supplier. On the ground in Palestine, competition for the role of the rebels' general command became increasingly tense between al-Hajj Muhammad and Abd al-Raziq. <b>They</b> <b>engaged</b> in a serious rivalry, which coincided with acrimonious relations between their families over influence in the Tulkarm area's social and political spheres.|$|E
