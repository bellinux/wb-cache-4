[...] An unnamed observer told Gaines: [...] "... knowing that everyone in that group was married, and had children and a house. I think he [...] felt like more of a benefactor than an artist." [...] Music writer Richard Goldstein relates his impression of Wilson based on a meeting in 1967: [...] "He came across as ... deeply insecure about his creative instincts, terrified that the songs he was working on were too arty to sell." [...] Ultimately, Wilson put an end to the Smile project once he felt he did not have a [...] "commercial feeling about some of these songs ... Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them ... but a lot of people just don't like it." [...] A replacement LP, Smiley Smile, [...] was released on September 18, 1967 to mixed reviews and the group's worst sales yet, becoming the first in a seven-year string of under-performing Beach Boys albums. According to writer Scott Schinder, the album was released to [...] "general incomprehension. While Smile may have divided the Beach Boys' fans had it been released, Smiley Smile merely baffled them." ...|$|E

This scene features Jade Thirlwall scribbling in a notebook as the other group members play around, laugh and take pictures of each other sleeping using the Samsung Galaxy. The group then {{look at the pictures}} they took together. In a different scene, Perrie Edwards is seen cuddling a puppy. Little Mix are also pictured singing [...] "Change Your Life" [...] to each other in a studio and preparing to go on stage at their Rhyl Pavilion tour date. Other scenes features the group in a dance rehearsal, using funny facial expressions and bonding with their mothers backstage. During the dance rehearsal, the group is seen practising dance moves to their DNA Tour setlist with their tour choreographer and backing dancers. In other scenes, the group is seen playing with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>Little</b> Mix dolls and Thirlwall, sporting blue hair, is wheeled away in a cardboard box. Before going onstage, Leigh-Anne Pinnock is seen smiling as a make-up artist applies her final touches while Thirlwall is pictured applying her own make-up. The group then centre themselves as they show each other support by hugging one another before heading to the stage. After the show, the foursome is seen showing their solidarity by embracing one another again.|$|E
500|$|One Hot Minute {{was not as}} universally well {{received}} as Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and was ultimately {{considered to be a}} poor follow-up. It did however receive mixed to positive reviews from critics. Daina Darzin of Rolling Stone said [...] "One Hot Minute dives into the emotionally deep end of drug addiction and loss", and that the album [...] "is a ferociously eclectic and imaginative disc that also presents the band members as more thoughtful, spiritual—even grown-up. After a 10 plus-year career, they're realizing their potential at last." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "One Hot Minute wails and flails like a mosh-pit workout tape, but it also has moments of outright subtlety and maturity." [...] He goes on to praise Kiedis for [...] "keeping his boorish tendencies under control." [...] Browne, however, criticizes the band for [...] "attempts at cosmic philosophy which often trip up on hippie-dippie sentiments", and some songs [...] "fall back on tired frat-funk flop sweat." [...] "The Peppers work <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> patch with considerable expertise," [...] wrote Peter Kane in Q. [...] "The incoming Navarro rarely fails to deliver the goods and upfront the taut ball of energy going by the name of Anthony Kiedis still makes for a suitably rubbery-lipped frontman, if not exactly a lovable one." [...] Q also included One Hot Minute in its 'best of the year' roundup: [...] "A bulging, blistering blend of a skewed ballads and physically intimidating workouts that charge around like a bull on a promise." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said that Smile leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them... {{but a lot of people}} just don't like it." [...] Carl Wilson reflected on the period: [...] "To get that album [...] out, someone would have needed willingness and perseverance to corral all of us. Everybody was so loaded on pot and hash all of the time that it's no wonder the project didn't get done." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{greatest}} constraint {{to economic}} development was a chronic shortage of labour. [...] Pushed into {{the interior of the}} island and decimated by alcohol addiction, venereal disease, smallpox, and sleeping sickness, the indigenous Bubi population of Bioko refused to work on plantations. Working <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> cocoa farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy. Moreover, beginning in the late nineteenth century, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters by the Spanish Claretian missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous Jesuit Reductions of Paraguay. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections in 1898 and 1910 protesting the conscription of forced labour for the plantations. Afterwards the Bubi were disarmed in 1917, and left dependent on the missionaries.|$|E

2500|$|Men {{may live}} {{together}} in society with some tolerable degree of security, {{though there is no}} civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>little</b> sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.
