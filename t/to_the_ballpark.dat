5|$|José Fernández {{grew up in}} Santa Clara, Cuba. There, {{he lived}} on the same street as, and was friends with, future Major League Baseball (MLB) shortstop Aledmys Díaz. They played for the same youth {{baseball}} team, and Díaz's father and uncle encouraged Fernández's mother to bring him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b> Fernández commented that had Díaz's uncle not been an influence early in his life, {{he would not have}} pursued a professional baseball career.|$|E
5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark,</b> in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line in right field. A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.|$|E
5|$|AT Park is {{distinguished}} {{by having the}} San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was {{largely due to the}} three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.|$|E

25|$|On September 6, 2008, {{during a}} {{series against the}} Pittsburgh Pirates, a fifth statue {{depicting}} former Giants great Orlando Cepeda was dedicated {{at the corner of}} 2nd and King Streets next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b> A sixth statue, dedicated on August 13, 2016, honors former Giants pitcher Gaylord Perry and is also located at the corner of 2nd and King Streets next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b> All five statues of the Giants Hall of Fame players were created by sculptor William Behrends of North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Cobb {{moved to}} Detroit's architecturally {{significant}} and now historically protected Woodbridge neighborhood, {{from which he}} would walk with his dogs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> prior to games. The Victorian duplex in which Cobb lived still stands.|$|E
25|$|Lights {{were added}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> in 1931, and on May 18, the Vols played their first night {{game against the}} Mobile Marines. Nashville lost the contest, 8–1. In 1938, the seating {{capacity}} was expanded to 8,500.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2008 season, the left field berm area was {{replaced}} with permanent bleacher seats. Additional metal bleachers were added on the concourse running from behind the former left field berm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bullpens in center field. This added 2,172 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark's</b> fixed seating capacity, raising it from its originally 4,365 fixed seats.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ballpark</b> {{is named}} for R. Dale Melching, a Stetson alumnus and donor. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark's</b> opening in 1999, the {{previous}} home of the Stetson Hatters baseball team, Conrad Park, was located on the same site, with home plate then located where center field now exists in Melching Field. Conrad Park was the home of spring training games during the 1940s and 1950s {{as well as the}} home of the DeLand Red Hats of the Florida State League.|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, the Senators added {{a unique}} logo to their brand, {{incorporating}} the prevalent and much reviled mayfly into the [...] "H." [...] Because of FNB Field's location on City Island in the Susquehanna River, thousands of mayflies are attracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark's</b> bright lights and die. The dead mayflies fall onto the fans below, obscuring their view.|$|R
25|$|In 1985, for the Clearwater Phillies' first-season in the Florida State League, a {{new home}} clubhouse and {{additional}} seating were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b> The Clearwater Phillies played their first game against the Tampa Tarpons at home on April 12, 1985.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{new owner}} Mike Ilitch began many {{cosmetic}} improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark,</b> primarily {{with the addition}} of the Tiger Den and Tiger Plaza. The Tiger Den was an area in the lower deck between first and third base that had padded seats and section waiters. The Tiger Plaza was constructed in the old players parking lot and consisted of many concessionaires and a gift shop.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals hold spring {{training}} in Florida, where they play their annual slate of Grapefruit League games. From 2005 through 2016, they held {{spring training}} at Space Coast Stadium in Viera, Florida, {{a facility that}} they inherited from the Expos. In 2017, the Nationals moved their spring training operations <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ballpark</b> of the Palm Beaches, a new facility they share with the Houston Astros in West Palm Beach, Florida; they played their first Grapefruit League game there on February 28, 2017.|$|E
2500|$|Following his retirement, García enjoyed {{spending}} {{time with his family}} and eventually going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballparks,</b> where he shared countless anecdotes with broadcasters, journalists, and baseball people.

50|$|Comiskey {{continued}} <b>to</b> own <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> {{for another}} {{decade or so}} (leasing it out to a replacement American Association club), until finally selling it to local interests in 1909.|$|R
25|$|Scrap metal salvage rallies {{were held}} at least once at the stadium during World War II, where people would bring scrap metal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> to be melted and made into steel for new weapons. Griffith was also the home to public school events, church revivals, public meetings, and annual ROTC drill competitions. Billy Graham held a crusade at Griffith in 1960, preaching from a {{platform}} erected near second base. Two choir stands, each accommodating 500 singers, were set up along the foul lines.|$|E
25|$|The stadium was {{dedicated}} on March 10, 1955. Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick, National League president Warren Giles, American League president Will Harridge, Clearwater mayor Herbert M. Brown, and other city dignitaries were in attendance. The Phillies played their first {{game at the}} stadium {{on the day of}} the dedication. Robin Roberts started for the Phillies against the Detroit Tigers. The Phillies won 4-2 on a two-run double by Willie Jones before 4,209 attendees. Roberts returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> and threw out the ceremonial first-pitch for the Phillies' final spring training game there in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, after exchanging {{divergent}} {{values for}} several weeks, both parties agreed to mediation, {{and with the}} November court date fast approaching, the final agreement was reached on October 12, 2007, with a negotiated price of $29 million. To make the deal possible, the Twins had agreed {{to make up the}} $15 million difference between that price and what Hennepin County had originally budgeted. In exchange, they received the right to develop several acres near the ballpark. Land Partners II received property and air rights over Dock Street, which was to be created for access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> from the north.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to baseball, Fifth Third Ballpark {{can also be}} used for other events including motorsports and concerts, where it seats up <b>to</b> 15,000. <b>The</b> <b>ballpark</b> hosts a large display of Christmas lights.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, a {{deal was}} reached <b>to</b> tear down <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> {{and move it}} to Redding, California.|$|R

25|$|Turn of {{the century}} {{baseball}} attendances were modest by later standards. The average for the 1,110 games in the 1901 season was 3,247. However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball. Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built {{for many of the}} larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Shibe Park in Philadelphia, Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, Boston's Fenway Park along with Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago. Likewise from the Eastern League to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising Negro Leagues professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre World War I peak of 5,836 in 1909, before falling back during the war. Where there weren't professional teams, there were semi-pro teams, traveling teams barnstorming, company clubs and amateur men's leagues. In the days before television, if you wanted to see a game, you had to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark.</b>|$|E
25|$|Turner Field also {{featured}} the Georgia's Own Credit Union Club and Superior Plumbing Club, consisting of 152 collective premium seats located directly adjacent {{to each side}} of the press box. The original club, sponsored by Georgia's Own Credit Union and featuring 80 seats, was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> for the 2012 season and also contained multiple upscale dining options and in-seat food and beverage services. Instead of stadium seats, patrons faced the field in chairs around semicircular tables. A slightly-smaller second section, sponsored by Superior Plumbing and featuring 72 seats, was added for the 2013 season {{on the opposite side of}} the press area. The Club Level was another indoor premium concourse level located on the second deck of the ballpark. This level featured multiple VIP suites that could be purchased for individual games and used for party-style affairs, among other events. For Turner Field's final few seasons, the Club Level had no title sponsor; in previous years, it was known as the Lexus Level and Golden Moon Casino Level.|$|E
25|$|Target Field {{was built}} in what was a {{parking lot at the}} north end of {{downtown}} Minneapolis within walking distance of the Target Center. On September 15, 2008 the Twins announced that they had sold naming rights to the Target Corporation and that the stadium would be known as Target Field. The Metro Light Rail was extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> area with a connection to the Northstar Commuter Rail, which terminates at the ballpark. Preliminary plans called for a seating capacity of 40,000 seats and 72 suites. There are approximately 34 rest rooms compared to only 16 in Metrodome. The concourses are open to the playing field with a view of the downtown Minneapolis skyline from every seat in the park. There is no retractable roof on the stadium which would have added about $200 million on to the cost which was $522 million. This received some objection due to the potentially harsh game conditions in early April (similar to other northern pro baseball teams such as the White Sox, Cubs, Tigers, Indians, Red Sox, etc.) and the potential risk of resulting lost revenue. The official groundbreaking for the stadium, originally scheduled for 2 August 2007, was postponed to August 30 due to the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge.|$|E
50|$|Adjusted ERA+, often simply {{abbreviated}} to ERA+ or ERA plus, is a pitching statistic in baseball. It adjusts a pitcher's {{earned run average}} (ERA) according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pitcher's <b>ballpark</b> (in case <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> favors batters or pitchers) and the ERA of the pitcher's league.|$|R
2500|$|As Ruth's {{popularity}} grew, Cobb {{became increasingly}} hostile toward him. He saw the Babe {{not only as}} a threat to his style of play, but also to his style of life. While Cobb preached ascetic self-denial, Ruth gorged on hot dogs, beer and women. [...] Perhaps what angered him the most about Ruth was that despite Babe's total disregard for his physical condition and traditional baseball, he was still an overwhelming success and brought fans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballparks</b> in record numbers to see him challenge his own slugging records.|$|R
50|$|During the offseason, the Aces {{announced}} that they were moving their home games from the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Melbourne <b>Ballpark</b> in Altona, Victoria. <b>The</b> <b>Ballpark,</b> which also hosted Melbourne-based teams in the previous incarnation of the league, will undergo significant improvements before {{the opening of the}} season, including the adjustment of fences, and the installation of an open-air beer garden.|$|R
500|$|Adams once {{paid for}} his tickets (one for himself, and one for his drum), but the Indians now pay for two of his season tickets {{in honor of the}} {{contributions}} he has made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> atmosphere. Adams buys an additional two season tickets. In 2006, the Indians gave out bobblehead dolls depicting Adams, making him the only fan for whom the team has dedicated a bobble head day.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} before the event Dahl invited his {{listeners}} to bring records {{they wanted to see}} destroyed to Comiskey Park. The disc jockey feared that the promotion would fail to draw people <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark,</b> and that he would be humiliated. [...] The previous night's attendance had been 15,520, and Comiskey Park had a capacity of 44,492. The White Sox were not having a good year, and were going into the July12 doubleheader. The White Sox and WLUP hoped for a crowd of 20,000, and Mike Veeck hired enough security for 35,000.|$|E
500|$|For 2016, more safety netting {{was added}} behind home plate which {{extended}} the protective netting {{to cover the}} seating area behind both dugouts. Other additions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> included six [...] ceiling fans on the concourse, new drinking fountains and water bottle filling stations, {{the opening of a}} center field entrance adjacent to the new parking garage beyond right-center field, and improvements to the children's fun zone on the first base side. The ballpark's attendance record was set the next year, when on July 3, 2017, 11,764people watched the Sounds play against the Oklahoma City Dodgers {{on the night of the}} team's Independence Day celebration.|$|E
50|$|In {{both the}} National League and American League, more home team dugouts {{are on the}} first-base side (9 to 6 each). Even the two oldest parks still in use differ on this point: the Cubs sit on the third-base side at Wrigley while the Red Sox inhabit the first-base dugout at Fenway. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ballpark's</b> orientation, at Wrigley the third-base dugout faces away from the sun from noon onward, whereas the first base dugout faces {{sunlight}} in the late innings. At Fenway, the third-base dugout faces the sun for part of a day game, while the first-base dugout remains shaded.|$|R
50|$|Burnett Field, in Dallas, Texas, {{was home}} to several minor league {{baseball}} clubs from 1924 <b>to</b> 1964. <b>The</b> <b>ballpark</b> sat 10,500 fans. It was located at 1500 East Jefferson Boulevard (west, first base), Brazos Street (north, third base); Colorado Boulevard (south, right field); and the Trinity River (east, left field).|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Engel Stadium {{was used}} as the movie set for the motion picture 42, the life story of Jackie Robinson. Much of the entire film's {{baseball}} action was shot at Engel Stadium, which also doubled for Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field. On July 18, 2012 crews began demolition <b>to</b> restore <b>the</b> <b>ballpark</b> back <b>to</b> its historic accuracy after construction was done for the movie that altered <b>the</b> <b>ballpark,</b> including moving <b>the</b> location of the ball fields.|$|R
