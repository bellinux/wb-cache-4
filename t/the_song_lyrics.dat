5|$|The {{music on}} the record was proclaimed as {{a return to the}} band's roots, with an {{emphasis}} on up-tempo songs with an aggressive sound. <b>The</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> are mostly told {{from the point of view}} of characters and deal with the socio-political issues in the United States at the period, such as the War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|A third {{milestone}} in Wodehouse's life came {{towards the end}} of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run {{by the standards of the}} day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917–18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.|$|E
5|$|Imaginos was envisioned {{as a rock}} opera to be {{published}} as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history, {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce and the content often difficult to decipher for the casual reader. However, thanks to various comments in interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard, and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release, it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent.|$|E

25|$|George Harrison {{began working}} with New Zealand-born artist Keith West in 1985, {{overseeing}} West's illustrations to accompany <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> included in Songs by George Harrison, published in February 1988. Limited to a single print run of 2500 copies, and available at considerable expense directly from Genesis Publications in England, the book soon sold out. Although Harrison had discussed a second volume during his late-1987 interview with Musician magazine, its publication {{did not take place}} until midway through 1992. In the intervening years, Harrison followed up his 1987 comeback album, Cloud Nine, with two similarly successful albums with the Traveling Wilburys, released in 1988 and 1990, before returning to the collaboration with West.|$|E

25|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> on Howling Bells {{were written}} by Juanita Stein when she took time off from the band's {{previous}} incarnation, the Sydney-based pop rock group Waikiki. All members of Howling Bells were also in Waikiki. After growing discontent with their pop rock sound, the band members opted to assume an indie rock identity and changed their name to Howling Bells. The group began to perform material from Howling Bells while still called Waikiki. The majority of the lyrical subject matter centres on Juanita's own interpersonal relationships. She wrote some songs about the loss felt through ending relationships and others about forming new romance. Afterward, drummer Glenn Moule, guitarist Joel Stein, and bass guitarist Brendan Picchio arranged the music around her words.|$|E
25|$|The group {{then started}} an {{international}} The Occupied Europe Tour '83, {{with the group}} The Last Few Days, which included sixteen dates in eight Eastern and Western European countries. The performances provoked {{a lot of interest}} in the European media, especially with the totalitarian musical and visual style. The socialist realism background, effective live appearances and a dissident status in their home country provided the group with a swift increase of interest of the Western countries. Their provocative usage of symbols from Nazi Germany firstly provoked the Slovene WW2 Veteran Organization in Yugoslavia. By combining the imagery of socialist realism, Nazism and Italian futurism, the group created a unique aesthetic style which could not pass unnoticed by the public. <b>The</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> were initially written in German language, but having included cover versions of English language songs, the group focused more on the latter language.|$|E
25|$|The {{symbiotic}} relationship has also stretched to include car manufacturers, clothing designers and sneaker companies, {{and many other}} companies have used the hip hop community to make their name or to give them credibility. One such beneficiary was Jacob the Jeweler, a diamond merchant from New York. Jacob Arabo's clientele included Sean Combs, Lil' Kim and Nas. He created jewelry pieces from precious metals that were heavily loaded with diamond and gemstones. As his name was mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> of his hip hop customers, his profile quickly rose. Arabo expanded his brand to include gem-encrusted watches that retail {{for hundreds of thousands}} of dollars, gaining so much attention that Cartier filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit against him for putting diamonds on the faces of their watches and reselling them without permission. Arabo's profile increased steadily until his June 2006 arrest by the FBI on money laundering charges.|$|E

500|$|Megadeth is an American {{heavy metal}} band from Los Angeles, California. [...] Guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson formed the band in 1983 shortly after Mustaine's {{dismissal}} from Metallica.

500|$|Before {{the premiere}} of the fourth season, the {{producers}} sent two episodes to critics: [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] and [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge". A New Orleans critic viewed [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] and published <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> in his newspaper before the episode aired. Many readers took the lyrics out of context, and New Orleans' then-Fox affiliate, WNOL-TV (then-owned by musician Quincy Jones; the Fox affiliation for the area later moved to WVUE), received about one hundred complaints {{on the day the}} episode aired. Several local radio stations also held on-air protests in response to the song.|$|E
500|$|... "The Answer's at the End" [...] {{is a song}} by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released in}} 1975 on his final album for Apple Records, Extra Texture (Read All About It). Part of <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> came from a wall inscription at Harrison's nineteenth-century home, Friar Park, {{a legacy of the}} property's original owner, Sir Frank Crisp. This aphorism, beginning [...] "Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass", had resonated with Harrison since he bought Friar Park in 1970, and it was a quote he often used when discussing his difficult relationship with his former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney.|$|E

500|$|Champion has {{explained}} that Nelson's production style was liberating {{and allowed the}} band to feel at ease during the recording of Parachutes (many songs from the album often featured slow tempos).

500|$|In Utero is {{the third}} and final studio album by American rock band Nirvana, {{released}} on September 21, 1993, by DGC Records. [...] Nirvana intended the record to diverge significantly from the polished production of its previous album, Nevermind (1991). [...] To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired engineer Steve Albini to record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. [...] The music was recorded quickly with few studio embellishments, and <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>lyrics</b> and album packaging incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame.|$|E
500|$|The album's title {{comes from}} a lyric on the album's final song, [...] "Home".
