5|$|The {{black mamba}} is diurnal and chiefly an ambush predator, {{though it has}} been {{recorded}} as hunting partly by pursuit, such as catching pigeons at a watering hole before they can fly high enough to escape. It usually goes hunting from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return, if the hunting is good {{and it is not}} disturbed. It hunts mainly by sight and in doing so it commonly will raise much of its length well off the ground. The black mamba does not typically hold onto prey after biting, instead releasing its quarry and waiting for it to succumb to paralysis and die. This however depends on the type of prey; for example, it typically will hold onto a bird <b>till</b> <b>it</b> stops struggling to escape. If prey tries to escape or defend itself, the black mamba often may follow up its initial bite with a rapid series of strikes to incapacitate and quickly kill its prey. The snake has been known to prey on hyrax and rock hyrax, bushbabies, and bats. The black mamba has a potent digestive system and has been observed to digest prey fully within eight to ten hours.|$|E
5|$|To works, however, {{of which}} the {{excellence}} is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent <b>till</b> <b>it</b> has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time. The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect; but the poems of Homer we yet know not to transcend the common limits of human intelligence, but by remarking, that nation after nation, and century after century, {{has been able to}} do little more than transpose his incidents, new name his characters, and paraphrase his sentiments.|$|E

25|$|According to Jains, the {{universe}} has a firm and an unalterable shape which is measured in the Jain texts {{by means of a}} unit called Rajju which is supposed to be very large. The Digambara sect of Jainism postulates that {{the universe}} is fourteen Rajju high and extends seven Rajjus from north to south. Its breadth is seven Rajjus at the bottom and decreases gradually till the middle where it is one Rajju. The width then increases gradually <b>till</b> <b>it</b> is five Rajju and again decreases <b>till</b> <b>it</b> is one Rajju. The apex of the universe is one Rajju long, one Rajju wide and eight Rajju high. The total space of the world is thus 343 cubic Rajju. The svetambara view differs slightly and postulates that there is constant increase and decrease in the breadth and the space is 239 cubic Rajju.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the unique}} {{structures}} of Igbo culture was the Nsude Pyramids, at the Nigerian town of Nsude, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay/mud. The first base section was 60ft. in circumference and 3ft. in height. The next stack was 45ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, <b>till</b> <b>it</b> reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto, who was believed to reside at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.|$|E

The initial site that was acquired to relocate the school was situated at Kokomlemle; however, this site had to be abandoned as a result of a prolonged litigation concerning the ownership of the land. A second site, which was located at Korle Gonno, was also given up because of its remote location.|$|E

The home was shut down in 2010 soon after the loss of Fr Abela. At some point it served as a temporary shelter for former prisoners and drug abusers. It was occasionally used for meetings by people with blindness disability. The house-church was open to the public.

25|$|Cotton mills get {{the cotton}} shipped {{to them in}} large, 500 pound bales. When the cotton {{comes out of a}} bale, it is all packed {{together}} and still contains vegetable matter. The bale is broken open using a machine with large spikes. It is called an Opener. In order to fluff up the cotton and remove the vegetable matter, the cotton is sent through a picker, or similar machines. The cotton is fed into a machine known as a picker, and gets beaten with a beater bar in order to loosen it up. It is fed through various rollers, which serve to remove the vegetable matter. The cotton, aided by fans, then collects on a screen and gets fed through more rollers <b>till</b> <b>it</b> emerges as a continuous soft fleecy sheet, known as a lap.|$|E
25|$|A cell-first {{cross-section}} uses some hyperplane {{parallel to}} one of the octahedral cells of a 24-cell. Consider, for instance, some hyperplane orthogonal to the vector (1,1,0,0). The cross-section of {3,4,3,3} by this hyperplane is a rectified cubic honeycomb. Each cuboctahedron in this honeycomb is a maximal cross-section of a 24-cell whose center lies in the plane. Meanwhile, each octahedron is a boundary cell of a (4-dimensional) 24-cell whose center lies off the plane. Shifting this hyperplane <b>till</b> <b>it</b> lies halfway between the center of a 24-cell and the boundary, one obtains a bitruncated cubic honeycomb. The cuboctahedra have shrunk, and the octahedra have grown until they are both truncated octahedra. Shifting again, so the hyperplane intersects the boundary of the central 24-cell gives a rectified cubic honeycomb again, the cuboctahedra and octahedra having swapped positions. As the hyperplane sweeps through 4-space, the cross-section morphs between these two honeycombs periodically.|$|E

25|$|An athlete {{may choose}} to leave their sport due to many reasons, either due to an injury or due to them {{reaching}} an old age. If an athlete becomes injured, this must be looked deeper into, as an injury can vary between very subtle and very dangerous. If the athlete loves their sport, they will sometimes hide {{the severity of the}} injury and just wait <b>till</b> <b>it</b> heals slightly {{in order for them to}} get playing as soon as possible, which could cause catastrophic injuries later on in their career. This is why injuries need to be looked into, because if the injury is too extreme where the athlete can't physically go back to playing their sport, they may get forced to retire in order for them not to damage themselves at a more extreme level, resulting in the athlete experiencing many different feelings, such as alienation, distress or uselessness.|$|E
25|$|The Munger Fort, {{located at}} Munger (also spelt as Monghyr during the British Raj), {{in the state}} of Bihar, India, is built on a rocky hillock on the south bank of the Ganges River. Its history is not {{completely}} dated but it is believed that it was built during the early rule of Slave dynasty of India. The Munger town where the fort is situated was under the control of Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi (1325-1351 AD). The fort has two prominent hills called the Karnachaura or Karanchaura, and the other a built up rectangular mound deduced to be the location of a citadel of the fort with historical links. The Fort had a succession of Muslim rulers (Khaljis, Tughlaqs, Lodis, Nawabs of Bengal, followed by Mughal rulers, <b>till</b> <b>it</b> was finally acceded to the British by Mir Quasim (1760â€“72), after unseating his father-in-aw MÄ«r Jafar on the grounds of old age, for a monetary reward negotiated by Vansittart. This deal involved payment by the East India Companyâ€™s merchants of an ad valorem duty of 9 percent, against an Indian merchantâ€™s duty of 40%. The fort became a place of considerable importance to the British in Bengal till 1947 (India'a independence).|$|E
25|$|On September 19, 1863, General John C. Breckinridge's {{division}} {{was on the}} left of the entire Confederate line along the Chickamauga Creek. Stationed near Glass' Mill; the 1st-3rd Florida was detached with an artillery battery as observation force {{when the rest of the}} division moved southwards. During the night to the 20th, D.H. Hill's whole corps was shifted to the extreme right of the Confederate lines. The 1st-3rd, relieved by cavalry from Wharton's division, had to march the whole night <b>till</b> <b>it</b> reached its position on the right; not locating its brigade till 8 a.m. When the advance against the Union positions around Horseshoe Ridge started in the morning the brigade was on the right of the second line, and marched against elements from Thomas' XIV Corps. Advancing towards Kelly Field along the Lafayette Road in a southern move, the 1st-3rd Florida, together with the 47th Georgia Infantry, was separated from the rest of the column and drifted rightwards. Here it faced elements from King's Regular Brigade. Nearly losing its colors during the retreat it reunited with the brigade after the later was repulsed. Then the division shifted its northern elements to the east due to the advance of Gordon Granger's Reserve Corps from the north. Another local advance towards Kelly Field in the afternoon brought in a number of prisoners but could not break the enemy's lines. The regiment lost 9 killed, 70 wounded and 13 missing.|$|E
