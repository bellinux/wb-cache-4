40|$|Introduction and aims: Experiences of buprenorphine-naloxone (BNX) sublingual film {{injection}} are {{not well}} documented or understood. We examined how people who inject BNX film seek and share information about this practice, document the methods used to prepare BNX film for injection, and report participants' experiences of this practice. Design and Methods: Interviews were (n[*]=[*] 16) conducted with people who {{indicated that they had}} injected BNX film since its introduction onto the Australian market. Semistructured interviews were recorded and <b>transcribed.</b> NVivo 10 <b>program</b> (QSR International) was used to analyse the data using qualitative description methodology. Results: Participants largely reported similar BNX film preparation techniques, although the texture of BNX film during preparation to inject was reported to be unusual (gluggy), and there were many varied accounts associated with the amount of water used. Physical harms reported as associated with injecting BNX film were described (including local and systemic issues); participants reported injecting the film to enhance its immediate effects, yet generally reported that sublingual administration provided longer-lasting effects. Discussion and Conclusions: Understanding knowledge acquisition about injecting new formulations of opioid substitution therapy is crucial in developing more effective harm-reduction strategies. Dissemination by peer networks to those who are currently or planning to inject BNX film regarding the 'gelatine like' texture when mixing, using only cold water and double filtering is important to ensure safer injecting practices. Findings from this study highlight the importance of peer networks for the dissemination of harm-reduction information. Introduction of new formulations internationally requires more qualitative studies to inform safer practices.

40|$|Patient {{engagement}} {{is one of}} the 6 quality directives {{issued by}} the Institute of Medicine for patient-centered care. Federal meaningful use regulations require health care organizations to offer patients a secure online website, or patient portal, to access their health information. Although the patient portal offers patients the opportunity to be more involved in their care, the portal has not been widely used. However, barriers to utilization are best understood {{from the perspective of the}} patient. Any barriers to patients accessing the portal are also barriers to patient engagement. The purpose of this project was to understand from the patient perspective why 99 % were not using the portal at a large health system. The goal was to understand the patient preferences and their expectations for the portal as well as the perceived barriers. The Diffusion of Innovation Theory guided this quality improvement project to understand the patient perspective to initiate focused portal revisions and program changes. A focus group method was used to interview patients about their portal knowledge, willingness to use the portal, and general preferences for accessing health information. Four focus groups were conducted with 15 participants. Each session was recorded, <b>transcribed</b> within the <b>program</b> NVivo, and reviewed through content analysis. The main barrier to patient portal use is a general knowledge deficit about the purpose, usefulness, and accessibility. As possible solutions, the participants suggested education and promotion materials are essential. Also, nursing staff will need to offer patients information about how to access and use the portal. Through this project, positive social change can be achieved as patients will have better access to their personal health information with the revised portal...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} how first year, tertiary-level English as an Additional Language (EAL) academic writing programs for adult learners can use emerging understandings about the importance of discourse communities and imagined communities to guide and inform participation in an Academic Writing (AW) program. It asks what learning gains students have from an AW program using discourse-specific generic tasks to engage learners desiring a range of future destinations. More specifically, this paper considers links between academic genres and students’ desired, future imagined communities (Anderson 1983; Kanno & Norton 2003). It does this by incorporating the literacy practices characteristic of those communities into the drafting/redrafting process. The study maintains that a focussed genre approach can impact learners’ imaginings of themselves as members of future discourse communities through reproducing texts similar to the authentic artefacts of those discourse communities (Flowerdew 2000; Hyland 2003, 2005). This paper outlines a situated pedagogical approach, where students report on their improvement across three drafts and assess their learning reflectively. This approach is compatible with research into the value of genre as a way of preparing learners for future discourse communities. A multicultural group of 41 learners enrolled in the degree-level course, Academic Writing, at a tertiary institution in New Zealand took part in a study reflecting on this approach to building awareness of one’s own writing. Focus group interviews with a researcher at the first and final stages of the <b>program,</b> <b>transcribed</b> and analysed using textual analysis methods (Sandelowski, 1995) provided qualitative data. This core data was triangulated with written student reflections on their progress. Key benefits identified include the facts that the chance to produce texts perceived as useful to the students’ immediate futures reflected the overall value of the AW program, and that the process of reproducing them engaged the learners largely because of their focus on their future, imagined communities...|$|R
40|$|A common way {{to examine}} children's {{language}} production is to analyze their narrative ability, {{which has been}} observed in several studies in various languages. The present study aims to analyze Swedish children's stories at microstructural level (grammatical and utterance level) and macrostructural level (discourse level) and examine how these results differ between two narrative elicitation methods. Furthermore, the study aims to investigate if the results from Swedish and English speaking children differ between these two elicitation methods. The present study involved 40 typically developing children aged 7; 0 – 8; 11 years with Swedish as their native language from southeastern Sweden. The two narrative elicitation methods used were personal narrative generation and fictional narrative retell. During personal narrative generation the participants were prompted to share their own experiences based on given themes with image support. In the fictional narrative retell {{participants were asked to}} retell the tale "Frog, Where are you?" (Mayer, 1969). The participants' two stories were <b>transcribed</b> in the <b>program</b> Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) and analyzed at micro- and macrostructural level. At the microstructural level the following measures were investigated: Total utterances (TU), Mean Length of Utterance in Words (MLU-w), Type Token Ratio (TTR), Percentage of Maze Words (PcMw), Overgeneralization Errors (EO) and Total Number of Words (TNW). For macrostructural analysis the Narrative Scoring Scheme (NSS) was used. At the microstructural level participants achieved higher MLU-w, TTR and PcMw in the fictional narrative retell than in personal narrative generation. TNW and MLU-w correlated with participants' age at fictional narrative retell. The participants generated higher values regarding TU and TNW in personal narrative generation. Analysis of the macrostructure showed {{that the majority of the}} participants achieved higher scores in fictional narrative retell than in personal narrative generation.

40|$|Background: Acute {{postoperative}} pain can develop into chronic pain if not managed well. Nurse anesthetists consider many factors when developing an anesthetic plan to provide optimal {{postoperative pain}} management. Multimodal pain management {{is recommended for}} managing pain in the perioperative period and this may include administering medications such as intravenous (IV) acetaminophen and IV non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to the patients if not contraindicated. Even though these are valuable and daily considerations for nurse anesthetists, {{there is not a}} standard of care for addressing postoperative pain management in adult abdominal surgical procedures. Objective: The purpose of the project is to determine the perspectives of nurse anesthetists for developing postoperative pain management in adult patients having abdominal surgical procedures. Design: This is a descriptive study designed to determine if current nurse anesthetist practices are being guided by evidence-based practices and if the findings can be used to develop a standard of care. Participants: Nurse anesthetists from a local Tucson, AZ health care facility Measurements: Nurse anesthetists were interviewed in-person. They were asked six semi-structured questions and the answers were recorded and <b>transcribed</b> into the <b>program</b> NVivo. Each answer was then coded and compared for emerging common themes. Results: Five out of eleven nurse anesthetists participated in this project. Thirty-five themes were discovered and three main categories developed: 1. Nurse anesthetists consider multimodal pain management {{an integral part of the}} anesthetic plan. IV acetaminophen and IV NSAIDs are considered for every surgical patient if they are not contraindicated; 2. IV acetaminophen is used more frequently for abdominal procedures compared to IV NSAIDs because of risks for bleeding associated with IV NSAIDs; and 3. Each anesthetic plan is individualized to safely address both the patient and surgical factors. Conclusion: A multi-center study should be considered for a future project to determine if these common themes would be found consistently across health care facilities. Eventually, this information could be used to develop a standard of care for managing postoperative pain in adults having abdominal surgery. Other methods for addressing multimodal pain management such as regional blocks should be considered for future studies as well...|$|R

For this fact, the World Health Organization has suggested as one of the lines of action to train midwives who actively provide their care services to mothers. General objective: to determine the knowledge, attitudes and intercultural practices in the postpartum care of midwives from Tarqui Parish, 2017. Methodology: it is a qualitative study, carried out in a focus group of 10 midwives from Tarqui Parish, 2017; that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An interview was applied based on the questions of investigation and determination of the problem and its registration through a tape recorder. The data obtained through the interview were <b>transcribed</b> into Word <b>program</b> without modifying the words used by midwives. The interpretation and analysis was carried out through Atlas Ti. 7 program with its respective categories, citations, codes and memos. Results: the knowledge possessed by the midwives of Tarqui who participated in the research comes mainly from empiricism. There is a clear understanding of the pathologies and complications around childbirth and according to their worldview that has been transmitted from generation to generation, they deal mostly with medicinal plants considering the heterogeneity of the parturients and the cases. The continuation of rituals with their respective meanings is also evident, although signs of modernity are also visible, which has also caused their attitudes to form around the families that come to them and the Local Health System. According to this research, the ultimate goal of the midwives is to achieve the quick recovery of the mother and ensure the health of the newbornLicenciado en EnfermeríaCuenc...|$|R
