5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Maurice Friedman {{writes about}} the book {{in the context of}} the various {{attempts}} to find a universal essence - or perennial philosophy - within religion. He finds that Time and Eternity is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by Aldous Huxley or Ananda Coomaraswamy, but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.|$|E
5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform is <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{ought to be}} a political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

These kinds of unconfirmed reports of British military involvement, coupled with the actually legitimate acts of repatriation, were subsequently exaggerated by Ustaša supporters, particularly in the Croatian diaspora, in biased published works to accuse the British of war crimes.|$|E
25|$|A {{few studies}} have even found that emotionally arousing stimuli enhance memory only after a delay. The most famous of these was a study by Kleinsmith and Kaplan (1963) that found an {{advantage}} for numbers paired with arousing words over those paired with neutral words only at delayed test, but not at immediate test. As outlined by Mather (2007), the Kleinsmith and Kaplan effects were most likely due to a methodological confound. However, Sharot and Phelps (2004) found better recognition of arousing words over neutral words at a delayed test but not at an immediate test, supporting <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is enhanced memory consolidation for arousing stimuli. According to these theories, different physiological systems, including {{those involved in the}} discharge of hormones believed to affect memory consolidation, become active during, and closely following, the occurrence of arousing events.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} merits and practicalities {{of using a}} multi-framing {{approach}} in problem solving and decision making, through applying it to a real situation. We provide a rationale for the multi-framing approach, which is founded on <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no one correct way to approach most real problems, and that single-frame approaches can induce frame blindness. The case analysis demonstrates benefits of multi-framing that include building frame awareness, overcoming frame blindness, and understanding the development of perspectives that contribute to more robust and acceptable ‘solutions’. We describe our experiences of using framing as a meta-framework for problem solving and illustrate how the approach {{may be used in}} the classroom. In doing so, we indicate how the nature and success of problem-solving interventions can be frame dependent. ...|$|R

500|$|The idea of {{the galactic}} {{habitable}} zone has been criticized by Nikos Prantzos, {{on the grounds that}} the parameters to create it are impossible to define even approximately, and that thus the galactic habitable zone may merely be a useful conceptual tool to enable a better understanding of the distribution of life, rather than an end to itself. For these reasons, Prantzos has suggested that the entire galaxy may be habitable, rather than habitability being restricted to a specific region in space and time. In addition, stars [...] "riding" [...] the galaxy's spiral arms may move tens of thousands of light years from their original orbits, thus supporting <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may not be one specific galactic habitable zone. A Monte Carlo simulation, improving on the mechanisms used by [...] Ćirković in 2006, was conducted in 2010 by Duncan Forgan [...] of Royal Observatory Edinburgh. The data collected from the experiments support Prantzos's notion that there is no solidly defined galactic habitable zone, indicating the possibility of hundreds of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, though further data will be required in order for a definitive determination to be made.|$|E

500|$|The {{choice of}} Kent and Æthelberht was almost {{certainly}} dictated {{by a number of}} factors, including that Æthelberht had allowed his Christian wife to worship freely. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established,and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Another reason for the mission was the growing power of the Kentish kingdom. [...] Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium, or overlordship, south of the River Humber. Lastly, the proximity of Kent to the Franks allowed for support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Liudhard was felt to be acting {{as a representative of the}} Frankish Church and not merely as a spiritual adviser to the queen.

500|$|While {{he viewed}} the Muslim Mughals as despotic and the Marathas as predatory, Tod saw the Rajput social systems as being {{similar to the}} feudal system of medieval Europe, and their traditions of recounting history through the generations as similar to the clan poets of the Scottish Highlanders. There was, he felt, a {{system of checks and}} {{balances}} between the ruling princes and their vassal lords, a tendency for feuds and other rivalries, and often a serf-like peasantry. The Rajputs were, in his opinion, on the same developmental trajectory that nations such as Britain had followed. His ingenious use of these viewpoints later enabled him to promote in his books <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a shared experience between the people of Britain and this community in a distant, relatively unexplored area of the empire. He speculated that there was a common ancestor shared by the Rajputs and Europeans somewhere deep in prehistory and that this might be proven by comparison of the commonality in their history of ideas, such as myth and legend. In this he shared a contemporary aspiration to prove that all communities across the world had a common origin. There was another appeal inherent in a feudal system, and it was not unique to Tod: the historian Thomas R. Metcalf has said that [...] Above all, the chivalric ideal viewed character as more worthy of admiration than wealth or intellect, and this appealed to the old landed classes at home as well as to many who worked for the Indian Civil Service.|$|E
