5|$|The {{proposal}} that {{one type of}} organism could descend from another type goes back {{to some of the}} first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, such as Anaximander and Empedocles. Such proposals survived into Roman times. The poet and philosopher Lucretius followed Empedocles in his masterwork De rerum natura (On <b>the</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things).</b>|$|E
5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On <b>the</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things).</b> In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, the author, Stephen Lewis, aged 67 and living in Toronto, worked as the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, a {{position}} he held since 2001. Previously he worked as the Deputy Director of United Nations Children's Fund (1994–99), as the Canadian ambassador to the UN (1984–88), and {{as leader of the}} Ontario New Democratic Party (1970–79). After Lewis optimistically accepted the Special Envoy position he became increasingly distraught by the devastation he witnessed. Already a skilled orator, he became more vocal on the topic. He founded the Stephen Lewis Foundation, hosted Oprah Winfrey as she toured Africa, and was the subject of two award-winning documentaries by <b>The</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things,</b> entitled Race Against Time and The Value of Life. Meanwhile he was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada, awarded the Pearson Medal of Peace, and named Canadian of the Year (2003) by MacLean's magazine. In 2005, he was invited to deliver the annual series of Massey Lectures from which the book, Race Against Time, was adapted. He wrote the text in early to mid- 2005 and delivered the lecture series in October when the book was released. Lewis wrote the book, not as an employee of the UN, but as a citizen concerned with the world's response to the AIDS challenge in Africa.|$|E

5|$|Later {{chapters}} tell {{of events}} since Metamorphosis. In British Columbia, Suzuki spends {{time on the}} Queen Charlotte Islands and in Stein Valley advocating against logging. He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of <b>The</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the Kayapo people. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the Amazon. His tour of Papua New Guinea and how Australia became his second home are explained. He describes the founding and {{early years of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, a non-profit organization based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts about climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

5000|$|Continuing {{with the}} Pythagoreans: The Pythagoreans, too, held that void exists, {{and that it}} enters the heaven from the {{unlimited}} breath - it, so to speak, breathes in void.

25|$|One of {{the most}} eloquent {{expressions}} of Epicurean thought is Lucretius' On <b>the</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> (1st century BCE) in which he held that gods exist but argued that religious fear was one the chief cause of human unhappiness and that the gods did not involve themselves in the world.|$|E
25|$|With {{the goal}} of {{explaining}} Epicurean philosophy to a Roman audience, the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius wrote De Rerum Natura (<b>The</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things)</b> in 50 BC. In the work, Lucretius presents the principles of atomism; {{the nature of the}} mind and soul; explanations of sensation and thought; the development of the world and its phenomena; and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena.|$|E

25|$|In July 1934 {{at the age}} of 14, he sat the exams for the Liceo Classico D'Azeglio, a Lyceum (sixth form or {{senior high}} school) specializing in the classics, and was {{admitted}} that year. The school was noted for its well-known anti-Fascist teachers, among them the philosopher Norberto Bobbio, and Cesare Pavese, who later became one of Italy's best-known novelists. Levi continued to be bullied during his time at the Lyceum, although six other Jews were in his class. Upon reading Concerning <b>the</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> by Sir William Bragg, Levi decided {{that he wanted to be}} a chemist.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{chemical}} hypothesis first {{emerged in}} Classical Greece {{with the theory}} of four elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything {{is formed as a}} combination. Greek atomism dates back to 440 BC, arising in works by philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus. In 50 BC, the Roman philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De rerum natura (On <b>The</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things).</b> Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments.|$|E

25|$|He {{thinks it}} ill-advised {{to build the}} doctrines of natural {{religion}} and morality on a hypothesis which many philosophers had rejected, and {{which could not be}} proved against Epicureans, the principal impugners of the existence of laws of nature. He cannot assume, he says, that such ideas existed from eternity in the divine mind, but must start from the data of sense and experience, and thence by search into <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> to discover their laws. It is only through nature that we can rise to nature's God. His attributes are not to be known by direct intuition. He, therefore, held that the ground taken up by the Cambridge Platonists could not be maintained against Hobbes.|$|E
25|$|Fuller {{states that}} in the Nikayas, right-view {{includes}} non-dependence on knowledge and views, and mentions the Buddha's simile of his dhamma as a raft that must be abandoned. He finds that the Atthakavagga's treatment of knowledge and wisdom {{is parallel to the}} later Patthana's apparent criticism of giving, holding the precepts, the duty of observance, and practicing the jhanas. In his view, both texts exhibit this particular approach not as an attack on practice or knowledge, but to point out that attachment to the path is destructive. Similarly, the text's treatment of concentration meditation is intended to warn against attachment to insight, and communicate that insight into <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> necessarily involves a calm mind.|$|E
