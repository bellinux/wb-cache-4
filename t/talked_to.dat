5|$|In {{order to}} make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> his father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday {{included}} a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because it was too soon in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relation between child distress, parent distraction behaviors, and parent other nonprocedural talk during pediatric cancer procedures. Participants were 72 children with cancer (age 5 to 13 years old) and their mothers. Cancer procedures were videotaped and coded for parent behaviors and child distress. Contrary to hypotheses, child distress {{was positively related to}} parent verbal distraction and nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child and negatively related <b>to</b> nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult in the room. Sequential analyses suggested that verbal distraction and nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child were more likely to occur after crying, while nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult was less likely to occur after crying. Crying was less likely to occur after nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult. Results suggest that nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another adult functions differently than nonprocedural <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child; however, given the low frequency of behaviors, results should be interpreted with caution...|$|R

5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is demon negotiation, {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and can fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons can be <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player selects a demon, which initiates a negotiation. For those demons who can talk, the responses vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons can be bribed with Macca and items, some will ask questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others can be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. A negotiation can fail if the wrong responses are chosen, if the Protagonist's demon roster is full, or if another enemy demon interrupts. When in the party, demons can be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama can also affect how negotiation goes.|$|E
