5|$|A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought {{assistance}} from Stephen after his domains, which were {{situated in the}} regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops {{in the second half}} of 1263. Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria. The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Bulgaria. Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.|$|E

5|$|A notable venue {{not found}} at the 1956 Games was an Olympic Village, where the athletes would be housed. The town of Cortina d'Ampezzo had a {{population}} of less than 7,000 people in 1956. Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an Olympic Village would so significantly increase the hotel capacity it would put many of <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business. Athletes were billeted by local families or stayed in hotels during the Games.|$|E
5|$|Back at {{the house}} her odd {{behaviour}} continued; most notably she offered the men cigarettes, only to quickly snatch <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their mouths as the men smoked them, claiming the cigarettes to be poisoned. She was also carrying multiple mobile phones, {{as well as a}} laptop. She appeared to be paranoid and constantly looked out of the windows; this behaviour caused Molloy to assume that she had run away from an abusive partner. Shortly before midnight Molloy left the two, and Sabina stayed the night in Hollinshead's home.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May 1799, the Austrians had wrested {{control of}} parts of Switzerland from the French as forces {{under the command of}} Hotze and Count Heinrich von Bellegarde pushed <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Grisons.

5|$|Czechoslovakia's {{hardline}} {{communist government}} agreed {{to close its}} border with East Germany to choke off the exodus. The closure produced uproar across East Germany and the GDR government's bid to humiliate refugees by expelling them from the country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the windows. When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station {{in an attempt to}} board. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E

In an upset, the Australians defeated the All Blacks, knocking <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the tournament.

5|$|On 13–14 May, German forces {{crossed the}} Meuse near Sedan using {{integrated}} land and air tactics {{that broke the}} morale of the French 55th Infantry Division, driving <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the blockhouse line and allowing the Germans to gain a strong position from which to exploit the breakthrough. A progressive collapse of the French Second and Ninth Armies from 14 May to 17 May allowed German forces to move to the west of La Ferté, cutting La Ferté off from much of its mobile support.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1970, taking {{advantage}} of a visit by Sihanouk to Moscow and Beijing, the prince was deposed by the National Assembly, who promptly announced the creation of the Khmer Republic. The real power, however, fell into the hands of Lon Nol. The general promptly issued an ultimatum to the North Vietnamese, ordering <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country, but the only real result was that the Cambodian Army led a bloody pogrom against ethnic Vietnamese in the eastern provinces.|$|E
5|$|Ridiculous Fishing: A Tale of Redemption is {{a mobile}} fishing video game where players use motion and touch {{controls}} to catch fish and subsequently shoot <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the sky for}} cash.

The game was developed and published by Vlambeer—Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman—and released for iOS on March 13, 2013, and later that year for Android.|$|E

5|$|The Everglades hosts 1,392 exotic {{plant species}} {{actively}} reproducing in the region, outnumbering the 1,301 species considered native to South Florida. The melaleuca tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia) takes water in greater amounts than other trees. Melaleucas grow taller and more densely in the Everglades than {{in their native}} Australia, making them unsuitable as nesting areas for birds with wide wingspans. They also choke out native vegetation. More than $2million has been spent on keeping <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Everglades National Park.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{won their}} first five games in 2009, but lost their next four. After beating the Atlanta Falcons in overtime, they lost badly to Denver on Thanksgiving.
