500|$|Slee {{collapsed}} {{during the}} est <b>training</b> <b>seminar</b> after {{participating in a}} 16-hour session. He fell backwards while standing on stage with other est participants, during {{a part of the}} training known as [...] "the danger process" [...] or [...] "fear confront", which had started at approximately 11:30 P.M. that night. During this process, Slee was supposed to confront his fear of {{standing in front of a}} group of individuals. An est graduate whose role was called a [...] "body catcher" [...] or [...] "people catcher" [...] broke Slee's fall and then went to get help. Assistants in the est training discovered that Slee was not breathing, and attempted to resuscitate him. While individuals were attempting to revive Slee, est trainer David Norris asked the est assistants to help keep the participants in their seats to remain calm.|$|E
500|$|Werner Erhard and his est Training {{programs}} and later The Forum have been parodied in films, both directly and through more subtle references. [...] Still in other films {{that did not}} directly intend to parody the subject matter, other reviewers have found elements of the est movement as applied to the genre of fictional self-help films. [...] The 1977 movie Semi-Tough, starring Burt Reynolds, parodied the est training. [...] Bert Convy played [...] "Friedrich Bismark," [...] a caricature of Werner Erhard. [...] Bismark's organization and its training went by the name [...] "B.E.A.T.", which stands for: [...] "Bismark Earthwalk Action Training." [...] In real life, Erhard had a Mercedes Benz with a llicense plate that said [...] "SO WHUT", in the film, Bismark rode in a limousine that said: [...] "BEAT IT". A form of Rolfing was also parodied in the film, and Lotte Lenya's character [...] "Clara Pelf", called PELFING", was described as: [...] "a Rolf like masseuse." [...] The press caught on to this satire of Erhard in the film, and gave these sections of the film positive reviews. [...] The Wall Street Journal did not give an overall positive review, but did appreciate the portions where Werner Erhard was parodied: [...] "The movie isn't much - an erratic ramble - But it has some pleasant moments, and a delicious send-up of The self-improvement guru Werner Erhard." [...] The Charlotte Observer praised Bert Convy's portrayal of the self-help guru Frederick Bismark, writing: [...] "Bert Convy is a hilariously smug consciousness-raiser with a more than passing resemblance to EST's Werner Erhard." [...] After the film's release, Bert Convy appeared on The Tonight Show and discussed his experiences when he attended an est <b>training</b> <b>seminar</b> in preparation {{for his role as}} Frederick Bismark. [...] During actual filming on Semi-Tough, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. [...] She related to Convy that Erhard was [...] "pleased" [...] with the role, and she wished him success in the film. [...] However, Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him to go easy on his parody of Erhard in the film. However, several EST graduates shunned the film for making fun of the training, its methods, its philosophy, as well as Werner Erhard, himself.|$|E

2500|$|Aelony was not {{completely}} naïve about segregation and first became involved in civil rights campaigns in high school. During {{this time in the}} mid-1950s, he participated in the distribution of NAACP postcards bearing the slogan [...] "Completely Free by ’63," [...] though to him this goal seemed too distant. The hatred Aelony witnessed towards the Koinonia community for practicing racial equality drove him towards participation in the Civil Rights Movement. In September 1959, he attended a ten-day CORE <b>training</b> <b>seminar</b> in Miami, Florida. The seminar focused on nonviolence training and was attended by many people involved in the Freedom Rides, including Patricia Stephens Due and her sister Priscilla Stevens. The seminar was held at the Sir John Motel, {{one of the few places}} in Miami that allowed blacks and whites to stay together. The nonviolence training consisted of techniques in organizing and training, and also emphasized the need to understand the people who were against integration. Aelony came to believe that it was important to understand why people do things rather than just dividing them into categories of good and bad.|$|E
2500|$|The Grescoe article (see Criticism section) did not garner much {{attention}} and the allegations in Michelle Remembers were still {{considered by many}} in the early 1980s to be true. As a result, Pazder was considered to be an expert in the area of satanic ritual abuse. With the sudden emergence of Satanic ritual abuse cases in the 1980s (likely {{due in part to the}} publication of Michelle Remembers) Pazder's expertise was called upon. In 1984, Pazder acted as a consultant in the McMartin preschool trial which featured allegations of satanic ritual abuse. Pazder also appeared on the first major news report on Satanism (broadcast on May 16, 1985), by ABC’s 20/20. Pazder was part of the Cult Crime Impact Network and lectured to police agencies about satanic ritual abuse during the late 1980s. By 1987 Pazder reported that he was spending a third of his time consulting on Satanic ritual abuse cases. By September 1990, Pazder had been consulted [...] "in more than 1,000 'ritual abuse' cases". With people suddenly being prosecuted for satanic ritual abuse, prosecutors used the book as a guide when preparing cases against alleged Satanists. Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases several local social workers had attended a <b>training</b> <b>seminar</b> that listed satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse and used Michelle Remembers as training material.|$|E
