40|$|Application sharing is an {{important}} aspect of collaborative computing. One mechanism for sharing applications is a multiplexor, a tool that broadcasts input /output messages from a single client to multiple displays. We describe the design and implementation of a multiplexor for X windows that supports a heterogeneous environment and works effectively across both local and wide area networks. This X-multiplexor is composed of two distinct components, the Collaborative Computing Frameworks X-Multiplexor (CCFX) which acts as a pseudo-server for the client, and the Collaborative Computing Session Manager (CCSM) which renders the client images and supplies the user interface to the system. In effect, CCSM acts as a distributed window manager, ensuring that all participants have the same view of the shared clients. This <b>two-headed</b> <b>approach</b> offers significant gains in flexibility and resource usage. CCFX and CCSM can communicate using any reliable transport protocol. This can result in si [...] ...|$|E
