5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, property rights and even <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E

Hogg repeatedly made the case to Shelley that marriage was in Harriet's best interests. Shelley was eventually persuaded and eloped with Harriet to Edinburgh.|$|E

This is accepted in the Jain tradition as what started the tradition of alms giving in its various forms, and one that has continued since ancient times in India.|$|E

Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode.

50|$|The novel explores several social {{problems}} in Victorian England, especially those relating to <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> <b>the</b> Church, and education. These themes are developed in particular through Hardy's use of contrast. For example, {{at the beginning}} of their relationship, Jude's Christian faith contrasts with Sue's religious scepticism, a contrast which is heightened even further by their later role-reversal. Although the central characters represent both perspectives, the novel as a whole is firmly critical of Christianity and social institutions in general.|$|R

50|$|While {{institutions}} tend {{to appear}} to people in society {{as part of the}} natural, unchanging landscape of their lives, study <b>of</b> <b>institutions</b> by <b>the</b> social sciences tends to reveal <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>institutions</b> as social constructions, artifacts of a particular time, culture and society, produced by collective human choice, though not directly by individual intention. Sociology traditionally analyzed social <b>institutions</b> in terms <b>of</b> interlocking social roles and expectations. Social institutions created and were composed of groups of roles, or expected behaviors. The social function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> was executed by the fulfillment of roles.

25|$|Thackeray {{began as}} a satirist and parodist, writing works that {{displayed}} a sneaking fondness for roguish upstarts such as Becky Sharp in Vanity Fair, and the title characters of The Luck of Barry Lyndon and Catherine. In his earliest works, written under such pseudonyms as Charles James Yellowplush, Michael Angelo Titmarsh and George Savage Fitz-Boodle, he tended towards savagery in his attacks on high society, military prowess, <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and hypocrisy.|$|E

5000|$|These works also {{place more}} {{emphasis}} on social commentary through the interrelational imaginative use of found objects. Matthew Mangold writes, [...] "The notion of [...] "fiber" [...] often includes not only materials commonly employed {{in the development of}} quilts, tapestries, and other such coverings, but unorthodox substances that heighten the conceptual basis in the work. Sheet metal, window screening, sugar packets, and trinkets of consumer culture are his chosen substance deployed against the detritus of Pop Art. Lefelhocz's compositions are not the ironically banal semiotics of Andy Warhol or James Rosenquist. Although not as sly as his predecessors, Lefelhocz's attacks are blatant, devastating and often two pronged. One only need to look at works like Match Schticks, where <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and <b>the</b> quilting tradition light up equally under his brand of RADAR.".|$|R

40|$|The {{ideology}} of motherhood, ijjat and bhadrata {{on the one}} hand, the patriarchal customs, traditions and the laws <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and divorce on the other have been instrumental in subordinating Bangladeshi women. These patriarchal mechanisms have created a subaltern space for women across classes. Although women from within their heterogeneous positions in Bangladeshi society experience moments of dialogue with the dominant power, oftentimes they are silenced. ^ In Chapter One I read Shaukat Osman 2 ̆ 7 s Janani to examine how {{the body of the}} subaltern female becomes the ultimate site of gender oppression. I also interrogate the {{ideology of}} motherhood which produces and upholds the image of an all-sacrificing woman. ^ In Chapter Two I demonstrate that the heroines of Taslima Nasreen 2 ̆ 7 s Chaar Kannya are subalternized by <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and divorce. Chaar Kannya simultaneously represents that a subalternized woman can subvert and challenge Bangladeshi patriarchy through an exploration of the female body on her own terms. Since all the characters of Taslima 2 ̆ 7 s stories are middle class women, their subalternization brings to focus that patriarchy subordinates women of all classes. As {{one of the most important}} feminist writers, Taslima Nasreen intervenes in the patriarchal episteme through a discourse challenging and opposing that subalternization. ^ Finally, in Chapter Three I analyze Abdullah Al-Mamun 2 ̆ 7 s play Kokilara in order to explore how the ideology of ijjat and bhadrata and <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and divorce disempower women irrespective of classes. I also examine how the language of Bengali and its dialects intersect with class and gender within the multiple negotiation and contestations of power in Bangladeshi society. Most importantly, I bring to focus that Kokilara foregrounds and reiterates the need for collective resistance against patriarchy. Mamun 2 ̆ 7 s play suggests that such a resistance can be based on ethical singularity among women of various classes. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} total {{war on the}} British home front from 1939 to 1945 was profound. In particular, {{military}} and economic mobilization disrupted gender relations. Men and women of different class and national backgrounds encountered each other, sometimes forming romantic relationships that strained <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and family. This disruption was heavily depicted in wartime British cinema, especially in feature films devoted to the home front experience. Differences of class, gender, and nationality were downplayed in order to construct a solidaristic meaning for wartime social experience, fitting for “the People’s War. ” My thesis examines romantic relationships and marriages depicted in numerous British home front films. While many films featured unconventional couples of mixed class or nationality, they did not always offer happy endings. I argue that these films evince the problems <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in wartime Britain and foreshadow the rise in divorce that came with peace in 1945 - 46...|$|R
