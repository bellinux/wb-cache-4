I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> video the same. But I did love the richness of that video.

25|$|Consequently, on 28 February 1914, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was {{declared}} and a provisional government {{was formed to}} support the state's objectives. Christakis-Zografos himself {{became president of the}} provisional government. In a proclamation to the people of Northern Epirus, Zografos maintained that their aspirations had been ignored, that the Great Powers had even denied them self-government within the Albanian state, as well as guarantees for the protection of life, property, religious freedom and of their national existence. The proclamation also called upon the Epirotes <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> sacrifice defending the integrity of Northern Epirus and its liberties from any attack whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|A belt {{could also}} be {{fastened}} over a simple tunic-like garment or undergarment, just below the breasts or over the breasts. When the apodesmos was worn under the breasts, it accentuated them. Another word for a breast-band or belt was strophion (Gr: στρόφιον). A further term was kestós (Gr: κεστός, Latin: cestus), used specifically for Aphrodite's charmed girdle in the Iliad, whose power was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> woman who wore it irresistible to men. In view of its association with the love goddess, this type of garment probably had an erotic connotation because of its effect to accentuate the breast.|$|E

25|$|The NFL and New Orleans {{officials}} worked diligently to {{put together}} a deal to reschedule the game. The league considered a number of options, including shortening the regular season, shortening the playoffs, condensing the three playoff rounds in two weeks, and moving the game to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. It was eventually decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort to maintain a full regular season and playoff, and push the Super Bowl back to February 3. Also, due to the Super Bowl being sent back a week, the first week of New Orleans Mardi Gras parades rolled one week earlier than normal.|$|E
25|$|Kempe's {{argument}} goes as follows. First, if planar regions separated by the graph are not triangulated, i.e. {{do not have}} exactly three edges in their boundaries, we can add edges without introducing new vertices in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> region triangular, including the unbounded outer region. If this triangulated graph is colorable using four colors or fewer, so is the original graph since the same coloring is valid if edges are removed. So it suffices to prove the four color theorem for triangulated graphs to prove it for all planar graphs, and {{without loss of generality}} we assume the graph is triangulated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, World War I erupted in Europe. European socialists were {{singularly}} unable to stop the march of their various national governments to a particularly bloody conflagration. Algie Simons made the effort to write to both Ramsay MacDonald and Keir Hardie, leaders of the British Independent Labour Party, urging them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort to keep the Second International alive, thereby preserving lines of communication with the socialists of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Though both parties agreed in the desirability of the policy which Simons advocated, they proved incapable of its implementation, as the belligerent national governments of both sides shut down all means of contact.|$|E

The declaration calls on the government and other stakeholders in Cameroon <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort in order to protect and make accessible for public use the country’s photographic and cinematographic heritage.

25|$|As {{the chief}} {{advantage}} of the Collins Line over its competitor the Cunard Line was speed, it was considered imperative <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort to ensure this advantage was maintained regardless of cost. This policy frequently resulted in costly repairs as the ships' engines were continually pushed to the limit. By 1852 {{it was clear to}} the owners that the existing government mail subsidy of $19,250 per voyage was insufficient, and the Line returned to Congress to request an increase in the subsidy to $33,000 per voyage. The government granted this request, and it was additionally decided {{to increase the number of}} voyages from 20 to 26 per annum, resulting in a total increase of the annual subsidy from $385,000 to $858,000. Competition between the two Lines had reduced freight rates considerably however, and even this new subsidy was not sufficient to prevent the company from continuing to lose money.|$|E

Any such deferral required congressional notification before it was authorized. The Attorney General was charged with training officials in identifying and utilizing foreign intelligence information properly {{in the course of}} their duties. The government officials include those in the Federal Government who do not normally encounter or disseminate foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties, and State and local government officials who encounter, or potentially may encounter in the course of a terrorist event, foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties.

25|$|Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite {{features}} a base roster of 30 playable characters, consisting of both new and returning heroes and villains in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. Additional characters {{will also be}} released post-launch as downloadable content (DLC). According to Producer Mike Evans and Associate Producer Peter Rosas, the development team examined {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of each returning character and adjusted them by providing new moves and abilities, hoping <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> fighter viable. In terms of roster selection, characters were chosen based on two aspects: their potential interactions within the story and their gameplay style. The developers sought to include a variety of different character archetypes, from small, nimble characters, such as Strider Hiryu, to large, brawler-type characters, such as the Hulk. The Marvel characters' designs were proposed by Capcom's research and development team in Japan, who took inspiration from both the characters' comic book and film appearances. Marvel staff members worked closely with the team, providing feedback to maintain the authenticity of their characters' portrayals. While speaking at E3 2017, Evans explained how they picked the roster based on which characters Marvel was currently pushing or planning to push in the future.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the more}} {{persistent}} criticisms of the show (especially its first two series) has been its indifferent or decidedly negative depiction of male characters. Tim Oglethorpe, reviewing the first series in the Daily Mail, wrote that [...] "the men often appear to be feckless, devious or dangerous" [...] and stated that DS Andy Roper (Gleaves) was [...] "the only man to emerge with any credit". Dianne Butler, who reviewed the programme upon its airing in Australia, made a similar point, questioning {{the relevance of the}} show's male characters: [...] "there are some men in this but they're fairly incidental". The Guardians John Crace expressed his belief that most of the programme's male characters are deficient in some way, writing: [...] "surely it must be possible to make a show with women lead characters without having <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> male a complete dork? From Janet's useless husband and Rachel's idiot brother who can't boil an egg without burning down the kitchen".|$|E
500|$|Some {{characters}} who previously appeared in War for Cybertron feature updated appearances and transformation schemes, or moving parts that animate regardless of player action, similar to breathing. The character Optimus Prime was redesigned for a [...] "more warrior-type feel", with more bulk {{added to his}} body mass. The weaponry in Fall of Cybertron was also modified and enhanced; the designers of the game put out a call {{to everyone in the}} studio for new weapon ideas. Matt Tieger of High Moon explained that in addition to new designs, each weapon could be upgraded, continuing, [...] "We really made a conscious choice <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>every</b> upgrade a significant improvement, so one upgrade might increase your firing speed by 75%. We could have made the system so {{that there were a lot}} of upgrades that each improved your guns a little bit, but we wanted to make each upgrade feel like this giant thing.
