It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen." ...|$|E

Booth {{was one of}} {{the first}} leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's The Marble Heart. In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek {{sculptor}} in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she turned <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you." [...] The President replied, [...] "He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?" [...] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.|$|E

500|$|Gilligan {{also came}} up with the idea to have a {{crossover}} with the show , which also takes place in Baltimore.

Homicides a great show, so why not try to get Richard Belzer to play his Detective [...] character?'" [...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode. He noted, [...] "we had the board set up and [...] and there was a piece missing and we just couldn't come up with a how to get out of this situation, why doesn't this assassin just kill The Lone Gunmen?

500|$|The {{traveller}} {{explains in}} [...] "Part III" [...] {{how he is}} the son of an Oxford mathematics professor. When young, he loved to read outdoors and wanted to know how the world worked. He became an architect and travelled throughout Europe. Eventually he married a lovely woman with whom he had a son, Henry. One day the couple left their son with his nurse during an outing and she fell asleep. When they returned, their son was gone, and he could not be found. The traveller spent years searching the countryside for his son; one day he met the woman, Dame Smithson, who had stolen his son. To please her sailor husband who wanted a child, she lied <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> she was pregnant. Before his return, she needed a child, so she stole the traveller's. Unused to the harsh life of a peasant, the child suffered and became sickly. As a result, the woman's husband disliked him and beat him, believing him to be worthless. Hearing this story, Maurice reveals himself to be the traveller's son; he had changed his name to avoid the person he believed to be his cruel father. Overjoyed to be reunited with his son, the traveller buys the cottage for him and they return every once in a while. Maurice is educated, grows up, and travels widely. He returns to see that the cottage has disintegrated; he builds a new one for another poor fisherman's family, beside the lot of the old one.|$|E

The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western hemisphere 600 years before Jesus' birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated that this vision occurred {{on the evening of}} September 21, 1823 and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill; was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions; and that, in four years from this date, the time would arrive for [...] "bringing them forth", i.e., translating them.

2500|$|William Kirk, {{driver of}} the steam tram car on the Derby-road, was summoned for using abusive and {{threatening}} language to Israel Jordan, {{driver of the}} Nottingham and Bulwell omnibus. Mr. W.H. Stevenson appeared for the complainant and Mr. Barlow for the defendant. Mr. Stevenson said this was another instance in which the Tramway Company endeavoured to monopolise all {{the streets in the}} town. There was a case before the Bench the other week in which the company summoned one of this complainant's drivers for being {{on the wrong side of}} the road. The Bench dismissed the case. The next day Mr. Jordan was driving along Derby-road when the defendant used abusive language <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "You beat us yesterday, but I'll be even with you before the week is out. The first time I meet you I'll knock you and the bus off the road." [...] Defendant also threatened to give complainant a [...] "good hiding". Israel Jordan was then called, and said he was one of the proprietors of the Nottingham and Bulwell Bus. He corroborated the statement of Mr. Stevenson. In reply to Mr. Barlow, he denied that he first used threatening language towards complainant. Frederick Bramley, residing at Hucknall Torkard also corroborated.-- There was a cross summons taken out by Kirk against Jordan for abusive language, and obstructing the steam car. The charge of using abusive language was withdrawn, but the other was proceeded with and Kirk was placed in the witness box. After hearing his evidence, however, the Bench dismissed the summons against Jordan, and fined Kirk 10s.

2500|$|When Schneersohn came to America (he was {{the first}} major Chasidic leader to move {{permanently}} to the United States) two of his chassidim came <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> not to start up all the activities in which Lubavitch had engaged in Europe, because [...] "America is different." [...] To avoid disappointment, they advised him not even to try. Schneersohn wrote, [...] "Out of my eyes came boiling tears", and undeterred, the next day he started the first Lubavitcher Yeshiva in America, declaring that [...] "America is no different." [...] From 1940-1945, the Rebbe created a lot of turmoil within the US Jewish community since he refused to work with Rabbi Kalmanowitz and Rabbi Kotler of the VAAD in trying to help rescue more Jews out of Hitler's Europe. Instead, he focused heavily on trying to bring about the coming of the Messia. Also, instead of putting a most of his efforts into rescuing other Jews, he placed inordinate amount of time and energy in saving his books. Historian and head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Israel and Orthodox Jew Efraim Zuroff asks, [...] "How can one justify expending even a small amount of resources and energies to try and save the rebbe's library {{at a time when the}} rescue of lives should have taken precedence?" [...] One wonders why no one talked about using the funds and political contacts necessary for retrieving the books to save more Jews, but the Lubavitchers never discussed this matter. As Zuroff writes, Lubavitchers [...] "do not consider such a set of priorities controversial or in any way problematic", for the preservation of knowledge and torah learning is one of their highest priorities. In 1949, Schneersohn became a U.S. citizen, with his son-in-law Menachem Mendel assisting to coordinate the event. A special dispensation was arranged wherein the federal judge came to [...] "770" [...] to officiate at Rabbi Yoseph Yitzchak's citizenship proceedings, rather than the Rebbe travel to a courthouse for the proceedings. Uniquely, the event was recorded on color motion film. In 1950, Schneersohn died in his home in Brooklyn and many members, even the next Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, declared him the Messiah. This caused a lot of problems for the Chabad community just like it would when Menachem Mendel Schneerson died in 1994, and many in the community declared him the Messiah. In 1951, Menachem Mendel Schneerson took over the leadership of Chabad and became the next Rebbe of Chabad. When this happened, many stopped declaring Rebbe Schneersohn the Messiah and focused on building out the community under the new Rebbe Schneerson (note: the confusion on names results from the fact that Rebbe Schneerson was the second cousin and son-in-law of Rebbe Schneersohn).|$|E
