The research seeks to develop an understanding of {{the perception of}} fit and investigates the role it plays in the evaluation and support for CRM campaigns. This research aims to address the overarching research problem: How does the congruence of nonprofit-forprofit pairings influence consumers' perceptions of fit and consequently their evaluation and support for CRM campaign alliances? To assist in addressing this research problem, a number of focal theories are integrated in a CRM conceptual framework including congruity theory, social alliance principles, co-branding, attribution theory, message framing and message claim vividness and the transfer (spill-over effect). These theories assist in addressing the key research questions: • What {{is the role of the}} perception of fit in a CRM context? • How do consumer perceptions of fit between the nonprofit-forprofit pairings affect consumers' evaluation and intent to support a joint CRM campaign? • How do the different information cues and attributes embedded in CRM advertising stimuli affect the perception of the participating organisations and the evaluation of a joint CRM alliance? • Does perceived fit in isolation or in combination with other factors play a significant role in consumers' attitude toward a joint CRM campaign? The nonprofit sector in Australia faces major challenges -the lack of government and philanthropic funding to support the charitable organisations and the increasing demand for nonprofit services in the wider community. The sector must diversify its revenue stream to avoid becoming over-reliant on government funding. This is to ensure sustainability into the future and to continue to provide social value to the community. One strategy increasingly used is cross-sector alliances between forprofit and nonprofit organisations. Despite CRM campaigns becoming quite prominent in the retail landscape, it is still predominantly the domain of high profile charitable organisations such as breast cancer, children's hospitals, and cancer research. The focus on prominent social issues is also prevalent in the CRM and co-branding literature. As such, this research seeks to determine whether a congruent CRM campaign aligned with a less marketable social issue (such as obesity) is perceived as a better fit than an incongruent campaign aligned with a social issue (such as environment preservation). It is clear from the exploratory research the perception of fit does not operate in isolation. After a review of the literature (congruity theory, attribution theory, message framing and message claim vividness), a number of factors are identified that have the potential to influence the perception of fit and the consumer's evaluation of, and intent to support, a CRM campaign. These factors include the role of the product type and charity type and the perception of the forprofit and nonprofit organisations engaging in CRM campaigns. In addition message persuasiveness is assessed based on the provision of supporting evidence. The supporting evidence consists of either statistical evidence, or a narrative, or a combination of both, or a neutral message (no evidence provided). The message structure is important in a CRM context as there may be instances when the consumer has limited knowledge about the cause or brand or the reasoning behind the formation of the social alliance, for which they may seek further clarification. Therefore, it is essential to determine whether specific message structures are more effective under different congruent and incongruent conditions. As a precursor to the conclusive stage of the research, Study 1 was an exploratory phase. This phase included a literature review, commercial CRM campaign assessment and a newspaper content analysis. This allowed a deeper insight into the social phenomena at hand. The conclusive stage of the research adopted a positivist research paradigm through a scenario-based experiment using a sample of 935 respondents. The results of the study were quite mixed. It was clear the initial perception of obesity as a social issue was quite negative but when aligned with either a hedonic restaurant or utilitarian cafe, the perception of fit was perceived as better than the incongruent counterpart of the hospitality organisations aligned with environment preservation. A key contributor to this perception was the importance of conveying a similar philosophical mission across the CRM partners (such as a hospitality outlet promoting and delivering healthy eating options). However, from a CRM campaign evaluation and support perspective, the results indicate that a favourable perception of fit transfers to a positive evaluation of the respective CRM promotion when the campaign has a similar mission but does not transfer to the overall support. A mediation analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting CRM campaigns conveying a similar philosophical underpinning enhance consumers' perceptions of fit and result in a positive evaluation of this type of CRM campaign. The findings also demonstrate the role of the advertising message. The message plays a role in the favourable evaluation of the perception of fit especially when the message contains statistical evidence and focusses on the mission of the campaign. It is also evident that when <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>missions</b> are not aligned, the CRM campaigns are less effective. This also holds true for campaigns that provide no information pertaining to the services the charity provides to the community (neutral claim). In relation to forprofit and nonprofit organisations. the CRM campaign message using statistical evidence or vivid message claims (statistical evidence in combination with a narrative), by highlighting a similar mission, significantly enhanced the attributions of the nonprofit organisation. On the other hand, the perceived motive of the forprofit organisation for participating in the CRM campaign had no effect. In terms of the perceptions of the forprofit and nonprofit organisations' motivations transferring to the evaluation and support for the CRM campaign, the findings showed no such effects. In summary, individuals recognise the perception of fit is greater when the campaign clearly articulates mission similarity using statistical and narrative supporting evidence, which transfers to a positive evaluation of the CRM campaign. The message tends to be more in favour of the role of the nonprofit organisation than the forprofit organisation. However, this does not persuade individuals to purchase the CRM product to assist the charitable organisation. Given the prevalence and longevity of CRMs in the marketplace, the importance of understanding the cues and attributes which influence consumers' perceptions and evaluations of fit and subsequent evaluations and support of the CRM campaign, is paramount. This is particularly so when lesser-known or less marketable charities are involved. Overall, this research contributes to the field of CRM as it provides a better understanding of the factors influencing consumer perception of fit. The findings assist decision-makers in the development of effective message frames that clearly communicate the objectives of the campaign to potential target consumers. This better elucidates the process through which consumers respond to CRMs thus helping strategic partners meet their societal goals and objectives...|$|E

These changes are transforming {{the way in which}} social housing providers perform their task and are reshaping their relationships with the State, communities and with other market actors. The combination of continued State withdrawal from service provision, the deep and persistent effects of the global financial crisis that begun in 2008 and profound changes in the type of demand for social housing across North Western Europe call for a reflection on the implications of these phenomena for social housing providers. Several studies indicate that social housing providers in Europe have begun to adopt new (social) entrepreneurial strategies and are becoming more innovative as a response to these challenges. These strategies imply tackling the tensions between (at times) conflicting drivers, notably those arising from the State, the market and communities. However, research in this topic so far is fragmented, focussing on one country or on specific sub-areas such as asset management and non- housing activities and rarely connects with the relevant wider literature on the third sector and social enterprise. Within this context, this PhD research has sought to widen this discussion by providing new insights through a comparative study {{of the ways in which}} individual social housing providers are relating to (i. e. responding to and influencing) these contextual changes. More specifically, the research sought to better understand the complex process of decision-making these companies undergo to manage their responses to competing drivers. Companies operating in two countries (England and The Netherlands) were studied in-depth. In both countries, the social rental sector has played a prominent role in their respective welfare states for decades. While both are amongst countries with the highest share of social rental housing in Europe, each represents a different type of welfare state and of social housing provision - following Kemeny’s classification, a unitary system (the Netherlands) and a dualist system (England). The broad aim of this PhD was to deepen the understanding of the ways in which contextual drivers impact on the mission, values and activities of social housing organisations. Furthermore, the study sought to understand how these organisations are positioning themselves vis-à-vis the State, market and community. The above aims translate into three research questions: (1) How are contextual developments impacting on the missions, values and activities of social housing organisations? (2) How do these organisations position themselves vis-à-vis the State, the market and community? and (3) How are competing values enacted in the decision-making process exercised by these organisations vis-à-vis these contextual drivers? The universe for this PhD research consists of social purpose organisations, not owned by the State, which operate on a non-profit distribution basis. Together they are part of a wide range of ‘third sector’ actors providing social and affordable housing across most of North Western Europe. The PhD adopted a pluralistic epistemological approach with an interpretivist emphasis, with significant use of qualitative research methods. This approach was deemed useful to give a voice to the subject(s) of study. The research design included a mixed methods approach and a longitudinal, international and inter-organisational case study research design, involving two company-cases. The companies were studied over a four-year period, starting in March 2008. The research design and data analysis draws on elements of grounded theory, and on the work of Eisenhardt on ‘building theory from cases’. Following this approach, a series of ‘theoretical propositions’ were devised from the study’s findings in order to answer each of the three research questions. In relation to the first research question, the study found that contextual developments and the missions, values and activities of social housing organisations are in a two-way relationship. From an initial assumption of unidirectional causality, in the process of the research it became clear that the relationship between contextual developments and organisational change is more often than not one of mutual causality. We qualified this relationship through six propositions. First, we posited that market and State drivers have a relatively stronger impact on social housing organisations as compared to community drivers. Second, we postulated that both market and State drivers have a knock-on effect on community drivers. Third, we established that State drivers pose continuous exogenous shocks to social housing providers by means of constant policy changes. Our fourth proposition stated that in a context of economic crisis the relationship between market drivers and social housing organisations is marked by volatility. Our fifth proposition established that all three types of contextual drivers are reinforcing the long-term trend of deepening residualisation of the social housing sector. The sixth proposition emphasizes the long-term mutually shaping relationship between context and social housing organisations. Findings on the second research question led us to describe the positioning of social housing organisations vis-à-vis their environment as a ‘dynamic balancing act’. In order to understand the way(s) in which social housing organisations position themselves in relation to changes in their environment we drew on theories of social enterprise and hybridity to unpack three ideal-typical strategic orientations that may be at play in this process: State, market and community. We adopted a triangular model to illustrate these orientations and developed a classification model to understand the ‘strategic position’ that these organisations adopt vis-à-vis their environment.  We looked at three different dimensions of this strategic position, namely mission, values and activities, each captured by a different type of variables in the classification: ‘descriptor’ (to capture the formal characteristics of the organisation), ‘motivator’ (as related to the organisation’s mission), and ‘behaviour’ (referring to the organisation’s activities). Upon applying this classification to our case studies, our findings resulted in three propositions. First, it became clear that while descriptor variables confirmed the hybrid formal characteristics of social housing organisations, they do not account on their own for their position in relation to State, market and community. Our second proposition stated that social housing organisations are constantly balancing pressures to (re) define their mission. Our study found that in this process, each company is faced with trade-offs when considering their organisational mission in relation to a changing mandate from the State domain, while at the same time weighing demands from the market and community domain. Third, we posited that social housing organisations exert different degrees of agency in their positioning vis-à-vis the State, market and community. We identified a continuum of actions that these organisations have put in place to respond to key contextual changes, ranging from ‘reactive’ to ‘proactive’ and ‘strategic’. Hence, social housing organisations would have the capacity to shape their environment and / or at least, their position in relation to this environment. On our third research question, we found that enacting competing values in social housing organisations implies multiple rationalities at play in decision-making.  The PhD research used the study of a critical incident in each company to describe the ways in which competing values are enacted in the decision-making process of these organisations in relation to the three types of contextual drivers. In each case, a critical incident was chosen in conjunction with the companies to be studied over a prolonged period of time. Both incidents turned out to be of regulatory nature (i. e. State-driven); in the English case, it was the Comprehensive spending review (CSR) announced in October 2010 and a series of major welfare reforms implemented by the coalition government. In the Netherlands, the Dutch government ruling on the issue of State aid by housing associations implemented in January 2011. The companies’ responses to these critical incidents, respectively, were operationalised through a ‘strategic decision’ made by each of them vis-à-vis these events, defined as a decision recognised as having significant implications for the structure, direction or purpose of an organisation. The English company defined their strategic decision as the impact on the company’s vision, direction, strategy and financial capacity of the October CSR and the shake-up in the welfare benefit system. More specifically, the company’s bid to the HCA for the four-year development programme in the first half of 2011 formed the basis for the study of this critical incident. The strategic decision of the Dutch company was whether to follow the Dutch government’s ruling on income ceilings or not. Furthermore, the company had to decide how to re-organize its financing in order to comply with the required administrative split between activities classified as ‘Services of General Economic Interest’ (SGEI) and ‘non SGEI’. The study of these critical incidents looked at the decision-making process from both a formal and content perspective, distinguishing motivator and behaviour variables in the process. In terms of form, we found that different modes of decision-making co-exist in the process. Participants in each company use a variety of ‘political tactics’ to influence the decision-making process. Taken all together, the existence of these tactics confirms the presence of institutional entrepreneurial behaviour amongst company executives taking part in the process. Realizing that these tactics exist is important because it shows the ways in which different participants and their (departmental) agendas try to influence the outcome of the decision. In terms of content, a first proposition established that social housing organisations operate with multiple rationalities; non-rational factors such as politics, intuition and past experience played a key role alongside technical considerations. In our fourth proposition we identified a number of ‘dilemmas of hybridity’ that these organisations have to deal with to stay true to their mission while tackling pressures from different State, market and community. Second, we discussed the ambivalent relationship that social housing providers have with risk. A number of questions were raised on what (if any) risk attitude lies closer to third sector service providers in relation to what is expected from commercial enterprises or even from the State. This is relevant in particular given the more general trend to transfer risk from the State to third sector organisations in service provision overall in European societies. Last, our research found that social housing organisations are consistent with stated core values but are constantly making choices on how to enact these values. While contextual drivers may appear not to affect the mission and values of these social housing organisations, the former do impact on the companies’ strategies and activities. This means that there can be significant gaps between espoused and enacted values. Policy and practice implications emerging from the findings to all three research questions included: First, we raised the question as to whether the aggregate impact of the regulatory changes at sector level in each country - such as the ones portrayed by the respective critical incidents - would be the convergence of both countries’ housing association sectors in terms of their role and scope. Second, the study coincides with views in both countries pointing to the lack of a ‘single voice’ or unified strategic action fields. In addition, in both cases, although to different extents, the perceived ‘policy confusion’ – namely, the view that government was sending conflicting signals to social housing organisations - raised tensions between the redefined mandate and <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>missions</b> of the individual companies. Third, findings suggest a trend towards increasing differentiation within the housing association sector in each country as a result of growing tensions between mandate (social housing as a public service obligation as defined by the State) and mission (social housing as ‘core business’ as define by each organisation). Fourth, the question emerges as to whether the identity of a social housing provider operating along the wide spectrum between the two ‘pure’ types is defined by its activities (behaviour variables) or by their organisational form/legal status (descriptor variables). The concept of hybridity proved useful to gauge this complexity, as illustrated in the ‘dilemmas’ companies have to face when making strategic decisions. Fifth, findings showed that community drivers tend to stay constant or change slightly over the long term, except for those resulting from the combined impacts of the economic crisis and the resulting political and regulatory changes. This leads to the recommendation for social housing enterprises to consider longer-term political (and market) trends as well, to anticipate on going (neoliberal) trends and possibly fundamental changes in housing preferences. Sixth, while values tend to stay constant, mission is permanently redefined in relation to pressures from the environment (including changes in mandate) and activities change accordingly. In order to stay true to this identity, social housing providers ought to be able to anticipate conflicting logics and put mechanisms in place to adjust their policies and activities to respond to these challenges while keeping its core values intact. This PhD has contributed to science both from a theoretical and methodological perspective. Through a series of theoretical propositions, we have added to a developing body of knowledge, specifically on the nature of the relationship between contextual drivers and organisational changes in social housing organisations. Our classification of social enterprise in housing allows comparisons between organisations operating in diverse contexts, which share a similar core task. This can be useful for scientific, political and practical purposes. From a scientific perspective, it can be used as a basis for identifying similarities and differences between social housing organisations within and between countries at a much deeper level than traditional comparisons on the basis of tenure or other formal organisational characteristics. Policy makers can also use this information to understand the factors leading to different types of behaviours by social housing providers. For professionals, this model may be useful to assess to what extent their organisation is being consistent with regards to espoused vs. enacted values. From a societal perspective, findings of this PhD can help us reflect on the future role of social housing in the context of changing social contracts and social cohesion and welfare models in each country. Furthermore, the research helped participating practitioners to reflect about a number of organisational dilemmas they face, as illustrated in our findings...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a structured approach {{to measure the}} performance of a shared services business unit. This approach links the activities in the areas at which a shared services business unit must excel to create sustainable value for the organisation to <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> vision. <b>The</b> methodology developed can be used to measure {{the performance of a}} shared services business unit by all the stakeholders that have an interest in the organisation. The study concludes that measuring of the performance of a shared services business unit is dependent on <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> vision and strategies as contained in a mission statement. The study further concludes that as the transformation of technology, business processes, people and customer satisfaction are required for continuous evolution of the shared services; the activities that make up these areas should form the basis of the performance measurement of shared services. These activities in the areas of technology, business processes, people and customer satisfaction should be derived from <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> vision and <b>mission,</b> and be supportive of <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>mission</b> and vision. <b>The</b> author has studied shared services and performance measurement metatheories and has found that the principles applicable to measure the strategic performance of an organisation can be applied to a shared services business unit. Some of these principles are so straight forward that they are often overlooked and taken for granted. The empirical methodology in this thesis follows a structured approach where the sample framework was tested to determine if the sample elements comply with the requirements of shared services. Following on this the study had to determine if the remaining sample elements are measuring the performance of their respective organisations in a structured manner. Only once this has been established can the study determine the manner in which these sample elements measure the performance of their shared services. After this, the elements identified through the literature study and empirical research could be build into a hierarchy of performance measurement for a shared services business unit. In developing a hierarchy of performance measures for a shared services business unit, shared services organisations have been provided with a structured approach to measure the performance of their shared services business unit that will indicate the value created by the shared services to all stakeholders concerned.

Competency gap analysis helps to develop required competency in line with <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>mission,</b> vision and strategic objec-tives. HRP provides strategic basis for taking HR decisions, anticipating change. Of-late HRP has become an important enterprise-wide strategic function not only to achieve goals and objectives but also to sustain present level in organisations. Globally, skili shortages, competency gap, redundan-cies, downsizing, rightsizing are the major issues in today's organisations. The biggest problem for manpower or human resource redundancy lies with inadequate Human Resource Planning (HRP). To achieve any goal, manpower requirement needs to be assessed, located and harnessed. HRP is not mere assessment of number of men required.

This study discusses the contemporary HRP process, without, however, discarding the importance of traditional processes altogether. Traditional processes, by and large follow logical sequence to study the job and then translate the job information into manpower requirement [...] Here, however, we have discussed the 'importance of application of some selected quantitative manpower planning models and then suggested their consideration for reducing the risk of inaccurate manpower plan-ning.

The organisation chosen for this research falls into the small to medium enterprise category and is a consulting firm. This project attempts to define performance management, differentiates performance management systems and performance appraisal, and explains the three approaches to performance management. Further to this, it explores the various motivation theories {{that are associated with}} performance management. Performance and rewards are closely correlated; therefore, rewards management systems are also discussed in this project and how it contributes toward organisational and employee effectiveness. The various characteristics of performance management and the performance management process are outlined and how it affects employees and the organisation as a whole. Finally an attempt is made to validate the link between human resources, strategy and performance management. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are used in this project to collect data and a total of 64 respondents (which constitute 100 %) took part in the quantitative study. For the qualitative study, a total of 5 personnel from the senior management team were interviewed. The data collected were uploaded into SPSS and analysed. The results from the analysis were used to test the null and alternative hypotheses. It has been specifically requested by the participating consulting firm not to mention the name of the organisation and therefore, the researcher has refrained from doing so. The results suggested that the main aim of the performance management system is to achieve organisational goals and having a clear, concise and well defined job descriptions {{play a crucial role in}} employee performance. Furthermore, it was found that <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>mission</b> and vision play an important role in the development and implementation of performance management policies and practices in an organisation, which must be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bound. However, the performance management process itself should be an ongoing process.

In this dissertation, the intention is to examine and evaluate the intermediary role played by the health area reference librarianship. This evaluation will be done under an academic and medical perspective. The reference librarianship should have the users‟ needs at the centre of his role. He should always use the information and communication technologies available; however, the ethical part of the process cannot be forgotten.

Our case study basis is the 250 health area teachers of Escola Superior de Tecnologia da Saúde de Lisboa. The inquiry was the method used in order to obtain the data for this research. Our case study conclusions may give some idea about the new profile of the reference librarianship of the academic context within the health area, which are as follows: 1) the reference librarianship has to co-operate with the students and teachers in the classes, in other words, they have to start working in the field instead of being „closed‟ in the academic library; 2) within the library, the reference librarianship should support the increase of information consultancy; the librarian should have the capacity to use his skills in order to help the user; 3) the user would prefer the librarian to assist/guide in the research process rather than using the librarian‟s skills to provide the research material; 4) the user should be aware that a fee may be payable if he requires an urgent and quality research service which is/can be provided by a skilled professional (reference librarianship); 5) the reference librarianship can be helpful in the field, when working with a health care team (hospital) based on their access and capacity to have the latest news on health research discoveries and being able to resolve medical doubts due to their capacity to deal with problem-based learning...|$|R

The non-library stakeholders prefer-red a narrower mission for the libraries focused more on the needs of their institutions and emphasising collection devel-opment as the method of attaining excellence. The library stakeholders expressed a much broader mission defined in the context of national information provision, emphasising information access while at the same time balancing it with collection development. This multiplicity of strategic visions was found to be the subject of disagreement between decis-ion-makers and the rest of the library staff. The study con-cludes with some ideas on how to address this situation...|$|R

Campbell and Yeung's Ashridge mission model is one of the methodologies suggested in academic literature for use in the analysis and design of mission statements. This paper measures marketing managers' perceptions of the usefulness of the Ashridge mission model as a tool for assessing <b>the</b> quality of <b>organisational</b> <b>mission</b> statements in Zimbabwe. To fulfill this objective, the perceptions of a convenience sample of 25 marketing managers enrolled on a postgraduate marketing programme at a leading Zimbabwean university are gathered and content-analysed. The Ashridge mission model prescribes that an ideal mission statement should have four elements - i. e. purpose, strategy, behaviour standards and values. The study finds that nearly all the mission statements in the sample reflect the purpose and strategy elements. More than half of them are in conformity with the values component. Less than half are in compliance with the behaviour standards aspect. Although the study is exploratory in 'nature, considering the convenient nature of the sample, the practical implication of this paper is that marketing managers in Zimbabwe can draw on the Ashridge mission model to analyse existing mission statements and design new ones...|$|R

Performance management has been emphasised {{as a critical}} tool to guide Transnet in maintaining a competitive advantage. Performance management cannot be viewed in isolation from <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> context and is inextricably linked to the Human Resources strategy, {{which in turn is}} aligned with the overall business strategy. Performance management may be defined as a systematic process by which an organisation involves its employees, as individuals and members of groups, in improving <b>organisational</b> effectiveness in <b>the</b> accomplishment of <b>organisational</b> <b>mission</b> and goals. For the purposes of this study, performance management was explored in terms of purpose, key role players, processes, criteria and challenges. The main research problem {{of this study was to}} determine the perceptions of non-bargaining unit employees of the performance management system at Transnet Engineering. The main research problem had three sub-problems which were addressed through the following actions: A literature study was conducted highlighting the importance of an effective performance management system which establishes a foundation for rewarding excellence by aligning individual objectives with <b>organisational</b> <b>mission</b> and objectives. In this way, performance management establishes clear expectations in terms of results, actions and behaviours. Through regular feedback and coaching, performance management provides a mechanism for detecting problems at an early stage and identifies ways in which to take corrective action. Perceptions of performance management are largely centred around fairness, and dependent on a number of issues, including openness, transparency, communication, and equitability, and the establishment of clear parameters of measurement such as whether both skill and effort will be evaluated. This is why it is important to link performance appraisals to employee goals. If mutually negotiated goals, which involve the participation of all stakeholders, are established at the beginning of the performance period and there is on-going feedback to employees about their performance, then performance appraisals may be perceived as objective, fair and reliable. The insights gained from the literature survey were incorporated into a survey questionnaire which was used in the empirical study to investigate the perceptions of non-bargaining unit employees of the performance management system at Transnet Engineering. This study revealed that most of the respondents were not satisfied with the performance management system within Transnet Engineering, that performance management could be enhanced by using multiple measures more frequently and that greater involvement of subordinates at each step in the performance management process would lead to a greater level of acceptance thereof...|$|R

40|$|This Report summarises the {{outcomes}} of the phases of the Professional Development for the Future Project and presents {{the implications of this}} research for professional development of staff in Vocational Education and Training (VET), as they become knowledge workers. These shifts are occurring within the knowledge era. Distinguishing features of this era are summarised into four broad areas: - the importance and value placed on knowledge in organisations - the time span of discretion - the complexity of relationships, and - the ubiquitous nature of information and communication technology. It is within this context that work is currently performed, and understanding this context provides the foundation for considering new capabilities required in the knowledge era. Key capabilities required of knowledge workers to work effectively in the knowledge era were drawn together from an analysis of the theoretical literature and the results of interviews with knowledge workers. The core capabilities identified include: - adaptive problem solving – becoming designers as well as problem - solvers - rapid knowledge gathering and sharing with others - discriminating between relevant and irrelevant information, and - understanding and working effectively with the organisation’s culture. Knowledge era characteristics and knowledge worker capabilities have been mapped to each other illustrating conceptual linkages between these two areas. Professional development themes drawn from interviews with knowledge workers are presented. While global trends in knowledge work have been well documented, the impact of these trends on the capabilities of workers, {{and the ways in which}} knowledge workers develop these capabilities is less well understood. Their learning methods challenge our current thinking in relation to the ways in which workers acquire skills and knowledge. Some of the professional development methods include seeking exposure to new ideas from a wide variety of sources, embracing intense learning opportunities, and using relationships to increase knowledge. ‘Thought pieces’ (see p 17 ff) commissioned for this Project, as well as subsequent interviews with the authors, provided further insights into the professional development of knowledge workers. The implications of these insights are an extension of earlier themes and emphasise: - the emergent nature of knowledge work - the importance of relationships that facilitate knowledge sharing - coherent conversations and dialogue - collaborative work and generosity. A key insight is the shift from thinking about knowledge work in terms of borrowed knowledge to an emphasis on generated knowledge within a context. Data from focus groups of the Project provide further insights for knowledge worker professional development. These augment the perspectives of the earlier data analysis but also add greater emphasis to: - the clear and direct relationship between professional development and work and career aspirations of knowledge workers, - the relationship of professional development to <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>mission,</b> and - <b>the</b> issues of managing and leading knowledge workers and their development. As part of this analysis the defining features of organisational life in VET were reviewed in relation to effective professional development of knowledge workers. The final section of the Report revisits the core dimensions of the Project. Concise commentaries on working and learning in the knowledge era, professional development in the knowledge era, and leadership and management in the knowledge era are presented. The Report concludes with a discussion of the enablers of professional development for knowledge workers in VET. This discussion is introduced by a re-statement of the VET sector’s positioning in the knowledge era and the consequences of this for VET managers an d staff in terms of complexity, uncertainty and diminished prospects for accurate predictiveness. The enablers comprised: - integration of information technology into socio -technical systems - greater understanding of the organisation from within - connecting staff to the organisation’s fundamental identity - connecting to the work and career trajectories of workers - establishing work structures which integrate the use of professional development resources with knowledge work - providing workers with the autonomy to design their own professional development activities - building professional development into the iterative nature of knowledge work, and - creating organisational contexts that value intuitive thinking and working. Professional development needs to be thou ght of in a much broader context in the knowledge era. What each VET staff member knows and shares will become increasingly central to their work, and in that sense all VET workers require capabilities for knowledge work. This report accurately describes t he VET context, the capabilities required, and <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> enablers that will promote ‘knowing’ and thus embed a new style of professional development within VET. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Since 2000, local {{municipalities}} {{have been}} {{through a process of}} transformation which amalgamated a number of smaller local municipalities into larger municipalities. The amalgamation of a number of municipalities brings together an array of people, and therefore a myriad of organisational cultures are combined. <b>The</b> <b>organisational</b> culture of an organisation has an effect on <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment of its employees. A fit between <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> culture and <b>the</b> employees will increase <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment of those employees and contribute towards improved service delivery. A survey conducted in South Africa indicated that the local municipalities have been delivering poor standards of service to the community; therefore {{there is a need to}} increase the service delivery within local municipalities. The importance of looking at <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment of a local municipality is because if there is commitment within the organisation, then employees will identify with their organisation and its goals, and will deliver the service more effectively and efficiently. Therefore, increasing the service delivery of local municipalities can be achieved through diagnosing <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment and organisational culture of employees within the selected municipality. The primary objective of this research was therefore to diagnose <b>the</b> relationship between <b>organisational</b> culture and <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment of employees at the selected municipality. In order to achieve this objective, a survey was conducted to canvas the opinions of respondents (N = 148) from the selected local municipality regarding their perceptions of <b>the</b> existing <b>organisational</b> culture, their preferences regarding <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> culture within <b>the</b> selected municipality, and finally <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment. <b>The</b> main findings of this research conducted at a selected municipality can be summarised as follows: <b>The</b> dominant existing <b>organisational</b> culture is <b>the</b> power culture, while <b>the</b> dominant preferred <b>organisational</b> culture is <b>the</b> support culture; There is an organisational culture gap between the existing and preferred <b>organisational</b> cultures at <b>the</b> selected municipality; <b>The</b> dominant <b>organisational</b> commitment within <b>the</b> selected municipality is normative commitment; The findings pertaining to <b>the</b> relationship between <b>organisational</b> culture and organisational commitment of employees within the selected municipality can be stated as follows: <b>The</b> existing <b>organisational</b> cultures have significant effects on <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment of employees; <b>The</b> preferred <b>organisational</b> cultures do not have significant effects on <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment of employees; and <b>The</b> <b>organisational</b> culture gap does not have a significant effect on <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> commitment of employees; The findings pertaining to the relationship between the biographical variables and the existing and preferred organisational culture, <b>organisational</b> commitment and <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> culture gap can be stated as follows: There is no significant relationship between biographical variables and <b>the</b> existing <b>organisational</b> culture; There are significant relationships between the biographical variables, namely the departments in which respondents work, and the education level of respondents, and <b>the</b> preferred <b>organisational</b> culture; There are significant relationships between the biographical variables and <b>organisational</b> commitment; and <b>The</b> average <b>organisational</b> culture gap scores of <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> culture scales for the biographical variables are significantly different.
