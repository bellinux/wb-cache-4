5|$|After a {{preliminary}} investigation, Geetha calls Georgekutty and family for questioning. Georgekutty, who had predicted that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen,</b> had already taught his family {{how to change}} their alibi {{at the time of}} murder. When questioned individually, they give the same replies. Georgekutty also presents the bill of the restaurant, the movie ticket and the bus tickets as proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty's alibi. However, Geetha realizes later that Georgekutty had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later.|$|E
5|$|After {{developing}} the core {{concepts of the}} show, Abrams began to seek studios to develop the show; Abrams' past successes led to Warner Bros. Television and the Fox Television Network to quickly jump on board the project. Peter Roth, {{the chief executive of}} Warner Bros. Television, had been actively seeking to bring any Abrams' project to his studio, and heard Abrams' pitch for Fringe at a dinner meeting in August 2007. Similarly, Kevin Reilly, the entertainment chairman at Fox, knew that it was critical for him to bring the next Abrams' project to his network, and worked with Roth to assure <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen,</b> coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The statements {{of the people who}} own the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt {{on the day of the}} incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, and had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E

25|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} Rahab {{was one of}} the four most {{beautiful}} women who ever lived, along with Sarah, Abigail, and Esther. The Rabbis taught that Rahab inspired lust by the mere mention of her name. Rabbi Isaac taught that saying Rahab's name twice would cause a man immediately to lose control. Rav Nachman protested that he said Rahab's name twice and nothing happened to him. Rabbi Isaac replied that he meant that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to any man who knew her.|$|E
25|$|In April, the Committee {{accepted}} the Manager's recommendation that the Mapperley tram service should {{be converted to}} motorbus operation, and {{it was hoped that}} <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> before August. However, the matter was delayed on account of an 8d. increase in the tax on fuel oil. Proposals for this conversion were brought before the City Council, who approved, by a small majority, the use of motorbuses instead of trolleybuses. In November it was similarly agreed to convert the Arnold tramway.|$|E
25|$|In Rømer's {{position}} as royal mathematician, he introduced {{the first national}} system for weights and measures in Denmark on 1 May 1683. Initially based on the Rhine foot, a more accurate national standard was adopted in 1698. Later measurements of the standards fabricated for length and volume show an excellent degree of accuracy. His goal was to achieve a definition based on astronomical constants, using a pendulum. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> after his death, practicalities making it too inaccurate at the time. Notable is also his definition of the new Danish mile of 24,000 Danish feet (circa 7,532m).|$|E

25|$|Dewey again presided at {{the opening}} of the link from Route199 to 82 in October 1954. He {{expressed}} pride in having gotten the parkway out of Dutchess County at last under his tenure. He also called for parkway designers to straighten the roads out, and praised the Thruway, then under construction on the opposite side of the river. Moses, in his speech, recalled Roosevelt's original hope to build the parkway all the way to Canada, the idea he had opposed three decades before. It did not appear likely that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> in any event, between the likely end of the Taconic at the Berkshire section of the Thruway and the recently announced plan to build the Adirondack Northway from Albany to Canada as part of the new Interstate Highway System.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the unique effect can be nearly zero even when the marginal effect is large. This may imply that some other covariate captures all the information in x'j, so that once that variable is in the model, there is no contribution of x'j to the variation in y. Conversely, the unique effect of x'j can be large while its marginal effect is nearly zero. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if the other covariates explained {{a great deal of the}} variation of y, but they mainly explain variation in a way that is complementary to what is captured by x'j. In this case, including the other variables in the model reduces the part of the variability of y that is unrelated to x'j, thereby strengthening the apparent relationship with x'j.|$|E
25|$|Since chance {{procedures}} {{were used by}} Cage to eliminate the composer's and the performer's likes and dislikes from music, Cage disliked the concept of improvisation, which is inevitably linked to the performer's preferences. In a number of works beginning in the 1970s, he found ways to incorporate improvisation. In Child of Tree (1975) and Branches (1976) the performers are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments, for example the cactus. The structure of the pieces is determined through the chance of their choices, as is the musical output; the performers {{had no knowledge of}} the instruments. In Inlets (1977) the performers play large water-filled conch shells – by carefully tipping the shell several times, it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside, which produced sound. Yet, as it is impossible to predict when <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen,</b> the performers had to continue tipping the shells – as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance.|$|E

25|$|After King Alexander died without heirs, {{the general}} {{elections}} {{scheduled to be}} held on November 1, 1920 suddenly {{became the focus of}} a new conflict between the supporters of Venizelos and the Royalists. The anti-Venizelist faction campaigned on the basis of accusations of internal mismanagement and authoritarian attitudes of the government, which, due to the war, had stayed in power without elections since 1915. At the same time they promoted the idea of disengagement in Asia Minor, without though presenting a clear plan as to how <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> On the contrary, Venizelos was identified with the continuation of a war that did not seem to go anywhere. The majority of the Greek people were both war-weary and tired of the almost dictatorial regime of the Venizelists, so opted for change. To the surprise of many, Venizelos won only 118 out of the total 369 seats. The crushing defeat obliged Venizelos and a number of his closest supporters to leave the country. To this day his rationale to call elections at that time is questioned.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{the direct}} and {{indirect}} rebound effects add up to less than 100%, technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy-wide effects that results in increased resource use for {{the economy as a}} whole. In particular, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if increased resource efficiency enables an expansion of production in the economy, and an increase in the rate of economic growth. For example, for the case of energy use, more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources. It is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates. In the 1970s, sharp increases in petroleum prices led to stagflation (recession and inflation) in the developed countries, whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth. An improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices, and leads to faster economic growth. Economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use, more efficient technologies will lead to increased use, because of this growth effect.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the War Cabinet (7 January). He claimed to have recommended that the British should keep the initiative and draw in German reserves (to prevent a German attack on the French) by renewing the offensive around Ypres, and that this proposal did not meet with political approval. In fact the logistical infrastructure was not available for a breakout from the Ypres salient, and {{there is no mention of}} his suggestion in the official minutes. The minutes do agree with Haig's account that he warned only of limited German offensives. After the meeting Robertson, who had also been present and who had been concerned that Haig had not got his point across, insisted that Haig submit a paper warning of the danger of a major German offensive. Over lunch (9 January) at 10 Downing Street with Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War) and Lloyd George (Derby bet a skeptical Lloyd George 100 cigars to 100 cigarettes that the war would be over by the following year), Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the “internal state of Germany” (a broadly accurate prediction). Charteris’ final intelligence report had deduced that Germany was bringing 32 divisions, ten per month, from the moribund Eastern Front, so the most likely time for a German Offensive was in late March (again, a correct prediction). Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer and Conservative Leader) asked Haig what he would do if he were a German general: Haig replied that any German attempt to “break through” would be a “gambler’s throw” as Germany had only a million men as reserves and the balance of manpower would shift in favour of the Allies in August (i.e. when more US troops had arrived - in fact <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> a month or two earlier as US deployment was speeded up after the German Spring Offensives) and that if he were a German general he would launch only limited offensives, although he did warn that the German generals might try to keep the civilians out of power by launching an attack to knock out France. Haig again left the politicians with the impression that he thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai.|$|E
