40|$|In future ATM networks, {{the support}} of the ABR service {{category}} is a key feature to allow an economical <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> with vague requirements for throughput and delay. To provide this capability, feedback information about the current network congestion status is conveyed from the network elements to the end systems in order to dynamically adapt the transmission rates of the ABR sources to changing network conditions. The performance of flow control mechanisms for the ABR service category strongly depends on the choice of the control parameters and the congestion detection scheme used by the network elements. In this paper we summarize a numerical approach to describe the dynamical evolution of the transmission rate of the ABR sources and the resulting buffer content in a congested network element. Based on this approach, simple and accurate formulae to estimate the maximum number of cells buffered in a network element are derived for three easy-to-implement congestion d [...] ...|$|E

Network simulations are performed on 3 network topologies (star, tree and mesh) to determine their suitability for smart water meter networks. The simulations found that once a number of nodes threshold is exceeded the network’s delay increases dramatically regardless of implemented topology. This threshold is at a relatively low number of nodes (50) and the use of network topologies such as tree or mesh helps alleviate this problem and results in lower network delays.

To provide user- or applicationlevel Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee Multipath routing strategy can be used for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> QoS sensitive traffic over the network. Multipath routing means using multiple paths instead of using single path to forward the traffic. If multiple paths are being used for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> the traffic then the traffic will be redirected to the back up path if active path fails. In this way robustness can be achieved.
