5|$|As Duckworth {{gathered}} his squadron, Northumberlands mainmast collapsed across the deck, causing severe {{damage to the}} ship's fittings. Although Cochrane's flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron, all had suffered to a degree: Superbs men counted 60 shot holes while Atlas {{was out of control}} and Donegal had lost one of her topmasts. Casualties were also distributed throughout the fleet, with Northumberland and Spencer suffering <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>and</b> Atlas the least except for the barely engaged Agamemnon. Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged, but Duckworth was rapidly able to effect repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore.|$|E

Steph told Max that he and Tom were now her family, a family further bonded when he proposed marriage. Steph becomes friends with Niall, who fell for her, although she saw him more as someone to confide her problems in. Max began to see Steph as selfish and only interested in her career and money, which led to several arguments between the pair. One day, he caught her alone with Niall, wearing only a shirt. She'd spilled something on her dress, but he assumed <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>and</b> they broke up. A few days later {{she went back to}} Niall's place and they kissed, but were interrupted by his room-mate.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{colleague}} Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations {{three times a}} night for a continuum of five years. The Song astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved {{into a state of}} considerable error. Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements. Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times a night for what should have been five successive years. The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed Wei and Shen's work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate. They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs. When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors. Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions. Therefore, only <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>and</b> most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.|$|E

25|$|After his {{election}} {{as prime minister}} Asō was expected to dissolve the lower house {{to clear the way}} for a general election. But he repeatedly stressed the need for a functioning government to face the economic crisis and ruled out an early election. Only after passage of the extra budget for fiscal 2009 in May and facing internal pressure from the LDP after a series of defeats in regional elections – most notably the Tokyo prefectural election on 12 July – he decided to announce a general election for 30 August 2009. He dissolved the House of Representatives on 21 July 2009. The LDP lost by a landslide to Democratic Party of Japan, in the face of record levels of post-war unemployment. Accepting responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> (<b>and</b> second-only) defeat of a sitting government in modern Japanese history, Asō immediately resigned as LDP president.|$|E

As he tried to defend Harden from advancing to the rim, George's leg caught on the stanchion of the hoop, and fractured. He was stretchered off of the court. Many described his injury as one of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>and</b> most graphic injuries they'd seen since the Kevin Ware incident. A day later, George successfully underwent surgery. He was expected to miss the entire 2014–2015 season. On April 5, 2015 Paul George returned from his injury to play in a game against the Miami Heat.

25|$|Pakistan {{has seen}} many floods, <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>and</b> most {{destructive}} is the recent 2010 Pakistan floods, which swept away the 20% of Pakistan's land, the flood {{is the result}} of unprecedented monsoon rains which lasted from 28 July to 31 July 2010. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and North eastern Punjab were badly affected during the monsoon rains when dams, rivers and lakes overflowed. By mid-August, according to the governmental Federal Flood Commission (FFC), the floods had caused the deaths of at least 1,540 people, while 2,088 people had received injuries, 557,226 houses had been destroyed, and over 6 million people had been displaced. One month later, the data had been updated to reveal 1,781 deaths, 2,966 people with injuries, and more than 1.89 million homes destroyed. The flood affected more than 20 million people exceeding the combined total of individuals affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2005 Kashmir earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The flood is considered as worst in Pakistan's history affecting people of all four provinces and Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo came in 1932. In 1934, Houston Junior College {{became a}} {{four-year}} institution and {{changed its name}} to the University of Houston. A flood in 1935 suddenly turned conditions for <b>the</b> <b>worst,</b> <b>and</b> Houstonians were forced to clean up the mess. Air service by Braniff Airways and Eastern Air Lines came in 1935 and 1936. By the end of the decade, Houston was encountering growth pains, as the city had inadequate air service and that it was no longer a frontier town. Houston became the largest city in Texas in terms of population in 1939. Many immigrants and African-Americans from Louisiana and other parts of Texas moved to the city to find education or work. The city obtained a very multicultural atmosphere, with large African-American and immigrant communities scattered about. However, African-Americans faced bad housing and poor jobs during this time period. Nevertheless, African-American society developed so much that the city was, and still is, the African-American capital of Texas. The University of Houston moved to its present-day location donated by the Cullen family off of what would later be the first freeway in Houston, U.S. Highway 75 (now called Interstate 45), or Gulf Freeway.|$|E
