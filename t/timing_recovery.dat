40|$|Digital {{communication}} systems invariably employ an underlying analog communication channel. At the transmitter, data is modulated {{to obtain an}} analog waveform which is input to the channel. At the receiver, {{the output of the}} channel needs to be mapped back into the discrete domain. To this effect, the continuous-time received waveform is sampled at instants chosen by the <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> block. Therefore, <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> is an essential component of digital {{communication systems}}. A widely used <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> method is based on a phase-locked loop (PLL), which updates its timing estimates based on a decision-directed device. <b>Timing</b> <b>recovery</b> performance is a strong function of the reliability of decisions, and hence, of the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Iteratively decodable error-control codes (ECCs) like turbo codes and LDPC codes allow operation at SNRs lower than ever before, thus exacerbating <b>timing</b> <b>recovery.</b> We propose iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery,</b> where the <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> block, the equalizer and the ECC decoder exchange information, giving the <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> block access to decisions that are much more reliable than the instantaneous ones. This provides significant SNR gains at a marginal complexity penalty over a conventional turbo equalizer where the equalizer and the ECC decoder exchange information. We also derive the Cramer-Rao bound, which is a lower bound on the estimation error variance of any timing estimator, and propose <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> methods that outperform the conventional PLL and achieve the Cramer-Rao bound in some cases. At low SNR, <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> suffers from cycle slips, where the receiver drops or adds one or more symbols, and consequently, almost always the ECC decoder fails to decode. Iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> has the ability to corrects cycle slips. To reduce the number of iterations, we propose cycle slip detection and correction methods.

40|$|<b>Timing</b> <b>recovery</b> is the {{processing}} of synchronizing the sampler with the received analog signal. Sampling at the wrong times can have a devastating impact on performance. Conventional <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> techniques {{are based on a}} decision-directed phase-locked loop (PLL). They are adequate only when the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high, but recent advances in error-control coding have made it possible to communicate reliably at very low SNR, where conventional techniques fail. This thesis develops new techniques for <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> that are capable of working at low SNR. We propose a new <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> scheme based on per-survivor processing (PSP), which jointly performs <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> and equalization, by embedding a separate PLL into each survivor of a Viterbi algorithm. The proposed scheme is shown to perform better than conventional scheme, especially when the SNR is low and the timing error is large. An important advantage of this technique is its amenability to real-time implementation. We also propose a new iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> scheme that exploits the presence of the error-control code; in doing so, it can perform even better than the PSP scheme described above, but at the expense of increased complexity and the requirement of batch processing. This scheme is realized by embedding the <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> process into a trellis-based soft-output equalizer using PSP. Then, this module iteratively exchanges soft information with the error-control decoder, as in conventional turbo equalization. The resulting system jointly performs the functions of <b>timing</b> <b>recovery,</b> equalization, and decoding. The proposed iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> scheme is shown to perform better than previously reported iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> schemes, especially when the timing error is severe. Finally, performance analysis of iterative <b>timing</b> <b>recovery</b> schemes is difficult because of their high complexity.

40|$|Abstract: The {{recovery}} from the last recession has been slower than any other recovery in the post-‐WWII period both in the US and in many other advanced economies. There is an ongoing debate around the causes of such a slow recovery. Are there any structural factors that are constraining the speed of recovery? Or is it simply that recoveries from financial crises are slower than others? How should monetary and fiscal policy act in these circumstances? In this debate, {{there is a constant}} reference to a recovery phase in the business cycle, but such a phase is absent in the most-‐accepted methodology to characterize business cycle: that of the NBER business cycle dating committee. This paper explores data from the US to characterize and date a recovery phase in the business cycle.
