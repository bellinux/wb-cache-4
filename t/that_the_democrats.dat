5|$|Cleveland's {{campaign}} made {{extensive use}} of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{did not want to}} lower the tariff so much that they would lose their jobs. In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers made it impossible for Democrats to win.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, The Post-Star {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> had {{narrowed the}} field of potential candidates from over two dozen applicants down to six. The Democratic chairpersons met with all six candidates at a diner in Albany on February 1, and selected Scott Murphy of Glens Falls, president of the Upstate Venture Association of New York, as their candidate. Other confirmed candidates included Saratoga County Democratic Chairman Larry Bulman, former New York Rangers goaltender Mike Richter, Coxsackie Town Supervisor Alex Betke, and Tracey Brooks, failed candidate for the nomination for the 21st district election in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly all polls {{conducted}} in the months prior to <b>the</b> election showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party would gain fewer parliamentary seats than the Pheu Thai Party, and even Democrat Party Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij admitted that, [...] "we're doing terribly in the polls" [...] and that, [...] "it was obvious from <b>the</b> beginning" [...] <b>that</b> they would not win a majority. [...] Newin Chidchob, de facto leader of coalition partner Bhum Jai Thai Party, predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party would win only 160 out of 500 seats. [...] Abhisit dismissed the polls, and {{days before the election}} exuded confidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party would certainly win the election and form the next government. [...] He promised to [...] "evaluate his own performance" [...] if <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party won fewer than 170 seats.|$|R

5|$|Regular Democrats {{were forced}} to call for {{annexation}} of Texas in their platform, {{but there was a}} bitter battle for the presidential nomination. Ballot after ballot, Van Buren failed to win the necessary super-majority of Democratic votes, and slowly fell in the rankings. It was not until the ninth ballot <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> turned their sights to James K. Polk, a less prominent candidate who supported annexation. They found him to be perfectly suited for their platform, and he was nominated with two-thirds of the vote. Tyler considered his work vindicated, and implied in an acceptance letter that annexation was his true priority rather than election.|$|E
5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E

5000|$|The {{court also}} ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party did not malign Thaksin or urge voters {{to cast a}} [...] "no" [...] vote in the election. It also found the party {{innocent}} of obstructing a parliamentary candidate from registering in a southern constituency.|$|R
5000|$|Following his {{graduation}} in 1856, he {{was made}} register of the United States Mint 7 May 1857.

5|$|On September 7, 1874, the new {{constitution}} was completed and signed {{by a majority of}} delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the Freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of the {{new constitution}} but also for state officials that would be elected if the constitution was indeed ratified. The Republicans actually took the same position <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> had taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied paramilitary groups suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from the polls, and outright assassinations. The new constitution was ratified on October 13, 1874 and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two years of a four-year term.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, who by now had {{tired of}} the {{political}} squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree {{for the next two}} years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951 Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as an affront to his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations rallying against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> had played a complicit role in them. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US chargé d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|Ellsworth {{scored a}} {{landslide}} victory over Hostettler on November 7, 2006. He took 61% {{of the vote}} to Hostettler's 39% – {{by far the most}} lopsided defeat for an incumbent in the 2006 election. Ellsworth's victory was the first of 30 seats <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> took from the Republicans in the cycle.|$|E

25|$|December 6 – South Carolina Supreme Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat,</b> William H. Wallace, was the legally elected Speaker of the House.

25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the deal, the two filibustered nominees not {{mentioned}} in it (David W. McKeague and Richard Allen Griffin) were confirmed. Despite these agreements, however, some observers noted that the chances were still high <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> would filibuster any of the ten originally filibustered nominees if he or she were later nominated to the Supreme Court, especially Owen, Pryor or Brown.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} 1960 Presidential election, Richard Nixon was alarmed {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that his brother, Donald, received a $205,000 loan from Hughes. It has long been speculated that Nixon's drive to learn what the Democrats were planning in 1972 was based in part on his belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> knew about a later bribe that his friend Bebe Rebozo had received from Hughes after Nixon took office.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, it was assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> would {{filibuster}} any Supreme Court nominee who would change the ideological composition of the court. Initially, this conjecture seemed to be borne out when conservative jurist John Roberts was renominated to replace conservative Chief Justice Rehnquist. The confirmation process went relatively smoothly with no threat of a filibuster. Later, however, the hypothesis was disproved. When Bush chose another conservative appellate judge, Samuel Alito, to replace moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, opponents of Alito could not generate enough votes to prevent cloture from being invoked on his nomination. Very soon afterward, he was successfully confirmed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{violence}} followed {{conflict in}} the state over the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election, when differing parties concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> John McEnery or the Republican William Pitt Kellogg had won. While reviews were pending, each candidate certified slates of local officers, increasing social tensions in many areas. It was months before Grant weighed in on behalf of Kellogg.|$|R
2500|$|Jackson {{had been}} a lifelong Democrat; however, in the 1980s he embraced conservatism. He said of his decision, [...] "I had a crisis of conscience. Can I be in a party that holds these views that are antithetical to my worldview?

25|$|On June 17, 2005, Sensenbrenner, {{the chair}} of the House Judiciary Committee, ended a meeting where Republicans and Democrats were debating the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act and walked out in {{response}} to Democratic members discussing human rights violations at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp and the ongoing Iraq war. He ordered the court reporter to halt transcription of the proceedings and C-SPAN to shut off its cameras. Sensenbrenner defended his actions by stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> and witnesses had violated House rules in discussing issues unrelated to the subject of the meeting. Democrats have claimed that his walkout was contrary to House parliamentary procedure, which is to adjourn either on motion or without objection.|$|E
25|$|At the Republican state {{convention}} in Lexington, held May 23, 1883, Morrow {{was chosen as}} the Republican nominee for governor of Kentucky. His opponent was popular six-term congressman J. Proctor Knott. Morrow charged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> had, {{since the end of the}} Civil War, squandered the state's money and accomplished little. He cited as evidence that in 1865, the state's debt was $6 million and the state sinking fund contained $9 million in resources, but by 1883, the sinking fund was exhausted with the state debt still standing at $400,000. He also attacked outgoing Democratic governor Luke P. Blackburn for his liberal use of executive clemency. Morrow was no match for Knott's oratory nor the scathing press of Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson. Knott won the election by a vote of 133,615 to 89,181.|$|E
25|$|Reagan won 53% of {{the vote}} in {{reliably}} Democratic South Boston. His electoral college victory of 489 electoral votes (90.9% of the electoral vote) was the most lopsided electoral college victory for a first-time President-elect. Although Reagan was to win an even greater Electoral College majority in 1984, the 1980 election nonetheless stands as the last time some currently very strong Democratic counties gave a Republican majority or plurality. Notable examples are Jefferson County in Washington State, Lane County, Oregon, Marin and Santa Cruz Counties in California, McKinley County, New Mexico, Polk County, Iowa and Rock Island County, Illinois. Conversely, this was the last time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won Georgia and Maryland until 1992. This election is the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Georgia. This is the first time Massachusetts voted for the Republican candidate since 1956. 1980 is one of only two occurrences of a pair of consecutive elections seeing the incumbent President defeated, the other one happening in 1892. This is the only time in the 20th century a party was voted out after a single four-year term.|$|E
50|$|Abhisit voiced displeasure at <b>the</b> 2006 coup <b>that</b> overthrew Thaksin, but {{otherwise}} did not protest it or <b>the</b> military junta <b>that</b> ruled Thailand {{for over a}} year. A fact-finding panel at the Attorney-General's Office found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party bribed other parties to boycott the April 2006 parliamentary election, which forced the constitutional crisis, and voted to dissolve the party. It also found that Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party bribed other parties to contest the election. A junta tribunal acquitted Abhisit and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> of <b>the</b> vote fraud charges, but convicted and banned the Thai Rak Thai party and its entire executive team.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his last}} {{campaign}} rally, Abhisit claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party was <b>the</b> only way <b>that</b> Thais would live, [...] "under the same sky" [...] {{and that a}} victory for Puea Thai would result in [...] "mob rule." [...] Abhisit positioned the election as a referendum on Thaksin.

Hendrik Hertzberg writes in The New Yorker: [...] There’s no great mystery about the motives behind this deliberate misnaming. 'Democrat Party' is a slur, or intended to be—a handy way to express contempt. Aesthetic judgments are subjective, of course, but 'Democrat Party' is jarring verging on ugly. It fairly screams 'rat'.|$|R
500|$|Barbara Ehrenreich called Barr {{a working-class}} {{spokesperson}} representing [...] "the hopeless underclass {{of the female}} sex: polyester-clad, overweight occupants of the slow track; fast-food waitresses, factory workers, housewives, members of the invisible pink-collar army; the despised, the jilted, the underpaid," [...] but a master of [...] "the kind of class-militant populism <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> most of them anyway, never seem to get right."

500|$|After President Obama's 2011 State of the Union Address, Moran {{was interviewed}} by Alhurra, an Arab {{television}} network.
