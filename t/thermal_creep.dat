50|$|A superalloy, or {{high-performance}} alloy, is an alloy that exhibits {{several key}} characteristics: excellent mechanical strength, resistance to <b>thermal</b> <b>creep</b> deformation, good surface stability, {{and resistance to}} corrosion or oxidation. The crystal structure is typically face-centered cubic austenitic. Examples of such alloys are Hastelloy, Inconel, Waspaloy, Rene alloys, Haynes alloys, Incoloy, MP98T, TMS alloys, and CMSX single crystal alloys.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} of single crystal solids is in materials {{science in the}} production of high strength materials with low <b>thermal</b> <b>creep,</b> such as turbine blades. Here, the absence of grain boundaries actually gives a decrease in yield strength, but more importantly decreases the amount of creep which is critical for high temperature, close tolerance part applications.|$|E

The mechanism is not enhanced diffusivities, as would be intuitive from the elevated temperature, but rather interaction between the stress and the developing microstructure. Stress induces the nucleation of loops, and causes preferential absorption of interstitials at dislocations, which results in swelling.

50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential <b>thermal</b> <b>creep,</b> which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in <b>thermal</b> <b>creep.</b> No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper wire terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|E

40|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>creep</b> and {{relaxation}} of prestressing steel {{are crucial to}} the permanent loss of prestress in post-tensioned concrete structures after fire. Harmathy’s creep model is widely used {{to account for the}} irrecoverable <b>thermal</b> <b>creep</b> strain. In view of advances in steel manufacture, it is desirable to determine the relevant parameters of Harmathy’s creep model for common prestressing steel being used. Recently, Gales et al. found that the creep parameters obtained by Harmathy and Stanzak in the 1970 s were out of date as the use of these parameters could not give accurate numerical results. They further identified the parameters through testing of prestressing steel to ASTM A 417. This study further extended the work of Gales et al. Based on the steady state <b>thermal</b> <b>creep</b> {{and relaxation}} tests of prestressing steel to GB/T 5224 (Grade 1860) and BS 5896 (Grade 1860) over wide stress ranges, the parameters of Harmathy’s <b>thermal</b> <b>creep</b> model were identified and calibrated.

Rarefied flows characterized by the Knudsen number {{in the range of}} 0 ≤ Kn ≤ 0. 1 are analyzed in detail for <b>thermal</b> <b>creep</b> effects in square cross-section microchannels with constant wall temperature boundary condition. Axial conduction becomes important for very low Reynolds number flows thereby enhancing the <b>thermal</b> <b>creep</b> effect. Three dimensional numerical simulations are conducted for simultaneously developing flows at very low Reynolds numbers in the range of 0. 2 ≤ Re ≤ 5. Extended inlet boundary conditions are used to avoid entrance region singularity and also to account for axial heat conduction near the entrance.
