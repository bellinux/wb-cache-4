50|$|Swing axles were supplanted {{in general}} use by De Dion <b>tube</b> <b>axles</b> {{in the late}} 1960s, though live axles {{remained}} the most common. Most rear suspensions {{have been replaced by}} more modern independent suspensions in recent years, and both swing and deDion types are virtually unused today.|$|R
50|$|The Jeep XJ {{utilizes}} {{front and}} rear solid (live) axles as opposed to independent {{front and rear}} axles. This configuration allows the XJ to have superior off-road capability and performance {{at the expense of}} some on-road comfort and driveability. Mid-1985 and later two-wheel drive models used the same basic suspension with a single <b>tube</b> connecting <b>axle</b> ends with no differential.|$|R
30|$|In the {{previous}} work, the effective parameters of (5, 0) and (5, 5) SWCNTs during the interaction with CO 2 as sensors were determined [32]. The interaction of CO 2 molecules and its rotation around <b>tube</b> <b>axles</b> vertically and parallel to {{internal and external}} walls of the nanotubes were studied using Gaussian 03 coding by density functional theory (DFT) at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G level of theory. The carbon dioxide molecule was predicted to bind only weakly to nanotubes, and the tube-molecule interactions can be identified as physisorption. CO 2 adsorption is stronger on the external walls than on internal walls, and adsorption on the external wall of (5, 0) is stronger than on the external wall of (5, 5); the adsorption energies are exothermic. In the present study, the interaction of hydrogen sulfide with the {{inside and outside of}} (5, 0) and (5, 5) SWCNT is investigated.|$|R

50|$|Straight axle — {{term for}} a car (often a gasser) that has had it stock A-arm style front {{suspension}} removed for leaf springs and a solid <b>tube</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Peyret had fixed {{tailskid}} {{landing gear}} with its mainwheels and associated bungee shock absorbers on a single, steel <b>tube</b> <b>axle</b> mounted on V-struts, wire cross-braced to each other, {{from the lower}} longerons.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to normal}} layout, portal axles enable {{the vehicle to}} gain a higher ground clearance, as both the <b>axle</b> <b>tube</b> and {{differential}} casing are tucked up higher under the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Every Dana 60 {{that was}} {{originally}} manufactured by Dana Corp (i.e. not aftermarket) is stamped with a build date and {{bill of materials}} {{on the back of}} the right hand <b>axle</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|R
50|$|The AC model {{began in}} 1967 and {{came with a}} 1438 cc twin cam, 4-speed gearbox (the option of a 5-speed item {{appearing}} in mid-'67), front and rear anti-roll bars and a torque <b>tube</b> rear <b>axle.</b> It featured a 120 mph speedo, three supplementary gauges, a faux wood steering wheel, a woodgrain dash and console top, as well as tail lights shared with the Lamborghini Espada and Iso Rivolta.|$|R
5000|$|The 250F principally {{used the}} SSG 220 bhp (@ 7400 rpm) 2.5-litre Maserati A6 straight-six engine, ribbed 13.4" [...] drum brakes, {{wishbone}} {{independent front suspension}} and a De Dion <b>tube</b> <b>axle.</b> It was built by Gioacchino Colombo, Vittorio Bellentani and Alberto Massimino; the tubular work was by Valerio Colotti.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The iconic [...] "T-bucket" [...] custom. Exposed {{engine is}} {{virtually}} mandatory, as are flat windshield, headers, and open pipes. Soft top (shown) is optional. Also features chrome five-spokes, dropped <b>tube</b> <b>axle,</b> transverse front leaf spring, front disc brakes, open-face aircleaner, Weiand valve covers, and single 4-barrel (probably a QJ).|$|E
5000|$|Most {{models of}} the Kawasaki MULE line of utility {{vehicles}} feature a leaf sprung DeDion rear suspension with a distinctively curved <b>tube</b> <b>axle</b> that clears the rear subframe to provide 50mm of wheel travel. [...] Benefits include simplicity, durability, compactness and a relatively low liftover height for the cargo bed.|$|E
5000|$|The 300 {{series was}} unusual in having the gearbox mounted to the De Dion <b>tube</b> rear <b>axle</b> as a transaxle, with the 2 liter models having the {{driveshaft}} enclosed in a [...] "torque tube". The rear-mounted gearbox helped with weight distribution but {{resulted in an}} unusually large transmission tunnel, especially by comparison with then-contemporary front wheel drive competitors such as the Mk. III Ford Escort and the Opel Kadett E/Mk. II Vauxhall Astra.|$|R
50|$|In March 1969, Opel {{introduced}} {{a new line of}} KAD models with new bodies and a more sophisticated chassis with a De Dion <b>tube</b> rear <b>axle.</b> These cars were slightly smaller than their predecessors. While the lesser models (Opel Kapitän and Admiral) were also available with a carburetted 2.8 l-inline six, the Diplomat could be had with either a fuel-injected version of this engine (Diplomat E) or with Chevrolet´s 327-V8 (Diplomat V8), now coupled to a 3-speed Turbo-Hydramatic.|$|R
5000|$|Bolt-on Portals (or drop boxes) are {{a housing}} {{with a set}} of gears which bolts onto the final flange of the <b>axle</b> <b>tube.</b> This {{approach}} allows existing vehicles to be converted to portals without modifying the axles (Volvo C303 or Unimog 404).|$|R
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} and Variomatic was completely redesigned, learning from DAF's experience in Formula Three racing. The Variomatic {{was much more}} robust and now incorporated a differential for smoother low speed maneuvering. The unpredictable swing axle {{rear suspension}} of the 44 and 55 was changed to a leaf sprung De Dion <b>tube</b> <b>axle,</b> which greatly improved handling and comfort.|$|E
5000|$|Rear suspension: Torsion bars {{acting on}} {{trailing}} link-arms and joined and pivoted (between torsion bar ends) diagonal semi-trailing arms, described as [...] "semi-independent"; This gave similar geometry but less unsprung weight than a solid (<b>tube)</b> <b>axle.</b> The axle a continuous tube between rear wheel spindles, V-shaped and fastened {{in the center}} by a rubber bushing mounted on the subframe cross member. The torsion bars in sets of three, one set for {{each side of the}} rear axle. No antisway bar.|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} {{parameters of}} (5, 0) and (5, 5) single-wall carbon nanotubes during the interaction with carbon dioxide as sensors are determined. The interaction {{of carbon dioxide}}  molecules with internal and external walls of the nanotubes is studied using Gaussian 03 coding by density functional theory (DFT) at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G level of theory. CO 2 rotation around <b>tube</b> <b>axles</b> vertically and parallel to {{the internal and external}} walls has been investigated. The carbon dioxide molecule is predicted to bind only weakly to nanotubes, and the tube-molecule interactions can be identified as physisorption. CO 2 adsorption is stronger on external wallsthan on internal walls, and adsorption on the external wall of (5, 0) is stronger than on the external wall of (5, 5); the adsorption energies are exothermic and equal to - 0. 8884 and - 0. 0528 kcal/mol, respectively. The rotation energy barrier for (5, 5) is lower than that for (5, 0) in all rotations, therefore in these interactions (5, 5) is more active. The energy gap significantly changes in the presence of  carbon  dioxide molecules on the inside surface of (5, 0) and the electric conductivity is affected, but no remarkable change is observed in the electronic structure of (5, 5) ...|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the rapid}} {{development}} program, the Loyd used parts from other vehicles: From the Universal Carrier, the track, drive sprockets, and Horstmann suspension units; from the Fordson 7V, the chassis, engine, gearbox, torque <b>tube</b> and front <b>axle.</b> The brake drums and back plates were designed specifically for the Loyd.|$|R
5000|$|The styling of the Cord 810 was {{the work}} of {{designer}} Gordon M. Buehrig and his team of stylists, which included young Vince Gardner and Alex Tremulis. While the first American front-wheel-drive car with independent front suspension, it had an archaic <b>tube</b> rear <b>axle</b> with semi-elliptic rear springs. Power came from a [...] Lycoming V8 of the same [...] as the L-29. The semi-automatic four-speed transmission (three plus overdrive) extended in front of the engine, like on a Traction Avant. This allowed Buehrig to dispense with the driveshaft and transmission tunnel; as a result, the new car was so low it required no running boards. It had a 125 in wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|For 1977, Jeep J-10 pickups {{included}} Dana's manual four-wheel-drive system, a {{more powerful}} 258 CID L six-cylinder engine, and heavier <b>axle</b> <b>tubes,</b> while power front disc brakes became standard equipment and the considerably greater GWV capacity J-20s included AMC's 360 CID L V8 engine. The 401 CID L engine was optional, as well as full-time Quadra-Trac and both automatic and manual transmissions.|$|R
50|$|Pro Arena Trucks {{are usually}} seen at Monster Truck events, and are rarely run as an {{independent}} event. Some Arena Trucks are {{owned and operated by}} Monster Truck teams. Arena Trucks are usually pickup trucks that have been upgraded to resist the rigors of arena track off-roading. By contrast, a modern Monster Truck is a large-scale methanol-fueled <b>tube</b> frame, solid <b>axle</b> vehicle with fiberglass exteriors designed to resemble a pickup truck.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle had {{air-cooled}} four-cylinder OHC boxer-type {{engine of}} the SUV Type 82 with 2490 cc engine capacity and [...] The front-mounted engine drove through a single-disc dry clutch and a four-speed transmission with synchronized 3rd and 4th Gear to the rear wheels. The attainable speed was 90 km/h. The chassis had a central <b>tube,</b> a front <b>axle</b> with Transverse leaf spring and oscillating rear axles, also with a Transverse leaf spring.|$|R
50|$|Portal axles (or portal gear) are an offroad {{technology}} {{where the}} <b>axle</b> <b>tube</b> {{is above the}} center of the wheel hub and where there is a reduction gearbox in the hub. This gives two advantages: ground clearance is increased, particularly beneath the low-slung differential housing of the main axles; and secondly the hub gearing allows the axle halfshafts to drive the same power but at reduced torque (by using higher shaft speed). This reduces load on the axle crownwheel and differential.|$|R
50|$|At high mileages, this {{is prone}} to wear of the axle {{mounting}} bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm <b>axle</b> <b>tubes,</b> requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly. The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R
50|$|In mid-1985, a two-wheel-drive {{version of}} the Cherokee {{was added to the}} lineup. This marked the first time any Jeep product was offered with two-wheel drive since 1967, and was done in the hopes of {{attracting}} a few more buyers who did not need (or want to pay for) four-wheel drive. When the XJ Cherokee-based Comanche (MJ) truck was introduced, it was also available in two- and four-wheel drive. The new two-wheel-drive models shared the front suspension (from the track bar, control arms, ball joints) with four-wheel-drive models. Jeep simply used a single <b>axle</b> <b>tube</b> from hub to hub with no differential between, resulting in an inexpensive front suspension.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flail mower}} gets {{its name from}} the use of [...] "flails" [...] {{attached}} to its rotating horizontal drum (also called <b>tube,</b> rotor, or <b>axle).</b> Many implement companies also refer to the flails as knives or blades. The rows of flails are usually staggered to provide a complete cut. The flails are attached to the drum using chain links or brackets, depending on the manufacturer. The rotating drum is perpendicular to the axis of the tractor. The PTO driveshaft along the tractor's axis must make a right angle {{through the use of a}} gearbox in order to transfer its rotational energy to the drum. As the drum rotates, centrifugal force pushes the flails outward.|$|R
5000|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 60 is an {{automotive}} axle {{manufactured by}} Dana Holding Corporation {{and used in}} OEM pickup and limited passenger car applications by Chevrolet, Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, Ford and Land Rover. Various construction companies use this axle. There are front and rear versions of the Dana 60. It can be readily identified by its straight <b>axle</b> <b>tubes,</b> 10 bolt asymmetrical cover, and a [...] "60" [...] cast in to the housing. Gross axle weight ratings are often lowered by the vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons. They are also lowered to reduce loads on other powertrain components such as transmissions and transfer cases.Dana 60 Axles are also increasingly swapped into many custom offroad applications to accommodate larger tires and deep compound gearing with locking differentials.|$|R
5000|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 70 is an {{automotive}} axle {{manufactured by}} Dana Holding Corporation {{and has been}} used in OEM heavy duty applications by Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford. It can be identified by its straight <b>axle</b> <b>tubes,</b> 10 bolt asymmetrical cover, and a [...] "70" [...] cast in to the housing and is visually similar to the Dana 60. The majority of the Dana 70s are rear axles, however Dana 70 front axles do exist. Both front and rear axle variations were first offered in 1957. The Dana 70 is generally regarded to have more strength than a Dana 60 {{but not as much as}} a Dana 80. Gross axle weight ratings are often lowered by the vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal single axis {{trackers}} {{are typically}} used for large distributed generation projects and utility scale projects. The combination of energy improvement and lower product cost and lower installation complexity results in compelling economics in large deployments. In addition the strong afternoon performance is particularly desirable for large grid-tied photovoltaic systems so that production will match the peak demand time. Horizontal single axis trackers also add {{a substantial amount}} of productivity during the spring and summer seasons when the Sun is high in the sky. The inherent robustness of their supporting structure and the simplicity of the mechanism also result in high reliability which keeps maintenance costs low. Since the panels are horizontal, they can be compactly placed on the <b>axle</b> <b>tube</b> without danger of self-shading and are also readily accessible for cleaning.|$|R
25|$|The 2013 models gain a new {{front end}} sheet metal along with {{standard}} HID headlamps, {{along with a}} new LED tail light assembly. Performance changes include twin fuel pumps (a Mustang GT’s single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec 6060 six-speed with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft. Larger Brembo front disc brakes with six-piston calipers, reinforced <b>axle</b> <b>tubes,</b> and aero tweaks to help the car reach 200+mph safely. Ford says the changes {{have resulted in a}} 14-percent reduction in drag and a 66-percent increase in front-end downforce. Also new for 2013 is a larger front anti-roll bar and retuned springs. An rpm-adjustable electronic launch-control function is standard, as is four-mode electronic stability control.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, Jeep used {{a unique}} Dana 44 IFS setup, that was short lived. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ford used {{a form of}} IFS known as [...] "Twin Traction Beam" [...] (TTB). This Dana 44 had no <b>axle</b> <b>tubes</b> but {{attached}} to the driver side traction beam, which also acted as a cover plate, and had [...] "open air" [...] axles which traveled through the beams to the spindles. The axles had u-joints {{to allow for the}} independent action of the beams. Individual pivot points for the beams at greater than center made each beam longer than half the overall width crossing in the middle. This allowed for an independent front suspension design. Ford TTB Dana 44 axles all utilized locking hubs. The TTB set-up is based on Ford's highly successful Twin I-beam design on two-wheel-drive pick-up truck models.|$|R
40|$|Portal axles (or portal gear) are an offroad {{technology}} {{where the}} <b>axle</b> <b>tube</b> {{is above the}} center of the wheel hub and where there is a reduction gearbox in the hub. It is the shaft which must tough and strong, since composite materials have promising properties, which can reduce the weight and almost equal to conventional material properties. In this paper portal axle shaft analyzed by Finite Element Analysis considering three different composite materials and varying parameters. i. e rib thickness and hollow shaft thickness are consider. Some of the parameters are kept constant they are depth of spokes, rib fillet radius, number of spokes. Torsional strength of the shaft compared for three different materials. When Rib Thickness are varied Deformation and Stresses are almost same for Kelvar/Epoxy and Boron/Epoxy materials but varied for E Glass/Polyester Resin. Similarly When Shaft Thickness is varied the results are same for Kelvar/Epoxy and Boron/Epoxy but varied for E Glass/Polyester Resin material...|$|R
