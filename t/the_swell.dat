5|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside <b>the</b> <b>swell.</b> At the summit is another view area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of <b>the</b> <b>swell</b> until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to <b>the</b> <b>swell.</b> The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down. About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of <b>the</b> <b>swell,</b> the San Rafael Reef. Just as the highway exits <b>the</b> <b>swell</b> it passes {{to the north of}} Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits <b>the</b> <b>swell</b> near Green River.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-70 the San Rafael Swell was relatively inaccessible and not well known or explored. There were, however, a few efforts to protect <b>the</b> <b>swell</b> as early as 1935. Since {{the construction}} of the freeway the number of visitors to <b>the</b> <b>swell</b> has increased significantly, as <b>the</b> <b>swell</b> can now be accessed by automobile. As such, several groups are increasing efforts for protected status of the area, via National Park, National Monument or wilderness designation.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} <b>the</b> <b>swell</b> behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath <b>the</b> <b>swell,</b> as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Interstate Highway System was in the {{planning}} stages, no paved road had yet entered the San Rafael Swell. The established highway through the area was US-6/US-50 which, like the railroad, entered Utah from Colorado and turned north around <b>the</b> <b>swell.</b>|$|E
5|$|Currently most of <b>the</b> <b>swell</b> is {{administered}} by the BLM and is not given special consideration.

At the ceremony the mayors of cities recently made neighbors, including Grand Junction, Colorado, introduced themselves. Then Governor Calvin L. Rampton noted that I-70 was the longest road the U.S. had built over a completely new route since the Alaska Highway, during World War II. It was also noted this was the longest piece of the Interstate Highway System to open at a given time.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed.

5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by <b>the</b> <b>swell</b> as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.|$|E

At high tide, small swells will be more prevalent, creating barrels.|$|R
5|$|In 1979 Peter Galton and James A. Jensen {{described}} a fragmentary femur {{belonging to a}} hadrosauroid discovered in Arches National Park. Utah. Various hadrosauroid teeth had also been found in quarries of small vertebrates in the western region of the San Rafael Swell, near Castle Dale in Emery County, Utah; they were described in 1991 by J. Michael Parrish. Subsequently, in 1993, Carole Jones and her husband Ramal Jones discovered fragmentary bones in a fossil site located in the northwestern region of <b>the</b> <b>Swell.</b> They brought the site {{to the attention of}} Donald Burge, director of the institution then called the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum (CEUM). The site, which is formally known as CEUM Locality 42em366v, would subsequently be named Carol's Site (sic) in her honour. The fossils, stored under the specimen number CEUM 9758, represent the partial remains of an adult hadrosauroid, including parts of the skull, vertebrae, ischium, and leg. CEUM 5212, a partial skull and forelimb from an adult, was found nearby in CEUM Locality 42em369v. CEUM 8786, a left femur from an adult, was discovered later in Carol's Site, and was not described until 2012.|$|E
