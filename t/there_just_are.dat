50|$|Adam T. Holland (D) {{has served}} as the {{extremely}} over-qualified Mayor of the Town of Oak Grove since his election in 2014. The townspeople are most fortunate to have such a progressive, youthful, diligent, faithful and humble public servant working so hard on their behalf. Indeed, <b>there</b> <b>just</b> <b>are</b> not enough positive adjectives in Webster's dictionary to describe this up and coming politician. With Holland's masterful understanding of politics, he could easily use the mayor's office as a stepping stone to further his political career, as many have urged him to seek such high offices as United States Congressman for the 5th District of Louisiana, others have suggested he would make a fine United States Senator, and countless others have begged Holland to apply his political skill to benefit the entire state and serve as Governor of Louisiana. This has caused much concern from the individuals who hold these offices, as they recognize they would be soundly defeated by such a masterful politician. However, Holland has indicated that serving Oak Grove as mayor has been his boyhood dream, amongst other things, and he intends to serve as mayor of Oak Grove until 2082, at which time he will be the longest serving mayor {{in the history of the}} United States, and only then will he consider retiring, but acknowledges he will most likely seek another four year term.|$|E
40|$|Ultimately, this {{association}} of genius and brilliance with our profession is misleading. Extreme intelligence or technical skills are good to have, {{but they are}} certainly not prerequisites to {{join the ranks of}} our profession. It takes only one time at a mathematics department meeting to see that logical fallacies, hyperbole, and inconsistencies find a comfortable home among mathematicians, too, as they argue vehemently about small and irrelevant matters. More seriously, there are more than thirty thousand members of the American Mathematical Society; it would be a stretch to assume all are geniuses. Many working as actuaries or insurance agents or software developers or teachers or researchers self-identify as mathematicians. <b>There</b> <b>just</b> <b>are</b> a great many of us.

40|$|<b>There</b> <b>just</b> <b>are</b> a few {{professional}} scientific statements {{concerning the}} natural environment at the outside of Cologne Cathedral. These statements are set forth and inspected in order to their explainability towards students and people not having biological expertise or knowledge. Multiple scientific studies are enforced as well. The thesis also contains didactical designs concerning the ecology of Cologne Cathedral. Therefore several qualitative interviews have been done to find the perfect solution for each of those designs. Existing, rich nature always {{played an important role}} for humans - and so it is in the city. But nature in urban areas mostly isn‘t honored as much as nature at the countryside. The mentioned didactic designs are composed for receivers of all ages to show the ecological facts about Cologne Cathedral as clearly as possible. The created material is designed to provide a realistic recognization of typical organisms in the urban areas and, furthermore, to understand the ecological functions of the organisms...|$|E

40|$|The most {{frequent}} complaint of operators in modern computer-based control rooms is that <b>there</b> <b>just</b> <b>are</b> not enough video display units (VDUs). In this paper {{we examine the}} basis for this concern and {{try to understand the}} technical and historical reasons for this complaint, and its implications for the design of complex human-machine systems, including the number of VDUs in the control room. The overall aim of our work is to develop human factors guidance for the review of computer-based and modernized control rooms in nuclear power plants. As part of these efforts we have conducted literature reviews and studies using both simulators and actual systems in a broad range of industries, including process control, aerospace, medical, and others. Our findings reflect the general complaint of operators across all these industries: <b>there</b> <b>just</b> <b>are</b> not enough VDUs in the control room. We conclude that there are three primary reasons for this complaint. First, as part of a workload management strategy, operators frequently avoid interface management tasks and do not access all the information available, preferring instead to use a fixed set of familiar displays that provide much (but not all) of the information needed. Performance thereby becomes data limited and operators complain {{that they do not have}} a sufficient number of VDUs to set up in the early phases of a high-workload period so they can get all the information they need. Second, display designs are typically not designed with operator tasks in mind. The most common method of representing information is by functions and systems. Since tasks typically cut across many systems, operators need many displays. Thus, to make task performance easier operators need additional VDUs. Finally, there is a differing ''concept of operations'' between designers and operators. Modern computer-based control rooms are designed with vast amounts of data, available through hundreds of displays, viewed by the operator through a limited number of display devices. Designers expect that operators will use the flexibility of the computer-based interfaces to configure them in such a way that they are ideally tailored to the unique demands of the current situation. However, operators usually do not do that and instead configure the interfaces in a spatially dedicated way. Thus, while the number of VDUs may seem reasonable to the designer, it is not to the operator who is attempting to minimize the interface management aspects of workload. The implications of these findings for design are discussed in terms of the need for a method for determining the number of displays, task-relevant displays, data-dense displays, and enhanced interface management design and training...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} beliefs may be stake-sensitive is explored. This {{is the idea}} that the {{strength}} with which a single, persistent belief is held may vary and depend upon what the believer takes to be at stake. The stakes in question are tied to the truth of the belief—not, as in Pascal’s wager and other cases, to the belief’s presence. Categorical beliefs and degrees of belief are considered; both kinds of account typically exclude the idea and treat belief as stake-invariant, though an exception is briefly described. The role of the assumption of stake-invariance in familiar accounts of degrees of belief is also discussed, and morals are drawn concerning finite and countable Dutch book arguments. “Having any definite degree of belief implies a certain measure of consistency, namely willingness to bet on a given proposition at the same odds for any stake…” F. P. Ramsey, “Truth and probability, ” 1926 Suppose that Ramsey was mistaken about this. What would that mean? Perhaps that <b>there</b> <b>just</b> <b>are</b> no ‘definite degrees of belief ’ of the sort he had in mind. Or if there are, that a person might have one, yet have inconstant willingness to bet on its content, depending on what is at stake. The first alternative, that definite degrees of belief do not exist, is the point or a consequence of any number of critiques of the family of accounts of partial belief that descend from Ramsey’s and de Finetti’s work. 2 The second alternative is the one I explore in this paper...|$|E
