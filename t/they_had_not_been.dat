5|$|During May 2009, {{the repairs}} were {{reported}} to be almost complete and new sea trials were planned for 15–20 June. By October 2009, the work had still not been completed due to the shipyard's electrical supply having been disconnected. Nikolay Povzyk, {{the head of the}} shipyard, complained <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> paid the 1.9 billion roubles (63.8 million dollars) owed for the work carried out on Nerpa.|$|E

The Progressive-Historical {{coalition}} was rechristened as the Liberal Party (the third bloc bearing this name in Brazil's history). Its most radical wing would declare itself republican in 1870—an ominous signal to the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|All the {{structures}} in Old Yosemite Village, {{except for the}} chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, even though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority {{was thought to be}} the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E
5|$|Although the appellants {{argued that}} natural justice had been {{breached}} because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> consulted {{prior to the}} issuance of the orders, the High Court observed that where the public interest is at stake the English courts have held that principles of natural justice must apply in a modified manner. In a 1977 case, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle {{did not need to}} be complied with if the public interest so demanded.|$|E

5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> able to fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, on the grounds that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. The brutality of the incident was embarrassing for the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered the massacre, was forced to resign. The massacre helped create greater sympathy for the Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sector}} of Longwy, Sedan and Namur, where the Ardennes and the River Meuse meet, the French Ninth Army and French Second Army were made up chiefly of poor quality divisions. Reinforcements were minimal, and those units were {{equipped}} with obsolete weapons. The resources at {{the disposal of}} the two Series B divisions, the 55th and later 71s Infantry Divisions, who were to bear the brunt of the attack, were weak. They had almost no Regular officers and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> broken-in to war conditions by being in contact with the enemy.|$|E

5|$|Shoup opposed {{military}} action against Cuba, warning against any attempt to intervene militarily against Fidel Castro. He was initially not involved or aware of {{the plans for the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. He was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to furnish an officer, but became furious when he learned the CIA was requisitioning Marine supplies without his permission. He finally learned the intent of the CIA when the officer, Colonel Jack Hawkins, contacted him {{on the night of the}} invasion, pleading with him to appeal to Kennedy for air support. Following the failure of the operation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were blamed, which Shoup thought was unfair, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> aware of the early planning.|$|E
5|$|Whales {{were once}} {{uncommon}} in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, but {{have increased their}} presence in both waters as global populations have recovered. Recent increases within the Mediterranean basin, including re-sightings, indicate that more whales may migrate into the inland sea in the future, not only for wintering but also for feeding. Humpbacks are also showing signs of re-expanding into former ranges, such as Scotland, Skagerrak and Kattegat, as well as Scandinavian fjords such as Kvænangen, where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> observed for decades.|$|E
5|$|Although William's {{supporters}} {{dominated the}} government, there remained a significant following for James, {{particularly in the}} Highlands. His cause, which became known as Jacobitism, from the Latin (Jacobus) for James, led {{to a series of}} risings. An initial Jacobite military attempt was led by John Graham, now Viscount Dundee. His forces, almost all Highlanders, defeated William's forces at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, but they took heavy losses and Dundee was slain in the fighting. Without his leadership the Jacobite army was soon defeated at the Battle of Dunkeld. The complete defeat of James in Ireland by William at the Battle of Aughrim (1691), ended {{the first phase of the}} Jacobite military effort. In the aftermath of the Jacobite defeat on 13 February 1692 in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, on the grounds that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs.|$|E

5|$|In January 2014, Elite Systems, who {{produced}} a successful range of {{software for the}} original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices such as the iPad. The company provided a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund the project, which would be compatible with games already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original 1980s game software that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> paid for the content. Later that year, a £100 Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on IndieGogo, with the apparent backing of Clive Sinclair as an investor, but without a full keyboard and manufactured in a limited capacity.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence. It later arose that the majority of the people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in self-defence. The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{speculation}} about potential medal winners before the Games focused on athletes from Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. Athletes from German-speaking countries had traditionally been {{dominant in the}} sliding sports, luge and bobsleigh, but following the re-introduction of skeleton, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> as strongly competitive in the new sport. Mellisa Hollingsworth of Canada, the defending Olympic bronze medalist, won the 2009-10 Skeleton World Cup, and was considered a strong contender if not the favorite to win. British athlete Shelley Rudman won the only British medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics with her silver in skeleton, and her bronze medal at the European Championships {{just prior to the}} Games kept her name in media previews of the Olympic event. Her countrywoman Amy Williams, however, finished outside of the medal places in both the World Cup, in which she placed fifth, and the European Championships, in which she placed sixth. American Noelle Pikus-Pace {{had not been able to}} compete in the 2006 Games after a runaway bobsleigh had broken her leg.|$|E

5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Savaric {{went with}} Henry's son and {{successor}} King Richard I on crusade, {{and it was}} while they both were in Sicily that Savaric obtained his bishopric. In December 1191 he was elected Bishop of Bath. Savaric's election was held under controversial conditions, for Savaric had obtained from Richard I letters allowing Savaric to be elected to the next available bishopric. When Savaric's cousin Reginald was elected to Canterbury in 1191, Reginald went to Bath and pressed the clergy there to select Savaric as Reginald's successor. On {{the strength of the}} letters from Richard, the justiciar Walter de Coutances ratified the election of Savaric. The canons of Wells objected because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> consulted, but Savaric was ordained a priest on 19 September 1192 at Rome. He was consecrated bishop there on 20 September 1192 by the Bishop of Albano. He went on the Third Crusade with Richard.|$|E
5|$|While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented {{soldiers}} {{began to}} pose {{a danger to the}} young United States. Most of the army was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> paid in eight months. Furthermore, the Continental officers had been promised, in May 1778, after Valley Forge, a pension of half their pay when they were discharged. By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers. In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. Alexander McDougall. The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life. Congress rejected the proposal.|$|E
