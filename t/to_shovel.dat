5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week <b>to</b> <b>shovel</b> 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough <b>to</b> <b>shovel</b> up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Riiser-Larsen's {{years of}} polar {{exploration}} began in 1925 when his compatriot Roald Amundsen, the famed polar explorer, {{asked him to}} be his deputy and pilot for an attempt to fly over the North Pole. Riiser-Larsen agreed and secured the use of two Dornier Do J Wal seaplanes. The expedition, however, was forced to land close to the Pole, badly damaging one of the planes. After twenty-six days on an ice shelf, first trying <b>to</b> <b>shovel</b> tons of snow to create an airstrip, until someone suggested the easier way of tramping the snow surface, the expedition's six members squeezed themselves into the remaining plane.

25|$|On 21 January 1942, Jim Crawford {{enlisted in}} the Australian Army Medical Corps. Crawford wanted to enlist earlier {{but he had not}} been {{medically}} fit. When Crawford grew tired of peeling spuds he was discharged in September and worked as a stoker in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, serving aboard mine-sweepers guarding the B.H.P steel works at Whyalla. While working as a stoker, Crawford founded a Worker's study group. Crawford also spoke at War Loan Rallies. At one rally he spoke on a platform with future Australian Prime Minister, Harold Holt, who shouted Crawford to a double whisky after his speech. Jim was charged with mutiny for organising to stop work of naval stokers until they were paid trade union rates. They stood firm and gained the Union rates they were after, however, Crawford was transferred to New Guinea to the Naval Depot HMS Ladava. In 1944, he experienced the bombing by the Japanese in New Guinea. He also served aboard an Icelandic fishing trawler converted to minesweeper HMS Beryl. While working on the minesweeper Crawford had <b>to</b> <b>shovel</b> coal into the furnace. This coal shovelling had caused permanent damage to Crawford's lungs and he developed emphysema. In January, 1945, he was discharged from the navy with a pension as he was suffering from a duodenal ulcer. Once discharged from the navy, he arrived back in Melbourne and wrote for large newspapers, such as the Sporting Globe and the Melbourne Guardian. He worked for the Melbourne Guardian for ten years, writing mostly about political issues.|$|E

Booker responded by tweeting, [...] "I will do it myself; where does he live?" [...] Other people volunteered, including one person who offered his help on Twitter, and 20 minutes later Booker and some volunteers showed up and shoveled the man's driveway. On April 12, 2012, Booker saved a woman from a house fire, suffering smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on his hands in the process. Newark Fire Chief John Centanni said that Booker's actions possibly saved the woman's life. After Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the shoreline areas of New Jersey and New York in late October 2012, Booker invited Newarkers without power to eat and sleep in his home. In February 2013, responding to a Twitter post, Booker helped a nervous constituent propose to his girlfriend.

500|$|The Beatles did {{not attend}} Epstein's funeral, both to allow his family some privacy, and to avoid {{attracting}} fans and the media. According to Geoffrey Ellis, chief executive of NEMS Enterprises, George Harrison had given Nat Weiss, Epstein's good friend and confidant, {{the day before the}} funeral a single flower (Ellis remembers it being a chrysanthemum) wrapped in a newspaper on behalf of all four Beatles, with instructions to place the flower on Brian's coffin as a final farewell. However, flowers are forbidden at Jewish funerals and burials. Weiss and Ellis discussed this dilemma while walking back to the grave, where they observed two men beginning <b>to</b> <b>shovel</b> dirt onto the casket. Ellis: [...] "Nat, who himself was Jewish, cast the newspaper package unopened onto Brian's coffin, where it was swiftly covered by earth." [...] Epstein was buried in section A grave H12, in the Long Lane Jewish Cemetery, Aintree, Liverpool. The service at the graveside was held by Rabbi Dr Norman Solomon, who said, disparagingly, that Epstein was [...] "a symbol of the malaise of our generation". A few weeks later, on 17 October, all four Beatles attended a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue in St John's Wood (near Abbey Road Studios), which was officiated by Rabbi Louis Jacobs. The Bee Gees' 1968 song [...] "In the Summer of His Years" [...] was written and recorded as a tribute to Epstein.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, an {{extremely}} high tax burden was imposed on Armenian, Greek and Jewish citizens of Turkey, and tax assessors had {{a free hand}} in determining the amount, often amounts {{that could not be}} paid. In the winter of 1942, hundreds who could not pay, including elderly men, were brought to the town of Aşkale, with very harsh winters, and made <b>to</b> <b>shovel</b> snow continually for as much as five months. Some were able to pay locals to perform the labor for them, and some succumbed to the cold and conditions, sleeping in barns, coffeehouses, or anywhere else they could get shelter. The book [...] "You Rejoice My Heart" [...] by Turkish author Kemal Yalçın includes a visit by the author to Aşkale in the 1990s to learn first hand about the tax and the labor camps, the conditions and the victims at a time when this incident was dangerous and taboo to discuss in Turkey.|$|E

Hill began his cattle promotion with the ‘Great Fat Stock Show’, July 4, 1886 in Devil's Lake, then the far western terminus of the Great Northern Railway. [...] The Great Fat Stock Show was a gala midsummer fair of bronco-busting, horse races, Indian war dances and festivities. [...] Hill needed someone with banking experience to manage the show, and McCreight was “commandeered” to serve as “ticket seller, money counter and banker.” [...] The show was a success and Hill later invited McCreight <b>to</b> <b>shovel</b> the dirt to lay the first railroad tie to the Great Northern Railway transcontinental system from Devils Lake to Seattle, Washington.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{thought that}} by {{analyzing}} work, the [...] "one best way" [...] {{to do it}} would be found. He is most remembered for developing the stopwatch time study, which combined with Frank Gilbreth's motion study methods, later became the field of time and motion study. He broke a job into its component parts and measured each to the hundredth of a minute. One of his most famous studies involved shovels. He noticed that workers used the same shovel for all materials. He determined that the most effective load was 21½ lb, and found or designed shovels that for each material would scoop up that amount. He was generally unsuccessful in getting his concepts applied, and was dismissed from Bethlehem Iron Company/Bethlehem Steel Company. Nevertheless, Taylor was able to convince workers who used shovels and whose compensation was tied to how much they produced to adopt his advice about the optimum way <b>to</b> <b>shovel</b> by breaking the movements down into their component elements and recommending better ways to perform these movements. It was largely {{through the efforts of}} his disciples (most notably H.L. Gantt) that industry came to implement his ideas.
