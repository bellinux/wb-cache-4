5|$|Lack {{of money}} has precluded major improvements, however, and timber {{companies}} have replanted {{much of the}} logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, {{partly due to the}} suppression of forest fires until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since <b>the</b> <b>redwoods</b> were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old-growth forest sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.|$|E

2500|$|In {{retirement}} {{with his}} wife, Ruth Moore, in a family-built house near Point Arena on the Northern California coast, Moore began to assemble poems from five decades, {{and in the}} process kindled a reconnection with the literary world. At the Squaw Valley Writer's Conference, Moore met the poet Brenda Hillman, who encouraged him to submit his poems for publication. Moore's response was indifferent. In 1997 Ruth Moore died. Three years later Moore left Point Arena intending to settle at <b>The</b> <b>Redwoods</b> in Mill Valley. Not prepared for a retirement home, he soon accepted the invitation of a friend to visit Southern California.
