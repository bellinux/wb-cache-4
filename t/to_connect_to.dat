At the western end of the station, a transfer will be built <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> the Harlem–125th Street station of the Metro-North Railroad. An elevator, stairs, and escalators would connect the two stations.|$|E

5|$|At Wardour Street {{station a}} branch {{was to leave}} the main route and head south-east, <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have {{platforms}} on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route was to branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which was to have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions with College Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, Drayton Gardens, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with the DR at Walham Green {{before coming to the}} surface and running parallel with the DR as far as Parsons Green, beyond which the line was <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> the DR. The requests for an extension of time and for the powers to build the DR deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B and the GN were now in common ownership, the bill also sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B to change its name.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of the second road bridge, {{the construction}} of a railway through Perth's southern suburbs to Rockingham and Mandurah became a political issue. The incumbent Liberal State Government proposed building a railway from Kenwick <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> the Kwinana Freeway, running in the centre of the freeway for only part of its journey. The Labor opposition instead wanted to build the railway across the Narrows Bridge and down most of the length of the freeway.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, the Utah Department of Transportation petitioned {{to extend}} US666 {{northwest}} to Richfield, but {{the proposal was}} rejected. The proposed extension followed SR95, SR24, and SR119. A concurrency with US191 would have been routed through Blanding and Monticello <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> {{the rest of the}} route. One of the reasons cited for rejecting the proposal was that portions of SR24 were not built to standards desired for additions to the U.S. Highway System.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, to {{the north}} of Aylesbury, the Buckinghamshire Railway was being built by Sir Harry Verney. The scheme {{consisted}} of a line running roughly south-west to north-east from Oxford to Bletchley, and a line running south-east from Brackley via Buckingham, joining roughly halfway along the Oxford–Bletchley line. The first section opened on 1May1850, and the rest opened on 20May1851. The Buckinghamshire Railway intended to extend the line southwards <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> its station at Aylesbury, but this extension was not built.|$|E

In 1832, the Glens Falls Feeder Canal opened, further improving transportation in Queensbury. Sixteen years later, in 1848, a plank road was built over the old Military Road.|$|E
