5|$|Many topical {{treatments}} for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> dentin surface. Treatment {{of the root}} cause is critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} pathway of endocytic processing {{had also}} been demonstrated wherein certain proteins like fibrinogen and myoglobin can bind as a whole to MHC-II molecules after they are denatured and their disulfide bonds are reduced (breaking the bond by adding hydrogen atoms across it). The proteases then degrade <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> regions of the protein-MHC II-complex.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} ratites, emus have a {{relatively}} low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to {{a higher rate of}} heat loss when standing from <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> underbelly.|$|E

5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase {{got off to}} a quick start by attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's head into <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> turnbuckle and using the Razor's Edge to get the pin.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> cab in bad weather, which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of the}} cab and the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Miners’ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E

After {{back and forth}} action, Carlito removed the padding {{from one of the}} turnbuckles. Benjamin then hit his head on <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> metal while performing a Stinger splash. Carlito pinned Benjamin with a roll-up, allowing Carlito to retain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E

5|$|During summer, the Bay of Bengal {{is subject}} to intense heating, giving rise to humid and {{unstable}} air masses that morph into cyclones. The 1737 Calcutta cyclone, the 1970 Bhola cyclone, and the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone rank among the most powerful cyclones to strike India, devastating the coasts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Widespread death and property destruction are reported every year in <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> coastal states of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. India's western coast, bordering the more placid Arabian Sea, experiences cyclones only rarely; these mainly strike Gujarat and, less frequently, Kerala.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{had also}} been ongoing between the tops (platforms at the {{junction}} of mast and topmast) of the ships, as rival sharpshooters fired upon their opponents and upon sailors on <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> decks below. While the ships were locked together, the British marksmen, led by midshipman William Smith, commander of the fore-top, stormed Chesapeakes fore-top over the yard-arm and killed all the Americans there. Following this, the wind tore the two ships apart, and Chesapeake was blown around the bows of Shannon. This left the British boarders, about fifty-strong, stranded. However, organised resistance aboard the American ship had almost ceased by this time.|$|E
5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay {{at the bottom of}} a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E

5|$|Hearing {{the shots}} from the {{northern}} side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson. However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open. The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover. Five Company soldiers were injured. The resulting skirmish lasted about an hour, by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood.|$|E
5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed directly on <b>the</b> <b>exposed</b> {{surface of the}} brain. This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E
