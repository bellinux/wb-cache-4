But food and ammunition shortages soon forced <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> to disengage on 5 November, thus ending <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> First Phase Campaign. Besides the victory at Unsan, <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> First Phase Campaign also destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division and one regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division at the Battle of Onjong. In return, <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> had suffered 10,700 casualties {{by the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> First Phase Campaign.

5|$|Although the PVA 13th Army had {{a nominal}} {{strength}} of 230,000 men, its actual strength {{during the battle}} could be as low as 150,000 men. The PVA 66th Corps, for example, had only 6,600 men per division {{at the start of}} the battle, as opposed to the expected 10,000 men per division. There were also only one firearm available for every three Chinese soldiers, and the rest were employed as grenade throwers. Because most of <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> howitzers and guns were left behind in Manchuria, mortars were the only artillery support available for <b>the</b> <b>Chinese.</b> For the counteroffensive, the average Chinese soldier were issued with only five days worth of rations and ammunition, and resupply could only be obtained by scavenging on the battlefield. To compensate for its shortcomings, <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> relied extensively on night attacks and infiltrations in order to avoid the UN firepower. The primitive logistics system had also allowed <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> to maneuver over the rough hilly terrains, thus enabled them to by-pass the UN defenses and to surround the isolated UN positions. Because <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> had captured large numbers of Nationalist weapons during <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> Civil War, most of <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> weapons were composed of US made small arms such as the Thompson submachine gun, the M1 Garand rifle, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, the bazooka and the M2 mortar.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00, {{troops of}} <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> 39th Army began a frontal assault on Hill 205, {{signaled}} by drums and whistles.

A number of Rangers were wounded in this attack, including Puckett, who refused evacuation. At 23:00 <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> launched a second attack which was quickly repelled, as was a third attack several minutes later. Both of these attacks were an estimated company in strength. The Rangers inflicted heavy casualties each time {{as a result of}} a well-established defensive perimeter, though the platoon of tanks at the foot of the hill opposite <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> attack were unable to assist the Rangers, as the crews had no experience in night operations. By 23:50 <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> began attacking in greater numbers, with an estimated two companies advancing at a time, moving to within hand grenade range. The Rangers began to run low on ammunition while their casualties continued to mount, and Puckett was wounded again.

Finally, after a year's delay, <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> government did allow the film a limited Chinese release, but only after <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> New Year, so as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market.
