5|$|After {{the failure}} of the 26th Corps at Hagaru-ri, the PVA High Command ordered the 26th and the 27th Corps to chase the {{escaping}} UN force with the 20th Corps blocking the escape route. But with most of the 20th Corps destroyed at Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the only forces between Koto-ri and Hungnam were the remnants of the 58th and the 60th Divisions. In desperation, Song Shi-Lun ordered these troops to dig in at Funchilin Pass while blowing up the vital <b>treadway</b> bridge, hoping the terrain and obstacles would allow the 26th and the 27th Corps {{to catch up with the}} retreating UN forces. The PVA 180th Regiment that occupied Hill 1081 blew up the original concrete bridge and two improvised replacements in succession, believing the bridge was rendered irreparable. In response, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines (1/1) attacked Hill 1081 from the south, and the hill was captured on 9 December after the defenders fought to the last man. At the same time, the 7th Marines and RCT-31 attacked the <b>treadway</b> bridge from the north, only to encounter defenders that were already frozen in their foxholes.|$|E
25|$|III Corps had {{previously}} attached a <b>treadway</b> bridge company to the 9th Armored Division's column, but the 9th needed more bridge-building resources. Over {{the next two}} days, First Army headquarters rounded up three heavy pontoon battalions, the 51st and 291st Engineer Combat Battalions, two <b>treadway</b> companies, and a DUKW amphibious truck company. All were assigned to III Corps and given the task of building two tactical bridges across the Rhine. The two small roads leading into Remagen from the west and south were rapidly choked for miles with hundreds of amphibious trucks, bridging equipment, anti-aircraft batteries, tanks, supply vehicles, trucks with trailers, and thousands of troops who were diverted {{to take advantage of}} the unexpected bridgehead. The approaches to the bridge were frequently backed up with troops waiting for their turn to cross the bridge.|$|E
25|$|In December 1950, after Chinese PLA troops blew up {{a bridge}} at a narrow {{point on the}} {{evacuation}} route between Koto-ri and Hungnam, blocking the withdrawal of U.N. forces, eight U.S. Air Force C-119 Flying Boxcars flown by the 314th Troop Carrier Group. were used to drop portable bridge sections by parachute. The bridge, consisting of eight separate sixteen-foot long, 2,900-pound sections, was dropped one section at a time, using two parachutes on each section. Four of these sections, together with additional wooden extensions were successfully reassembled into a replacement bridge by Marine Corps combat engineers and the US Army 58th Engineer <b>Treadway</b> Bridge Company, enabling U.N. forces to reach Hungnam.|$|E

25|$|On January 1, 1945, Starbird assumed {{command of}} the 1135th Engineer Combat Group. The 1135th Engineer Combat Group {{supported}} the XII Corps assault crossing of the Rhine River on March 22 and 23, 1945. For this operation 18 engineer units were attached to 1135th Engineer Combat Group, and Starbird had the services of 600 storm boats and 300 assault boats. The 1135th Engineer Combat Group built a pontoon bridge over the Danube River on May 4 and then a <b>treadway</b> bridge on May 6. Starbird was awarded the Legion of Merit and second bronze star. He returned to the Operation Division on June 1, 1945.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the season}} started, {{a number of}} Southern League teams, {{including}} Nashville, participated in exhibition games against clubs from the National League. On March 24, the Tigers faced the St. Louis Browns, a 9–0 loss which Nashville forfeited. That April, they participated in a two-game exhibition series against the Baltimore Orioles. In {{the first game of}} the series, Baltimore's George <b>Treadway</b> hit a double, scoring John McGraw in the first inning. Tredway added to their lead with a home run in the sixth. McGraw was hit by a pitch in the eighth and later scored on Harry Stovey's triple. The Orioles outscored Nashville by a final tally of 3–0. During the fourth inning of the next day's game, the umpire was removed due to the Baltimore club disagreeing with some of his calls. He was replaced by Tom Vickery, Nashville's pitcher from the previous day's contest. The game was called in the ninth inning due to darkness, resulting in a tie score (9–9).|$|E
25|$|MTU-20 (Ob'yekt 602) (Tankoviy Mostoukladchik) - T-54 {{converted}} into a bridge-layer tank. It has a twin-treadway superstructure mounted on a modified chassis. Each <b>treadway</b> {{is made up of}} a box-type aluminum girder with a folding ramp attached to both ends to save space while the bridge is in the travel position. The vehicle with the bridge in the traveling position is 11.6 m long. When set up, the bridge is 20 m long. This is an increase of about 62% over that of the older MTU-1. The bridge is launched using the cantilever method. First, the ramps are lowered and fully extended before the treadways are forward with the full load of the bridge resting on the forward support plate during launch. The span is moved out over the launching girder until the far end reaches the far bank. Next, the near end is lowered onto the near bank. This method of launching gives the bridgelayer a low silhouette, which makes it less vulnerable to detection and destruction.|$|E

25|$|The sudden {{capture of}} a {{bridge across the}} Rhine was front-page news in American newspapers. The {{unexpected}} availability of a bridgehead {{on the eastern side}} of the Rhine more than two weeks in advance of the planned crossing allowed Allied high commander Dwight Eisenhower to alter his plans to end the war. The Allies were able to rapidly transport five divisions across the Rhine into the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. The bridge had endured months of aircraft bombing, direct artillery hits, near misses, and deliberate demolition attempts. It finally collapsed at 3:00 pm on 17 March. Twenty-eight American engineers were killed and sixty-three were wounded. But by then U.S. Army combat engineers had finished building a tactical steel <b>treadway</b> bridge and a heavy duty pontoon bridge followed by a Bailey bridge across the Rhine. Over 25,000 troops crossed into Germany before the Americans broke out of the bridgehead on 25 March 1945. This was 18 days after the bridge had been captured. German and American military authorities agreed that capturing the bridge shortened the war. The Ludendorff Bridge was not rebuilt following World War II.|$|E
25|$|An {{attack on}} Stadtilm was {{initiated}} on 12 April by the 1st and 2nd companies {{of the task}} force along with units of the 346th IR. The speed of the attack resulted in a bridge across the Ilm River being captured and the town was taken. The two companies continued moving east towards Rudolstadt, where they began meeting resistance, but by nightfall the southwest part of town had been taken. The next day, {{with the assistance of the}} 346th IR, the attack continued with the goal of capturing an intact bridge across the Saale River but this was not to be. All bridges had been blown so they raced towards Saalfeld, again finding the same conditions. A bridgehead was established and on the 14th the task force crossed the newly erected <b>treadway</b> bridge and headed east towards Peuschen, meeting resistance a few miles west of the town. After losing an M-8 and crew to bazooka fire, the town was taken and the task force bivouaced for the night in Wernburg. Meanwhile, 607th Companies A and C continued to advance with the infantry regiments behind the task force companies, with Co. A moving through Schmorda to Moxa and Co. C crossing the bridge at Weissen, then advancing a few miles before darkness.|$|E

50|$|A {{meeting of}} the company was {{immediately}} called and the following officers elected: Asbury Denoylles foreman; James Creney, assistant forman; James King. Secretary, J. W. Edwards, treasurer. and Lewis R. Mackey, Steward. A truck was purchased shortly afterwards. From 1854 to 1867 the truck was kept in an old shed located where the Methodist church now has its wagon sheds. It was afterwards moved to all old shed in Division Street, where it had its home until 1870. Then it was kept {{for about six months}} in an old shed on West Front street, next to John D. <b>Treadway’s</b> present stable, and then moved to a long one-storied shed on the location of its present home, where it has remained ever since. Up to 1880 the company had had no permanent meeting rooms, holding its meetings here and there, wherever it could hire or beg a room. In 1880 the village erected the building it now occupies. From June 1853, to April 1864, no meetings were held on account of inability to get rooms. Its first fire service was on September 5, 1854, at the burning of a barn near (Garnerville where it performed excellent service as a bucket brigade. Up to 1859 it had been an independent company owning its apparatus and accouterments.
