500|$|Robinson's {{promotion}} met {{a generally}} positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players. However, racial tension {{existed in the}} Dodger clubhouse. Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, [...] "I do not care if <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And {{if any of you}} cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded." ...|$|E

[...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels— and it allows you to figure out who <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is.</b> Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look at it and you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E

500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically {{we are like}} twin brothers". Max {{also said that he}} talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what I asked him to do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We had no idea who <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is,</b> he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E
500|$|Urlacher dislocated {{his wrist}} in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He {{underwent}} surgery, {{and went on}} to miss the remainder of the season. [...] Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve. Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury. The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team's identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, [...] "Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> a winner, and that formula worked for us. I hate to say it, but that's the truth." [...] Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.|$|E

[...] Rhys manages to convince Erin that Kate is a jealous ex-girlfriend and that he does not want her place on the program. Rhys charms Erin [...] "into his bed", but he is put out when she calls time on their relationship to focus on her studies. Rhys later learns Erin has turned up late for surgery and during dinner together, he spills wine on Erin's top. When she turns up at the hospital, she smells of alcohol. Rhys then implies to Karl that she has a drinking problem. Barber explained [...] "Rhys just has to plant the seed of doubt, fake some concern for his colleague, and rumour and innuendo does the rest..." [...] Erin quits the program, giving Rhys the chance to successfully apply for her place.|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the music}} video began on September 20, 2012, with shots of Jepsen on set of the music video {{surfacing}} online the same day. She was pictured {{wearing a pair of}} leather pants along with a red-black corset and a silver chain hanging from her waist. The singer said she is aiming to show a more mature side with the music video. On October 8, 2012, a 24-second teaser was uploaded to YouTube featuring Jepsen performing the track at a party, falling for a guy in a grey beanie and then jumping into a swimming pool with him for a kiss. Two weeks later, the singer tweeted, [...] "the music video for This Kiss is coming soooo soon! Until then here is a little preview. Hope you enjoy it! Mwah x," [...] followed by the link of the teaser. A lyric video, which [...] "channels the familiar opening credits of the classic show Saved By The Bell" [...] as noted by Carl Williot of Idolator, was released on October 18, 2012. The music video premiered on October 26, 2012, at the Fun Size film premiere, and was released online on October 28, 2012. Directed by Justin Francis, the video starts with Jepsen and her fellow friends driving a Fiat 500. After they come out of the car, they follow to a '80s inspired warehouse, where Jepsen starts flirting with a guy (actor Kurt Collins). <b>The</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> immediately attracted to her, and, as the video comes to a close, they dive in a pool and kiss.|$|E
500|$|Long-time {{collaborators}} {{and veteran}} Disney writers, Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle {{had already been}} writing for Disney Channel for several years, contributing to the network's male-led animated series Aladdin, Hercules and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, each one spin-offs of their respective feature-length animated films. Although they had enjoyed working on those projects, Schooley and McCorkle were becoming interested in contributing to [...] "something original". At the same time, the writers learned that Disney Channel had become interested in developing a show featuring ordinary children in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, the network commissioned Schooley and McCorkle to create an animated series geared towards the nine to 14 year-old demographic that was also capable of entertaining older audiences at the same time. While traveling in an elevator {{on their way back}} to their office from their lunch break, McCorkle said to Schooley, [...] "Kim Possible. She can do anything", to which Schooley responded, [...] "Ron Stoppable, he can’t", and nearly the entire premise of Kim Possible naturally unfolded thereafter. According to Schooley and McCorkle, both lead characters' names indicate that Kim Possible [...] "is going to be an arched show that is a little bit over the top, but also that the girl {{is going to be the}} action lead and <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> going to be funny." [...] Conceiving all main characters themselves, Rufus and Wade were eventually created and added to the roster, but the series essentially remains about Kim [...] "who is incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world" [...] while [...] "Ron would be challenged everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] were often {{difficult}} for listeners to decipher, both {{due to their}} nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that the Nevermind album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one Geffen promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, [...] "We can't play this. I can't understand what <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> saying." [...] MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule. The lyrics for the album—and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs—were later released with the liner notes of the [...] "Lithium" [...] single in 1992. American rock critic Dave Marsh noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was [...] "the 'Louie Louie' of the nineties" [...] and wrote, [...] "Like 'Louie,' only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently." [...] Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics of the song, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that [...] "what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang," [...] and added, [...] "Worst of all, I'm not sure that I know more about [...] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts." ...|$|E

2500|$|Loneliness is a {{significant}} factor in several characters' lives. Candy is lonely after his dog is gone. Curley's wife is lonely because her husband is not the friend she hoped for—she deals with her loneliness by flirting with the men on the ranch, which causes Curley to increase his abusiveness and jealousy. The companionship of George and Lennie is the result of loneliness. Crooks states the theme candidly as [...] "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got anybody. Don't make any difference who <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is,</b> long's he's with you." [...] The author further reinforces this theme through subtle methods by situating the story near the town of Soledad, which means [...] "solitude" [...] in Spanish.|$|E

I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E

[...] Maxis gave little support or financing for the game. However, EA was more enthusiastic. Steven Levy wrote: [...] "Wright’s games were so different from EA’s other releases {{that it was hard}} to imagine the two being united in the same enterprise." [...] However, the success of SimCity had already established Sim as a strong brand, and EA, which by then, fifteen years after its founding, was becoming a Procter & Gamble-style brand-management company, foresaw the possibility of building a Sim franchise.|$|E

[...] Winslet adds that [...] "Roman {{is one of the}} most extraordinary men I've ever met. <b>The</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> 77 years old. He has an effervescent quality to him.

He likes to have a small crew, to the point that, when I walked on the set, my thought was, 'My God, this is it?'” Also noting that style of directing, New York Film Festival director Richard Pena, during the American premiere of the film, called Polanski [...] "a poet of small spaces... in just a couple of rooms he can conjure up an entire world, an entire society." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Fanzine's Richard Parks, {{interviewing}} Mikey Heppner, {{noted that}} many of the album's lyrics were threatening in some way; in addition to the aforementioned references to death, other songs have dark subtexts. [...] "Time Will Cut You Down" [...] has a straightforward message of [...] "one frustrated person warning someone else", according to Heppner, while [...] "Talk to Her" [...] seemed according to Parks to be [...] a distorted take on the Beatles song [...] "She Loves You". [...] "In 'She Loves You', <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> trying to help his friend who's in a relationship," [...] explained Parks, [...] "but in 'Talk to Her' it becomes a threat - more like, I'm going to take your girl away from you." [...] Heppner remarked that a closer comparison would be to the other Beatles tune [...] "You're Going to Lose That Girl", whose message about losing in a relationship was similarly blunt. Heppner acknowledged that the songs [...] "fit together" [...] with regard to their apparent similarities in subject matter, but denied the presence of an intentional unifying theme around which the songs were written.|$|E
2500|$|Titans {{starting}} {{running back}} Chris Johnson - {{who had the}} vast majority of the carries in 2009, rushing for over 2000 yards - will reportedly get fewer carries in 2010. This will likely mean in increase in number of carries for Ringer. Backup Running back LenDale White is an impending free agent, and his future with the team also affects Ringer's future. During the 2010 NFL Draft, White was traded to the Seattle Seahawks. Despite the team signing Stafon Johnson and LeGarrette Blount as undrafted free agents, Head coach Jeff Fisher has confirmed that Ringer will be the new #2 running back, stating [...] "We have a terrific running back , and a very talented backup in Javon." [...] When Chris Johnson held out of training camp, Ringer took the first-string role. When discussing the #2 running back role, offensive coordinator, Mike Heimerdinger said, [...] " [...] been really good in training camp. I have a lot of confidence in Javon, with everything he has shown. He has the ability to make some runs... There's no reason why he can't be that guy." [...] During the first pre-season game of the 2010 season, Ringer led the team in rushing yards (60 yards, seven carries). Fullback Ahmad Hall said of Ringer [...] "Everybody knew he was a great back last year... He really, really immersed himself in the playbook, and picked everything up. If anything happened to C.J. he could definitely fill in and execute well. He is a smart guy, and he applies himself. <b>The</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> a good running back." ...|$|E
