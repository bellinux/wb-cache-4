40|$|Mirrors {{fabrication}} {{for large}} aperture telescopes {{is an important}} aspect in space exploration programs. One of the cost effective techniques to obtain such mirrors is electroplating of Ni-Co alloys from sulfamate solution. The Center for Irradiation of Materials at Alabama A&M University - Research Institute {{has been involved in}} a NASA-MSFC project for producing ultra-light Ni-Co alloy mirrors since the summer of year 2000. The goal of this project is to obtain ultra-light, high strength electroformed large aperture normal incidence replicated mirrors, (weighting less than 5 kg/m 2), free of stress, with a good figure and reproducible thickness variation. In order to simplify the control of parameters such as temperature gradient, concentration gradient, distribution of the electric field lines and flow control, the proposed geometry involves a cylindrical main tank contained in another cylindrical tank, which plays the role of a weir.

40|$|The {{background}} for the project is the 320 MVA generator step-up transformer for Jostedal Power Plant. The transformer experiences excess heating in a limited part of the steel <b>tank</b> and <b>lid</b> from eddy current loss caused by the low voltage busbar configuration. This is unfavorable for the gasket and the transformer oil. In the project a test rig has been constructed which features a mild steel plate, being subjected to a magnetic field. The temperature in the plate is recorded and compared versus a numerical model created in Comsol Multiphysics {{and the use of}} the New Thermometric Method. The non-linear magnetic permeability in mild steel has also been investigated. The heat transfer analysis from the numerical model showed an acceptable temperature deviation compared with the actual temperature in the steel plate. The knowledge from this has been used to create numerical model of a selected part of the transformer utilizing symmetry conditions. The Heat Transfer analysis of this coincides well with thermography images of the overheating area. Poor electromagnetic contact between <b>tank</b> and <b>lid</b> may be an important part of the excess heating in the flange. It is recommended to mount braided copper links over the flange to see if this will reduce some of the excess temperature. If this is not adequate, the evaluation of the different measures that could be done to reduce stray loss concluded that mounting an aluminum shield would be the preferable choice. Mounting such a shield would repel the flux from entering the tank steel, and thereby reduce the temperature. However, the shield itself may experience heating, but not to an extent that the steel experience today. </p...|$|R

50|$|The K-431, {{completed}} around 1965 as unit K-31, was a Project 675 (Echo II) class submarine {{with two}} pressurized water reactors, each 70 MWt capacity and using 20% enriched uranium as fuel. On 10 August 1985, the submarine was being refuelled at the Chazhma Bay naval facility near Vladivostok. The submarine had been refuelled and the reactor <b>tank</b> <b>lid</b> was being replaced. The lid was laid incorrectly {{and had to}} be lifted again with the control rods attached. A beam was supposed to prevent the lid from being lifted too far, but this beam was positioned incorrectly, and the lid with control rods was lifted up too far. At 10:55 AM the starboard reactor became prompt critical, resulting in a criticality excursion of about 5&middot;1018 fissions and a thermal/steam explosion. The explosion expelled the new load of fuel, destroyed the machine enclosures, ruptured the submarine's pressure hull and aft bulkhead, and partially destroyed the fuelling shack, with the shack's roof falling 70 metres away in the water. A fire followed, which was extinguished after 4 hours, after which assessment of the radioactive contamination began. Most of the radioactive debris fell within 50-100 metres of the submarine, but a cloud of radioactive gas and particulates blew to the northwest across a 6 km stretch of the Dunay Peninsula, missing the town of Shkotovo-22, 1.5 km from the dock. The contaminated forest area was later surveyed as 2 km2 in a swath 3.5 km long and 200 to 650 metres wide. Initial estimates of the radioactive release were about 74 PBq (2 MCi) of noble gases and 185 PBq (5 MCi) of other fission products, but most of this was short-lived isotopes; the estimated release inventory one hour after the accident was about 37 TBq (1000 Ci) of non-noble fission products. In part because the reactor did not contain spent fuel, the fraction of biologically active isotopes was far smaller than {{in the case of the}} Chernobyl disaster.|$|E

This situation affects the poor more than the rich people in the community. Rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) were implemented using the roof as the catchment at household level under subsidized schemes, which was a measure to minimize water and sanitation issues. The harvested rainwater was intended to be used for drinking and other domestic purposes with or without treatment. Assessment of the current status of RWHS in the country shows that there is a high correlation between the lack of some of the essential components of RWHS and non-use of the system. All the systems that were not being used lacked {{one or more of the}} essential components of a typical RWHS, such as gutters, <b>tank</b> <b>lid,</b> filter and first flush device.

There were some who made use of the system and maintained it fully, but this was around 50 % of the original number of beneficiaries. Awareness also plays an important role in adoption of the system. As expected, almost all the beneficiaries who had undertaken routine maintenance of RWHS used the harvested rainwater for drinking purposes. Abandonment of systems takes place when the system provided is incomplete or if it lacks one or more of the essential components...|$|E
40|$|As break {{downs of}} {{production}} transformers are costly and often result in long outages {{it is essential}} for reliability of operation that the transformers are manufactured to be robust. The aim of this M. Sc. thesis is to investigate if deviations should be made from the standard IEC 60076 – Power Transformers in order to describe a robust large power transformer for procurement. The investigation has been conducted in three stages. In the first stage a definition of the term robust was developed in consultation with the client Vattenfall Vattenkraft. In the second stage six parameters, called key parameters, which significantly affect transformer robustness were identified. The identification was based on an analysis of transformer construction, a description of occurring faults and an analysis of statistics. In the third and final stage the standard was evaluated regarding requirements on the six key parameters. The evaluation was primarily conducted by means of interviewing persons with relevant knowledge of the evaluated aspects. The identified key parameters are: Temperature, regarding mainly hot spot temperature rises; Type and properties of the insulation; Quality and performance of the manufacturing facility; Ability to withstand external short circuit; Loss evaluation, since the magnitude of the losses dictates the forces developed during transients, and finally impurities within the insulation. It has been found that, in order to describe a robust transformer, deviations from the standard should be made in the specification for procurement. A total of 22 recommended deviations have been presented including the following: The hot spot temperature at the core surface should be specified and verified by calculation and test. The rated voltage for insulation sizing should be chosen higher than the standard suggests. The ability to withstand external short circuit should be validated by calculation. The loss evaluation should be specified, a value of 11, 000 euro/kW for no load losses is recommended. The transformer <b>tank</b> <b>lid</b> should be welded in place in order to ensure a tight seal over time.

40|$|Background: Pesticide use {{continues}} to be a serious public health problem in developing countries, despite decades of safe pesticide use strategies. In Nicaragua, organophosphate insecticides, in particular chlorpyrifos and methamidophos are responsible for about half of the acute pesticide poisonings. Contamination of the skin occurs frequently in the occupational setting. There is extensive research to improve methods to assess dermal exposure. The applicability and feasibility of such methods in developing countries is uncertain. Aim: This thesis aims at increasing the understanding of risk factors underlying exposure, evaluating dermal exposure among Nicaraguan subsistence farmers, and proposing more suitable methods for developing country conditions. Methods: A group of 29 subsistence farmers were interviewed in four focus groups and their responses were analyzed using grounded theory. Field data for semi-quantitative and quantitative exposure measurements of 31 farmers were collected during 33 pesticide applications, using observation, supplementary video recording, a fluorescent tracer, and skin wiping. A visual scoring system developed in the US was modified into a Nicaraguan Visual Scoring System suitable for developing country conditions. Pesticides were traced during application. Skin fluorescence was videotaped in a foldaway darkened room which was later measured through Body Segment Scores (BSS), Contaminated Body Area (CBA) and Total Visual Score (TVS). TVS was used as a criterion indicator for the identification of main exposure determinants by observation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Hundred and ten potential exposure determinants were reduced to 27 variables grouped as worksite, spray equipment, work practices, clothing, and hygiene practices. Reliability of the visual score was tested with intraclass correlation coefficients, in a sub-sample of five farmers evaluated by five raters. Observations of hand exposure events (direct and indirect contacts) were summarized into a Concentrate Contamination Index (CCI) and a Solution Contamination Index (SCI). Chemical residues were quantified for the hands and selected body parts according to fluorescent intensities. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were computed to compare the observational indices (CCI+SCI), fluorescent visual scores and quantitative residues. Results: Reasons for unsafe practices were connected with poverty, inadequacy of personal protective equipment, climatic factors, and limited knowledge influenced by beliefs and traditions. Farmers felt affection towards their traditional crops and this relationship seemed to have strong meanings for pest removal and pesticide use, contributing to dangerous work practices. The observed fluorescent images on the skin of farmers reflected work practices and contamination mechanisms and pathways. Novel determinants included spraying on a muddy terrain, dew on plants, sealing of <b>tank</b> <b>lids</b> with a cloth, and wiping sweat from the face. The Visual Scoring System was highly consistent (Cronbach alpha = 0. 96) and reasonably reliable (0. 75; 95 % CI: 0. 62 - 0. 83), with scoring of extent being more reliable than scoring of intensity. The highest CBA was 66 % and the farmer with the highest TVS scored 60 % of the maximum possible. Hands were most frequently contaminated and the back had the highest BSS. Hand contact was most frequently indirect, by touching contaminated surfaces. All farmers had quantifiable pesticide residues on their hands. Spearman correlation coefficients between the observational contamination scores, fluorescent visual scores and residues in relation to the hands ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 74 for chlorpyrifos and 0. 62 to 0. 87 for methamidophos. Differences in scores could be explained by limitations of the different methods. Conclusions: Poverty and cultural factors contribute to pesticide use and unsafe use conditions. Education programs should be culturally appropriate to achieve pesticide exposure reduction. Each method studied in this thesis can be used independently. However, they can also complement each other, providing {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of skin exposure. With further improvements, a combination of observation and fluorescent visual scoring techniques, both lowcost and practical, would become highly accessible methods for surveillance and for epidemiological studies in developing countries...|$|R

Both spilling and plunging breakers are considered. A PIV system, using a high speed digital video camera at up to 500 frames per second, was used to obtain quantitative data on both the air and water side of the free surface interface. Waves are generated by a computer controlled, paddle-type wave maker {{at one end of}} long, narrow acrylic tank. In order to obtain breaking waves on a small scale, surface tension was lowered by mixing isopropyl alcohol with distilled water. Surface tension characteristics of the water-IPA mixture are also presented herein. To perform high speed PIV measurements, a low-cost, Lasiris Magnum, near-IR, TTL diode line generator laser is used to form the light sheet. To seed the water, traditional silver coated hollow-glass spheres were used. While seeding in the water was quite straight-forward, seeding in the air was quite complex. In order not to adversely affect the surface tension, a water-based fog was used to seed the air. Qualitative visualizations and PIV show the formation of the vortex aft of the breaking wave and reveal strong counterclockwise vorticity in the air side of the interface. Results for the plunging breaking wave case are presented herein and compared with numerical results from Hendrickson (2004) ...|$|R
40|$|Injury {{rates among}} farmers {{are one of}} the highest in all occupations. Farm {{machinery}} accounts for a majority of these injuries. In order to reduce these injuries, the root causes of the injury events need to be found. The person involved, the machine involved, and the environment are all factors that influence an injury event. As part of a case-control study of farm machinery injuries, this thesis describes the accounts of conducting on-site investigations of machinery from an engineering perspective. This thesis focused on the machinery factors that were involved in the injury events. The thesis focused on three aspects of the machinery, namely its age, its state of repair or maintenance, and its conformance to safety standards. On-site inspections were conducted on 24 case (involved in an injury event) machines and 15 matching control (not involved in an injury event) machines. There were 15 different types of machinery inspected, ranging from air seeders, augers and combines to front-end-loaders, mix-mills and water pumps. The small sample size was one reason that the analysis did not provide any statistically significant results. The analysis showed {{no significant difference between the}} case and control machinery. The on-site machinery inspections were valuable in understanding the injury event. They were also valuable in determining the root causes of the injury events. The standards, to which the machinery was compared, were generally sufficient in defining the safety requirements of machinery. However, one simple addition that could be considered by the safety standards organizations and subsequently by the machinery manufacturers, was supplying machinery with a system that would reduce the possibility of a <b>tank</b> or hopper <b>lid</b> closing unexpectedly...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Caroma (Industries Limited), Adelaide, Australia. Caroma {{is the leading}} manufacturers of toilets and bathroom accessories in Australia. One of their most popular products is the plastic toilet cistern, a cheaper alternative to the vitreous china cistern. Caromas plastic cisterns are very common in Australian homes and public bathrooms. All of their cisterns are manufactured at Caromas manufacturing plant in Norwood, Adelaide, where they also produce other plastic components such as valves and toilet seats. This project will be emphasizing on the styling of a new cistern and its design and it will consist of a <b>tank,</b> a <b>lid,</b> a connection plate and dual flush button setup. The main aim of this thesis is to present the product development and design of a new plastic cistern intended for the replacement market. The new cistern shall be big {{enough to cover the}} footprint of plastic cistern out on the market, Caromas own brands and other producers. Caroma has got more then 10 different models of plastic cisterns and they all got different footprints (the footprint is the wall area that the cistern covers). Some of the models are up to 30 years old and need to be replaced because of malfunction but also because of their old-fashioned styling. The old models are often very big and have got a big footprint. If a cistern has to be replaced the new cistern shall cover the footprint so that no marks, left by the old cistern, are visible on the wall and no further renovation is necessary. In order to optimize the required footprint, plastic cisterns were measured and charted. The product development started with brainstorming and an ITK, Identity Tool Kit. The ITK is used to get a general idea about what style was wanted. Three concepts were generated and presented to Marketing in Sydney. A concept was chosen by using systematic concept selection and after having had input from marketing. The result of the project is a new plastic cistern that covers the required footprint and has a style that goes well with contemporary bathroom design as well as with older. It has a slim shape and looks proportional. The cistern has also got a shelf feature that allows placing objects on top. The button setup is designed as a rocker and adds a new type of button to the Caroma product range. The new cistern design is presented with rendered CAD pictures and a full-scale prototype. A physical model is from a marketing point of view more convincing. It gives not only a visual experience but also a tactile. When designing the new cistern, manufacturability has been taken into consideration. Knowledge about the processes and manufacturing techniques has improved the design utilizing the properties instead of consider them as limitations. This project will hopefully give Caroma inspiration to start manufacturing a new plastic cistern design. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Gas Cooled Reactor Experiment I. Expedient {{modifications}} to the tube bundle and control rods made possible the attainment of initial critical of the GCRE-I reactor early in February. The scheduled series of low-power experiments was completed and the facility shut down in midApril to permit the permanent modification to the tube bundle, control rods, and instrumentation. Gas Cooled Reactor Experiment II. Work on the GCRE-II was limited to materials development and systems studies. These studies included mobile and portable power systems using homogeneous graphite reactors as well as modifications and improvements to the ML- 1 system. The materials development effort was devoted to homogeneous graphite fuel materials. The ML- 1. Activation measurements {{were made in the}} <b>Lid</b> <b>Tank</b> Facility. Reanalysis of stresses in the tube sheet indicated high stresses in certain regions. Design of most of the reactor package was completed and fabrication initiated. An alloy (80 % Ag [...] 15 % In [...] 5 % Cd) was selected for the ML- 1 control blades on the basis of ductility tests, corrosion tests, and neutronic calculations. A critical experiment was performed on the ML- 1 configuration with pin type fuel elements. The recuperator design selected is a four-pas-s shell and tube heat exchanger. Fuel-element Development. A preliminary design study indicated that the seven-pin fuel element does not significantly improve performance over that obtainable with the 19 -pin design. A corrosion test specimen of Hastelloy X exposed for 5000 hr in air at 1750 deg F showed 0. 0016 - in. penetration. Beryllium oxide [...] uranium oxide capsule irradiation was completed with about 2 at. % U/sup 235 / burn-up at maximum surface temperature of 1740 deg F. The IB- 2 T-Z irradiation test was completed after about 800 hr of operation, including 1147 thermal cycles between 1000 and 1600 deg F without any evidence of malfunction. The irradiation of the GCRE- 1 plate type element (1 - 3 P) was completed after 429 hr of operation. (For preceding period see IDO- 28549.) (W. L. H. ...|$|R
