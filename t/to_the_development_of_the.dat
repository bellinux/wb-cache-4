During the Second World War the country became wealthier as exports of rubber, cotton, coffee, uranium and diamonds increased.

5|$|Many scholars, however, have {{disagreed}} with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis. For example, the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism {{did not begin}} with the Industrial Revolution but in 14th century Italy. In Milan, Venice and Florence, the small city-state governments led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest forms of capitalism. In the 16th century, Antwerp was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has been {{pointed out that the}} Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, {{which was one of the}} centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland. Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter's argument by arguing the hypothesis that Calvinism hurt the development of capitalism by leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labour theory of value.|$|E

5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate {{from that of the}} middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures {{as well as to the}} non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, {{mesoderm}} and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue. The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choroid plexuses. The open neuropores of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.|$|E
5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in Vietnam was winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat {{as well as the}} political climate regarding military acquisition programs had caused the Army to amend the service's attack helicopter requirements in favor of a twin-engine conventional helicopter, viewed as less technical and more survivable. The Army announced a new program for an Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) on 17 August 1972, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AH-64 Apache.|$|E

5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prime number theorem.|$|E

Aiming at a scientific market, Digital machines had a 36-bit word length to accommodate artificial intelligence work in Lisp and to compete with IBM mainframe computers. In 1965, in {{what may have been}} the first around-the-world networking connection, a PDP-6 at the University of Western Australia in Perth was operated from Boston in the United States via a telex link.|$|E
