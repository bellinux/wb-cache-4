5|$|Bats possess highly adapted lung {{systems to}} cope with the {{pressures}} of powered-flight. Flight is an energetically taxing aerobic activity and requires large amounts of oxygen to be sustained. In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E

Karnataka has also established a modicum of public health services having a better record of health care and child care <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> states of India. In spite of these advances, some parts of the state still leave much to be desired when it comes to primary health care.|$|E
5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains.|$|E

50|$|The {{mountain}} stands about 26 km south-west of {{the national}} capital of Dili. The forest ranges in elevation from about 800 m upwards to the 1369 m summit. The underlying rocks are non-calcareous and the forest {{is considered to be}} more species-rich <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> on the island.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning {{the hike}} at Zaō Pass (Zaō Tōge), follow the {{signs on the}} trail until you reach the summit. This route is much longer <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> as it zigzags a lot while going up the mountain. This route {{is also the most}} rugged, steep, strenuous, and dangerous.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of {{metformin}} is gastrointestinal irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence; metformin is more {{commonly associated with}} gastrointestinal side effects <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> antidiabetic drugs. The most serious potential side effect of metformin use is lactic acidosis; this complication is very rare, {{and the vast majority}} of these cases seem to be related to comorbid conditions, such as impaired liver or kidney function, rather than to the metformin itself.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic stabilisers which contributed far more than discretionary action and more <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> countries.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, {{perhaps because it}} may be more biologically productive <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy catsharks from a number of locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E

5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different welding torch {{to create a more}} focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was memorialized {{on several}} postage stamps. The {{first was a}} 13-cent stamp issued on November 18, 1902, with the {{engraved}} likeness of Harrison modeled after a photo provided by his widow. In all Harrison has been honored on six U.S. Postage stamps, more <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> U.S. Presidents. Harrison also was featured on the five-dollar National Bank Notes from the third charter period, beginning in 1902. In 2012, a dollar coin with his image, part of the Presidential $1 Coin Program, was issued.|$|E
5|$|High {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} recorded in the Serengeti. In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> large mammals.|$|E
50|$|The {{track is}} slower paced <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> on the album. Its lyrics are {{inspired}} by S.E. Hinton's book Rumble Fish, about biker gang culture. The lyrics have been interpreted by the band as {{an attack on the}} hollowness of the consumer lifestyle offered by capitalism, describing how society expects young people to conform.|$|R

5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E
5|$|Lead's per-particle {{abundance}} in the Solar System is 0.121 ppb (parts per billion). This figure is {{two and a}} half times higher than that of platinum, eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold. The amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms (all of which are unstable) gradually decay to lead. The abundance of lead in the Solar System since its formation 4.5 billion years ago has increased by about 0.75%. The solar system abundances table shows that lead, despite its relatively high atomic number, is more prevalent <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.|$|E
5|$|Mature bulls {{can weigh}} up to 800 {{kilograms}} (1,800pounds) and cows can weigh up to 500 kilograms (1,100pounds). Cows typically have {{a height of}} 90–106centimeters (3–3.5ft), and bulls are typically {{in the range of}} 106–120centimeters (3.5–4ft). Mating occurs throughout the year with a gestation period of approximately 277–290 days. Most commonly a single calf is born, but twins are not unknown. Sexual maturity is reached at about eighteen months. Highland cattle also have a longer expected lifespan <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> breeds of cattle, up to 20 years.|$|E
