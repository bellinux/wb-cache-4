30|$|This study {{investigated}} the relation between <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential of a 2 -year-old Japanese oak (Quercus crispula Blume) sapling and its physiology, especially the radial transport of water containing inorganic ingredients in the stem using the scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray microanalyzer (SEM-EDXA) method. <b>The</b> <b>resting</b> potential of a sapling could be monitored continuously with our measuring apparatus. Changes in resting potential were due to the light. The hyperpolarization and depolarization peaks of <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential, whose absolute voltage was about 10 mV, occurred right after lights-off and lights-on, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>resting</b> potential was found to show periodic responses for each day unit. At night (lights-off), <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential tended to depolarize {{with an increase in}} tangential strain. On the other hand, during the daytime (lights-on) <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential tended to hyperpolarize, depolarize, or show a nearly constant value for the tangential strain. The water containing inorganic ingredients was transported, via transpiration, in both directions between the mature xylem zone and the phloem zone through differentiating xylem cells. This water transport within a tree stem had a significant effect on the diurnal changes in resting potential.|$|R

40|$|The {{contributions}} of specific K+ currents to <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potential of rabbit isolated, pulmonary artery myocytes, and their modulation by hypoxia, were investigated {{by use of}} the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique. In the presence of 10 [*]μM glibenclamide <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential (− 50 ± 4 [*]mV, n= 18) was unaffected by 10 [*]μM tetraethylammonium ions, 200 [*]nM charybdotoxin, 200 [*][*]nM iberiotoxin, 100 [*]μM ouabain or 100 [*]μM digitoxin. The negative potential was therefore maintained without ATP-sensitive (KATP) or large conductance Ca 2 +-sensitive (BKCa) K channels, and without <b>the</b> Na+-K+ATPase. <b>The</b> <b>resting</b> potential, <b>the</b> delayed rectifier current (IK(V)) and the A-like K+ current (IK(A)) were all reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) and by quinine. 4 -AP was equally potent at reducing <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential and IK(V), 10 [*]mM causing depolarization from − 44 [*]mV to − 22 [*]mV with accompanying inhibition of IK(V) by 56 % and IK(A) by 79 %. In marked contrast, the effects of quinine on resting potential were poorly correlated with its effects on both IK(A) and IK(V). At 10 [*]mM, quinine reduced IK(V) and IK(A) by 47 % and 38 %, respectively, with no change in <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential. At 100 [*]μM, both currents were almost abolished while <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential was reduced < 50 %. Raising the concentration to 1 [*]mM had little further effect on IK(A) or IK(V), but essentially abolished <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential. Reduction of <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential by quinine was correlated with inhibition of a voltage-gated, low threshold, non-inactivating K+ current, IK(N). Thus, 100 [*]μM quinine reduced both IK(N) and <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential by around 50 %. <b>The</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potential was the same whether measured after clamping the cell at − 80 [*]mV, or immediately after a prolonged period of depolarization at 0 [*]mV, which inactivated IK(A) and IK(V), but not IK(N). When exposed to a hypoxic solution, the O 2 tension near the cell fell from 125 ± 6 to 14 ± 2 [*]mmHg (n= 20), resulting in a slow depolarization of the myocyte membrane to − 35 ± 3 [*]mV (n= 16). The depolarization occurred without {{a change in the}} amplitude of IK(V) or IK(A), but it was accompanied by 60 % inhibition of IK(N) at 0 [*]mV. Our findings suggest that <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential of rabbit pulmonary artery myocytes depends on IK(N), and that inhibition of IK(N) may mediate the depolarization induced by hypoxia...|$|R
