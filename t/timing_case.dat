In 1971, deck height was extended from 9.480 in to 9.503 in (casting D1AE-6015-DA) {{to lower the}} compression ratio to reduce NOx emissions without the need to change piston or cylinder-head design. In 1974, a boss was added {{on the front of}} the right cylinder bank to mount the air injection pump (casting D4AE-A). In 1974, the oil dipstick tube moved from the <b>timing</b> <b>case</b> to the skirt under the left cylinder bank near the rear of the casting. These details made swapping older blocks from passenger cars with front sump oil pans to more recent rear-sumped Mustang and LTD/Crown Vic Ford cars more difficult unless an oil pan had the dipstick mounted therein. In 1984, the rear main seal was changed from a two-piece component to a one-piece design.|$|E

They supplied a torque converter adapter plate and other fittings so that a Ford Essex V4 engine could be fitted in the space left by a removed rotary engine. It was the only engine short enough to fit in the vacated space without modification to the body work. Depending on which Ford model it came from, the engine was available with front or rear sump wells, crank pulley or <b>timing</b> <b>case</b> mounted cooling fan, two capacities and a low compression version for using low grade fuel. In terms of smoothness and refinement, the V4 and the rotary were like chalk and cheese compared to the turbine quality of the rotary engine, but what the V4 did provide was dependability, an increase in torque and an improvement in fuel consumption. Later the Ford V6 was tried but needed body modifications, was thirsty and didn't quite have the right handling balance.|$|E

This effect provided the guide {{to build a new}} algorithm for determining geomagnetic storm sudden commencement onset times. It is proved that the change in the spectrum during the SC is directly proportional to the value of the SC rate of variation. Investigations elaborate that the second detail of the MRA of the DWT is the best detail to be used to monitor the SC <b>timing.</b> <b>Case</b> {{studies have shown that the}} algorithm is very sensitive to both low- and high-rate variation SCs.

S. combines storage, transportation and disposal elements to evaluate schedule, cost and other resources needed for all major operations leading to final geologic disposal. Geologic repository reference options are associated with limits on waste package thermal power output at emplacement, {{in order to meet}} limits on peak temperature for certain key engineered and natural barriers. These package power limits are used in logistical simulation software such as CALVIN, as threshold requirements that must be met by means of decay storage or SNF blending in waste packages, before emplacement in a repository. Geologic repository reference options include enclosed modes developed for crystalline rock, clay or shale, and salt. In addition, a further need has been addressed for open modes in which SNF can be emplaced in a repository, then ventilated for decades or longer to remove heat, prior to permanent repository closure. For each open mode disposal concept there are specified durations for surface decay storage (prior to emplacement), repository ventilation, and repository closure operations. This study simulates those steps for several timing cases, and for SNF with three fuel-burnup characteristics, to develop package power limits at which waste packages can be emplaced without exceeding specified temperature limits many years later after permanent closure. The results are presented in the form of correlations that span a range of package power and peak postclosure temperature, for each open-mode disposal concept, and for each <b>timing</b> <b>case.</b> Given a particular temperature limit value, the corresponding package power limit for each case can be selected for use in CALVIN and similar tools...|$|E

In many cases, it is assumed that each of the references from a dynamic load/store instruction will miss in the cache and replace a cache block that would otherwise lead to a cache hit.

This paper presents a fine timing synchronization scheme which utilizes the channel impulse response (CIR) estimated from frequency-domain samples at OFDM receivers.

The ML timing scheme is further developed for both integer precision and real-valued precision implementations. In the real-valued <b>timing</b> precision <b>case,</b> a delay locked loop (DLL) structure is devised as {{an effective way to}} implement the MLE.
