40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the entrepreneurial orientation of immigrant entrepreneurs in South Africa. Data was collected through the use of self-administered questionnaires in a survey. The study focused on immigrant entrepreneurs from West Africa specifically, Nigerians, Ghanaians and Senegalese that are business owners in the retail sector and have been in business for at least five years. Because of the difficulty in obtaining the population of immigrant entrepreneurs in the study area, purposive and snowball sampling methods were used. The results indicated <b>that</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs are adept at introducing new product lines and also making changes to their product lines. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs are innovative. The results also showed <b>that</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs are proactive as they have the tendency to be ahead of others in introducing new products. In additions, immigrant entrepreneurs have a strong preference for high risk projects with chances of high return...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} oppositional culture among immigrant and majority {{adolescents in the}} Netherlands. Oppositional culture theory expects <b>that</b> <b>immigrant</b> adolescents would uphold positive attitudes towards education.

To test these ideas, we make use {{of one of the}} first large-scale studies on oppositional culture in the Netherlands, and in Europe more generally. Applying multilevel analyses to a survey across 340 schools among 11, 215 adolescents aged 11 to 19, we find no clear evidence <b>that</b> <b>immigrant</b> adolescents support oppositional culture either more or less than majority adolescents. Results however showed that oppositional culture differs across schools and that in more ethnically concentrated schools, there is a higher tendency for ethnic minority adolescents to skip classes. Furthermore, oppositional culture finds more support among adolescents who are in a higher grade, male, and who attend a lower education track...|$|R

25|$|Economist Thomas Sowell (2001) argues <b>that</b> <b>immigrants</b> during Riis's {{time were}} {{typically}} {{willing to live}} in cramped, unpleasant circumstances as a deliberate short-term strategy {{that allowed them to}} save more than half their earnings to help family members come to America, with every intention of relocating to more comfortable lodgings eventually. Many tenement renters physically resisted the well-intentioned relocation efforts of reformers like Riis, states Sowell, because other lodgings were too costly to allow for the high rate of savings possible in the tenements. Moreover, according to Sowell, Riis's own personal experiences were the rule rather than the exception during his era: like most immigrants and low-income persons, he lived in the tenements only temporarily before gradually earning more income and relocating to different lodgings.|$|E

25|$|Epidemiological {{data support}} the hygiene hypothesis.

Longitudinal studies in the third world demonstrate an increase in immunological disorders as a country grows more affluent and, it is presumed, cleaner. The use of antibiotics {{in the first year of}} life has been linked to asthma and other allergic diseases. The use of antibacterial cleaning products has also been associated with higher incidence of asthma, as has birth by Caesarean section rather than vaginal birth.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of social class on educational achievement {{is much greater}} in western Germany {{than it is in}} eastern Germany (former GDR). An analysis of PISA data on Gymnasium pupils for the year 2000 showed that, while in western Germany the child of an academic was 7.26 times as likely as that of a skilled worker to attend, in eastern Germany a child from an academic family was only 2.78 times as likely as a working class child to attend. The reasons for this were unclear. Some people believed <b>that</b> <b>immigrants</b> were responsible, because more uneducated immigrant families lived in western than in eastern Germany. This assumption however could not be confirmed. The difference between east and west was even stronger when only ethnic German children were studied.|$|E
25|$|Chile {{was never}} a {{particularly}} attractive destination for migrants, owing to its remoteness and distance from Europe. Europeans preferred to stay in countries closer to their homelands instead of taking the long journey through the Straits of Magellan or crossing the Andes. European migration {{did not result in}} a significant change in the ethnic composition of Chile, except in the region of Magellan. Spaniards were the only major European migrant group to Chile, and there was never large-scale immigration such as that to Argentina or Uruguay. Between 1851 and 1924, Chile only received 0.5% of European immigration to Latin America, compared to 46% to Argentina, 33% to Brazil, 14% to Cuba, and 4% to Uruguay. However, it is undeniable <b>that</b> <b>immigrants</b> have {{played a significant role in}} Chilean society.|$|E
30|$|I {{conclude}} therefore <b>that</b> <b>immigrant</b> inflows do {{increase the}} proportion of childbearing-age women that have recently given birth {{and participate in the}} labor market.

50|$|Volker Hagemeister observes <b>that</b> <b>immigrant</b> {{children}} in Germany have much less {{mastery of the}} language {{than their counterparts in}} countries such as Canada or New Zealand, where English is spoken.

25|$|Immigrants {{may often}} do types {{of work that}} natives are largely unwilling to do, {{contributing}} to greater economic prosperity for {{the economy as a}} whole: for instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United States has close to zero effect on native employment in that occupation, which means that the effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work was therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic productivity. Research indicates <b>that</b> <b>immigrants</b> are more likely to work in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and educational attainment. Further, some studies indicate that higher ethnic concentration in metropolitan areas is positively related to the probability of self-employment of immigrants.|$|E
25|$|This policy {{resulted}} {{in a wide variety}} of ethnicities in New Zealand, with people from over 120 countries represented. Between 1991 and 1995 the numbers of those given approval grew rapidly: 26,000 in 1992; 35,000 in 1994; 54,811 in 1995. The minimum target for residency approval was set at 25,000. The number approved was almost twice what was targeted. The Labour-led governments of 1999–2008 made no change to the Immigration Act 1987, although some changes were made to the 1991 policy. In particular, the minimum IELTS level for skilled migrants was raised from 5.5 to 6.5 in 2002, following concerns <b>that</b> <b>immigrants</b> who spoke English as a second language encountered difficulty getting jobs in their chosen fields. Since then, migration from Britain and South Africa has increased, at the expense of immigration from Asia. However, a study-for-residency programme for foreign university students has mitigated this imbalance somewhat.|$|E
25|$|The federal Naturalization Act, {{signed into}} law on March 26, 1790, by President Washington stated <b>that</b> <b>immigrants</b> to the United States had to be White {{according}} to the definition under the British Common Law, which the United States inherited. The legal definition of Whiteness differed greatly from White Society's informal definition, thus Jews, Gypsies, Middle Eastern Peoples {{and those of the}} Indian Subcontinent were before 1917 classified as White for Immigration purposes but not considered White by the society at large. The Naturalization Act of 1870, passed during Reconstruction, allowed for peoples of African descent to become U.S. Citizens but it excluded other nonwhites. The U.S. Supreme Court in the case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898) declared that all nonwhites who were born in the United States were eligible for citizenship via the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. U.S. Immigration Policy was first restricted toward Chinese with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Gentleman's Agreement of 1907 in which Japan voluntarily barred emigration to the United States and the Immigration Act of 1917 or the Asiatic Barred Zone which barred immigrants from all of the Middle East, the Steppes and the Orient, excluding the Philippines which was then a US Colony. European Jews and Gypsies, although of Asiatic Ancestry, were not affected by the Asiatic Barred Zone, as they held European Citizenship. The Johnson-Reed act of 1924 applied only to the Eastern Hemisphere. The Act imposed immigration quotas on Europe, which allowed for easy immigration from Northern and Western Europe, but almost excluded the Mediterranean and Slavic Nations. Africa and Asia were excluded altogether. The Western Hemisphere remained unrestricted to immigrate to the United States. Thus under the Immigration Act of 1924 all Hispanics and Caribbeans could immigrate to the United States, but a White family from Poland or Russia could not immigrate. Puerto Rican Citizenship was created under the Foraker Act, Pub.L. 56–191, 31 Stat. 77 but it wasn't until 1917 that Puerto Ricans were granted full American Citizenship under the Jones–Shafroth Act (Pub.L. 64–368, 39 Stat. 951. Puerto Ricans, excluding those of obvious African ancestry, were like most Hispanics formally classified as White under U.S. Law, but this classification did not prevent informal discrimination against them by Anglo-Americans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Greece has {{experienced}} {{rapid growth in}} immigrant and refugee populations since 1990. Most are immigrants from Albania and throughout the Balkan region. Immigrant and refugee groups arriving in Greece also come from the former Soviet Union, Southeast Asia and Africa. Some of these newcomers started small businesses {{in their quest to}} become economically self-sufficient, serve the consumer needs of fellow newcomers, and integrate into community life. Research cites <b>that</b> <b>immigrant</b> businesses are closely intertwined with national interest in community economic development. As well, national and research statistics have reflected <b>that</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurship has a direct economic impact on local economies. Finally, {{research in the area of}} immigrant small business development must also address reasons <b>that</b> the <b>immigrant</b> small business entrepreneur gravitates to self-employment and innovative financing methods. The purpose of this research was two-fold: 1) to review the extant literature on social and economic factors influencing immigrant entrepreneurship in Greece, and 2) to determine characteristics and business profiles of Albanian immigrant-owned small businesses within the municipality of Attiki – the location of Athens, Greece’s capital city an...|$|R
