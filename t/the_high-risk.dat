25|$|HPV {{vaccines}} {{have been}} shown to prevent cervical dysplasia from <b>the</b> <b>high-risk</b> HPV types 16 and 18 and some protection against a few closely related high-risk HPV types.

25|$|Unlike {{prostitution}} and drug use, homosexuality {{has never been}} banned in China, but it was listed as a psychiatric disorder until 2001, and public acts of homosexual sex are punishable as hooliganism. Although increasingly tolerated in the cities, in general, homosexuality is highly stigmatised and {{men who have sex}} with men are under considerable pressure to conceal their sexual orientation. As a result, most homosexuals are married, or will be in the future, and form a bridge between <b>the</b> <b>high-risk</b> {{men who have sex with}} men group to their low-risk wives and other partners. The government has initiated few interventions for men who have sex with men, leaving such programmes to advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers. However, the government recently estimated that there were 5–10 million men who have sex with men living in China, of whom 1.35% are thought to be HIV positive. This information, in addition to studies indicating low levels of HIV knowledge, perceived risk, and testing, and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, has prompted the Ministry of Health to now include men who have sex with men in <b>the</b> <b>high-risk</b> groups and to call for the development of novel interventions to target them.|$|E

Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it {{is more likely to be}} treated successfully.|$|E

25|$|The {{emergence}} of cooking in early Homo may have created problems of food theft from women while food was being cooked. As a result, females would recruit male partners {{to protect them}} and their resources from others. This concept, known as the theft hypothesis, accommodates an explanation {{as to why the}} labor of cooking is strongly associated with the status of women. Women are forced to gather and cook foods because they will not acquire food otherwise and access to resources is critical for their reproductive success. On the contrary, men do not gather because their physical dominance allows them to scrounge cooked foods from women. Thus, women's foraging and food preparation efforts allow men to participate in <b>the</b> <b>high-risk,</b> high-reward activities of hunting. Females, in turn, become increasingly sexually attractive as a means to exploit male interest in investing in her protection.|$|E
25|$|Genetically, linkage {{studies have}} {{identified}} 18 possible loci on 15 different chromosomes {{that are associated}} with myopia, but none of these loci are part of the candidate genes that cause myopia. Instead of a simple one-gene locus controlling the onset of myopia, a complex interaction of many mutated proteins acting in concert may be the cause. Instead of myopia being caused by a defect in a structural protein, defects in the control of these structural proteins might be the actual cause of myopia. A collaboration of all myopia studies worldwide, identified 16 new loci for refractive error in individuals of European ancestry, of which 8 were shared with Asians. The new loci include candidate genes with functions in neurotransmission, ion transport, retinoic acid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and eye development.

25|$|Animal {{control and}} {{vaccination}} programs have decreased {{the risk of}} rabies from dogs {{in a number of}} regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. <b>The</b> <b>high-risk</b> group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol.|$|E
25|$|O.glaber is more {{potentially}} dangerous {{in some places}} than in others. The United States, and especially the state of California, prohibits the ant from entering lest it should disrupt the country's ecosystems. Its relationship with honeydew-producing insects and consumption of parasitoids could disrupt the biological control of certain pests, risking long-term ecological damage that could reduce biodiversity, disrupt natural communities, or change ecosystem processes. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>high-risk</b> team and dog team of the California Department of Food and Agriculture have intercepted the ant in nursery stock and fresh plants from Hawaii, and a border station found and stopped it on beehives from Florida. California is especially vulnerable to O.glaber infestation because the state's climate resembles that of those regions where the ant already lives. Nonetheless, O.glaber would not lower crop yields, increase farming costs, degrade water supplies, or likely disrupt Californian agricultural commodity markets.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the risks and benefits associated with oophorectomy in the BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population are different than those for the general population. Prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is an important option for <b>the</b> <b>high-risk</b> population to consider. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations who undergo salpingo-oophorectomy have lower all-cause mortality rates than women in the same population who do not undergo this procedure. In addition, RRSO has been shown to decrease mortality specific to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Women who undergo RRSO are also at a lower risk for developing ovarian cancer and first occurrence breast cancer. Specifically, RRSO provides BRCA1 mutation carriers with no prior breast cancer a 70% reduction of ovarian cancer risk. BRCA1 mutation carriers with prior breast cancer can benefit from an 85% reduction. High-risk women who have not had prior breast cancer can benefit from a 37% (BRCA1 mutation) and 64% (BRCA2 mutation) reduction of breast cancer risk. These benefits are important to highlight, as they are unique to this BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{clinical}} genetics assessment is commonly performed by <b>the</b> <b>high-risk</b> obstetrician or genetic counselor {{where they may}} ask for a blood sample from the fetus or will perform an amniocentesis. These samples are used to perform several tests, one {{of which may be}} to check for the proper number of chromosomes, called a karyotype, of the fetus. Some birth defects are known to be associated with missing a chromosome, having an extra chromosome, such as in Down syndrome, as well as by having a part of one chromosome break off and relocate to a portion of another chromosome (called a translocation). However, on each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes are thousands of different genes. While chromosomes are easy to visualize under a microscope and count, the genes on them are not. Genes are very small pieces of DNA when compared to the chromosomes they reside on. A gene contains a code for a protein and if the gene is mutated (different from normal) the protein that is made from it may not function properly - if at all. Unfortunately, genetic abnormalities could still exist despite having normal chromosomes. The only way to determine genetically inherited mutations in the infant is to perform a genetic analysis of the mother, father, affected infant and any unaffected siblings of the affected fetus. These analyses will reveal what genetic mutations are present in the affected infant, and by comparing these results to the surviving siblings and parents, it can be determined which mutations were inherited or were not.|$|E

Given that the formulation of that strategy was a fundamental role of the Board of Northern Rock, overseen by some directors who had been there since its demutualisation, the failure of that strategy must also be attributed to the Board. The non-executive members of the Board, and in particular the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and the senior non-executive director, failed in the case of Northern Rock to ensure that it remained liquid as well as solvent, to provide against the risks that it was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members." ...|$|E
40|$|Background. Many {{studies that}} show {{improved}} health in older adults have relied on subjective measures of health. This article assesses changes in the physiological status of older Americans during the 1990 s using biological measures of high-risk for morbidity and mortality. Methods. Changes in the prevalence of clinically-defined, high risk for 10 biological markers were assessed in respondents age 65 years and older from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) III (1988 – 1994) and IV (1999 – 2000). Results. Some changes in prevalence of high-risk values of biological markers indicate improved health among older adults in the 1990 s: a 6 % reduction in <b>the</b> prevalence of <b>high-risk</b> total cholesterol (p,. 001) and a 7 % reduction in <b>the</b> prevalence of <b>high-risk</b> homocysteine (p,. 001). Other changes indicate worsening health: a 9 % increase in <b>the</b> prevalence of <b>high-risk</b> systolic blood pressure (p,. 01), a 10 % increase in obesity (p,. 001), and an 8 % increase in <b>the</b> prevalence of <b>high-risk</b> C-reactive protein (p,. 001).
