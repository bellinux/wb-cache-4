60|$|As soon as I was {{sufficiently}} recovered from my fatigue and bruises, and had rendered thanks to merciful Heaven for my deliverance, I {{set out for}} the interior of the country, taking with me a cutlas for protection against wild beasts and a bag of sea-biscuit for sustenance. I walked vigorously, for the weather was then cool and pleasant, and after I had gone {{a few miles from the}} inhospitable coast I found the country open and level. The earth was covered with a thick growth of crimson grass, and at wide intervals were groups of trees. These were very tall, their tops in many instances invisible in a kind of golden mist, or haze, which proved to be, not a <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> but a permanent one, for never in that country has the sun been seen, nor is there any night. The haze seems to be self-luminous, giving a soft, yellow light, so diffused that shadows are unknown. The land is abundantly supplied with pools and rivulets, whose water is of a beautiful orange color and has a pleasing perfume somewhat like attar of rose. I observed all this without surprise and with little apprehension, and went forward, feeling that anything, however novel and mysterious, was better than the familiar terrors of the sea and the coast.|$|E

From among the billowy developments of this style, and beneath a translucent and illuminated headdress, his eye watched jealously for {{the respect of}} the less fashionable world. At other times he emphasised his elegant slenderness in close-fitting garments of black satin. For effects of dignity he would assume broad pneumatic shoulders, from which hung a robe of carefully arranged folds of China silk, and a classical Bindon in pink tights was also a <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in the eternal pageant of Destiny. In the days when he hoped to marry Elizabeth, he sought to impress and charm her, {{and at the same time}} to take off something of his burthen of forty years, by wearing the last fancy of the contemporary buck, a costume of elastic material with distensible warts and horns, changing in colour as he walked, by an ingenious arrangement of versatile chromatophores. And no doubt, if Elizabeth's affection had not been already engaged by the worthless Denton, and if her tastes had not had that odd bias for old-fashioned ways, this extremely chic conception would have ravished her. Bindon had consulted Elizabeth's father before presenting himself in this garb--he was one of those men who always invite criticism of their costume--and Mwres had pronounced him all that the heart of woman could desire. But the affair of the hypnotist proved that his knowledge of the heart of woman was incomplete.|$|E

Modeling of pipes, valves, surge tanks, Francis turbine and its draft tube based on onedimensional approach is performed. Numerical simulation of <b>transient</b> <b>phenomena</b> is performed for different configuration of hydroelectric power plant at off-design conditions such as load rejection/emergency shut-down. Also, analysis of <b>transient</b> <b>phenomena,</b> such as increase of the rotational speed (runaway) of the units, increase of the pressure (head) in the hydraulic system (water hammer) and turbine draft tube pressure pulsations is calculated. Finally, numerical model of hydroelectric power plant, validated with existing measurements data, is used for investigation of influential criteria on HPP’s guaranteed control values (allowed values of runaway, water hammer and minimum closing time of the guide vanes).

50|$|Self-pulsation is a <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in continuous-wave lasers. Self-pulsation {{takes place}} at the {{beginning}} of laser action. As the pump is switched on, the gain in the active medium rises and exceeds the steady-state value. The number of photons in the cavity increases, depleting the gain below the steady-state value, and so on. The laser pulsates; the output power at the peaks can be orders of magnitude larger than that between pulses. After several strong peaks, the amplitude of pulsation reduces, and the system behaves as a linear oscillator with damping. Then the pulsation decays; {{this is the beginning of}} the continuous-wave operation.|$|E

50|$|Microlensing {{is caused}} by the same {{physical}} effect as strong lensing and weak lensing, but it is studied using very different observational techniques. In strong and weak lensing, the mass of the lens is large enough (mass of a galaxy or a galaxy cluster) that the displacement of light by the lens can be resolved with a high resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope. With microlensing, the lens mass is too low (mass of a planet or a star) for the displacement of light to be observed easily, but the apparent brightening of the source may still be detected. In such a situation, the lens will pass by the source in a reasonable amount of time, seconds to years instead of millions of years. As the alignment changes, the source's apparent brightness changes, and this can be monitored to detect and study the event. Thus, unlike with strong and weak gravitational lenses, a microlensing event is a <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon</b> from a human timescale perspective.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{dates to}} the {{beginnings}} of classical economics in the late 18th century, {{and there is a}} long-running debate on the existence, causes, and solutions of a general glut. Some classical and neoclassical economists argue that there are no general gluts, advocating a form of Say's law (conventionally but controversially phrased as [...] "supply creates its own demand"), and that any idling is due to misallocation of resources between sectors, not overall, because overproduction in one sector necessitates underproduction in others, as is demonstrable in severe price falls when such alleged 'malinvestment' in gluts clear; unemployment is seen as voluntary, or a <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon</b> as the economy adjusts. Others cite the frequent and recurrent economic crises of the economic cycle as examples of a general glut, propose various causes and advocate various solutions, most commonly fiscal stimulus (government deficit spending), a view advocated in the 19th and early 20th century by underconsumptionist economists, and in the mid to late 20th and 21st century by Keynesian economics and related schools of economic thought.|$|E

ALPO adopted a similar structure with sections like that of the British Astronomical Association (BAA) in order to properly study the objects observed. ALPO established interest sections as needed, such as the Saturn Section. Each section would be directed by an individual known as a [...] "recorder", which later became known as [...] "coordinator" [...] (a term still used today). Julius L. Benton still serves to the present day as the first coordinator of the ALPO Saturn Section since its founding in 1971. One of its most active sections over the decades has been its Lunar Section which would record, extensively draw, and record features on the Earth's Moon, including transient lunar phenomenon (TLP) known as lunar <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon</b> (LTP). ALPO's [...] "Lunar Recorder" [...] for 1957-1961 was Alika K. Herring, an individual whose drawings of lunar craters would appear several times in the astronomical magazine Sky & Telescope.
