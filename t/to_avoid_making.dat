5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, biographers {{began writing}} about Lenin {{soon after his}} death; some – like Christopher Hill – were {{sympathetic}} to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and Robert Gellately – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised {{him as a man}} who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, revisionists in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ella {{intensified}} {{quickly and}} reached hurricane status late on August31, based on confirmation from nearby ship reports and a Hurricane Hunters flight. At the time, the hurricane was forecast <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> landfall on North Carolina and ultimately turn northeastward, {{although it was}} expected to pass within 50miles (85km) of land during the busy Labor Day Weekend. On September1, Ella reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a major hurricane and a Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At {{the same time a}} short-wave trough reached the East Coast of the United States. The trough caused the hurricane to decelerate and turn slightly to the north, and a ridge behind the trough caused Ella to become nearly stationary for 24hours. During that time, the threat toward the North Carolina coast diminished, and concurrently, the winds decreased as the convection diminished.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the subject}} of self-control, Rachlin states that it {{is less of a}} subject of knowing that one should not do {{something}} and more a matter of patience. He considers those with strong self-control simply more “long-term behaviorally-oriented” or “far-sighted.” This concept of considering further implications in the future is related to many other fields, particularly Rachlin’s second interest of Behavioral Economics. He likens the ability to weight the options of the future <b>to</b> <b>avoiding</b> <b>making</b> short-term poor investments in exchange for profitable, more beneficial ones at a much later point in time.|$|R
5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, {{he makes}} a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld lost {{hydraulic}} {{pressure on the}} grid; he was required to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane. Fisichella did the same {{because he had a}} fuel leak in his car. When the race started, Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner, with Barrichello in second and Michael Schumacher in third. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for the position at the exit of Variante della Roggia and got ahead heading into the Curve di Lesmo. Further back, Trulli was hit by Button and was sent into a spin and became the first retirement of the race. Button made a pit stop {{at the end of the}} lap for a replacement front wing. Irvine made a good start, rising from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap, while Häkkinen made a poor gateway after going through the chicane <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth. Verstappen made the best start, moving from nineteenth to eighth. At the end of the first lap, Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello, who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, de la Rosa, Irvine, Verstappen, Räikkönen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Bernoldi, Häkkinen, Panis, Frentzen, Alonso, Enge, Heidfeld, Yoong, Fisichella and Button.|$|E
5|$|Pixar got {{its start}} in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology's (NYIT) founder Alexander Schure, who was also {{the owner of a}} {{traditional}} animation studio, established the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL), recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film. Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, which were the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab. Schure kept pouring money into the computer graphics lab, an estimated $15million, giving the group everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles. Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio in order to reach their goal, and when George Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees decided to move over to Lucasfilm. During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> Schure suspicious, before they joined The Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cover was}} further changed for release in the United Kingdom, as the two-finger {{sign with the}} back of the hand faced toward the viewer is {{considered}} an insult; the UK cover features the hand facing the opposite direction <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> this, <b>making</b> it instead the more optimistic gesture for [...] "Victory", even though {{it may not have been}} intended to be made insulting.|$|R
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Often forget to put things back in their proper place, or Am careful <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> mistakes. Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often forget to put things back in their proper place or Am careful <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> mistakes can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, Duncan {{attended}} the founding {{convention of the}} American Federation of Labor as a delegate of the Granite Cutters' union. He was elected second vice-president of the AFL in 1894 and served on its executive council, positions he would hold until his death. Duncan became one of Samuel Gompers' closest friends and confidantes.

25|$|In a February 4, 2008 {{article of}} the National Post, {{the show was}} faulted {{on the basis that}} it had some similar {{elements}} to the American show 24. There have also been some claims of anti-Americanism, shown in the character of LaGarda and the portrayal of the American government. The show has also been criticized for an unrealistic portrayal of cooperation between Canadian law enforcement and intelligence agencies, but it is acknowledged this was done in order <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> it too complicated for viewers.|$|E

5000|$|Performances are {{attended}} by teams of juries of local arts professionals (14 English, 8 French jurors in 2009).

25|$|The anger {{generated}} by this controversy affects JTS to this day. The sensitivity {{over this issue}} caused future JTS Chancellors Ismar Schorsch, and then Arnold Eisen <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> future halakhic decisions, and insisting that such issues be resolved by the CJLS, e.g. the issue of homosexuality. This was especially apparent as Schorsch was a strong proponent of not changing the movement's views on homosexuality, while Eisen was a proponent of making such changes. Despite their personal views, each felt it would be improper to overrule the CJLS.|$|E
25|$|The CNO {{orders of}} September 4 {{directed}} the patrols {{to report the}} movements of ships of warring nations in cipher. U.S. Navy ships were initially instructed <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> any report while {{in the vicinity of}} such ships to avoid performance of unneutral radio direction finding service or the impression that an unneutral service was being performed. On October 9, President Roosevelt instructed the navy to transmit reports promptly in plain English; and the Neutrality Patrol was instructed on October 20 to report contacts with plain-language radio transmissions.|$|E

50|$|In any {{education}} environment, careless {{mistakes are}} those errors {{that occur in}} areas within which the student has had training. Careless mistakes are common occurrences for students {{both within and outside}} of the learning environment. They are often associated with a lapse in judgment or what are known as mind slips because the students had know-how <b>to</b> have <b>avoided</b> <b>making</b> the mistakes, but did not for undeterminable reasons. Given that students that are competent of the subject and focused are most likely to make careless mistakes, concerns for students exhibiting careless mistakes often turn toward neurological disorders as the cause.|$|R
50|$|Female {{speckled}} hummingbirds incubate {{and feed}} nestlings. The incubation period lasts approximately 17-20 days. The species broods for shorter durations than most hummingbirds during incubation. Speckled hummingbirds often travel several kilometers <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> competition, <b>making</b> visits <b>to</b> the nest less frequent. After the young hatch, the adult continues brooding hatchlings for 7-8 days. After brooding {{and until the}} young have fledged, the adult will no longer enter the nest and instead perches nearby, potentially watching for predators. This behavior is curious, as perching outside a nest may alert predators of its location.|$|R
25|$|Where a vehicle, {{such as the}} M50 Ontos, used {{multiple}} barrels, spotting rifles {{were usually}} provided for each barrel so that each could be accurately boresighted to its own barrel. The Ontos used six barrels with four spotting rifles; two without, <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> an already tall vehicle even higher. This provision may have been over-generous, although it did also increase the magazine capacity available for repeated ranging shots. Many photographs of the Ontos in service in Vietnam show it with {{only two of the}} spotting rifles installed in their mounts. The Ontos also often only carried four or even two main gun tubes.|$|E
25|$|When around forty manga {{chapters}} {{had been}} published, Arakawa {{said that as}} the series was nearing its end and she would try to increase {{the pace of the}} narrative. <b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> some chapters less entertaining than others, unnecessary details from each of them were removed and a climax was developed. The removal of minor details was also necessary because Arakawa had too few pages in Monthly Shōnen Gangan to include all the story content she wanted to add. Some characters' appearances were limited in some chapters. At first, Arakawa thought the series would last twenty-one volumes but the length increased to twenty-seven. Serialization finished after nine years, and Arakawa was satisfied with her work because she had told everything she wanted with the manga.|$|E
25|$|The {{principles}} {{behind the}} independence of New Zealand began before New Zealand even became a British colony in 1840. There had been minor rebellions in Canada, and in order <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> the mistakes which had led to the American revolution, Lord Durham was commissioned {{to make a report}} on the government of colonies which contained a substantial British population. The principles of self-government within the Empire were laid down in the Durham Report and first put into operation in Nova Scotia in 1848. Canada, New Zealand, and the Australian colonies very soon followed suit. The British Parliament passed the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 to grant the colony's settlers the right to self-governance, only 12 years (in 1853) after the founding of the colony. New Zealand was therefore to all intents and purposes independent in domestic matters from its earliest days as a British colony.|$|E

25|$|Despite wanting <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> the {{character}} a composite, Judi Beecher provided Madison's voice, {{as well as}} her facial motion capture. Heavy Rain marked Beecher's first role in a video game, having previously had a background in theatre. Beecher came on late to the project, and the first demo – The Taxidermist, in which Madison was voiced by Barbara Scaff – had already been made, before it was decided to recast {{the character}}. Beecher was contacted by her French agent in July 2008, after Quantic Dream had heard her voice demo and requested her, and told to audition. The audition involved a cold reading of 5 or 6 different scenes with different endings. The developers considered having her do the body capture, but were concerned that it would not match the movements of the shorter Ainsley, and were not willing to redo all the motion capturing. Madison had 150 pages of scripted dialogue; due to the motion capture, the script could not be seen and thus had to be learnt, which took Beecher roughly a month.|$|E
500|$|Starkiller was {{designed}} as Luke Skywalker's photo-negative, and is named after [...] "Annikin Starkiller" [...] (Luke Skywalker's original name in the early Star Wars scripts). The developers tried <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> Starkiller too rigidly defined while keeping the character developed. The developers also wanted <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> Starkiller seem irredeemably evil, and used elements of his backstory and his relationships with other characters to balance it, while trying not to explain too much of his backstory. In {{order to avoid the}} character being over emotional, they tried to let short pieces of dialogue and looks carry scenes so that the player could interpret how Starkiller felt. They attempted to make Starkiller feel like he would belong in the classic Star Wars trilogy by making his actions faster and more intense. During an interview to Haden Blackman by The Guardian, he claimed that most of the testing players wanted the character to be ultimately redeemed {{by the end of the}} game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{high-quality}} parallel corpus {{needs to}} be man-ually created to achieve good machine translation for the domains which {{do not have enough}} existing resources. Although the quality of the corpus to some extent can be improved by asking the professional translators to translate, it is impossible <b>to</b> completely <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> any mistakes. In this paper, we propose a framework for cleaning the existing professionally-translated parallel corpus in a quick and cheap way. The proposed method uses a 3 -step crowdsourcing procedure to efficiently detect and edit the translation flaws, and also guarantees the reliability of the edits. The experiments using the fashion-domain e-commerce-site (EC-site) parallel corpus show the effectiveness of the proposed method for the parallel corpus cleaning.
