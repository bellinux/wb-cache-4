5|$|That night I {{asked the}} Mother of God {{what was to}} become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> persevere in purity, and the red <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Thoreau {{followed}} various Hindu customs, including {{following a}} diet of rice ("It was fit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India."), flute playing (reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of Krishna), and yoga.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the uneven}} {{relation}} of forces I am {{of the opinion}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have to sacrifice myself sooner or later. I have closed out my private life and am determined {{to carry out the}} assignment given to me honourably, one way or another.|$|E

25|$|He {{said this}} Aaronic Priesthood {{had not the}} power of laying on hands for {{the gift of the}} Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter; and he {{commanded}} us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize me.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney {{revealed}} {{that she had}} received a death threat from Hal Turner. She stated in the San Francisco Bay Review that Hal Turner 'announced to his listeners in 2006 <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be lynched {{on my way to}} vote.' Mr. Turner was on the FBI's payroll as an informant at the time.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E

6000|$|... "Cynthia," [...] he said, [...] "I {{would not}} by an act or a word annoy or trouble you. If you bade me, I {{would go to}} the other side of the world to-morrow. You must know <b>that.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>should</b> come back again. You must know, <b>that,</b> too. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> come back again for you." ...|$|R
25|$|I had {{carefully}} learned to understand, about that experience which I could have upon things of rule, how fortune is failing or great, subject to such rule in common, so that otherwise I {{would have had}} scant reason to desire such a rule, had I not found myself obliged to it through God’s bidding and nature. Now it was of my acquaintance, that inasmuch as God had let me be born a prince, such as I then am born, then my good and my destruction were knotted into one with the common good; for every reason then, it was now my promise <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> take great pains about their well-being and good governance and management, and thereabout bear close concern.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
25|$|Took {{four hours}} to dress; and then it rained; ordered the tilbury and my umbrella, {{and drove to the}} fives' court; next to my tailors; put him off after two years tick; no bad fellow that Weston...broke three stay-laces and a buckle, tore the quarter of a pair of shoes, made so thin by O'Shaughnessy, in St. James's Street, that they were light as brown paper; what a pity they were lined with pink satin, and were quite the go; {{put on a pair of}} Hoby's; over-did it in {{perfuming}} my handkerchief, and had to recommence de novo; could not please myself in tying my cravat; lost three quarters of an hour by that, tore two pairs of kid gloves in putting them hastily on; was obliged to go gently to work with the third; lost another quarter of an hour by this; drove off furiously in my chariot but had to return for my splendid snuff-box, as I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> eclipse the circle by it.|$|E

25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

"If you bind {{me so that}} I am {{unable to}} release myself, then you will be {{standing}} by {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have to wait a long time before I got any help from you. I am reluctant to have this band put on me. But rather than that you question my courage, let someone put his hand in my mouth as a pledge that this is done in good faith." ...|$|E
500|$|.....that {{the young}} warriors {{of his great}} American father were not women, to be turned back by words; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{therefore}} proceed, and if he thought proper to stop me, he could attempt it; but that we were men, well armed, and would sell our lives at a dear rate to his nation; that we knew our great father would send his young warriors there to gather our bones and revenge our deaths on his people...|$|E

500|$|I'm {{trying to}} {{understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.|$|E
500|$|According to Inglis, [...] "Love You To" [...] is [...] "defined" [...] by {{the interplay}} between sitar and tabla. Bhagwat later {{recalled}} of his involvement: [...] "George told me what he wanted and I tuned the tabla with him. He suggested I play something in the Ravi Shankar style, 16-beats, though he agreed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> improvise. Indian music is all improvisation." [...] After rehearsing the song together many times, Harrison and Bhagwat recorded the sitar and tabla parts onto the vocal and guitar performance taped earlier that day.|$|E
500|$|It surpassed {{anything}} that I ever thought. [...] I didn't ever think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{be in the}} cathedral with the Queen and all the dignitaries that were there. [...] And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. [...] It's really been out of this world. [...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that {{and to have the}} Queen pass so close to me. [...] And yes, she smiled. [...] She smiled at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{mean that}} sounds! Oh, if I {{were a man}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> wish to be {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not, and nothing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> scorn to be a liar, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> choose to be open in all things, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> try to fight the world honestly.

500|$|... "I {{think my}} father really decided for me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> work in fashion," [...] she {{recalled}} in The September Issue. He arranged for his daughter's first job, at the influential Biba boutique, {{when she was}} 15. The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods. At her parents' behest, she also took fashion classes at a nearby school. Soon she gave them up, saying, [...] "You either know fashion or you don't." [...] Another older boyfriend, Richard Neville, gave her {{her first experience of}} magazine production at his popular and controversial Oz.|$|E
500|$|My disgust at this {{proposition}} was, I think, chiefly due to Victor Hugo's latter novels, which I regard as pretentious and untrue to nature. To this perhaps was added some feeling of indignation <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{be asked to}} give way to a Frenchman. The Frenchman had broken his engagement. He had failed to have his work finished by the stipulated time. From week to week and from month to month he had put off the fulfilment of his duty. And because of these laches on his part,— on the part of this sententious French Radical,— I was to be thrown over! ...|$|E
500|$|Stefanie {{stated in}} later {{interviews}} {{that she was}} unaware of Hitler at the time, but that she had received an anonymous love letter asking her {{to wait for him}} to graduate and then to marry him, which she only realised after being questioned about him, must have been from Hitler. She recalled: [...] "I once received a letter from someone who said they were to attend the Academy of Arts, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> wait for him; he could come back and marry me! I had no idea who the letter might have been from or who I should have send it to." ...|$|E

50|$|All <b>That</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Should</b> Be is {{the debut}} album of South African band Plush, {{released}} on 1 March 2004. It features 12 acoustic tracks by the band. Tainted reached no. 1 on local radio station Tuks FM, while the songs Today and My Baby received regular radio play with My Baby receiving airtime on MTV.|$|R
