5|$|A {{high-pressure}} area, high or anticyclone is {{a region}} where the atmospheric pressure at the surface of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> greater than its surrounding environment.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{not known}} to transit from Earth and {{atmospheric}} conditions are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the planet has been confirmed to date. As such, all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the main}} rings at a {{distance}} of 12 million km from <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> the sparse Phoebe ring, which is tilted at an angle of 27° to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{secondary}} transit of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> reported. Full {{observation of}} phases of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> reported in September 2014.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} by observing {{the amount of}} stellar flux reaching the Earth. The existence of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by also observing the reflected starlight from <b>the</b> <b>planet,</b> <b>the</b> shape of the star due to gravitational tug from <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> and radial velocity method. Finally, part of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> found transiting <b>the</b> parent star with secondary occultation also being detected.|$|R
50|$|The {{method in}} which <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{detected}} {{is similar to}} the way that <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Neptune <b>was</b> discovered, in which <b>the</b> newly discovered <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> known by its pull on another which is already known to exist.|$|R
5|$|Due to its extreme {{distance}} from the Sun, Planet Nine would reflect little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. It {{is expected to have}} an apparent magnitude fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than Pluto. If Planet Nine exists and is close to its perihelion, astronomers could identify it based on existing images. For its aphelion, the largest telescopes would be required. However, if <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> currently located in between, many observatories could spot Planet Nine. Statistically, <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> more likely to be closer to its aphelion at a distance greater than 500 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their aphelion, in accordance with Kepler's second law.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the planet}}'s high mass, <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> a gas giant with no solid surface. Since the planet {{has only been}} {{detected}} indirectly, parameters such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b has an orbital {{inclination}} of 86.7º {{as seen from}} Earth. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is,</b> thus, almost edge-on when seen from Earth. The planet has been observed to transit its host star.|$|E
50|$|COROT-1b (previously named COROT-Exo-1b) <b>is</b> an extrasolar <b>planet</b> {{approximately}} 1,560 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of Monoceros. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> discovered orbiting <b>the</b> yellow dwarf star COROT-1 in May 2007. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first discovery by the French-led COROT Mission.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} by <b>the</b> N2K Consortium in 2005, which searches stars for closely orbiting giant planets similar to 51 Pegasi b using the highly successful radial velocity method. The {{spectrum of the}} star was studied from the Keck and Subaru Telescopes. After <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> first detected from the Doppler effect it caused {{in the light of}} the host star, it was studied for transits at the Fairborn Observatory. A tiny decrease of light (0.003 magnitudes) was detected every time <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> transiting <b>the</b> star, thus confirming its existence.|$|R
50|$|In May 2011, <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{detected}} by brightness {{variations of the}} star cause by reflected starlight from <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> It <b>was</b> found that Kepler-7b has a relatively high geometric albedo of 0.3.|$|R
5|$|In the 5-planet {{solution}} for the 55 Cancri system, the orbit of 55 Cancri c is mildly eccentric: at apoastron <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> about 19% further from the star than it is at periastron. It is located closer to 55 Cancri A than Mercury is to our sun, though it has a longer orbital period than the hot Jupiters. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> located close to a 3:1 resonance with the inner planet 55 Cancri b; however, simulations indicate that the two planets are not actually in this resonance.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is {{the only}} known {{exoplanet}} in the orbit of host star MOA-2009-BLG-387L. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be 2.6 times the mass of Jupiter. However, because knowledge of the exact parameters of the planet {{are tied to the}} host star's parameters, and the host star's parameters are not well-constrained, uncertainty places MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass between 1.0 and 6.7 times that of Jupiter. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> estimated to orbit its host star every 1970 days at a distance of 1.8 AU, some 1.8 times the mean distance between Earth and the Sun. Uncertainty broadens the mean distance to between 1.1 and 2.7 AU.|$|E
5|$|Since 47 Ursae Majoris c was {{detected}} indirectly, properties {{such as its}} radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Based on its high mass, <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{likely to be a}} gas giant with no solid surface.|$|E

5|$|The gaseous {{content of}} <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{calculated}} {{at a few}} percent of its total mass, but the envelope accounts for 70-80% of the planet's total volume.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{unlikely}} to have large moons, since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales relative {{to the age of}} the system.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to {{the plane of the}} sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°. Planet c's inclination is unknown.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, a circumbinary Neptune-sized <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> found transiting <b>the</b> {{brighter}} star.

5|$|A long-standing {{mystery of}} Venus {{observations}} {{is the so-called}} ashen light—an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but {{the existence of the}} illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{its high}} mass, Gliese 876 c {{is likely to}} be a gas giant with no solid surface. Since it was {{detected}} indirectly through its gravitational effects on the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> predicted to have a cloudless upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} in the orbit of HAT-P-33, which lies 1,367 light years away from Earth. Its {{discovery}} was reported in June 2011, although it was suspected to be a planet as early as 2004. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this inflation has, as {{with the discovery of}} similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, raised the question of what (other than temperature) causes these planets to become so large.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} by <b>the</b> HATNet Project and the researchers there believed <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> to <b>be</b> 10-20% larger than Jupiter.

5|$|However, because <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{rotating}} {{underneath the}} atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted {{due to the}} Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference. Viewed from above this twist in wind direction {{is in the same}} direction as the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-9c is a gas giant that {{is smaller}} and {{slightly}} less massive than planet Saturn. It is approximately 0.171 MJ, or 17% {{the mass of}} planet Jupiter. It also has a radius of 0.823 RJ, which makes it slightly smaller (1.5%) than Saturn. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is,</b> on average, situated 0.225 AU from the star.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is an {{exoplanet}} in {{the orbit}} of the red dwarf MOA-2009-BLG-387L. Its discovery was announced on February 21, 2011, making it the eleventh planet discovered using gravitational microlensing. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> thought to be over twice the mass of Jupiter and to have an orbit 80 percent larger than that of Earth's, lasting approximately 1,970 days.
