25|$|Along {{with the}} {{recording}} contracts Blackwell was handing out, {{he also wanted}} to make a go-go film and soundtrack; a D.C.-based version of The Harder They Come, perhaps. The resultant film, Good <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> (<b>or</b> Short Fuse, as it was called on video) was plagued with problems: co-director Don Letts was let go halfway through production, the film became less about the music and more about drugs and violence, {{and despite the fact that}} most of the post-production was completed in the fall of 1985, the film was held for release until late-summer 1986. When it did poorly on release, it seemed that go-go had missed its best chance to break into the mainstream.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} did {{not escape}} criticism, however, with Tom Chick of IGN criticising {{the layout of}} the levels: [...] "The levels can be awfully linear, throwing you up against some frustrating brick walls where you don't know where <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>or</b> what you're supposed to do next. There are some bald key hunts." [...] The artificial intelligence of hostile NPCs received mixed reactions. GameSpot's Ron Dulin praised the AI, saying that they help the suspension of disbelief. Chi Kong Lui of Gamecritics.com, however, gave the opposite view: [...] "Enemy artificial intelligence is still pretty mindless and blasting them doesn't require much skill." ...|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{steadily}} improved {{during their}} time in Hamburg, and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time. McCartney recalled, [...] "We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us. The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would {{come in from the}} Top Ten (the big club where we aspired <b>to</b> <b>go)</b> <b>or</b> when Rory Storm or Ringo [...] would hang around to watch us. ‘What'd I Say’ was always the one that really got them." [...] The song was often played by the group, once being played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning. Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying, [...] "We have improved a thousand-fold since our arrival and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the CBS {{press release}} for Rawhide, the Universal (known then as Universal-International) film company was {{shooting}} in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and {{invited him to}} meet the director. According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio, where he showed him to cameraman Irving Glassberg. Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin, who, although very impressed with Clint's appearance and stature at 6'4" [...] (193cm), disapproved initially of his acting skills, remarking, [...] "He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>or</b> do anything". [...] Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week. After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.|$|E
500|$|The Act next {{establishes}} a uniform duty towards all lawful visitors, thus abolishing {{the distinction between}} contractors, invitees and licensees. Section 2 provides that the occupier extend a [...] "common duty of care" [...] to all lawful visitors, although it keeps the low duty of care towards unlawful visitors such as trespassers. This duty is described as [...] "a duty to take such care as in all {{the circumstances of the}} case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there". The Act allows the occupier to set limits on where the visitor is allowed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>or</b> how long they are allowed to be there, an extension of the common law judgment made by Scrutton LJ in The Calgarth , when he said that [...] "when you invite a person into your house to use the staircase, you do not invite him to slide down the bannisters, you invite him to use the staircase in the ordinary way in which it is used".|$|E

[...] It was also used by U.S. Navy nuclear submarines to clear their sonar dead zones.|$|E
2500|$|Cooper: John Alden. Alden was a 21-year-old from Harwich in Essex and {{a distant}} {{relative}} of Captain Jones. He hired on apparently while the Mayflower was anchored at Southampton Waters. He {{was responsible for}} maintaining the ship's barrels, known as hogsheads, which were critical to the passengers' survival and held {{the only source of}} food and drink while at sea; tending them was a job which required a crew member's attention. Bradford noted that Alden was [...] "left to his own liking <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>or</b> stay" [...] in Plymouth rather than return with the ship to England. He decided to remain.|$|E
2500|$|A {{stopping}} time {{with respect to}} a sequence of random variables X1,X2,X3,... is a random variable τ with the property that for each t, the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event τ = t depends only on the values of X1,X2,X3,...,Xt. The intuition behind the definition is that at any particular time t, {{you can look at the}} sequence so far and tell if it is time to stop. [...] An example in real life might be the time at which a gambler leaves the gambling table, which might be a function of his previous winnings (for example, he might leave only when he goes broke), but he can't choose <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>or</b> stay based on the outcome of games that haven't been played yet.|$|E

Gordon did not declare his love until he came to say good-bye to her before leaving for Australia on 7 August 1853. [...] "With characteristic recklessness he offered to sacrifice the passage he had taken to Australia, and all his father's plans for giving him a fresh start in life, if she would tell him not <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>or</b> promise to be his wife, or even give him some hope."
