[...] "I have in my Testamentary arrangements secured your comfort," [...] she wrote to him, [...] "and have constantly <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> well. The long letter I enclose which was written nearly a month ago is entirely and solely my own idea, not a human being will ever know of it or what you answer me. If you can't read it I will help you and then burn it at once." [...] She told Reid the squabbles placed her and the Munshi under strain, which he replied was unlikely in the latter's case [...] "judging from his robust appearance and undiminished stoutness". Lord Salisbury told Reid he thought it unlikely in her case too, and that she secretly enjoyed the arguments because they were [...] "the only form of excitement she can have".|$|E
500|$|Arriving in Geneva on December 26, the Christmas Eve, Balzac {{stayed at}} the Auberge de l'Arc, near the Maison Mirabaud where the Hański family had settled for the season. She left a ring {{for him at the}} hotel, with a note asking for a new promise of love. He gave it, and {{described}} how he began wearing the ring on his left hand, [...] "with which I hold my paper, so that the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> clasps me tight." [...] At this time he began working on a philosophical novel, Séraphîta, about a hermaphroditic angel united by the love of a mortal man for a compassionate and sensual woman. Balzac explained that she was his model for the latter. It was clear to all that Hański was in ill health, and Hańska began to think about her future with the French author. In the meantime, she asked Balzac to begin collecting for her autographs of the famous people he spent time with in Paris and elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard came to {{hope that}} no one would retain their sins even though they have been forgiven. And by the same token that no one who truly {{believed}} in the forgiveness of sin would live their own life as an objection against the existence of forgiveness. He made the point that Cato committed suicide before Caesar had a chance to forgive him. This fear of not finding forgiveness is devastating. Edna H. Hong quoted Kierkegaard in her 1984 book, Forgiveness is a Work As Well As a Grace and Kierkegaard wrote about forgiveness in 1847. [...] In 1954, Samuel Barber set to music Kierkegaard's prayer, [...] "Father in Heaven! Hold not our sins up against us but hold us up against our sins so that the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>You</b> when it wakens in our soul, and each time it wakens, should not remind us of what we have committed but of what You did forgive, not of how we went astray but of how You did save us!" ...|$|E
