The paper proposes a novel car ignition system to replace the traditional wired technology and enhance vehicle security. This new system uses wireless transmissions to start the engine and hence eliminates the ignition wire behind the dashboard. It also allows the user to set a password of his/her choice to keep the system protected. A <b>theft</b> <b>alarm</b> that goes ??????ON?????? when an unusual activity is sensed and/or when the wrong password is attempted to unlock the system is integrated in the system. Moreover, important factors such as economic feasibility, adaptability to the new vehicle technologies and customers??? preferences have been taken into consideration in the design of the proposed vehicle security system...|$|E
50|$|Being a major {{investor}} in Ninebot, a Chinese company that acquired the self-balancing scooter manufacturer Segway, Xiaomi released a self-balancing scooter called Ninebot Mini for CNY 1,999 on 19 October 2015. It was released for Chinese market only. The scooter has a maximum speed of 16 kph (10 mph), a 15-degree incline climbing capability, {{a range of}} 22 km on a single charge, and a recharging time of three hours. It weighs 13 kilograms (28 lbs). Users can monitor speed, check vehicle condition, update firmware, receive <b>theft</b> <b>alarms</b> and remotely control the vehicle via a smartphone app. The scooter can learn and adapt to users' driving habits.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes and {{implements}} a {{low cost}} object tracking system using GPS and GPRS. The system allows a user {{to view the}} present and the past positions recorded of a target object on Google Map through the internet. The system reads the current position of the object using GPS, the data is sent via GPRS service from the GSM network towards a web server using the POST method of the HTTP protocol. The object’s position data is then stored in the database for live and past tracking. A web application is developed using PHP, JavaScript, Ajax and MySQL with the Google Map embedded. The existing live tracking systems that are available now a days use SMS for the communication to the server {{which turned out to be}} expensive. (SMS are used for communication to device). We have used the GPRS service which made our system a low cost tracking solution for localizing an object position and status. This system is very useful for car <b>theft</b> situations (<b>alarm</b> alert, engine starting, localizing), for adolescent drivers being watched and monitored by parents (speed limit exceeding, leaving a specific area), as well as for human and pet tracking...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Advances in {{wireless}} {{networking and}} small, low-power {{storage and processing}} technologies are bringing ubiquitous computing closer to reality. We are nowhere near the vision articulated by Weiser in which computers disappear {{into the fabric of}} everyday life. But we do have cellular phones, smart cards, personal digital assistants (PDA) with wireless web connections, and limited deployments of many other devices, like positioning sensors and <b>theft</b> <b>alarm</b> systems in automobiles and cameras in traffic lights. In the future, extremely large numbers of devices will be deployed for myriad purposes. There are tremendous technical challenges to building scalable infrastructures for decentralized and ad hoc networking with adequate performance to meet application objectives. Just as great are the challenges in eliminating the many weaknesses of current technologies which make them vulnerable to attacks with potentially catastrophic consequences in economic terms and for national security. This paper surveys a project that addresses the problem as to how to meet both security and performance goals in applications using ad hoc short-range (wireless) networking and extensible software architecture bringing together two lines of security research, cryptographic protocol design and static program analysis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} transport {{telematic services}} (TTSs) for road-based {{heavy goods vehicle}} (HGV) transport and suggests a method for assessing the societal value of different TTSs. For decision making related to the selection of services to promote by potential investors, for example, governmental organisations and service providers, quantified service value can simplify the decision process by enabling comparison between TTSs. Moreover, these values can serve as inputs to quantitative analysis of service architectural system designs. The authors suggest a method for assessing the societal values of TTSs using potential saving indicators (PSIs), estimated {{in the context of}} Swedish HGV freight transport. To illustrate the proposed method, 32 services are analysed, and their societal values were quantified and compared for the Swedish HGV market. Results based on estimated values of PSIs and potential percentage savings indicate the following HGV-based TTSs to be of high societal potential: transport resource optimisation, dynamic traffic information, navigation, road hindrance warning, <b>theft</b> <b>alarm</b> and recovery, accident warning information, intelligent speed adaptation, eCall, en-route driver information, transport order handling, road user charging and sensitive goods monitoring.

40|$|Abstract. A {{smart home}} {{structure}} using network (internet, intranet, wireless etc.) is designed and developed {{to monitor the}} circumstances and control the appliances in the house when sensors are triggered by some unexpected cases. A good host of low-cost sensors is used to make anti <b>theft</b> <b>alarm,</b> fire alarm, smog alarm etc. And then transmitted these data got from the measuring devices to neutral module. The neutral module is constructed by ARM-S 3 C 6410 hardware and embedded Linux. It can transmit messages to the householders after processed. The householders can visit the web server {{to make it clear}} what happened in the house. Moreover, they can control some appliances to make incidences back to normal through the Internet. If the owners are holding mobile phones, the neutral module will transmit text messages to them. In turn, they can also control the appliances by sending some specific instructions. And then the neutral module will give some other messages as feedback. Additionally, visible interphone technology also makes function in this system. A LCD is organized in the neutral module, one person who stays in the house can make a good conversation with others through neutral platform. Finally, a series of experiments are posed to estimate the performance of our solution...|$|E

Each member agreed to furnish, at his own expense, six leather buckets and two stout linen bags, each marked with his name {{and the name of the}} company, which he was to bring to every fire. The buckets were for carrying water to extinguish the flames, and the bags were to receive and hold property which was in danger, to save it from risk of theft. The members pledged themselves to repair to any place in danger upon an alarm of fire with their apparatus. Some were to superintend the use of the water, others were to stand at the doors of houses in danger, and to protect the property from <b>theft.</b> On an <b>alarm</b> of fire at night it was agreed that lights should be placed in the windows of houses of members near the fire [...] "in order to prevent confusion, and to enable their friends to give them more speedy and effectual assistance.' ...|$|R
