25|$|The core {{elements}} of the bodily-kinesthetic intelligence are control of one's bodily motions {{and the capacity to}} handle objects skillfully. Gardner elaborates <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> also includes a sense of timing, a clear sense of the goal of a physical action, along with the ability to train responses.|$|E
25|$|TB {{involving}} the brain or spinal cord (meningitis, encephalitis, etc.) is currently treated with 2HREZ/10HR (12 months of treatment in total), {{but there is}} no evidence <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is superior to 2HREZ/4HR, it is merely that no-one has been brave enough to do the clinic trial that answers the question if the short course is equivalent.|$|E
25|$|It was Laplace {{who found}} the first answers {{explaining}} the remarkable dance of the Galilean moons (see below). It is fair <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> general field of study has remained very active since then, with plenty more yet to be understood (e.g., how interactions of moonlets with particles of the rings of giant planets result in maintaining the rings).|$|E

25|$|The District Engineer {{requested}} on 30 September 1977 {{that the}} dock siding at Lyttelton station be removed {{on the basis}} that the track was in poor condition and that access to the siding by trains was blocked. The District Traffic Manager responded several days later <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> track had, in fact, been renewed, and that it was still required for the stabling of shunting locomotives and track maintenance vehicles.|$|E
25|$|According to Walter Cronkite, Khrushchev {{would go}} on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{incident}} {{was the beginning of}} his decline in power as party chairman, perhaps because he seemed unable to negotiate the international arena and the communist hardliners at home. The collapse of the summit also saw an increased tension between the Soviets and the Americans in the years to come. After this debacle the arms race accelerated and any considerations for negotiations were dashed for the immediate future.|$|E
25|$|Another case {{alluded to}} in the Torcaso v. Watkins footnote, and said by some to have {{established}} secular humanism as a religion under the law, is the 1957 tax case of , 249 F.2d 127 (D.C. Cir. 1957). The Washington Ethical Society functions much like a church, but regards itself as a non-theistic religious institution, honoring the importance of ethical living without mandating a belief in a supernatural origin for ethics. The case involved denial of the Society's application for tax exemption as a religious organization. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the Tax Court's ruling, defined the Society as a religious organization, and granted its tax exemption. The Society terms its practice Ethical Culture. Though Ethical Culture {{is based on a}} humanist philosophy, it is regarded by some as a type of religious humanism. Hence, it would seem most accurate <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> case affirmed that a religion need not be theistic to qualify as a religion under the law, rather than asserting that it established generic secular humanism as a religion.|$|E

25|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} performed by Zheng et al. showed Tianyuraptor to be a basal {{member of a}} group containing Laurasian dromaeosaurids. Tianyuraptor seems to possess several features that are unknown in other Laurasian dromaeosaurids, but which are seen in basal avialans and Gondwanan dromaeosaurids, including Austroraptor, Buitreraptor, Neuquenraptor, Rahonavis, and Unenlagia. Zheng and colleagues also noted that Tianyuraptor shares some features with the monophyletic subfamily Microraptorinae, though they went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> mixture of features suggests a basal placement for Tianyuraptor within Microraptorinae, as evidenced by their phylogenetic analysis which indicated maximum parsimony in six of the 30 results recovered by the analysis. The authors {{then go on to}} suggest that since Tianyuraptor is considered a short-armed microraptorine, more derived long-armed microraptorines might have independently evolved flight capability. However, it is also equally possible, as argued by Zheng et al., that Tianyuraptor may in fact be a basal member of a clade containing all other Laurasian dromaeosaurids with the exception of Microraptorinae. This is indicated by the other 24 out of 30 most parsimonious trees recovered from the analysis. The discovery of Tianyuraptor sheds new light on the early evolution of dromaeosaurs and further exemplifies the great diversity this group enjoyed at an early stage.|$|E
500|$|Aguilera's {{new image}} was so widely {{rejected}} by the public that it began to overshadow her music. Tim Walker from The Independent wrote: [...] " [...] simulated masturbation while wearing {{little more than a}} pair of leather chaps." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Aguilera's image in the video as [...] "the world's skeeziest reptile woman," [...] and The Village Voice captioned her as a xenomorph from the Alien series. Aguilera's contemporaries Shakira, Kelly Osbourne, and Jessica Simpson expressed disapproval of the video. Time magazine commented that [...] "she appeared to have arrived on the set... direct from an intergalactic hooker convention." [...] Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone dubbed the video [...] "Girls Gone Wild: Beyond Thunderdome". Writer Emma Forrest remarked: [...] "What she's depicting is subcultures within sexuality, and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is normal young woman's sexuality is just not fair. ... Even Madonna never did that to girls." [...] Aguilera told Blender in response to the criticism: ...|$|E
500|$|As Jim recaps the Dundies for the camera, Pam {{stares at}} Jim with dazed fascination and then falls off her stool, and Dwight springs to her rescue, {{thinking}} Pam {{is having a}} seizure. [...] He then tries {{to take off his}} dress shirt and tie, but a Chili's employee stops him. [...] After the party is over, Pam runs to the camera and screams [...] "I would just like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the best Dundies ever! Whoo!". In the parking lot, Pam admits to Jim that it was she who wrote the graffiti. She begins to ask Jim a question, but stops when she notices the camera. A Chili's employee then talks to the camera and says that Pam apparently was sneaking drinks off of others' tables, which is against the restaurant's rules. [...] He then tells the audience that he Xeroxed her driver's license and she is never welcome at Chili's again. Jim helps Pam into Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) car and smiles as they leave.|$|E
5000|$|The Penguin Guide <b>to</b> Jazz <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> second Silkheart album by the New Horizons [...] "is also patchy, but the {{addition}} of Nicholson adds some fire and focus to the overall mix and Dawkins himself seems more contained." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Springsteen" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from many music critics. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song five stars out of five, calling it [...] "the best song {{from one of}} 2011's top country albums." [...] Matt Bjorke of Roughstock also gave the song five stars of five, writing that [...] "the strong, sing-a-long lyrics and driving, percussive melody brings Eric Church to an accessibility that he's previously never had." [...] Noah Eaton of Country Universe gave it an A-, {{saying that it is}} [...] "a gorgeous, bittersweet anthem-to-be that will likely leave even some more hardened hearts simultaneously smile and cry listening." [...] Eaton went on further <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> song would propel Church's career to the next level. American Songwriter chose the song for its Lyric of the Week feature, for the week of June 11, 2012. The song was nominated for two Grammy Awards [...] Best Country Solo Performance and Best Country Song [...] on December 12, 2012, but failed to win any of the awards at the ceremony in 2013.|$|E
500|$|The {{time period}} of {{recording}} was a high-point in musical style for both Joey and Johnny, though they directed their sound towards {{different styles of}} music: Joey's inspiration by pop music became evident in his writing, while Johnny's keenness of hard-rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on the album. Johnny thought that this did not result well for the band's sound, saying: [...] "I knew going in {{that this was not}} going to be the type of album I wanted. It really could have used another two of three punk songs...All I [...] want to do is keep our fans happy and not sell out. I'm fighting within the band. They are trying to [...] go lighter, looking for ways to be more commercial. I'm against the band for doing that." [...] Joey countered Johnny's point of preventing the band from selling out by explaining: [...] "By Road to Ruin [...] End of the Century, I was doing the majority of the songwriting. I started feeling that the Ramones were faceless; there were no individual identities in the band." [...] He went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> method worked well in the beginning of their career, but would later annoy Joey since [...] "everything [...] wrote, the band would take credit for." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wichita Linebacker" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "good". Despite this, he wrote a mixed review, opining that [...] "as far as mysteries go, this was a so-so one," [...] that [...] "the Hearst campus rapist story just doesn't {{seem to be getting}} the proper weight it requires," [...] and that [...] "there's also some strange tonal issues currently." [...] However, he praised the return of Weevil. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was also relatively critical, while focusing praise on Weevil's storyline. He referred to [...] "Wichita Linebacker" [...] as [...] "what I would expect were the show not so ambitious. Here, Veronica isn't going to Hearst College, she's going to Television College, where things that are college-y happen." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C+". [...] "I don't think it's being overly harsh <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was not one of this show's stronger or more exciting episodes. The writing was oddly flat, in the first place, and the attention to detail was subpar as well." [...] In addition, the reviewer criticized the show's treatment of its relationships. [...] "That's one of the things that's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship-centered show. I only hope they go somewhere with the gambling thing, because otherwise, in my opinion, this episode will have been a total waste of time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{origins of}} Lag BaOmer {{as a minor}} festival are unclear.

The Talmudic passage states that during the time of Rabbi Akiva, 24,000 of his students died from a divinely-sent plague during the counting of the Omer. The Talmud goes on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was because they did not show proper respect to one another.
