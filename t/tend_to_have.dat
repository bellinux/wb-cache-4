Large, touring motorcycles <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a high Koch index, sport motorcycles <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a medium Koch index, and scooters <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a low Koch index.

5|$|A {{virus has}} either a DNA or an RNA genome and {{is called a}} DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively. The vast {{majority}} of viruses have RNA genomes.

5|$|Pulmonary plethysmographs {{are used}} to measure {{functional}} residual capacity. Functional residual capacity cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity. The total lung capacity depends on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and 6 litres. Females <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a 20–25% lower capacity than males. Tall people <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. Thinner persons <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a larger capacity, and capacity can be increased by physical training as much as 40%.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{that share}} the same biosynthetic pathway <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the same first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{are similar}} to the adult female, but deeper brown below and paler above, with paler and less defined supercilia. Juveniles have broader buff feather edges, and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> looser, scruffier plumage, like {{moulting}} adults. Juvenile males <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> darker throats and white postoculars like adult males, while juvenile females <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> white throats. However, juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage: some juvenile males lack any markings of the adult male, and some juvenile females have male features. The bills of young birds are light yellow to straw, paler than the female's bill. Immature males have paler versions of the adult male's markings, which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage. By their first breeding season, young birds generally are indistinguishable from other adults, though they may still be paler during their first year.|$|E
30|$|In sum, our {{hypotheses}} received partial support. As expected, undergraduates <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> higher scientist identity {{when they}} reported receiving more instrumental and socioemotional mentoring; also, they <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lower scientist identity when their mentors reported engaging in more negative mentoring. Yet, {{in none of}} the three models did undergraduates’ and mentors’ ratings independently predict scientist identity.|$|R

5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the {{definition of a}} good (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E

5|$|On average {{within any}} one population, males <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fewer {{spots on the}} {{underside}} and are paler in colour than females. The latter are also larger with a strong female T. alba of a large subspecies weighing over 550g (19.4oz), while males are typically about 10% lighter. Nestlings are covered in white down, but the heart-shaped facial disk becomes visible soon after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Seeds {{and fruit}} form the major {{component}} of the diets of pigeons and doves. In fact, the family {{can be divided into}} the seed-eating or granivorous species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or frugivorous species (the other four subfamilies). The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. There are morphological adaptations {{that can be used to}} distinguish between the two groups: granivores <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi whereas the frugivores <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> thin walls. In addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{classification}} of endometrial carcinomas is based either on clinical and endocrine features (Type I and Type II), or histopathological characteristics (endometroid, serous, and clear-cell).
