5|$|Renal {{disease may}} lead to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost, there is a {{compensation}} by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid hormone. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as secondary hyperparathyroidism. If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Reverse {{transcription}} is {{the transfer}} of information from RNA to DNA (the reverse of normal transcription). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> {{to occur in the}} case of retroviruses, such as HIV, as well as in eukaryotes, in the case of retrotransposons and telomere synthesis.|$|E

5|$|The Moon orbits the Earth in {{approximately}} 27.3 days, {{relative to a}} fixed frame of reference. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as the sidereal month. However, during one sidereal month, Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal month: it is approximately 29.5 days. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as the synodic month and corresponds to what is commonly called the lunar month.|$|E
5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen {{have rarely}} {{played in the}} same {{division}} as their geographically closest rivals: Peterhead, Brechin City, Montrose, Arbroath, Elgin City, and Forfar Athletic, so rivalries have tended to come from further afield. Currently, Aberdeen have a minor rivalry with Inverness Caley Thistle, {{due to the fact}} both Aberdeen and Inverness are the two largest settlements in the north of Scotland. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as the North derby and has arisen since Inverness were first promoted to the SPL in 2004.|$|E

5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
5|$|Euler {{linked the}} nature of prime {{distribution}} with ideas in analysis. He proved that {{the sum of the}} reciprocals of the primes diverges.

5|$|Even if {{an ancient}} and {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity, humans could {{suffer from a}} loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity {{in such a way}} as to minimize unintended consequences. Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like humanity, to ensure that the less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as the zoo hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
5|$|If k is close, but not equal, to one, {{the second}} orbit resembles the first, but {{revolves}} gradually about {{the center of}} force; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as orbital precession (Figure3). If k is greater than one, the orbit precesses {{in the same direction}} as the orbit (Figure3); if k is less than one, the orbit precesses in the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people who}} develop SCSFLS feel the sudden onset of a severe and acute {{headache}}. It is a headache usually {{made worse by}} standing, typically becoming prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling {{to the point of}} incapacitation. Some patients with SCSFLS will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E

5|$|Neck {{stiffness}} usually presents {{six hours}} after initial onset of SAH. Isolated dilation of a pupil {{and loss of}} the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation {{as a result of}} rising intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull). Intraocular hemorrhage (bleeding into the eyeball) may occur in response to the raised pressure: subhyaloid hemorrhage (bleeding under the hyaloid membrane, which envelops the vitreous body of the eye) and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E
5|$|Non-aposematic {{species have}} often evolved {{to mimic the}} {{conspicuous}} markings of their aposematic counterparts. For example, the hornet moth is a mimic of the yellowjacket wasp; it resembles the wasp, but has no sting. A predator which avoids the wasp will to some degree also avoid the moth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as Batesian mimicry, after Henry Walter Bates, a British naturalist who studied Amazonian butterflies {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Batesian mimicry is frequency dependent: it is most effective when the ratio of mimic to model is low; otherwise, predators learn to recognise the impostors.|$|E
5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into {{more and more}} threads, those threads spend an {{ever-increasing}} portion of their time communicating with each other. Eventually, the overhead from communication dominates the time spent solving the problem, and further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases {{the amount of time}} required to finish. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as parallel slowdown.|$|E
