25|$|The {{projection}} of a vector {{on a plane}} is its orthogonal projection on <b>that</b> <b>plane.</b> The rejection of a vector from a plane is its orthogonal projection on a straight line which is orthogonal to <b>that</b> <b>plane.</b> Both are vectors. The first {{is parallel to the}} plane, the second is orthogonal. For a given vector and plane, the sum of projection and rejection is equal to the original vector.|$|E

50|$|On 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 {{was shot}} down over Ukraine. Because it, like Flight 370, was also a Boeing 777, some {{conspiracy}} theorists have suggested <b>that</b> the <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> crashed in Ukraine was actually Flight 370. This is {{based in part on}} photographs of the crash scene, which conspiracy theorists claim show <b>that</b> the <b>plane</b> <b>that</b> crashed in Ukraine had structural differences from MH17. Experts have dismissed this theory and argued that it is merely coincidental <b>that</b> both <b>planes</b> involved belonged to the same airline.|$|R

25|$|Numerous people {{claimed that}} they saw the plane crash, {{but all of them}} were giving {{different}} locations. Some people claimed <b>that</b> the <b>plane</b> crashed into Palopo Mountains, while others claimed <b>that</b> the <b>plane</b> crashed near Sidrap waterfall. A young student, claimed <b>that</b> the <b>plane</b> was flying very low, and had smoke on the wing, then impacted the sea at the Luwu shoreline. Some villagers also stated <b>that</b> the <b>plane</b> flew into the Barru and Pare-Pare sea. BASARNAS stated that there are possibilities <b>that</b> the <b>plane</b> flew off course, using a different route and flew over the shoreline due to the mountains in the west.

25|$|A similar {{incident}} with an A320 occurred on an America West Airlines flight in February 1999 in Columbus, Ohio (Flight 2811).

25|$|Another way {{to imagine}} wormholes {{is to take}} a sheet of paper and draw two {{somewhat}} distant points {{on one side of the}} paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding <b>that</b> <b>plane</b> so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.|$|E

25|$|Soil is an {{assemblage}} of particles that have little to no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress on <b>that</b> <b>plane.</b> The {{angle of internal friction}} is thus closely related to the maximum stable slope angle, often called the angle of repose.|$|E
25|$|Given a curve {{contained}} on the x-y plane, its {{tangent vector}} T is also contained on <b>that</b> <b>plane.</b> Its binormal vector B can be naturally postulated {{to coincide with}} the normal to the plane (along the z axis). Finally, the curve normal can be found completing the right-handed system, N = B × T. This form is well-defined even when the curvature is zero; for example, the normal to a straight line on a plane will be perpendicular to the tangent, all co-planar.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{vacuum tubes}} {{are much less}} {{susceptible}} than corresponding solid-state components to transient overvoltages, such as mains voltage surges or lightning, the electromagnetic pulse effect of nuclear explosions or geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares. This property kept them in use for certain military applications long after more practical and less expensive solid-state technology was available for the same applications, as for example with the MiG-25. In <b>that</b> <b>plane,</b> output power of the radar is about one kilowatt and it can burn through a channel under interference.|$|E

According to eyewitness accounts, however, MacArthur arrived at Wake Island twelve hours ahead of Truman and {{was waiting for him}} at the airport when his plane landed.|$|R
25|$|These are {{generated}} by bivectors in a straightforward way. Simple rotations {{are generated}} by simple bivectors, with the fixed plane the dual or orthogonal {{to the plane}} of the bivector. The rotation can be said to take place about <b>that</b> <b>plane,</b> in {{the plane of the}} bivector. All other bivectors generate double rotations, with the two angles of the rotation equalling the magnitudes of the two simple bivectors the non-simple bivector is composed of. Isoclinic rotations arise when these magnitudes are equal, in which case the decomposition into two simple bivectors is not unique.|$|E
25|$|Klein {{showed that}} the modular group moves the {{fundamental}} region of the complex plane so as to tessellate <b>that</b> <b>plane.</b> In 1879, {{he looked at the}} action of PSL(2,7), thought of as an image of the modular group, and obtained an explicit representation of a Riemann surface today called the Klein quartic. He showed that that surface was a curve in projective space, that its equation was x3y+y3z+z3x=0, and that its group of symmetries was PSL(2,7) of order 168. His Ueber Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting potential theory and conformal mappings. This work drew on notions from fluid dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The planing {{hull form}} is {{configured}} to develop positive dynamic pressure {{so that its}} draft decreases with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the drag. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is {{to have at least}} one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats <b>that</b> <b>plane</b> must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.|$|E
40|$|A plane graph {{is called}} entirely k-choosable if, for any list {{assignment}} L such that |L(x) | = k for each x ∈ V (G) ∪ E(G) ∪ F (G), we can assign each element x a color from its list such that any two {{elements that are}} adjacent or incident receive distinct colors. Wang and Lih [13] conjectured <b>that</b> every <b>plane</b> graph is entirely (∆ + 4) -choosable. They showed <b>that</b> every <b>plane</b> graph with ∆ ≥ 12 is entirely (∆ + 4) -choosable and <b>that</b> every <b>plane</b> graph with ∆ ≥ 9 is entirely (∆ + 5) -choosable.

25|$|The canal {{is also a}} very vegetated place. In the {{beginning}} Pierre-Paul Riquet planted trees to stabilize the banks of the canal especially where it overlooked the surrounding lands. The willow was widely used for its rapid growth. The engineer also planted irises {{on the side of the}} canal to reduce subsidence of its banks. In the 18th century the trees planted along the canal become a source of income. So mulberries were planted for rearing silkworms. Then, with the end of the silk culture in 1772, the mulberry trees were replaced by the poplar from Italy which was the most productive wood. Structures and lock-keepers' houses were decorated with fruit trees. At the Revolution plantations around the canal had approximately 60,000 trees when there were only 45,000 at {{the beginning}}. It was under the First Empire <b>that</b> <b>Plane</b> trees began to be planted to replace the cut trees, which are today the dominant variety along the canal.|$|E
25|$|One of Wheatstone's most ingenious devices was the 'Polar clock,' {{exhibited}} at {{the meeting of the}} British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering <b>that</b> <b>plane</b> of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the apparent solar time obtained. The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a Nicol (double-image) prism for an eyepiece, and a thin plate of selenite for an object-glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole—that is, parallel to the Earth's axis—and the prism of the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875–1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.|$|E
25|$|At 8:38am, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Boston, Massachusetts, {{reported}} a possible hijacking {{and called the}} Otis Air National Guard Base control tower on Cape Cod, home to the Massachusetts ANG's 102d Fighter Wing, to request military assistance. At that time, Major Dan Nash and Lieutenant Colonel Tim Duffy had air defense alert duty for the 102d. At 8:40am Colonel Bob Marr, a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman serving as NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector commander, learned from the FAA that American Airlines Flight 11 might have been hijacked. The two pilots immediately suited up and headed for their F-15s. Marr ordered Nash and Duffy into the air; their F-15s were airborne within six minutes and as directed, headed for New York City, 153 miles away. Unknown to the pilots, American Airlines Flight 11 had crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City just as Colonel Marr was delivering his order. Meanwhile, at 8:43am, the FAA {{reported a}}nother possible hijacking to the Northeast Air Defense Sector. That was Boston to Los Angeles United Airlines Flight 175.
