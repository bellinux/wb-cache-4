5|$|Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent {{suggested}} that Spencer audition {{for the role}} of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might be similar to General Hospital. Once the actor saw <b>the</b> <b>scripts,</b> he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show ER. Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read <b>the</b> <b>scripts</b> and believed that the show would be either a hit or miss.|$|E

5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing <b>the</b> <b>scripts</b> for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as <b>the</b> <b>scripts</b> were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E

Michael Goddard notes that [...] "Ruiz would write <b>the</b> <b>script</b> each day immediately after the siesta; hence, in effect, dream <b>the</b> <b>script</b> rather than writing it." [...] Due to this writing process, it becomes evident that the film is heavily influenced from conceptions of dreams and their relationship to storytelling and the visual.|$|R

50|$|The {{spread of}} Burmese {{language}} {{was accompanied by}} that of <b>the</b> Burmese <b>script.</b> <b>The</b> <b>script</b> was developed from either <b>the</b> Mon <b>script</b> or <b>the</b> Pyu <b>script.</b> Mainstream scholarship holds that <b>the</b> Burmese <b>script</b> was developed from <b>the</b> Mon <b>script</b> in 1058, a year after Anawrahta's conquest of the Thaton Kingdom. But recent research by Aung-Thwin argues that <b>the</b> Burmese <b>script</b> may instead have been derived from <b>the</b> Pyu <b>script</b> in <b>the</b> 10th century, and that <b>the</b> Burmese <b>script</b> was <b>the</b> parent of <b>the</b> Burma Mon <b>script.</b> He argues that <b>the</b> Mon <b>script</b> found in Burma was sufficiently different from <b>the</b> older Mon <b>script</b> found in <b>the</b> Mon homelands of Dvaravati or Haripunjaya (in present-day Thailand) with no archaeological evidence to prove any linkage between the two. On the other hand, Aung-Thwin continues, the latest archaeological evidence dates <b>the</b> Burmese <b>script</b> 58 to 109 years ahead of <b>the</b> Burma Mon <b>script.</b> <b>The</b> earliest Burma Mon script (at Prome) is dated to 1093 while <b>the</b> earliest Burmese <b>script</b> (<b>the</b> copper-gilt umbrella inscription of the Mahabodhi Temple) is dated to 1035. Indeed, if a recast 18th century copy of an original stone inscription is permissible as evidence, <b>the</b> Burmese <b>script</b> had already been in use at least since 984 CE.|$|R
