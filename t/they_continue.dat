5|$|Making an {{exception}} for zero {{in the definition of}} evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers.

5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power.

While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E

5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System.

The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E
