50|$|The American Supply Company {{was founded}} in 1883 by the merger of three {{businesses}} involved {{in the manufacture of}} parts for large <b>textile</b> <b>weaving</b> <b>looms.</b> Myron Fish founded one of these companies in Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1860s, and was lured to Central Falls by the offer of manufacturing space in the Valley Falls complex. In 1876, Fish contracted with the Valley Falls Company to lease space across Broad Street {{for the construction of a}} dedicated manufacturing space. Fish specialized in manufacturing belts, but also made other parts. He merged in 1883 with John Kendrick, a manufacturer of similar specialty parts for looms, who was based in Providence. The new company was called the American Supply Company. In 1890 it greatly expanded the facility on Broad Street, building an ell that dwarfed the size of the original building; this was demolished about 2000, along with a boiler house and shed that also stood on the property.|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of modern, efficient technology has far-reaching {{consequences for the}} geography of economic activity, inequality and environmental quality. This article examines two popular yet highly controversial claims about the conditions most favorable to the rapid spread of new technology. The first states that latecomer advantage allows developing countries to diffuse new technology faster than developed countries. The second claim, widely articulated by advocates of neo-liberal policy reform, is that new technologies diffuse more rapidly where countries are “open” to international trade and investment. To investigate these claims we use event-history analysis to estimate the determinants of diffusion speed across a large panel of developed and developing countries for three very different technologies. These are: continuous steel casting, shuttleless <b>textile</b> <b>weaving</b> <b>looms</b> and digital telephone mainlines. Our results broadly support both propositions. Countries which adopt new technology later or have a smaller existing capital stock – characteristic features of developing countries – diffuse new technology more rapidly than countries that adopt earlier or have more installed capacity – two characteristics of developed countries. Trade openness is also found to influence the rate of diffusion positively for all three technologies. Yet, consistent with recent empirical studies, we fail to find support for the idea that foreign direct investment (FDI) accelerates the {{diffusion of}} new technology in host economies. The article concludes by discussing the geographical implications of our findings...|$|R
40|$|The ever-changing {{senses of}} {{consumption}} and fashion {{factor in the}} world have caused an ongoing increase on the demand towards hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> in recent years. Therefore, the prices of hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles,</b> where the supply is limited, are on the rise. It is known that Buldan city, one of the centers of hand woven production in Anatolia, has a significant commercial potential in this respect. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide an insight to the industry by comparing the profit margin of products <b>woven</b> in hand <b>looms</b> and automatic looms in textile industry in Buldan city and to raise awareness regarding the importance of production in hand looms. “Scarf”, which is the most produced textile item in Buldan, was preferred in the application study. In the study, the unit costs of the scarves woven with insect silk, floss silk, cotton and linen yarn, which are widely used in production, in hand looms and automatic looms were calculated and the profit margins to be calculated through the average sales prices were compared. At the end of the application study, it was seen that the profit margin of hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> was almost twice as high as the <b>textiles</b> <b>woven</b> in automatic <b>looms...</b>|$|R
50|$|Agriculture is {{the basic}} {{economic}} activity of the Tzeltal people. Traditional Mesoamerican crops such as maize, beans, squash, and chili peppers are the most important, but {{a variety of other}} crops, including wheat, manioc, sweet potatoes, cotton, chayote, some fruits, other vegetables, and coffee are also grown. Domestic animals include pigs, donkeys, cattle and domestic fowl. Those who live in larger villages tend to specialize in craft production, with surpluses traded through a regional market system. This system has links to the wider Mexican economic system. Handcrafts mostly consist of <b>textiles</b> <b>woven</b> on backstrap <b>looms</b> decorated with traditional Mayan designs. For women the most common item is huipils, shirts and tablecloths/napkins which are then used in the home or sold. The best textiles come from Tenejapa, Pantelhó, Larráinzar and Chenalhó. However, for many Tzeltal the income from these agriculture and crafts is not enough to support their families, and many work for wages as well.|$|R
