As the subject of the study were selected import mechanisms, structure and approaches to the implementation of which turned out to be significantly different in relation to the sectors of the Russian economy. Introduction US, EU and its allies of sanctions limitations with regard to the Russian economy was, in fact, tantamount to the top of these national policies aimed at the economic strangulation of Russia. It should be noted that most of these restrictions have been introduced, bypassing most of the activities of international organisations, and contrary to all norms of international law. The methodology of the study was to justify the illegality of the introduction of sanctions restrictions, assessing their impact on the development of the Russian economy on the basis of statistics of a number of specialized publications, organizations, ministries and departments, as well as the development of measures and mechanisms for their implementation, aimed at protecting the Russian economy from the negative effects sector and financial sanctions restrictions. The effectiveness of mechanisms for import substitution in practice has shown that the reorientation of domestic production in the replacement of imported components and equipment can be carried out in a fairly short period of time, and its results can significantly reduce the technological dependence of the majority of sectors of the Russian economy from the procurement of imported parts and equipment. So, in a number of key sectors of the Russian economy managed with the help of state support to pass quickly enough from the purchase of imported parts and equipment for the production of their domestic counterparts, technological characteristics and quality indicators are not inferior to foreign models. The leading role in achieving these results was the timely development and implementation of <b>the</b> <b>import</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the framework of sectoral strategies and development programs...|$|E

40|$|According to this USDA report, in 2002 / 03 EU sugar {{production}} rose 15 % to 18. 66 million tonnes. Indications {{are that}} the area under sugar has been reduced by 6. 5 % {{in response to a}} cut in sugar quotas in 2002 / 2003 and higher carry-over of stocks. Production in 2003 / 04 is projected to be 17. 4 million tonnes (raw sugar equivalent) under normal growing conditions. In October 2002 in response to WTO limits on EU sugar export subsidies and weak prices during most of 2002 the European Commission reduced sugar quotas by 7 % for the 2002 / 03 season. This cut of roughly 900, 000 tonnes came well after the 2002 / 03 crop had been sown, and so had no impact on overall production, but rather increased the level of 'C' sugar production. With this largely carried over to the following year, reduced planting for 2003 / 04 resulted. In 2001 / 02 EU imports of sugar increased to 2. 087 million tonnes raw sugar equivalent, with Serbia and Montenegro entering as the fifth largest source of <b>imports.</b> <b>The</b> opening up of the EU market to duty-free access from the western Balkans accounts for <b>the</b> increase in <b>imports</b> as <b>the</b> high-priced EU market sucks in imports. This however is mainly in the form of refined sugar. In outlining <b>the</b> EU's <b>import</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>the</b> USDA analysis quotes an ISO (International Sugar Organisation) study which, under conservative assumptions, projects imports of 1 million tons of raw sugar equivalent by 2009 from least developed countries, with this rising to 2. 9 million tonnes if expensive infrastructure investments occurred in these countries. The analysis reviews the basis for the extension of the EU sugar regime to new member states and the likely implications of such a move, most notably an expected increase in the EU's structural surplus of sugar. It notes that enlargement is increasing the pressure for an early reform of the sugar regime, since it will be much harder to reach a consensus on reform amongst 25 governments than amongst 15. However it is noted that budget limits will seriously constrain the reform options open to the EU, given {{the extent to which the}} current costs of the sugar regime are borne by EU consumers. Comment: EU 'C' sugar exports (sugar exported without a direct export subsidy) in 2002 / 03 at 3. 256 million tonnes once again exceeded EU sugar exports receiving a direct export subsidy which were 2. 348 million tonnes. In terms of imports from least developed countries it is not clear to what extent ISO projections take into account likely scenarios for reform of the EU sugar regime, for as the report notes least developed countries 'are not the lowest cost producers on the world market' and they may therefore 'find it difficult to compete if EU prices are lowered as a result of sugar reform'. According to this USDA report, in 2002 / 03 EU sugar production rose 15 % to [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model {{the case of}} an {{international}} non-renewable resource monopolist as a differential game between the monopolist and the governments of <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries, and we investigate whether a tariff on the resource importations can be advantageous for <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries. We find that the results depend crucially on the kind of strategies <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> country governments can play and on whether the monopolist chooses the price or the extraction rate. For a price-setting monopolist it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries cannot use a tariff to capture monopoly rents if they are constrained to use open-loop strategies, even if the governments sign a tariff agreement. This result is drastically modified if <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries in <b>the</b> tariff agreement use Markov (feedback) strategies. For a quantity-setting monopolist the nature of the game changes and an open-loop tariff is advantageous for <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries.
