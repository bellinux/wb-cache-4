5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E

In 1888, both Schubert's and Beethoven's graves were moved to the Zentralfriedhof where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> be found next to those of Johann Strauss II and Johannes Brahms. The cemetery in Währing was converted into a park in 1925, called the Schubert Park, and his former grave site was marked by a bust.|$|E

Australia {{is one of the}} many places L. cuprina are found, and the place where it has been known to cause the most havoc. Their wide distribution is due to movement patterns and the traveling of humans and livestock within the last century. Although <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> be found worldwide, the flies’ origins are linked to afrotropical and oriental regions of the world.|$|E

25|$|Prisons {{typically}} {{do not allow}} inmates to donate organs to anyone but immediate family members. There is no law against prisoner organ donation; however, the transplant community has discouraged use of prisoner's organs since the early 1990s due to concern over prisons' high-risk environment for infectious diseases. Physicians and ethicists also criticize the idea because a prisoner {{is not able to}} consent to the procedure in a free and non-coercive environment, especially if given inducements to participate. However, with modern testing advances to more safely rule out infectious disease and by ensuring that there are no incentives offered to participate, some have argued that prisoners can now voluntarily consent to organ donation just as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> consent to medical procedures in general. With careful safeguards, and with over 2 million prisoners in the U.S., they reason that prisoners can provide a solution for reducing organ shortages in the U.S.|$|E

500|$|The {{bookseller}} Isabelline Books {{argues that}} [...] "Yarrell’s History [...] probably contains the richest collection of colour descriptions in any bird {{book in the}} English language", with [...] "various parts of the Bee-Eater described as verditer blue, saffron-yellow, chestnut, duck-green, verdigris-green, buff, greyish-brown and fawn colour. The Roller as berlin-blue, brownish-yellow, coppery-purple and light cinnamon. The Spotted Eagle as chocolate-brown, pale wood-brown and reddish liver-brown. The Golden Oriole had lead-colour toes, other parts oil-green, brocoli-brown and wine-yellow. The Cuneate-Tailed Gull was smoke-brown and pearl-grey, the Turnstone had ferruginus portions, the Little Auk was livid-brown and sooty-brown, while the American Bittern was leaden-brown. The variations in these terms seems to be inexhaustable. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> be considered a , somewhat romantic or just pure pedantry on the author’s part. But it was a serious attempt to try to define quite subtle colourings." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel {{generated}} huge {{controversy in}} Latin America: some Venezuelan and Colombian politicians described its depiction of Bolívar as [...] "profane". According to Stavans, they accused García Márquez of [...] "defaming the larger-than-life reputation {{of a historical}} figure who, during the nineteenth century, struggled to unite the vast Hispanic world". The novel's publication provoked outrage from many Latin American politicians and intellectuals because its portrayal of the General is not the saintly image long cherished by many. Mexico's ambassador to Austria, Francisco Cuevas Cancino, wrote a damning letter, which was widely publicized in Mexico City, objecting to the portrayal of Bolívar. He stated: [...] "The novel is plagued with errors of fact, conception, fairness, understanding of the historical moment and ignorance of its consequences... It has served the enemies of Latin America, who care only that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> denigrate Bolívar, and with him all of us." [...] Even the novel's admirers, such as the leading Venezuelan diplomat and writer Arturo Uslar Pietri, worried that some facts were stretched. García Márquez believes, however, that Latin America has to discover the General's labyrinth to recognize and deal with its own maze of problems.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{saturated}} condition {{attitude control}} is impossible. Since the gyroscopic torques can now only be created {{at right angles}} to the saturation axis, roll control about that axis itself is now non-existent. There will also be major difficulties with control about other axes. For example, an unwanted left yaw can only be countered by storing some [...] "up" [...] angular momentum in the CMG rotors. This can only be done by tilting at least one of their axes up, which will slightly reduce the forward component of their total angular momentum. Since <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> store less [...] "right roll" [...] forward angular momentum, they will have to release some back into the spacecraft, which will be forced to start an unwanted roll to the right.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin Piekut {{argues that}} this [...] "consensus view of experimentalism" [...] {{is based on}} an a priori [...] "grouping", rather than asking the {{question}} [...] "How have these composers been collected together in the first place, that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> be the subject of a description?" [...] That is, [...] "for the most part, experimental music studies describes [...] a category without really explaining it" [...] He finds laudable exceptions in the work of David Nicholls and, especially, Amy Beal , and concludes from their work that [...] "The fundamental ontological shift that marks experimentalism as an achievement is that from representationalism to performativity", so that [...] "an explanation of experimentalism that already assumes the category it purports to explain is an exercise in metaphysics, not ontology" [...]|$|E

2500|$|Rhetorical {{debate and}} {{composition}} {{are taught to}} somewhat older (often high school aged) students, who by this point in their education have the concepts and logic to criticize their own work and persuade others. [...] According to Aristotle [...] "Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic", concerned with finding [...] "all the available means of persuasion." [...] The student now learns to articulate answers to important questions in his/her own words, {{to try to persuade}} others with these facts, and to defend ideas against rebuttal. [...] The student learns to reason correctly in the Logic stage so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> apply those skills to Rhetoric. [...] Traditionally, students would read and emulate classical poets in learning how to present their arguments well.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, the Yankees {{lifted the}} 9-year alcohol ban {{in the bleachers}} in the New Yankee Stadium, where the Bleacher Creatures were {{relocated}} to Section 203. While no beer vendors come through to the bleachers, fans are permitted to purchase beer in the stadium and take {{them back to their}} seats. A few Creatures have admittedly stated <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> desist in their beer smuggling efforts, which they were able to do for years with the help of local delis who used to wrap up sandwiches with beer cans. Other sources of previous smuggling included [...] "a guy who would sell those airline-size liquor bottles out of a bathroom stall, like a drug dealer."

[...] After fighting valiantly, he is killed by the Hulk, and his body is devoured by {{a few of the}} zombies (Hulk, Colonel America, Giant-Man, Iron Man, Luke Cage, Wolverine, and Spider-Man). His corpse grants the zombies a portion each of his cosmic powers, which they use to kill all of the other zombie heroes and villains whom they consider [...] "competition" [...] for what's left of the living. Afterwards, Pym creates a machine that concentrates the Cosmic powers they all share to create a massive blast that kills Galactus, at which point they eat him.
