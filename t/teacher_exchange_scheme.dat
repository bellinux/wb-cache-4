40|$|Abstract. The {{rigorous}} {{security of}} Okamoto-Tanaka identity-based key <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> has been {{open for a}} decade. In this paper, we show that (1) breaking the scheme is equivalent to breaking the Diffie-Hellman key <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> over Zn, and (2) impersonation is easier than breaking. The second result is obtained by proving that breaking the RSA publickey cryptosystem reduces to breaking the Diffie-Hellman scheme over Zn {{with respect to the}} polynomial-time many-one reducibility. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a cryptanalysis of the pairing based Diffie Hellman (DH) key <b>exchange</b> <b>schemes</b> which have found important applications {{as in the}} tripartite <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> proposed in [1]. The analysis of weak keys of the standard DH scheme proposed in [2] is applied to show existence of weak sessions for tripartite schemes over supersingular curves. It is shown that for such sessions the associated Bilinear Diffie Hellman Problem (BDHP) is solvable in polynomial time, without computing the private keys i. e. without solving the discrete logarithms. Similar applications of the analysis to Decisional Diffie Hellman Problem (DDHP) and the Identity Based DH scheme (IBS) are also developed. The tripartite key <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> is analyzed in detail and it is shown {{that the number of}} weak keys increases in this scheme as compared to the standard two party DH scheme. It is shown that the random choice of private keys by the users independent of each other’s knowledge is insecure in these schemes. Algorithms are suggested for checking weakness of private keys based on an order of selection. A modified tripartite key <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> is presented in which detection of weak keys is incorporated. ...|$|R

The least-reliable-bit (LRB) <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> helps collaborative decoding to lower {{the amount of information}} that must be exchanged while providing performance close to the maximal-ratio combining technique. In this paper, we approximately evaluate the error performance of the collaborative decoding with the LRB <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> when nonrecursive convolutional codes are used. The Gaussian approximation and union bound are used in the analysis. I...|$|R

A case study on M county of Beijing shows that the gross degree of <b>exchange</b> teachers’ satisfaction with <b>teachers</b> <b>exchange</b> policy is very low. During carrying out this policy, many new problems are produced such as low standard of chosing exchange teachers; no right of free choice for <b>exchange</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>exchange</b> schools, exchange teachers’ job assignments uncorrespondence with their professions, too long time of exchange and single exchange form, unreasonable evaluation subject or no unified evaluation standards and so on.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether the prevalence of HIV infection among injecting drug users in New Zealand has remained low since {{the introduction of a}} needle and syringe <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> in May 1988. DESIGN [...] Anonymous survey of intravenous drug users attending outlets of the <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme,</b> based on questionnaires and saliva testing. SETTING [...] Twelve pharmacies and community outreach organisation in six cities. SUBJECTS [...] Altogether 620 people provided saliva specimens and completed questionnaires. These represented 73 % of those who visited <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> outlets during a three month period in 1992. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Saliva was tested for antibodies to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 using an IgG-capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (GACELISA). RESULTS [...] Of 591 specimens eligible for inclusion, only three (0. 5 %) were repeatedly reactive in the GACELISA test, while two of these were also positive in a Western blot test. CONCLUSIONS [...] Although surveys show that sharing of needles and syringes was common in New Zealand until recently, the prevalence of HIV infection in intravenous drug users has remained low. This can probably be attributed to the success of educational campaigns and legislative action to allow a needle and syringe <b>exchange</b> <b>scheme</b> to be set up...|$|R
