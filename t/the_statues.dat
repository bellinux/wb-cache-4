5|$|In July 2005 <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> adorning the {{monument}} underwent a restoration. DeKalb County appropriated US$15,000 {{for the project}} which, among other tasks, repaired a split seam {{in one of the}} soldier statues and a crack in the other sculpture's base. The project took approximately six months; <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> were removed {{for the duration of the}} restoration work and reinstalled in March 2006. During the restoration it was revealed that <b>the</b> <b>statues,</b> thought to be bronze, were actually copper. The work, the first in the 110-year history of the memorial, was completed at a cost of $16,500. Three months after the work was completed one of <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> was removed for a second time because the metal began to oxidize.|$|E

5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by the glory of <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> housed within {{the halls of the}} Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been inscribed on the (bases) of <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the past tense in the text.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Supreme Court {{continued}} {{hearings on}} the PLI case about <b>the</b> <b>statues.</b> The BSP had still not provided evidence about where the monies expended on such monuments came from, whether it was all from appropriation bills passed by the legislature or also included party funds spent for the purpose.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Thinang Siwalai Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งศิวาลัยมหาปราสาท) {{is located}} on the southern-eastern end of the Siwalai Garden. The Siwalai Maha Prasat is a Thai-style edifice with a Mondop style spire of seven tiers. Built during the reign of King Rama V in 1878 to house the metal statues of his four predecessors, which were cast in 1869. The hall was {{to be used as a}} royal pantheon, where the lives of {{previous}} monarchs were to be commemorated and worshiped. Later King Rama VI had <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> removed and rehoused at the Prasat Phra Thep Bidorn in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha compound, where they would be more assessable to the public. On 6 April 1918 the first ceremony of worship was inaugurated, this ceremony continues to be performed annually. Since the removal of <b>the</b> <b>statues,</b> the Siwalai Maha Prasat has been left vacant.|$|E
50|$|More work on <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> {{and its environs}} was {{conducted}} in 2003 and early 2010. In 2003, a set of escalators, walkways, and elevators were installed to facilitate access to the platform surrounding <b>the</b> <b>statue.</b> <b>The</b> four-month restoration in 2010 focused on <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> itself. <b>The</b> <b>statue's</b> internal structure was renovated and its soapstone mosaic covering was restored by removing a crust of fungi and other microorganisms and repairing small cracks.

The exhibit also includes the Legacy Theatre, a 25-seat facility that plays a film about Pittsburgh's history with the Negro leagues. The Pirates donated <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> to the Josh Gibson Foundation in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{monetary}} {{policies were}} {{closely associated with}} his religious ones, in that increased minting was associated with measures of confiscation—taken since 331 and closed in 336—of all gold, silver and bronze statues from pagan temples, who were declared as imperial property and, as such, as monetary assets. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting hold of <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> and having them melted for immediate minting—with {{the exception of a}} number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>statue</b> {{was saved}} by Lucas Alamán, who {{convinced}} Guadalupe Victoria to retain <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> on <b>the</b> merit of its aesthetic qualities. This resulted in <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> being relocated in 1822 to {{the courtyard of}} the ancient university, to prevent people from destroying it. It wasn't until 1824 that the public was permitted to access <b>the</b> <b>statue,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was much safer in this location. In 1852, after years had passed and tempers had calmed, <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was moved to the intersection Paseo de la Reforma and Avenida Bucareli, although this time it was protected from potential damage by a grille. In 1979 it was relocated to its current location, Plaza Manuel Tolsá, overlooking the Palacio de Minería. Currently, in response to the earlier controversy surrounding <b>the</b> <b>statue,</b> <b>the</b> plaque on the pedestal indicates that Mexico conserved <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> as a monument to art, and not as a sign of praise to a Spanish king. A smaller, slightly different version of the sculpture {{can be seen in the}} Tolsá museum opposite <b>the</b> <b>statue.</b>|$|R

5|$|Frampton {{resigned}} from the project through pressure of work, and Drury and Pomeroy carried out the project, each contributing four monumental statues, which were installed in late 1907. On the upstream piers are Pomeroy's Agriculture, Architecture, Engineering and Pottery, whilst on the downstream piers are Drury's Science, Fine Arts, Local Government and Education. Each statue weighs approximately two tons. Despite their size, <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> are little-noticed by users of the bridge as they are not visible from the bridge itself, but only from the river banks or from passing shipping.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s statues were erected for the {{two leaders}} of the Dacian kingdom, Burebista and Decebalus. These came {{as part of a}} gradual process of {{disassociation}} of Socialist Romania from the Soviet Union. <b>The</b> <b>statues</b> depict the kings as freedom fighters, and nationwide celebrations were held for the anniversaries of ancient battles. Additionally two government-funded film productions were created as part of this same process. Both of the films focus on the history of Dacia in the first and second century AD and the exploits of Decebalus, while Burebista is almost ignored.|$|E

5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of. He preferred a non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth of the relief and the skills of the relief maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film instead of putting up a black curtain during photographing.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{sculpture}} {{experienced a}} renaissance during the Kamakura period, {{led by the}} Kei school. Partially influenced by Song dynasty China, their sculpture is characterised by realism featuring elaborate top knots, jewelry, and wavy drapery. Although predominantly wooden, bronze was also used as a material for <b>the</b> <b>statues.</b> As a novelty, portrait sculptures of prominent monks were created adjacent to the depiction of Buddhist deities.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders to ascend the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by <b>the</b> <b>statues</b> of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>statue</b> was {{an object}} of superstitious rites in Brittany for centuries.

It is said that during seventeenth century [...] "foul", [...] "indecent and obscene" [...] rites were also practiced at <b>the</b> <b>statue,</b> and that many couples performed [...] "erotic" [...] acts near <b>the</b> <b>statue.</b> <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> was also credited with being a sorcerer who would help those who approached her with dignity but would avenge herself on those who neglected to treat her with due honour.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>statue</b> was {{claimed to}} have been {{recovered}} from the sea in August 2013 by Joudat Ghrab, a local Palestinian fisherman. Ghrab said that he saw <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> lying in shallow waters near the Gaza border with Egypt, and initially thought <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> was a badly burnt body. It took four hours to get <b>the</b> <b>statue</b> ashore. <b>The</b> <b>statue</b> was later put for sale on the internet auction site eBay for $500,000 by members of Ghrab's family.
