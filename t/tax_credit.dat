5|$|Brown's 2000 Spending Review {{outlined}} a major expansion of government spending, particularly {{on health and}} education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance {{to pay for health}} spending. He also introduced working tax credits, and in his last budget as Chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3billion in pension allowances, an increase in the child <b>tax</b> <b>credit,</b> and an increase in the working <b>tax</b> <b>credit.</b> These increases were followed by another £1billion of support for increases in the child <b>tax</b> <b>credit.</b>|$|E

5|$|Owners of income-producing {{properties}} listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or {{of properties}} that are contributing resources within a National Register Historic District may {{be eligible for}} a 20% investment <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> for the rehabilitation of the historic structure. The rehabilitation may be of a commercial, industrial, or residential property, for rentals. The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State Historic Preservation Offices, and the Internal Revenue Service. Aside from the 20% <b>tax</b> <b>credit,</b> the tax incentive program offers a 10% <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> for rehabilitation to owners of non-historic, non-residential buildings constructed before 1936.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{pollution and}} foreign-capital tax policies on the host country's welfare when foreign-investment <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> are absent or {{present in the}} source country. In the absence of <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> the optimal policy is a pollution tax with a foreign-investment tax or subsidy. The presence of <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> may, however, result in a higher investment tax but a lower pollution tax, leading to higher welfare but lower environmental quality in the host country. The source-country's <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> may cause a switch in the host-country's capital subsidy to a tax, which may improve the environment.

40|$|Mexico has {{experimented with}} several tax {{instruments}} {{designed to promote}} private capital formation. Among such initiatives were general and industry-specific <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> employment <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> and corporate <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> The authors examine relative efficacy of such instruments using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. They carry out model simulations using three equal-yield investment incentive scenarios: increases in investment <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> increases in employment <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> and an equivalent reduction in the corporate tax rate.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} political contribution <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> {{a campaign}} finance reform that seeks to encourage participation. Several states provide citizens with <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> for part or all of their con-tributions to state or local candidates. Although {{a few studies have}} tried to estimate the budgetary impact of such programs, none has analyzed the effects of these <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> on the propensity of citizens to contribute. We discuss the results of two surveys in one state with <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> Ohio— one survey each of the general public and of campaign contributors. Our results indicate that if citizens are made aware of the <b>tax</b> <b>credits,</b> they have the potential to attract donors who are more similar to the general public than the current pool of campaign contributors. <b>Tax</b> <b>credits</b> have the greatest effect on small contributors, on younger adults, and on less partisan individuals...|$|R
5|$|Among Kefalas' top {{priorities}} is restoring and expanding Colorado's earned income <b>tax</b> <b>credit,</b> a move which met with resistance from legislative leaders in 2007 due to budget constraints.

5|$|Gordon Brown was an {{important}} figure in Blair's Labour government and {{played a key role}} in developing the party's philosophy. Brown served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1992 to 1997 and was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer following Labour's election victory in 1997. He attempted to control public spending and sought to increase the funding for education and healthcare. His economic strategy was market-based, attempting to reform the welfare state through a <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> scheme for poorer working families, and he assigned the Bank of England to set interest rates.|$|E

5|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{that of the}} 12 million with private insurance via the ACA exchanges in 2017, about 10 million receive premium <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> subsidies and will be shielded from premium increases, as their after-subsidy premiums are limited {{as a percentage of}} income under the ACA. However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face the brunt of the 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond. Another 13 million who are covered under the ACA's Medicaid expansion (in the 31 states that chose to expand coverage) should not be directly affected by Trump's action.|$|E

Zahorchak also said he believed basic education should be the state's primary fiscal educational investment, rather than special education or higher education.

5|$|Although Southern California and Mexico were {{considered}} for the main unit filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected {{for the majority of}} the shooting. Kaua'i was chosen over Mexico because a <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua'i Film Commission. John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather. Kaua'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 hours over 6 weeks exploring the island, using all-terrain vehicles, boats, and helicopters. After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this time spent on scouting additional locations for filming. Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|Netflix {{had ordered}} two seasons of 13 episodes when {{it made its}} {{original}} commitment to the series in 2011. According to Governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley, production of the first season brought $140 million {{in the form of}} 2,200 jobs and transactions with 1,800 vendors to the Baltimore metropolitan area economy and the Maryland General Assembly expanded its Film Production <b>Tax</b> <b>Credit</b> so that season two could have similar impact over the course of 150 days of filming. Like the first season, the second season was largely filmed in the Baltimore area. Although production was publicized as being in Baltimore, Season 1 had based production in Harford County, Maryland, and season 2 also had its production office in Edgewood and a Joppa sound stage. The April 27, 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner spoofed House of Cards from the Maryland set prior {{to the beginning of the}} filming of season 2.
