5|$|In March 2001, the {{official}} website was set up, which revealed the film's original October 26, 2001 release and a redirect to the film's distributor Constantin Films. The website was fully opened in July 2001, and composed of images, plot info, character biographies and downloads. The film was {{planned to have}} an R-rated classification which is what Anderson wanted since he knew the film had to be Rated-R in order to capture <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> games. In January 2002, the film was officially announced to contain an R rating.|$|E
25|$|He became {{involved}} in organisations pledged to remembering and recording <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camps. In 1954 he visited Buchenwald to mark the ninth anniversary of the camp's liberation from the Nazis. Levi dutifully attended many such anniversary events {{over the years and}} recounted his own experiences. In July 1957, his son Renzo was born, almost certainly named after his saviour Lorenzo Perrone.|$|E

25|$|Many {{historic}} buildings in Ireland were destroyed during the war, most famously the Custom House in Dublin, which was disastrously attacked on de Valera's insistence, to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more militarily experienced Collins. As he feared, the destruction proved a pyrrhic {{victory for the}} Republic, with so many IRA men killed or captured that the IRA in Dublin suffered a severe blow.|$|E
25|$|Rydberg's next work, Medeltidens Magi (The Magic of the Middle Ages) 1865 is an {{exposition}} of the magical practices {{and beliefs of}} the Medieval period. According to Rydberg, the contemporary Church was still driven by {{the ideology of the}} Dark Ages, and its dualistic notions of good and evil, represented by God and the Devil, Heaven and Hell, contributed towards <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witch-hunts in Europe and America in the recent past. From this point forward, Rydberg was economically successful as a writer.|$|E
25|$|The League's {{publications}} {{included a}} quarterly newsletter, The Ypres Times (first published in October 1921, and still being published {{as late as}} 1938), and books such as The Immortal Salient (1925), a historical record of the battles and a guide for pilgrims to Ypres. An account of <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions on the Ypres Salient, written by the war correspondent Philip Gibbs, {{was used for the}} League's information leaflets. Planned publications included the Ypres Book of Valour. The League also had a marching song, called Tramping along to a little tin whistle and an old toy drum, a version of which was published in 1926.|$|E

25|$|Already {{before the}} Romantic period proper, critics {{had begun to}} stress the {{elements}} of the play that would cause Hamlet to be seen, in the next century, as the epitome of the tragedy of character. In 1774, William Richardson sounded the key notes of this analysis: Hamlet was a sensitive and accomplished prince with an unusually refined moral sense; he is nearly incapacitated by <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truth about his mother and uncle, and he struggles against that horror to fulfill his task. Richardson, who thought the play should have ended shortly after the closet scene, thus saw the play as dramatizing the conflict between a sensitive individual and a calloused, seamy world.|$|E
25|$|Yet, in {{attempting}} to show, in a mainstream movie, the reprehensibility of torture, and what was done in our name, the filmmakers seem to have conflated events, and in this they have generated a sore controversy: the chairs of two Senate committees {{have said that the}} information used to find bin Laden was not uncovered through waterboarding. Do such scenes hurt the movie? Not as art; they are expertly done, without flinching from <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acts and without exploitation. But they damage the movie as an alleged authentic account. Bigelow and Boal– the team behind The Hurt Locker– want to claim the authority of fact and the freedom of fiction at the same time, and the contradiction mars an ambitious project.|$|E
25|$|In season two, Wolf {{has been}} {{released}} on home detention. He {{has no intention of}} keeping to Cheryl's new rules on life. Judd is determined to tear him away from Cheryl, and attempts to entice Wolf to break his parole so that he is returned to prison. Wolf escapes home detention and Judd moves in, much to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children. Pascalle starts to date Pakistani doctor Bruce, Van finds {{the love of his life}} Aurora and Loretta starts to date much older man Hayden. Jethro shocks his mother when he reveals he is still a criminal and only doing law to learn how to break the law more successfully. The season ends on Wolf framing Judd for a robbery he committed.|$|E

25|$|Many {{contemporary}} artists {{continue to be}} haunted by <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second World War and <b>the</b> specter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust.

25|$|Nietzsche {{found in}} {{classical}} Athenian tragedy {{an art form}} that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in The Birth of Tragedy was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian Kunsttrieben ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the satyr. He is <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> annihilation {{of the principle of}} individuality {{and at the same time}} someone who delights in its destruction. Both of these principles are meant to represent cognitive states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.|$|E
25|$|The Baker, his Wife, and Little Red Ridinghood {{get lost}} in the woods and find Cinderella's family and the Steward, who reveal that the castle was set upon by the Giant. The Witch arrives as well, {{bringing}} news that the Giant has destroyed the village and the Baker's house. Suddenly, thunderous footsteps are heard and the Giant appears. To the shock of all, this Giant is a woman who has come from the second beanstalk and is the widow of the Giant that Jack killed by chopping down the beanstalk. Her booming voice proclaims that she wants Jack's blood in revenge. To satisfy the Giantess, the group realizes they must give her someone, but are unable to decide on whom until they realize that the Narrator is still commenting on the actions from the sidelines. Everyone offers her the narrator as a sacrifice, but he convinces them how lost they would be without him. Nevertheless, the Witch throws him into the Giantess's arms and he is killed upon being dropped. Jack's mother finds the group and aggressively defends her son, angering the Giantess, and the Steward clubs Jack's mother to quiet her, inadvertently killing her. As the Giantess leaves to search for Jack, Rapunzel runs into her path and is trampled, to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Witch and her Prince ("Witch's Lament").|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} environments were praised as detailed. According to Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot, [...] "The game looks its best in corroded, bloody, gritty environments, like the damp, steel halls of the water prison or the subterranean subway layers that, {{at one point in}} the game, are walled in living, moving flesh." [...] The character and monster designs received praise as well-done. Reviewers generally commended the audio as contributing to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, although 1UP wrote that it was sub-par for the series.|$|E

500|$|In 1961, HIAG {{attempted}} {{to place a}} glorifying obituary of Max Simon, a former Gruppenführer in the SS, in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine. Simon had been convicted as a war criminal and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Allied courts {{for his role in}} the Marzabotto massacre, but was pardoned in 1954. He was subsequently tried twice in the Federal courts for the killings in Brettheim and other crimes, but, [...] "to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West German public", as Frankfurter Allgemeine wrote in 2010, was found not guilty. To HIAG's indignation, Frankfurter Allgemeine refused to run the obituary.|$|E
500|$|Kondracki's graphic {{depiction}} of violence was controversial.

500|$|As {{a running}} gag {{throughout}} the half-hour show, Harrison interrupts the sketches, trying to land an acting {{role as a}} pirate (and dressed accordingly), but gets turned down each time by RWT regulars Idle and Neil Innes, who simply want him to play the part of [...] "George Harrison". He then reappears at the end in more normal attire, strumming the well-known introduction to [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] on an acoustic guitar, and backed by the house band; instead of continuing with the song, Harrison finally takes his chance to play [...] "Pirate Bob" [...] by abruptly segueing into a sea shanty – to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "greasy" [...] compère, played by Idle. The other musicians follow Harrison's lead, after which a group of dancers appear on stage and the show's closing credits roll.|$|E

500|$|The premise behind [...] "Chimera" [...] was [...] "a {{compelling}} {{examination of}} the evil that lies beneath a prototypical white-bread suburban existence." [...] These themes had previously been explored in the season six episode, [...] "Arcadia". However, the show wished to explore the same ideas in a more [...] "straight-ahead scare" [...] style, rather than supplementing <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode with humor, as was done in [...] "Arcadia". Series creator, Chris Carter, saw the episode as [...] "a {{chance to do something}} bold and new." [...] Carter wanted the story to revolve around a crow, an image that he described simply as [...] "scary". With the story, he wanted to [...] "bust pretense and perception and expose the underbelly of a white-bread community." [...] Originally, the episode was going to feature a subterranean monster and was aptly going to be titled [...] "Subterranean Monster Blues".|$|E
500|$|Inspired by {{the flip}} books his son brought home, McCay [...] "came {{to see the}} {{possibility}} of making moving pictures" [...] of his cartoons. [...] He claimed that he [...] "was the first {{man in the world}} to make animated cartoons", though he was preceded by the American James Stuart Blackton and the French Émile Cohl. [...] McCay's first film starred his Little Nemo characters and debuted in movie theatres in 1911; he soon incorporated it into his vaudeville act. [...] He followed it in 1912 with How a Mosquito Operates, in which a giant, naturalistically animated mosquito sucks the blood of a sleeping man. [...] McCay gave the mosquito a personality and balanced humor with <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nightmare situation. [...] His animation was criticized as being so lifelike that he must have traced the characters from photographs or resorted to tricks using wires; to show that he had not, McCay chose a creature that could not have been photographed for his next film.|$|E
500|$|While the Simpsons {{attend a}} French Canadian circus called [...] "Cirque de Purée", a wild {{blizzard}} hits Springfield, {{turning it into}} a snowsquall overnight. However, Springfield Elementary School stays open regardless of the storm, even though every other local school closes. Only some students, including the classmates of Bart and Lisa, show up while Skinner and Willie are the only faculty members at the school that day. To pass the time, Skinner plays his professed favourite film, a very low-budget, long-running, 1938 holiday film called The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was, which Lisa notices has {{very little to do with}} Christmas. By the time the movie is finally over, it is already the end of the school day, and Skinner lets the kids go home--however, Skinner and the students quickly realize that over the course of the day, the snow has piled up tremendously, leaving them and Groundskeeper Willie trapped inside the school, much to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kids.|$|E
