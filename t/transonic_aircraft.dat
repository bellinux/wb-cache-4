25|$|Following on {{from the}} Delta 1, the Ministry of Supply {{requested}} that Fairey conduct a further model programme {{for the purpose of}} transonic investigations. However, Fairey did not find this proposal attractive, believing that a piloted aircraft would be mandatory if the project was to produce any worthwhile data. Fairey commenced work on a highly swept twin-engine aircraft; however, the Ministry lacked enthusiasm for the twin-engine configuration, largely due to an existing rival project underway to produce a twin-engine supersonic aircraft - this would become the English Electric Lightning. In February 1949, it was suggested that Fairey examine the prospects for a single-engine <b>transonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> as an alternative; {{by the end of the}} year, the company had produced their new project, out of which the Fairey Delta 2 (FD2) would directly originate. Accordingly, the Ministry issued Air Ministry Specification ER.103 for the project, ordering that a pair of prototype aircraft be produced.|$|E

Already in the early design stage at Fairey, the Ministry of Supply (MoS) decided to have the aircraft built as a more conventional jet-powered research vehicle to Ministry specification E.10/47. The Fairey Type R design was a mid-wing tail-less delta monoplane, with a circular cross-section fuselage and engine air-inlet at the extreme front.

50|$|Supersonic aircraft, such as Concorde, Tu-144, the English Electric Lightning, Lockheed F-104, Dassault Mirage III, and MiG 21, are {{designed}} to exceed Mach 1.0 in level flight, and, therefore, {{are designed}} with very thin wings.

50|$|The Hawker P.1121 was envisioned {{as being}} one of the first British-built {{supersonic}} fighter aircraft, being projected to be capable of speeds of up to Mach 2.5. It was to have been used not only as a radar-equipped interceptor aircraft but also ground attack missions, which was envisaged to potentially include tactical nuclear weapons. If pursued, the P.1121 would have replaced existing RAF <b>transonic</b> <b>aircraft,</b> such as the Hawker Hunter. While initial models were envisioned to be single-seat aircraft, Hawker emphasized that twin-seat versions, to seat a navigator/radar operator, were plausible.|$|E
50|$|The Saab 32 Lansen (English: Lance) was a two-seat, <b>transonic</b> {{military}} <b>aircraft</b> {{designed and}} manufactured by Saab from 1955 to 1960 for the Swedish Air Force (Flygvapnet).

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{evaluation of}} fixed-geometry and variable-sweep wing designs, a fixed delta wing, and oblique wings {{with a single}} body or two bodies suggests that an oblique wing is preferable in a <b>transonic</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> in terms of gross weight, fuel consumption, and aircraft noise, and also shows an acceptable aeroelastic stability. Further studies are, however, needed to develop the full potential of the oblique-wing concept, including its economic implications...|$|R
50|$|Early <b>transonic</b> {{military}} <b>aircraft,</b> {{such as the}} Hawker Hunter and F-86 Sabre, {{were designed}} to fly satisfactorily even at speeds greater than their critical Mach number. They did not possess sufficient engine thrust to break the sound barrier in level flight, but could exceed Mach 1.0 in a dive while remaining controllable. Modern jet airliners, such as Airbus and Boeing aircraft, have maximum operating Mach numbers slower than Mach 1.0.|$|R
50|$|Research {{aircraft}} of the 1950s and '60s {{found it}} difficult to break the sound barrier, or even reach Mach 0.9, with conventional airfoils. Supersonic airflow over the upper surface of the traditional airfoil induced excessive wave drag and a form of stability loss called Mach tuck. Due to the airfoil shape used, supercritical wings experience these problems less severely and at much higher speeds, thus allowing the wing to maintain high performance at speeds closer to Mach 1. Techniques learned from studies of the original supercritical airfoil sections are used in designing airfoils for high-speed subsonic and <b>transonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the Airbus A300 and Boeing 777 to the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II.|$|E

40|$|The BLWF code [1] was {{developed}} {{by researchers at the}} Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI). The BLWF code has been developed for preliminary aerodynamic analysis of <b>transonic</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> configurations. It can be used for rapid computations of viscous transonic flow over wing/body/nacelle/ tail configurations. Numerical simulations of the flow past the DLR-F 6 wing-body configuration have been performed to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of this code, when used for preliminary aerodynamic analysis of transonic transport configurations. A brief description of computational methods is given in Section 1. The numerical results and discussion are given in Section 2. The computational results for a prescribed Mach number (Ma= 0. 75) and prescribed design lift coefficient (CL= 0. 5) are compared with the available experimental data. The effect of Mach number on the aerodynamic performance is investigated by computations at Mach numbers from 0. 2 to 0. 9, with fixed Reynolds number and varying angles of attack. According to the evalution results, the BLWF code is well suited for the preliminary aerodynamic analysis of <b>transonic</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> configurations. ...|$|R

5000|$|Stabilator or all-moving tailIn {{transonic}} flight shock waves {{generated by the}} front of the tailplane render any elevator unusable. An all-moving tail was developed by the British for the Miles M.52, but first saw actual {{transonic flight}} on the Bell X-1; fortunately Bell Aircraft Corporation had included an elevator trim device that could alter the angle of attack of the entire tailplane. This saved the program from a costly and time-consuming rebuild of the <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Transonic</b> and supersonic <b>aircraft</b> now have all-moving tailplanes to counteract Mach tuck and maintain maneuverability when flying faster than the critical Mach number. Normally called a stabilator, this configuration {{is often referred to as}} an [...] "all-moving" [...] or [...] "all-flying" [...] tailplane.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, as a {{response}} to growing RAF interest in developing <b>transonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> to serve as a stopgap while the next generation of supersonic fighters were being developed, both Supermarine and Hawker proposed derivatives of their respective Swift and Hunter aircraft. By this point, the shortcomings of the Swift were not yet apparent, which perhaps had allowed Supermarine to gain the RAF's favour for their proposal, designated as the Type 545, over the rival Hawker P.1083. The Type 545 had been drawn up to conform with the requirements given by Specification F.105D; it was projected to have been capable of attaining Mach 1.3 and powered by a model of Avon engine, promising superior performance to that of the P.1083. Externally, the Type 545 bore a crude resemblance to the Swift, and would have served as a spiritual successor to it, but was radically redesigned with an area-ruled fuselage and wing changes. In 1955, work on the project was cancelled, in part due to the considerable difficulties experienced with the Swift.|$|E
5000|$|Aircraft {{designed}} {{according to}} Whitcomb's area rule (such as the Blackburn Buccaneer and the Northrop F-5) looked odd {{at the time}} they were first tested and were dubbed [...] "flying Coke bottles," [...] but the area rule is effective and came to be an expected part of the appearance of any <b>transonic</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Later designs started with the area rule in mind, and came to look much more pleasing. Although the rule still applies, the visible fuselage [...] "waisting" [...] can only be seen on a few aircraft, such as the [...] B-1B Lancer, Learjet 60, and the [...] Tupolev Tu-160 'Blackjack'. The same effect is now achieved by careful positioning of aircraft components, like the boosters and cargo bay on rockets; the jet engines in front of (and not directly below) the wings of the Airbus A380; the jet engines behind (and not purely at the side of) the fuselage of a Cessna Citation X; the shape and location of the canopy on the F-22 Raptor; and the image of the Airbus A380 above showing obvious area rule shaping at the wing root, which is practically invisible from any other angle.|$|E

The first flight of the M-346 was performed in 2004. The type is currently operated by the air forces of Italy, Israel, Singapore, and Poland.

40|$|Long-haul {{transport}} plane configurations are discussed {{that are considered}} technically feasible within a practical level of near-term technology.

The shape of subsonic transports is not expected to change noticeably, although recent advances of airfoil technology imply that new subsonic transports would have wings with higher aspect ratios and somewhat less sweep.
