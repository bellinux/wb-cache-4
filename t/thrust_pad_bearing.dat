Effects are examined of the load eccentricity, time-lag of changes in the supply pressure and load, surface roughness, recess volume, and the revolution radius. The bearing’s motion is simulated three-dimensionally, including roughness interaction and asperity contact. Solutions are obtained regarding the friction, flow rate, power loss, and stiffness. Calculations indicate that the eccentric load causes local contacts. The preceding change in the load poses a larger motion of the bearing. The hydrodynamic effect becomes marked as the revolution radius increases. As the recess volume increases, the bearing stiffness decreases...|$|E

Significant improvement in load carrying capacity, wear resistance and friction coefficient of the tribiological mechanical component can be achieved by forming regular micro structure in form of micro dimple on the <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> surface. In the present work numerical analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of spherical, cylindrical, elliptical, rectangular and square texture on the thrust pad hydrodynamic bearing and a comparison is done with the plain thrust bearing. The above texture profile was chosen in the view to easy fabrication of such texture using laser technology or etching process. These textured pads are tested on the various type of operating condition. The Reynolds equations are solved numerically by the finite difference method and an analysis is done on the effect of texture height, aspect ratio, and number of textures both in radial and circumferential directions on <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing.</b> It is observed that the load carrying capacity increases with increase of texture height ratio. This is because as texture height is increased it restricts the flow of lubricants which increases pressure and load carrying capacity. The analysis shows as aspect ratio is increased the roughness of surface is increased so pressure is increased, which result is increasing load carrying capacity. However with very larger value of aspect ratio the roughness of surface decreases, which decreases the load carrying capacity. Similar studies the done for behavior of coefficient of friction on variation of aspect ratio, texture height ratio etc. The author believes that such detail analysis on different texture profile on thrust pad hydrodynamic to study different tribological behavior under different condition will help researchers around the world...|$|E

The fluid load capacity was dramatically affected by the roughness directional pattern. The skewness had a lower effect than the roughness directional pattern.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend in the {{replacement}} of the babbit facing in <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> with a composite polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface layer. The PTFE-faced bearings have been shown to allow a greater specific pressure, reduce thermal crowning, and, in some cases, negate the need for an oil-lift (jacking) system. These designs of bearing require new methods for the measurement of oil film thickness both to assist in their development and for plant condition monitoring. In this work, an ultrasonic method of oil film measurement is evaluated for this purpose. An ultrasonic transducer is mounted on the back face of the <b>thrust</b> <b>pad.</b> Pulses are generated and transmitted through the pad material, bonding interlayer, and PTFE surface layer. The proportion of the wave that reflects back from the oil film layer is determined. This is then related to the oil film thickness using a series of calibration experiments and a spring stiffness model. In practice, the reflected signal is difficult to distinguish, in the time domain, from other internal reflections from the pad. Signals are compared with reflections when no oil film is present and processing is carried out in the frequency domain. Experiments have been performed on a full size PTFE-faced <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> destined for a hydroelectric power station turbine. The instrumented pad was installed in a test facility and subjected to a range of loading conditions both with and without oil lift.

40|$|LectureTilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> are used for oil lubricated <b>bearings.</b> Babbitted tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a tilting <b>pad</b> journal <b>bearing</b> and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a tilting <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is {{the elimination of the}} bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer tilting <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing,</b> the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly. The limitations of the available solid polymer tilting <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> have been overcome by the integration of a metal reinforced pivot as mentioned by Gassmann et al. (2013). The results of the TEHD analysis presented form the base of the optimized journal and thrust bearing design. The new journal and thrust bearing design has been validated through testing of a prototype. The data collected during tests with the optimized thrust and journal bearings are in excellent agreement with the simulations. With the optimized bearing design, the limitations of the original pad design have been mitigated. The successfully qualified journal and thrust bearing are one of the building blocks required for product lubricated pumps and will be used in subsea pump applications...|$|R

During the design phase the axial load shall be verified to remain safely lower than the thrust bearing capacity, under all possible operating conditions; this requires a high degree of accuracy in the calculation model used to evaluate each thrust component. Errors in this calculation may lead to high <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> temperature during operation, to early wearing of the pad surfaces and ultimately to the damage or failure of the thrust bearing (Moll and Postill, 2011), thus jeopardizing the integrity of the whole compressor.
