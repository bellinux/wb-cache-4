5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses {{is a pair}} of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is a {{schooling}} species, whose {{movements are}} associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although there appears to be little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a year have shown the species does not change its local distribution {{over the course of a}} day, generally being of the same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited over the course of a season. Like other sillaginids, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by.|$|E

They also have a play-by-play feature, where the names of moves performed by Quidditch players is shown in bright purple letters across the Omnioculars' lenses. Omnioculars also have the ability to list the names and numbers of the players, and can zero in on players rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Sea snakes (Hydrophiinae, {{sometimes}} {{considered to}} be a separate family) have adapted to a marine way of life in different ways and to various degrees. All have evolved paddle-like tails for swimming and the ability to excrete salt. Most also have laterally compressed bodies, their ventral scales are much reduced in size, their nostrils are located dorsally (no internasal scales), and they give birth to live young (oviparity). In general, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to respire through their skin; experiments with the yellow-bellied sea snake, Hydrophis platurus, have shown that this species can satisfy about 20% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, allowing for prolonged dives. The sea kraits (Laticauda spp.) are the sea snakes least adapted to aquatic life. They spend much of their time on land, where they lay their eggs. They have wide ventral scales, their tails are not as well-developed for swimming, and their nostrils are separated by internasal scales.|$|E

25|$|Blow flies – Family Calliphoridae- Flies in {{this family}} are often {{metallic}} in appearance and between 10 and 14mm in length. In addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as blue bottle fly, cluster fly, greenbottles, or black blowfly. A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented antennae. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day. Larvae have three stages of development (called instars); each stage is separated by a molting event. Worldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the Neotropics, {{and a large number}} of species in Africa and Southern Europe. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of India, Japan, Central America, and in the southern United States. The typical habitat for blow-flies are temperate to tropical areas that provide a layer of loose, damp soil and litter where larvae may thrive and pupate. The forensic importance of this fly is that it is the first insect to come in contact with carrion because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to smell death from up to ten miles (16km) away.|$|E
25|$|Humanity {{discovered}} {{the ruins of}} one alien technological civilization, and encountered one {{that at the time}} of the story is alive and thriving, the Ashiyyur. The sphere of Ashiyyur worlds is described by the author as abutting the worlds of human civilization along the Perimeter – first contact was made at least several hundred years before the time in which the back-story is set. McDevitt conceives the Ashiyyur as being at approximately the same technological level as humans, and in fact humanoid – bi-laterally symmetrical, bipedal, larger than average for human, of two genders, descended from predators, and interested in the same kind of real estate as humans. Most significantly for the story, they are also incapable of audible speech without mechanical aids, and are nicknamed “Mutes” by humans as a result. The Ashiyyur are telepathic and have evolved a society based on that form of communication. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability,</b> with some difficulty, to “read” human minds and emotions. Ashiyyur civilization is described as being much older than human civilization (approximately 75,000 years versus perhaps 15,000) but as having developed much more slowly. It is important to the back-story that to the Ashiyyur, human dynamism and exuberance appear threatening and humans are aggressive, untrustworthy, and unethical.|$|E
25|$|SGCs {{have the}} ability to release cytokines and other {{bioactive}} molecules that transmit pain neuronally. Neurotrophins and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are other cellular factors that work to sensitize neurons to pain. SGCs are present in the PNS in fewer numbers than other more well-known types of glial cells, like astrocytes, but have been determined to affect nociception because of some of their physiological and pharmacological properties. In fact, just like astrocytes, SGCs {{have the ability}} to sense and regulate neighboring neuronal activity. First, after a period of nerve cell injury, SGCs are known to up-regulate GFAP and to undergo cell division. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to release chemoattractants, which are analogous to those released by Schwann cells and contribute to the recruitment and proliferation of macrophages. Additionally, several research groups have found that SGC coupling increases after nerve damage, which has an effect on the perception of pain, likely for several reasons. Normally, the gap junctions between SGCs are used in order to redistribute potassium ions between adjacent cells. However, in coupling of SGCs, the number of gap junctions greatly increases. This may possibly be to deal with larger amounts of ATP and glutamate, which eventually leads to increased recycling of the glutamate. The increased levels of glutamate lead to over excitation and an increase in nociception.|$|E

[...] In the Second Treatise on Government (1689), he contends that it is the parents' duty to educate their children and to act for them because children, though <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to reason when young, do not do so consistently and are therefore usually irrational; it is the parents' obligation to teach their {{children to}} become rational adults so that they will not always be fettered by parental ties.|$|E
500|$|Herpetologist Wilfred T. Neill, {{reported}} in 1950 that he unearthed a bowfin aestivating in a chamber [...] below the ground surface, [...] in diameter, [...] from a river. It was further noted that flood levels had previously reached the area, and receded. [...] It {{is not unusual}} for riverine species like bowfin to move into backwaters with flood currents, and become trapped when water levels recede. [...] While aestivation is anecdotally documented by multiple researchers, laboratory experiments have suggested instead that bowfin are physiologically incapable of surviving more than three to five days of air exposure. However, no field manipulation has been performed. Regardless of the lack of evidence confirming the bowfin's ability to aestivate, it has been noted that bowfin can survive prolonged conditions of exposure to air because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to breathe air.
