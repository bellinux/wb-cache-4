5|$|With William dead, the {{succession}} to the English throne {{was thrown into}} doubt. Rules of succession were uncertain in western Europe at the time; {{in some parts of}} France, male primogeniture was becoming more popular, in which the eldest son would inherit a title. It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor while he was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear. This was not the case in England, where the best a noble could do was <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> Professor Eleanor Searle has termed a pool of legitimate heirs, leaving them to challenge and dispute the inheritance after his death. The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years. William the Conqueror had invaded England, his sons William Rufus and Robert Curthose had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.|$|E

25|$|Promoting {{intrinsic}} motivation {{and problem solving}} are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative {{when they see a}} task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.|$|E

The logical meaning of these sentences indicates that the property of being tall is attributed {{to some form of}} the QNP referring to girl. Along with the QNP and the predicate, there is also an inference of truth value. Either the truth value is True for a person who is tall, otherwise the truth value is False.|$|E

25|$|The {{policies}} for language revitalization have been changing {{in attempts to}} improve Maori language use and {{have been working with}} suggestions from the Waitangi Tribunal on the best ways to implement the revitalization. The Waitangi Tribunal in 2011 identified a suggestion for language revitalization that would shift indigenous policies from the central government to the preferences and ideologies of the Māori people. This change recognizes the issue of Te Reo revitalization as one of indigenous self-determination, instead of the job of the government <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> would be best for the language and Maori people of New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a series}} of vignettes recounting a social {{occasion}} during which someone said something that should not have been said, or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how people would have felt in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{research}} has engaged three further directions – the speculation {{that at least}} some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming sadism is not present, and can form an affectionate bond. Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> is perceived as consent beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.|$|E

25|$|A stepstone was {{the kitchen}} {{designed}} in Frankfurt by Margarethe Schütte-Lihotzky. Working class women frequently worked in factories {{to ensure the}} family's survival, as the men's wages often did not suffice. Social housing projects led to the next milestone: the Frankfurt Kitchen. Developed in 1926, this kitchen measured 1.9m by 3.4m (approximately 6ft 2in by 11ft 2in, with a standard layout). It was built for two purposes: to optimize kitchen work to reduce cooking time and {{lower the cost of}} building decently equipped kitchens. The design, created by Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, was the result of detailed time-motion studies and interviews with future tenants <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> they needed from their kitchens. Schütte-Lihotzky's fitted kitchen was built in some 10,000 apartments in the housing projects erected in Frankfurt in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|To {{a certain}} degree it is normal to procrastinate {{and it can be}} {{regarded}} as a useful way <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> is important, due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks (for most people). On the other hand, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, stress, anxiety, sense of guilt and crisis as well as loss of personal productivity and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination gets almost chronic. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also social stigma and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of willpower or low ambition. In some cases problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying psychological disorder, but not necessarily.|$|E
25|$|Pro mode for {{keyboards}} shows during gameplay ten white {{keys and}} the corresponding black keys, as the full range cannot be displayed on screen; Two visual cues are given to the player <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> position on the controller they should play relative to the keys shown on-screen. One cue is through highlighting the entire lane that corresponds to a played note whether correct or not; this {{is designed to help}} keep the player's hand positions correlated on the unit. A second cue is uniquely grouped coloring of a channel containing a set of 5 keys matching similar markings on the keyboard unit to identify the correct area of the keyboard that the player should be on. Pro keyboard charting includes notes and chords using a combination of white and black keys. On Easy or Medium Pro keys, the range of keys on screen does not shift, but on Hard and Expert the range of keys shown on the screen shifts as the song necessitates, requiring the player to move their own hands in turn. Arrow indicators are displayed to indicate when the displayed area is about to shift left or right, giving the player time to compensate.|$|E

500|$|Southern {{mountain}} caribou management previously aimed <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> {{was threatening}} caribou populations and find solutions {{to mitigate the}} threats, but the last caribou in the park {{was found dead in}} an avalanche in 2009. There was concern over why more had not been done to save the caribou population. The primary reason for their decline is thought to have been habitat loss and altered predator–prey dynamics. Park management began monitoring the last five caribou in the park in 2002 and taking actions such as reducing impacts of humans, conducting studies of the population, and investigating the possibility of translocating caribou to increase the Banff population.|$|E
500|$|More {{than any}} {{documented}} bite incident, Peter Benchley's best-selling novel Jaws {{and the subsequent}} 1975 film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg provided the great white shark {{with the image of}} being a [...] "man eater" [...] in the public mind. While great white sharks have killed humans in at least 74 documented unprovoked bite incidents, they typically do not target them: for example, in the Mediterranean Sea there have been 31 confirmed bite incidents against humans in the last two centuries, most of which were non-fatal. Many of the incidents seemed to be [...] "test-bites". Great white sharks also test-bite buoys, flotsam, and other unfamiliar objects, and they might grab a human or a surfboard <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> it is.|$|E

40|$|The {{previous}} {{literature on}} vertical equity in property assessment {{has focused on}} parcel-level data within a single area and has produced mixed conclusions on whether the process is progressive or regressive. This paper advances the discussion <b>to</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>what</b> differences between jurisdictions might account for the mix of findings. Using data from Virginia cities and counties between 2001 and 2007, evidence is presented that indicates having tax maps available online, appointed assessors, and senior citizens all influence the level of regressivity observed between jurisdictions. Overall, the results {{support the hypothesis that}} interjurisdictional differences are determinants of vertical inequity. ...|$|R
