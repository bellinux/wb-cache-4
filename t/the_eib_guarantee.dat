40|$|This article {{examines}} the principles of accountability applied by the European Investment Bank {{in comparison with the}} practices of other Multilateral Lending Institutions. After a brief description of <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> and its activities, the substantive and procedural principles governing <b>the</b> <b>EIB’s</b> external accountability are reviewed. The substantive accountability principles considered are the applicable rules of the EU legal order and the voluntary human rights, social and environmental principles and standards which <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> has identified for itself and committed to follow throughout its operations. The article evaluates {{the extent to which these}} norms form a credible normative framework against which <b>the</b> <b>EIB’s</b> lending practices can be appraised. From a procedural accountability point of view, the article assesses the transparency and participation policies of <b>the</b> <b>EIB,</b> as well as the mechanisms offered to external stakeholders to seek redress from <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> in case they are wronged by one of its decisions. The redress mechanisms analysed are <b>the</b> recent <b>EIB’s</b> Complaints Office, <b>the</b> European Ombudsman and the Court of Justice. We conclude that <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> should take more advantage of its being subjected to the EU human rights, social and environmental rules and of the EU judicial apparatus in order to upgrade its substantive and procedural accountability towards external stakeholders. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{continuing}} financial and economic crises, the European Investment Bank (EIB) {{has been criticized for}} being overly-conservative in its loans to Europe. Critics in particular have called on <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> to vastly increase its investment in utilities as a counter-cyclical measure. To take stock and, in order to evaluate the role of <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> in financing utilities over time, we compile and analyze an original database of all EIB utilities project loans from 1958 to 2004. We find <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> started out by functioning as a regional development bank, prioritizing utilities finance in its members’ poorer zones; however, energy crises in the 1970 s marked a shift whereby <b>the</b> logic of <b>EIB</b> finance to utilities became more politically-oriented. By the 1980 s, utilities projects supported by <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> were intimately related to those required for the Single Market. The origins of <b>the</b> <b>EIB’s</b> current conservative approach to utilities loans was born in the 1970 s and fully consolidated by the 1990 s. ...|$|R

40|$|There are {{diverging}} {{opinions about}} public banking and there relevance for {{the financing of}} economic growth. In this explorative research project the question about EU’s expectations of <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> and <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> in meeting these expectations is central. The main sources of this research project are secondary data about <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> and <b>the</b> European Union {{as well as the}} “honourable merchant”. To answer the question about the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>EIB,</b> <b>the</b> bank’s field of activity was contextualised with the “Europe 2020 strategy”. One key finding is that the relevance of public banks, such as <b>the</b> <b>EIB,</b> is underestimated. Especially the ability to provide long- term capital for large- scale investments with a low rate of return, shows that the public banks and its financial tools are essential for the economic development. Furthermore, the second research question analyses the ethical position of <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> as a public bank. This analysis is based on the hypothesis that this type of bank is acting more ethically as the strategic alignment is not based on the shareholder value approach. In this research project, the ethical stance of the bank was analysed by using the concept of the “honourable merchant”. The research project comes to the conclusion that public banks can invest more ethically because competition is not forcing the bank to maximise the rate of return...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – With {{the rise}} of {{multicore}} computing, the design of on-chip networks (or networks on chip) has become an increasingly important component of computer architecture. The Cell Broadband Engine’s Element Interconnect Bus (EIB), with its four data rings and shared command bus for end-to-end control, supports twelve nodes—more than most mainstream on-chip networks, which makes it an interesting case study. As {{a first step toward}} understanding the design and performance of on-chip networks implemented {{within the context of a}} commercial multicore chip, this paper analytically evaluates <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> network using conventional latency and throughput characterization methods as well as using a recently proposed 5 -tuple latency characterization model for on-chip networks. These are used to identify the end-to-end control component of <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> (i. e., <b>the</b> shared command bus) as being the main bottleneck to achieving minimal, single-cycle latency and maximal 307. 2 GB/sec raw effective bandwidth provided natively by <b>the</b> <b>EIB.</b> This can be exacerbated by poorly designed Cell software, which can have significant impact on the utilization of <b>the</b> <b>EIB.</b> <b>The</b> main findings from this study are that the end-to-end control of <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> which is influenced by the software running on the Cell has inherent scaling problems and serves as the main limiter to overall network performance. Thus, end-to-end effects must not be overlooked when designing efficient networks on chip. Index terms: Cell Broadband Engine, Element Interconnec...|$|R

40|$|Our {{intention}} is to extend <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> to a complete security concept which is currently missing in most solutions being developed for communication on <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> network. This article describes solutions to build a secured way using gateways to a TCP/IP based network without withdrawing {{the advantage of a}} secured transmission inside <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> installation. <b>The</b> concept includes a secured data path starting at a single EIB device as a part of an EIB installation to a device for remote control and supervision. In EIB installations it is quit easy for a potential invader to listen to telegrams and to send them himself to open for example a door. An even higher security leakage is in radio frequency and powerline transmissions. To avoid these problems, cryptographic secure data have to be used for communication. Several algorithms are established used by cash transactions for example. Symmetric methods like DES (Data Encryption Standard) or asymmetric RSA (Rivest-Schamir Algorithm) with encryption key length of 128 Bit should be used. To keep the decentralized structure of <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> fieldbus system and to minimize the bus traffic not every method is suitable.

This school is characterized by the cultural and linguistic diversity represented by the integration of teachers, students and parents of tseltal and tsotsil origin. We use the evaluation model CIPP (context, input, process and product) and complemented it with school ethnography, using semi-structured interviews (director and supervisor), participant observation (classroom sessions), focus group interviews to teachers and parents and a sociolinguistic questionnaire to students. The theoretical framework retrieves the core theoretical elements of <b>the</b> <b>EIB,</b> by reviewing and analysing bilingual education, bilingual bicultural education (biculturalism), pedagogical interculturalism and the intercultural bilingual approach. The main findings of this study show that, in practice, intercultural bilingual indigenous education has not transcended the bilingual dimension (the indigenous language teaching). Interculturalism is not yet clearly integrated in the speech nor in the educational practice of the studied school. <b>The</b> <b>EIB</b> implementation is still limited and responds to sociocultural, linguistic, political, educational and teacher training conditions that characterize the local educational context and are not favorable to enhance the effective implementation of <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> in <b>the</b> primary school...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{last few}} years, a {{tendency}} arose to integrate various programmable devices through ever expanding computer networks. One particular domain {{in which this}} evolution stood out clearly is home automation. <b>The</b> <b>EIB</b> 1 standard defines a home automation solution that consists {{of a network of}} cooperating components with little computational power. Bridging <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> network with a computer network allows software to interact with these EIB components. However, past attempts to link EIB components with computer networks fell short in dynamism, automatism or user friendliness. In this paper we present a distributed software framework that overcomes these issues, and is capable of automatically generating a software model based on the configuration of the components on <b>the</b> <b>EIB</b> fieldbus. A framework {{that can be used in}} this perspective is Jini. Its excellent capabilities for dynamic reconfiguration and its proven deployment in domestic and office environments make it an appropriate candidate for supporting home automation systems. ...|$|R
