25|$|As {{electrons}} and holes are fermions with half integer spin, an exciton may {{either be in}} a singlet state or a <b>triplet</b> <b>state</b> {{depending on how the}} spins of the electron and hole have been combined. Statistically three triplet excitons will be formed for each singlet exciton. Decay from triplet states (phosphorescence) is spin forbidden, increasing the timescale of the transition and limiting the internal efficiency of fluorescent devices. Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes make use of spin–orbit interactions to facilitate intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet states, thus obtaining emission from both singlet and triplet states and improving the internal efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{absorption}} of a photon causes an electron to be excited into a singlet state of the Q band. The excited state undergoes an intersystem crossing from the singlet state to a <b>triplet</b> <b>state</b> {{in which there are}} two electrons with parallel spin. This species is, in effect, a free radical, and is very reactive and allows an electron to be transferred to acceptors that are adjacent to the chlorophyll in the chloroplast. In the process chlorophyll is oxidized. Later in the photosynthetic cycle, chlorophyll is reduced back again. This reduction ultimately draws electrons from water, yielding molecular oxygen as a final oxidation product.|$|E

25|$|The {{generation}} of CIDNP {{in a typical}} photochemical system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and {{approximately half of the}} molecules undergo intersystem crossing into the long-lived <b>triplet</b> <b>state.</b> Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The actual kinetics are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH dependence.|$|E

The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are antibonding, and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.|$|E
40|$|The {{intramolecular}} {{interaction of}} ketone <b>triplet</b> excited <b>states</b> with nucleophilic substituents is investigated {{by studying the}} electronic properties of phenalenone {{and a range of}} phenalenones functionalized in position 9 as a model system. In accordance with the literature, a (π,π*) <b>triplet</b> excited <b>state</b> is predicted for phenalenone. Similarly, 9 -fluoro-, 9 -chloro-, and 9 -methoxyphenalenone are calculated to have (π,π*) lowest <b>triplet</b> excited <b>states,</b> whereas the lowest <b>triplet</b> <b>states</b> of 9 -bromo-, 9 -iodo, 9 -methylthio, and 9 -dimethylaminophenalenone are predicted to have (σ*,π*) character. As a result of the interaction between halogen and oxygen lone pairs increasing with increasing orbital size, the antibonding linear combination of substituent lone pairs with oxygen lone pairs sufficiently rises in energy to change the character of the lowest <b>triplet</b> excited <b>state</b> of the 9 -substituted phenalenones from (π,π*) to (σ*,π*). These unusual <b>triplet</b> excited <b>states</b> or exciplexes should essentially behave like (n,π*) <b>triplets</b> <b>states,</b> but will differ from pure (n,π*) states by showing significant spin densities at the substituent heteroatoms, predicted to reach values of 0. 25 for 9 -iodophenalenone, and ~ 0. 5 for 9 -dimethylaminophenalenone. Vertical T 1 –T 2 excitation energies calculated indicate that the stabilization of the (σ*,π*) relative to the (π,π*) state can reach 1 [*]eV. Preliminary calculations on the <b>triplet</b> excited <b>states</b> of 2 -iodobenzophenone, 4 -iodo- 2 -butanone, and iodoacetone indicate that intramolecular triplet exciplex formation should be a general phenomenon, as long as the ring being formed is at least a five-membered ring...|$|R

At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form, {{also known as the}} [...] "normal form". The equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen. The ortho/para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups, such as water and methylene, but is of little significance for their thermal properties.|$|E
