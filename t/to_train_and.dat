5|$|Following Syria's secession, Nasser grew {{concerned}} with Amer's inability <b>to</b> <b>train</b> <b>and</b> modernize the army, {{and with the}} state within a state Amer had created in the military command and intelligence apparatus. In late 1961, Nasser established the Presidential Council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments, instead of leaving this responsibility solely to Amer. Moreover, he instructed that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyalties. Nasser retracted the initiative after Amer's allies in the officers corps threatened to mobilize against him.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's Transformation Plan, the 3rd Brigade, 75th Division was redesignated as the 166th Aviation Brigade, {{under the}} command of Division West of the First Army. Its mission would be <b>to</b> <b>train</b> <b>and</b> {{mobilize}} aviation units of the Army's reserve and national guard components. It was to be the only brigade under the First Army that specialized in training for Army aviation units. It was activated 1 December 2006 as a reserve unit at Fort Riley. The brigade became a partner organization of the 1st Infantry Division, which was stationed at Fort Riley and could provide better support than the headquarters of First Army Division West, which was headquartered at Fort Carson, Colorado and maintained units all over the western United States. The brigade received a shoulder sleeve insignia on 13 June 2007, but it has not been authorized for wear due to First Army policy requiring its units to wear its SSI.|$|E

5|$|Born {{near the}} New South Wales country town of Bathurst, Booth moved to Sydney in 1952 and {{played in the}} grade cricket {{competition}} while training to become a teacher. He made his first-class debut for the New South Wales cricket team and came to prominence in dramatic circumstances in his second match, against the touring Englishmen in 195455. Due to late withdrawals, Booth was selected at late notice {{and had to be}} called from work {{on the morning of the}} match. After arriving after the start of the match, he scored 74 following a batting collapse. Booth struggled to make an impression early in his career and missed a season <b>to</b> <b>train</b> <b>and</b> with the Australian field hockey team for the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne. Upon returning to first-class cricket in 195758, he held down a regular position in the state team while the Test players were touring overseas. Booth gradually progressed and gained selection on the 195960 Australian Second XI tour to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{established}} the Territorial Force, which replaced the outdated and recently disbanded Volunteer Force. He organised {{the structure of}} the New Zealand Military Forces into four military districts, with each district to be capable of raising an infantry and a mounted brigade. The districts had a specified number of battalions and regiments organised {{along the lines of the}} British Army. He also formed a New Zealand Staff Corps <b>to</b> <b>train</b> <b>and</b> administer the Territorial Force. The quality of small arms and other personal equipment provided to the country's military personnel were improved and orders placed for new artillery pieces and machine-guns.|$|E
5|$|He briefly {{commanded}} the 90th Light Division Afrika in late 1941 before being wounded. After he recovered {{he was sent}} to the Eastern Front. Mickl {{commanded the}} 12th Rifle Brigade of the 12th Panzer Division in the east, taking over the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment when his brigade headquarters was disestablished. Transferred to the Führerreserve, he was promoted to Generalmajor, and received the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his outstanding commitment and leadership during the Soviet 1942–43 winter offensives around Rzhev. He then commanded the 11th Panzer Division during the Battle of Kursk. Later in 1943, he was appointed <b>to</b> <b>train</b> <b>and</b> command the 392nd (Croatian) Infantry Division, and led it in fighting against the Yugoslav Partisans before dying of wounds inflicted in the last month of the war. In 1967, the Austrian Bundesheer barracks in Bad Radkersburg was named after him.|$|E

5|$|The Regiment {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>train</b> <b>and</b> grow, {{leading to}} the activation of the 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiment at Fort Ord in November 1942. The 2nd Regiment was assigned to Camp Cooke and the 1st to Camp Beale. Eventually, more than 7,000 soldiers would be assigned to the Filipino Infantry Regiments. While at Camp Beale, there was a mass naturalization ceremony of 1,200 soldiers of the Regiment. As members {{of the armed forces}} they were able to become citizens; in 1924 naturalization of Filipino Americans had been barred, as it was determined that only aliens could be naturalized and Filipinos at the time were nationals. In November 1943, it paraded through Los Angeles, with Carlos Bulosan, the influential Filipino author of America Is in the Heart, there to witness it.|$|E
5|$|With {{the union}} {{threatening}} strike action, particularly at international matches, in April 1909 the Football Association insisted that all players agree {{to leave the}} union and pledge loyalty to the FA. Manchester United refused to issue the revised contracts to its players, and FA suspended the entire squad. The club then refused to pay the players in lieu of their suspension, and so the players instead took away ornaments from the club's office before Mangnall persuaded them to return the items. The players continued <b>to</b> <b>train,</b> <b>and</b> captain Charlie Roberts {{came up with the}} name of Outcasts F.C. The FA organised a meeting of 200 players, excluding the Outcasts, but a rambling speech from chairman Charles Clegg failed to win them over, and an agreement was reached where the PU would be recognised by the FA.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow <b>to</b> <b>train</b> <b>and</b> elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E
