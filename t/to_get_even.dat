5|$|Gibbs was {{appointed}} club captain {{at the start}} of the 1992–93 season. The team started the season with three First Division defeats in their opening six games, keeping just one clean sheet. However, on an individual level the season was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>even</b> worse for Gibbs. He sustained a knee injury against Notts County on 7 September 1992, putting him out of first team contention for six weeks. During his comeback, at home to Tranmere Rovers, Gibbs aggravated the previous injury, putting him out of action for more than two years. Concern over the injury, coupled with the good form of Gerard Lavin, restricted Gibbs' opportunities under Glenn Roeder in 1994–95.|$|E

Although Mushnick acts suspiciously nervous, Fink and Stoolie conclude that he knows nothing.

25|$|With two {{controversial}} races, {{the trip}} to England generated both bad feelings and bad press for Courtney and the Cornell rowing team.

Courtney believed that part of the problem was the rivalry between competing wire services. C. S.

Francis stayed with the Cornell team and helped out United Press reporters with information about the team. The Chicago Associated Press wanted to have their own representative.
