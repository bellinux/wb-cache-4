50|$|Here gamma <b>diversity</b> is <b>the</b> total species <b>diversity</b> of a {{landscape}} and alpha <b>diversity</b> is <b>the</b> mean species <b>diversity</b> per habitat. Because the limits among habitats and landscapes are diffuse {{and to some degree}} subjective, it has been proposed that gamma diversity can be quantified for any inventory dataset and that alpha and beta diversity can be quantified whenever the dataset is divided into subunits. Then gamma <b>diversity</b> is <b>the</b> total species <b>diversity</b> in <b>the</b> dataset and alpha <b>diversity</b> <b>the</b> mean species <b>diversity</b> per subunit.
