5|$|Stories for {{the show}} were often co-written by Burns, who also became a {{producer}} in the show's fourth season. Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because {{of the opportunity to}} work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: <b>Truth</b> <b>Be</b> Told. Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote {{for the show}} in each of its first three seasons. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics.|$|E
5|$|The land reforms {{brought about}} by the Arévalo {{administration}} threatened the interests of the landed elite, who sought a candidate who would be more amenable to their terms. They began to prop up Arana as a figure of resistance to Arévalo's reforms. The summer of 1949 saw intense political conflict in the councils of the Guatemalan military between supporters of Arana and those of Árbenz, over the choice of Arana's successor. On July 16, 1949, Arana delivered an ultimatum to Arévalo, demanding the expulsion of all of Árbenz's supporters from the cabinet and the military; he threatened a coup if his demands were not met. Arévalo informed Árbenz and other progressive leaders of the ultimatum; all agreed that Arana should be exiled. Two days later, Arévalo and Arana had another meeting; on the way back, Arana's convoy was intercepted by a small force led by Árbenz. A shootout ensued, killing three men, including Arana. Historian Piero Gleijeses stated that Árbenz probably had orders to capture, rather than to kill, Arana. Arana's supporters in the military rose up in revolt, but they were leaderless, and by the next day the rebels asked for negotiations. The coup attempt left approximately 150 dead and 200 wounded. Árbenz and a few other ministers suggested that the entire <b>truth</b> <b>be</b> made public; however, they were overruled by the majority of the cabinet, and Arévalo made a speech suggesting that Arana had been killed for refusing to lead a coup against the government. Árbenz kept his silence over the death of Arana until 1968, refusing to speak out without first obtaining Arévalo's consent. He tried to persuade Arévalo to tell the entire story when the two met in Montevideo in the 1950s, during their exile: however, Arévalo was unwilling, and Árbenz did not press his case.|$|E

50|$|Fitch's {{paradox of}} knowability {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} puzzles of epistemic logic. It provides a challenge to the knowability thesis, which states that every <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> in principle, knowable. The paradox is that this assumption implies the omniscience principle, which asserts that every <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> known. Essentially, Fitch's paradox asserts that the existence of an unknown <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> unknowable. So if all <b>truths</b> <b>were</b> knowable, it would follow that all <b>truths</b> <b>are</b> in fact known.|$|R
5000|$|The {{being of}} <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> the redoubling [...] of truth within yourself, within me, within him, that your life, my life, his life expresses the truth {{approximately}} in the striving for it, that your life, my life, {{his life is}} approximately the being of the truth in the striving for it, just as the <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> in Christ a life, for he <b>was</b> the <b>truth.</b> And therefore, Christianly understood, <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> obviously not to know the <b>truth</b> but to <b>be</b> the <b>truth.</b> Despite all modern philosophy, there is an infinite difference here, best seen in Christ's relation to Pilate, for Christ could not, could only untruthfully reply to the question [...] "What is truth?" [...] precisely {{because he was not}} the one who knew what <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> but <b>was</b> the <b>truth.</b> Not as if {{he did not know what}} <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> but when one <b>is</b> the <b>truth</b> and when the requirement is to <b>be</b> the <b>truth,</b> to know the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> untruth. For knowing the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> something that entirely of itself accompanies being the truth, not the other way around. And that is why it becomes untruth when knowing the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> separated from being the truth or when knowing the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> made identical with being it, since it is related the other way. <b>Being</b> the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> identical with knowing the truth, and Christ would never have known the truth if he has not been it, and nobody knows more of the truth than what he <b>is</b> of the <b>truth.</b> Practice in Christianity, 1848, Hong, 1991, p. 205-206 ...|$|R

She also imagined that 18 people witnessed the abuse, and she listed them by name. However, none of those named supported her stories of abuse.

25|$|The {{significance}} of this conclusion {{is that it allows}} Davidson to draw on the work of Alfred Tarski in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for artificial languages. Thus, Davidson takes three questions to be central to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of <b>truth</b> <b>be</b> given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first question can be answered affirmatively.|$|E

He also argued that, contrary to speculation about his wealth, Bogdan-Pitești [...] "maybe paid up so little because that is all he had to spare".

500|$|George {{grew into}} a healthy but {{reserved}} and shy child. The family moved to Leicester Square, where George {{and his younger brother}} Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, were educated together by private tutors. Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German, as well as comment on political events of the time, by the age of eight. He was the first British monarch to study science systematically. Apart from chemistry and physics, his lessons included astronomy, mathematics, French, Latin, history, music, geography, commerce, agriculture and constitutional law, along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing, fencing, and riding. His religious education was wholly Anglican. At age 10 George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison's play Cato and said in the new prologue: [...] "What, tho' a boy! It may with <b>truth</b> <b>be</b> said, A boy in England born, in England bred".

'Louboutins' ... definitely has the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into."

However, if one puts together the salient passages from some of his later papers such as “Logic”, “Thought ” and even a bit from “On Sinn and Bedeutung ” a picture of Frege’s views on truth begins to emerge. 1 Common to these texts is the view that the word “true ” is ultimately indefinable.
