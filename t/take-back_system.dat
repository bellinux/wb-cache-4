Utilizing nine case studies, this gap is addressed by exploring the use of value propositions entailing product–service systems among Swedish fashion firms. The value propositions in use by the firms suggest that sustainable consumption may be extending beyond purchase to also include aspects of use and disposal, suggesting new reciprocal responsibilities for firms and consumers. Similarities are found in what elements firms incorporate in their value propositions (i. e. more sustainable textiles, repair and <b>take-back</b> <b>systems),</b> but differences in how these are elaborated, testifying to the inter-organizational dynamics that embed practices.

Proper destruction of pharma residues should yield rest products without any pharmaceutical or ecotoxic activity. Furthermore, the residues should not act as components in the environmental formation of new such products. Incineration at a high temperature (>1000 degrees Celsius) is considered to fulfil the requirements, but even following such incineration residual ashes from the incineration should be properly taken care of.|$|R

On the basis of the 2005 amendment of the Act on Waste the producers and importers of electrical and electronic equipment are obliged to guarantee the take-back, separate collection, processing, reuse and disposal of the end-of-life products launched to the Czech market.

40|$|In theory, {{individual}} producer responsibility (IPR) creates {{incentives for}} "design-for-recycling". Yet in practice, implementing IPR is challenging, particularly if applied to waste electric and electronic equipment. This article discusses different options for implementing IPR schemes and producers' under German WEEE legislation. In addition, practical {{aspects of a}} German "return share" brand sampling scheme are examined. Concerning "new" WEEE put on the market after 13 August 2006, producers in Germany can choose between two different methods of calculating take-back obligations. These can be determined {{on the basis of}} "return shares" or "market shares". While market shares are regularly monitored by a national clearing house, the "return share" option requires sampling and sorting of WEEE. Herein itis shown that the specifics of the German WEEE take-back scheme require high sample sizes and multi-step test procedures to ensure a statistically sound sampling approach. Since the market share allocation continues to apply for historic waste, producers lack incentives for choosing the costly brand sampling option. However, even return share allocation might not imply a decisive step towards IPR, as it merely represents an alternative calculation of market shares. Yet the fundamental characteristics of the German <b>take-back</b> <b>system</b> remain unchanged: the same anonymous mix of WEEE goes to the same treatment operations. In the future, radio frequency identification-based sorting options could foster IPR and incentives for changes in product design.

Currently, {{there is a need}} to increase reuse and recycling rates of mobile phone, as they remain disturbingly low, while at the same time, inadequate return and collection incentives and systems are impeding future solutions in the field. We examine the opportunities and limitations for the implementation of a business model based on circular economy; entailing and emphasising the importance of the integration of ecodesign tools and a structured <b>take-back</b> <b>system.</b> As a new and upcoming smartphone producer, we examine Fairphone’s value-chain and the influence which it has on ecodesign initiatives. Additionally, we examine Fairphone’s experiments with a new return scheme, including focus on a leasing model. We find that Fairphone’s scale of production and bargaining power in its supply-chain are incapable of imposing ecodesign changes of the hardware in the smartphone. Influential and stabile production modes and the complexity of a modular structured supply-chain are embedding this production structure making type II, III and IIII ecodesign changes difficult to implement. In regards of software, we find that there is a huge potential in lifespan increases of mobile phone by applying aligned and modified software updates within the technical capabilities of the mobile phone’s hardware. Despite the opportunities a single mobile phone producer has in regard to the making of ecodesign changes, it is of most importance, that this attempt is backed up by bigger parties in the industry, which can create new ways of designing mobile phones. The increased lifespan will divert and increase the incentives for repeated leasing agreements. Furthermore, we want to stress that it is of utmost importance that the return scheme is still in control of the mobile phone in the end-of-life stage, but that more research should be carried out investigating the most desirable recirculation route of a smartphone...|$|E
30|$|Recently, the {{approach}} of extended producer responsibility (EPR) has gained {{a lot of attention}} and discussion in the EU. Extended producer responsibility requires the original manufacturer or producer to take back the product after its use. In EPR, the goal is that already in the design phase producers think about and plan how they can reduce environmental impact of the product after its use. This post-consumer waste should be reused, redesigned or recycled. In this concept, companies are forced to have a waste management <b>system</b> and preferably <b>take-back</b> <b>systems</b> based on closed or open loop thinking, or, if not, pay waste treatment costs. Closed loop thinking means that all off-cuts, waste and products after their use time are treated inside the factory’s own processes, and open loop means that leftovers are handled by some other outside partner (Niinimäki 2013; Belz and Peattie 2011). The principle is familiar in, e.g. electronic products but not yet in textiles.|$|R
40|$|A {{circular}} {{economy has been}} proposed as a sustainable alternative to our current linear economic system, mainly by recirculating material resources for new product development. To understand resource recirculation in practice, this paper analyses over 50 examples of products developed from discarded materials, categorising them into the recovery routes described in the {{circular economy}} literature. The examples were obtained during interviews with waste management professionals and designers who had developed products with discards. Practical challenges to implementing a circular economy were identified based on the example categorisation and comments from the interviews. The main difference observed was that the examples mostly recirculate resources to make different types of products, whereas a circular economy requires manufacturing companies to take back their own products to secure their material resources. This is partly because in practice the material collection system in place is waste management, rather than manufacturing-centred <b>take-back</b> <b>systems.</b> A revised model for recovery routes in society in which waste management is allocated {{an important role in}} facilitating material recirculation is therefore presented. The study highlights that current product design is facing a new challenge of anticipating social, economic and environmental challenges to realise the goals of a circular economy...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} public {{awareness}} of environmental issues has increased dramatically. This awareness has resulted in increased governmental control of related matters, for example, of waste and of industrial emissions. Consumer and legislative pressures are forcing manufacturers to broaden the manufacturing system to include product take back and recovery. A <b>take-back</b> <b>system</b> necessitates good logistics and information systems. This thesis proposes a decision support system that assists in decision-making in relation to end-of-life (EOL) products. There are several options at the end-of-life of a product: reuse/part reclamation, remanufacturing, recycling, incineration (with or without energy recovery) or discard to landfill. Each option has an economic and an environmental impact. The impacts are described by indicators that have specific values for each option. Decision-makers - who may be recycling companies, original equipment manufacturers or local authorities - need to determine which option, or combination of options, is best in a given situation. A mathematical model to assist in this decision is proposed. The model is based on vectors that contain indicators’ values for each EOL option. A generic EOL scenario, which may comprise a combination of EOL options is expressed as a linear combination of options. This modelling approach permits the use of linear algebra tools in expressing and solving problems related to EOL scenario of products such as: calculate the best scenario structure given the targets set by the EU WEEE Directive and the EOL options vectors; solve ‘What I f situations; when used in combination with a multi-criteria analysis method (such as AHP), identify the best EOL option from an environmental and economic point of view.

40|$|One of the {{industry}} sectors with the longest history in remanufacturing is the automotive industry. Remanufactured parts include brake calipers, engines, servo pumps and alternators. A big challenge for automotive component remanufacturers is to achieve {{a steady flow of}} cores (parts that are used for remanufacturing). This flow could be secured by making agreements with core suppliers, such as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), a core broker or another actor in the market. The remanufacturer can also choose to collect the cores without closer collaboration with the core suppliers. One crucial aspect in choosing how to collect the cores is {{that it has to be}} lucrative. The aim of this paper is to explore how remanufacturers manage their inter-organizational relationships in the closed-loop supply chain. A case study was conducted within the European research project ‘CAN-REMAN’, and empirical data was collected from six participating companies within the project, all European small and medium-sized (SME) remanufacturers of automotive components. These companies were investigated, and their relationships, defined in earlier research with core suppliers, were evaluated. A key finding of the research is that the most problematic parameter with supplier relationships is to receive the ordered quantity of cores from the supplier. This parameter is continually ranked as one of the most important, and the participating companies also claim to have problems with it. A successful relationship and <b>take-back</b> <b>system</b> was pointed out by one of the companies to never be the owner of the actual cores, and only perform the remanufacturing activity (service) for an OEM. This new relationship, called reman-contract, is where the OEM owns the core and the remanufacturer just performs remanufacturing including some sorting and storing. It was found that with this kind of relationship, the ordered quantity of cores was fulfilled to a higher degree, and thus the challenge of achieving a steady flow of cores was met. CAN-REMA...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{innovations}} receive increasing {{attention from}} policy makers {{since they are}} expected to produce a double dividend, i. e. limit environmental burden and contribute to the technological modernization of the economy. As a consequence, analyzing these kinds of technological progress has become a challenging task in environmental and innovation economics. This paper provides new empirical evidence regarding the determinants of different types of environmental innovations. The underlying unique firm level data set from the German manufacturing sector includes information not only regarding environmental technological product and process innovations, but also on organizational measures such as certified environmental management systems. The discrete choice analysis is based on binary probit, simple multinomial logit, and flexible multinomial probit models. Multinomial discrete choice models are considered because they allow for the analysis of the determinants of specific types of environmental innovations compared to the absence of environmental innovations as basic alternative. We show that environmental management tools such as product design with life cycle analysis and particularly <b>take-back</b> <b>systems</b> for products have a significantly strong positive effect on both environmental product and process innovations. In contrast, we find only minor effects of certified environmental management systems. While the world-wide ISO 14001 standard has a significantly weak positive influence, the Europea...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the second-best household's waste recycling policy. If we assume the first-best economy with no illegal disposal or transaction costs, then unit pricing, an advance disposal fee and a recycling subsidy are required {{in order to}} achieve the social optimum such that both the sum of unit pricing and an advance disposal fee and the sum of unit pricing and a recycling subsidy are equal to the marginal disposal cost. Furthermore, the first-best outcome can also be obtained by a producer <b>take-back</b> requirement <b>system.</b> In the real economy, however, various factors prevent the first-best optimal outcome. In this study we consider two factors, one being the transaction cost associated with a recycling subsidy (or refund) and the other being illegal disposal by the consumer. If a recycling subsidy (or a deposit-refund system) is adopted, a transaction cost associated with it will be generated. Alternatively, if unit pricing is adopted, some of the consumed goods may be disposed of illegally. We show the complete trade-off between unit pricing and a recycling subsidy. In other words, we can not adopt unit pricing and a recycling subsidy simultaneously. As a result, there are three candidates for the second-best policy: unit pricing with an advance disposal fee, a deposit-refund system, and a producer <b>take-back</b> requirement <b>system.</b> Which of these three policies is the second-best policy will depend on the relative magnitude of the price of a recycled good and the marginal transaction cost associated with a recycling subsidy (or the refund in a deposit-refund system). Generally, if the price of a recycled good is positive and the marginal transaction cost is relatively high, unit pricing with an advance disposal fee is the second-best policy. However, where the price of a recycled good is negative and the marginal transaction cost is relatively high, a producer <b>take-back</b> requirement <b>system</b> is the second-best policy. Further, where the marginal transaction cost is relatively low, a deposit-refund system is the second-best policy, regardless of whether the price of a recycled good is positive or negative.

40|$|The {{focus of}} {{environmental}} work in manufacturing companies has increasingly shifted from end-of-pipe {{solutions to the}} environmental performance of products and services. The product development process is central to creating value for customers. This thesis argues that companies can simultaneously create value for consumers and be profitable while taking environmental considerations into account. Modernising ecodesign means taking advantage of environmental benefits and the innovation potential when developing solutions rather than using ecodesign simply to ensure that legal requirements or customer demands are met. Ecodesign is a strategic issue and {{should be included in}} early product development activities, such as for project selection and when setting product targets. There is also need to perform ecodesign according to the characteristics of specific development processes as for radical product development or when developing integrated solutions, using a combination of services and products. This thesis reports on the findings from five different research studies, all of which adopted a qualitative approach in which the emphasis falls on exploring and creating understanding and meaning. The studies focused on three areas of ecodesign: A) rethinking approaches for manufacturing companies, B) setting environmental project targets and project selection and C) redesign of products. Recommendations on how to modernise ecodesign have been developed and can be summarised in six points: • Perform ecodesign both vertically and horizontally in a company. • Increase interaction between organisational units. • Take advantage of innovation potential in products, services, user behaviour and the delivery and <b>take-back</b> <b>systems.</b> • Take environmental considerations into account in the project selection process. • Set environmental targets for ensuring that environmental considerations are taken when developing innovative solutions. • Develop ecodesign procedures that fit the characteristics of the development proces...|$|R
50|$|Pharmaceutical {{residues}} {{may reach}} the environment {{by a number}} of different routes. It is generally assumed (albeit hardly verified) that the production of pharmaceuticals in industrialised countries is well controlled and unharmful to the environment, due to the local legal restrictions usually required to permit production. However, a substantial fraction of the global production of pharmaceuticals takes place in low-cost production countries like India and China. Recent reports from India demonstrate that such production sites may emit very large quantities of e.g. antibiotics, yielding levels of the drugs in local surface waters higher than those found in the blood of patients under treatment.The major route for pharmaceutical residues to reach the aquatic environment is most probably by excretion from patients undergoing pharma treatment. Since many pharmaceutical substances are not metabolized in the body they may be excreted in biologically active form, usually via the urine. Furthermore, many pharmaceutical substances are not fully taken up from the intestine (following oral administration in patients) into their blood stream. The fraction not taken up into the blood stream will remain in the gut and eventually be excreted via the faeces. Hence, both urine and faeces from treated patients contain pharmaceutical residues. Between 30 and 90% of the orally administered dose is generally excreted as active substance in the urine. An additional source to environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals is improper disposal of unused or expired drug residues. In European countries <b>take-back</b> <b>systems</b> for such residues are usually in place (although not always utilized to full extent) while in e.g. the US only voluntary initiatives on a local basis exist. Though most of the waste goes to incineration and people are asked to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least “rarely” via the toilet or sink. Proper destruction of pharma residues should yield rest products without any pharmaceutical or ecotoxic activity. Furthermore, the residues should not act as components in the environmental formation of new such products. Incineration at a high temperature (>1000 degrees Celsius) is considered to fulfil the requirements, but even following such incineration residual ashes from the incineration should be properly taken care of.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} {{extended producer responsibility}} in the Flemish waste policy, the Flemish government introduced the duty of acceptance in the Waste Decree. At the moment, the duty applies for paper, batteries, vehicles, tyres and electrical and electronic equipment. Producers are obliged to set up free of charge <b>take-back</b> collection <b>systems</b> for the disposal of their products in the post-consumption phase. As such, market failure is corrected by reconverting social costs into private ones, respecting the polluter pays principle. For the practical execution of the basic rules laid down in the legal framework, negotiated agreements are concluded with sector associations. This sector-based policy approach allows setting up efficient collection and disposal networks {{taking into account the}} specific characteristics of each waste product rather than implementing a uniform system. Although the duty of acceptance confronts producers with waste management responsibilities, they have actually succeeded in shifting most of the burden to the recovery sector. As waste management organisations have become the rightful owner of end-of-life products, they were able to create a rivalry amongst waste management companies. This enabled them to impose the recovery targets, to which the producers have engaged themselves in the negotiated agreements, on the recovery sector. On the one hand the monopolistic position of these waste management organisations stimulates market concentration in the recovery sector, setting aside small and medium sized companies, which could lead to negative monopolistic consequences. On the other hand, this entails a positive effect on the environmental performance of the recovery sector. Moreover, a lot of management tasks are passed on from government administrations to these private waste management organisations so that more government resources can be spent to tailor-made waste policy making. Additional resources and learning experiences have significantly improved the quality of more recently concluded negotiated agreements. Convinced that this innovative policy approach contributes to the overall goal of sustainable development, the government has already planned to start up additional sector-based policy programs based on the duty of acceptance.

40|$|Institutions {{of higher}} {{learning}} (universities) contribute significantly to the rapidly growing threat of e-waste. This research focused mainly on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) e-waste management in selected universities in the Kiang Valley of Central Region, Malaysia. ICT equipments (computers, printers, copiers) are {{the most widely used}} and frequently replaced electronics in universities and if not soundly managed pose grave environmental hazards because of their components which contain toxic substances. The objective of the article is to analyze e-waste flow among selected institutions {{of higher learning}} using material flow analysis model. Material Flow Analysis (MFA) modeling was conducted to investigate e-waste management systems, from asset purchase, use, end-of-life and disposal. Furthermore, MFA also led to better system analysis which contributed to practical recommendations for sustainable e-waste management. STAN (subSTance flow ANalysis) 2. 5 software was used to perform the MFA modeling providing graphical models of university e-waste management, data reconciliation, propagation of uncertainty and gross error detection. Findings of the research showed that some universities generated 100 tons of ICT e-waste in 2012 with an estimated market value of RM 0. 3 million (US$ 98. 500). The study also found that 7. 5 tons of e-waste was discarded into the MSW stream thus contributing to heavy metal contamination in landfill or dump sites. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) options i. e. <b>take-back</b> in university <b>systems</b> were practically nonexistent in these universities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Urbanization is the {{key factor}} to {{increase}} the solid waste generation especially in cities. Initiatives and various programs of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (3 R’s) that has been introduced by the Government since 1993, yet has shown no positive changes. Recycling rate is just a 5 % to 10 % which is very alarming. It shows that the major problem {{is the lack of}} recycling activities which will increase the amount of solid waste generated daily. The exposure of 3 R’s approach shall be strengthened further by the Government, public and the concessionaire appointed to manage solid waste in order to increase awareness of the importance of 3 R in Solid Waste Management (SWM). This study has been carry out by implementing 3 R’s approaches as the main focus and narrowed down the scope into the awareness of two main entities in the SWM which is the government and the concessionaire on the importance of the 3 Rs in SWM. The aim {{of this study is to}} see how far the awareness of the government and the concessionaire on the importance of the 3 R’s approach in SWM based on the initiative and its involvement. The case study method has been adopted and Kuala Lumpur is chosen as the study area based on urbanization factor that influence the amount of solid waste generation. In this study, the interviews technique was used to strengthen the output specifically for government agencies (PPSPP, JPSPN and DBKL) and private concessionaire (Alam Flora Sdn Bhd). The data were analysed using qualitative analysis and the results is presented in the form of descriptive (Descriptive Analysis). At the end of this study it was found that the awareness of the Government agencies and concessionaire is high based on the participation and initiatives. <b>Take-back</b> and buy-back <b>system</b> and the mandatory of the amendment of an Act 672 for the separation at source is the best practice to increase the awareness of all parties of the importance of the 3 R approach in Solid Waste Management...|$|R
40|$|E-waste” is {{the term}} popularly {{used to refer to}} {{end-of-life}} or discarded electrical and electronic equipment. Institutions of higher learning (universities) contribute significantly to the rapidly growing threat of E-waste. This research seeks to establish if there are any institutional mechanisms for E-waste management and assess the level of university public (staff and student) knowledge on E-waste. The research focused mainly on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) E-waste management in selected universities in the Klang Valley of Central Region, Malaysia. ICT equipment (computers, printers, copiers) are the most widely used and frequently replaced electronics in universities and if not soundly managed pose grave environmental hazards because of their components which contain toxic substances such as lead, nickel, beryllium, mercury, cadmium, chromium, copper, lithium etc. Through a thorough study of eight (8) universities in the Klang Valley, the research established that none of the institutions had a deliberate or dedicated policy for E-waste management. However, the universities use a host of general end-of-life asset management practices (i. e. keeping in storage, donate to charity, sell to recyclers/traders) which also catered for the management of E-waste thus to varying degrees reduce the potential negative impacts of institutional E-waste. Material Flow Analysis (MFA) modeling was conducted to increase understanding of university E-waste management systems from asset purchase, use, end-of-life and disposal. Furthermore, MFA also led to better system analysis which aid in giving practical recommendations for sustainable university E-waste management. STAN (subSTance flow ANalysis) 2. 5 software was used to perform the MFA modeling providing graphical models of university E-waste management, data reconciliation, error propagation and gross error detection. Findings of the research show that the selected universities that took part in the study generated 100 metric tonnes of ICT E-waste in 2012 with an estimated market value of RM 0. 3 million (US 98, 500). The study also found that 7. 5 metric tonnes of E-waste was discarded into the MSW stream thus contributing to heavy metal contamination in landfill or dump sites and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) options i. e. <b>take-back</b> in university <b>systems</b> were practically nonexistent. The research also endeavored to assess university public knowledge on E-waste and using simple random sampling, 400 university public were interviewed. And with the aid of SPSS software the research established that university public knowledge or awareness on E-waste, sound E-waste management practices and the potential environmental and human health hazards posed by E-waste, was extremely low. However, the university public showed a positive willingness to learn more about E-waste. Based on the research findings it was recommended that universities in the Klang Valley and beyond should formulate and implement environmentally sound E-waste management policies. These policies should include for the increased E-waste collection and recycling through e. g. provision of collection bins (GreenBox) and E-waste collection days, ensure that sensitive data carrying E-wastes have their hard drives formatted or shredded before being sold or donated and promote university public knowledge on E-waste through awareness campaigns. ...|$|R
