5|$|Understanding {{that they}} could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a {{solution}} at the earliest opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, <b>to</b> <b>paraphrase</b> Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>paraphrase</b> the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God {{is the only one that}} is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

25|$|Translation {{has given}} rise to a number of issues, as the {{original}} languages are often quite different in grammar as well as word meaning. While the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy states that inerrancy applies only to the original languages, some believers trust their own translation to be the accurate one. One such group of believers is known as the King-James-Only Movement. For readability, clarity, or other reasons, translators may choose different wording or sentence structure, and some translations may choose <b>to</b> <b>paraphrase</b> passages. Because some of the words in the original language have ambiguous or difficult to translate meanings, debates over the correct interpretation occur.|$|E
25|$|In {{translating}} the 39 {{books of the}} Hebrew Bible, Jerome was relatively free in rendering their text into Latin, {{but it is possible}} to determine that the oldest surviving complete manuscripts of the Masoretic Text, which date from nearly 600 years after Jerome, nevertheless transmit a consonantal Hebrew text very close to that used by Jerome. Jerome translated the books of Judith and Tobit, engaging a Jewish intermediary to render the Aramaic into oral Hebrew for him then <b>to</b> <b>paraphrase</b> into Latin. The Vulgate Old Testament texts that were translated from the Greek, whether by Jerome or preserving revised or unrevised Old Latin versions, are early and important secondary witnesses to the Septuagint.|$|E
25|$|The New Testament {{has been}} {{preserved}} in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th century CE Alexandrian text-type; the Western text-type, also very early but prone <b>to</b> <b>paraphrase</b> and other corruptions; and the Byzantine text-type, which makes up above 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very {{late in the}} tradition. Scholars regard the Alexandrian text-type as generally more authoritative when treating textual variations. The majority of differences are minor—matters such as variant spellings—although at a few points the oldest manuscripts show important inconsistencies compared with the more recent ones: these include the endings of Mark 16, describing Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, from the Gospel of Mark; the absence from John {{of the story of}} the woman taken in adultery; and an explicit reference to the Trinity in 1 John (the Comma Johanneum). Scholars such as Bart Ehrman have speculated that John 21 was appended to the gospel at a later date, but no manuscript evidence for this assertion has been discovered.|$|E

According to Wright, this happens in several of Paul's letters: Galatians and Romans.|$|R
25|$|Modern logicists (like Bob Hale, Crispin Wright, {{and perhaps}} others) have {{returned}} to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as Hume's principle (the number of objects falling under the concept F equals the number of objects falling under the concept G {{if and only if}} the extension of F and the extension of G can be put into one-to-one correspondence). Frege required Basic Law V {{to be able to give}} an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (<b>to</b> <b>paraphrase</b> him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that they have had to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem so obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.|$|E

40|$|The use of pivot {{languages}} and wordalignment techniques over bilingual corpora has proved an effective approach for extracting paraphrases {{of words and}} short phrases. However, inherent ambiguities in the pivot language(s) can lead <b>to</b> inadequate <b>paraphrases.</b> We propose a novel approach that is able <b>to</b> extract <b>paraphrases</b> by pivoting through multiple languages while discriminating word senses in the input language, i. e., the language <b>to</b> be <b>paraphrased.</b> Text in the input language is annotated with “senses ” {{in the form of}} foreign phrases obtained from bilingual parallel data and automatic word-alignment. This approach shows 62 % relative improvement over previous work in generating paraphrases that are judged both more accurate and more fluent. ...|$|R
