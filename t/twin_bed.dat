40|$|This article {{examines}} the advent of <b>twin</b> <b>beds</b> as a common sleeping arrangement for English couples. Through an analysis {{of a range of}} sources from the late nineteenth to mid twentieth centuries—marketing materials, advertisements, domestic, decorative and marital advice books and novels and films—it argues that while <b>twin</b> <b>beds</b> were initially recommended by proponents of the domestic sanitation movement as part of a raft of hygiene measures, by the 1920 s they had become a fashionable item of bedroom furniture for modern couples in ‘companionate’ marriages. It was in this context that Marie Stopes, in her popular marital advice books, railed against them as an ‘invention of the devil’, symptomatic of the evils of modernity, and endangering the happiness of the modern married couple. The article concludes that, despite these changing contexts of consumption, the significance of the history of <b>twin</b> <b>beds</b> needs to be understood through the intersecting discourses of domesticity, health and sexuality...|$|R
