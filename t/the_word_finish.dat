40|$|Abstract Diversity of suffix ‘-i’, called ‘ya’, in Persian language, {{which is}} of {{important}} consideration, for any reason, {{has not been able}} to attract scholars and grammarians in the field of Persian language. Here is an attempt to mention different kinds of ‘ya’ and to explain their applications, relying on grammar books, dictionaries, and today native application. The character generally has three types of applications in Persian language. It is firstly one of the Persian alphabet, so it primarily functions as a ‘phoneme’. It is applied in its second function when appears in the form of ’morpheme’, such as ‘-i’ in ‘mardi rad shod’ (a man passed) with usage of indefinite article. The third function appears when it comes in the place of a word, because it is one of the six types of pronouns. So, ‘ya’ is applied in three forms: phoneme, morpheme and word. In continue, it is attempted to explain these kinds in more details. ‘ya’ as indefinite maker (Nakare) : This kind of ‘ya’ is called the mark of indefinite by many of the Persian grammarians, including doctor Mohammad Moin. Dehkhoda says ‘ya’ is added to the end of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> to make it an indefinite one, such as <b>the</b> last <b>word</b> and it is a sign of indefinite types " of " is unknown, such as‘-i’ in ‘pesari ra didam’ (I saw a boy). ‘ya’ as numerical suffix means one (vahdat) :  This kind is added to the last  of <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> and means "one". The difference between this one and the previous, ‘ya’ as indefinite maker, is just in their meanings. ‘ya’ as attributive suffix: This ‘ya’ is joined by various kinds of Persian words an attributes them to someone, some place or something, such as ‘Shirazi’(from shiraz), ‘farsi’(Persian), ‘Irani’(Iraian), Barmaki (Barmakian). This kind also sometimes has other meanings like emphasis, adverbial, degradation, similarity, vehicle, type, distance, and so on. ‘ya’ as addressing suffix (khetab) : This kind is added to the end of verbs and is one of the six subjective pronouns – ‘-am’, ‘-i’, ‘-ad’, ‘-im’, ‘-id,’ ‘-and’ –used jointly. This just joins by verb and sometimes verb is replaced by it. ‘ya’ as infinitive maker: It is added to the end of nouns and adjectives to form various kinds of infinitives. Such as ‘-i’ in ‘madari’ (to be mother). ‘ya’ as a suffix means astonishment: This ‘ya’ appears in the end of adjectives meaning astonishment, such as ‘che marde zeshti!’ (what an ugly man!). ‘ya’ as description planner (relative, indefinite) : This one has been called by grammarians variously indefinite, allusion, definition, descriptive, relative, indicative, and so on. These names are the matter of debates in this essay. ‘ya’ as emphatic suffix for adverbs: Another kind of ‘ya’ can be named adverb maker. 1 - It is an independent one for which two possibilities can be considered: It comes with some adverbial expressions with an emphatic function such as  ‘zoodi amad’ (he came soon). 2 - It carries the burden of preposition in other adverbial forms, such as ‘be zoodi’ (soon). Arabic ‘ya’s in Persian language: Some kinds of ‘ya’ are Arabic, such as geminated ‘ya’ in attributives, and first person pronoun ‘ya’ which have separately or jointly by their words entered within Persian language and found their places. ‘ya’ as  institution of ‘-e’ (kasre) meaning ‘of’: It comes at the end of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>finished</b> by non-pronounced ‘ha’ in combining with an adjective or noun in the genitive case to avoid the difficulty in pronunciation of a vowel besides another one...|$|R

The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can.

40|$|The study {{originated}} from an industrial {{case study in}} the field of steel production, but it presents a larger interest, as many other manufacturing fields have similar concerns (e. g. foundries, food, textile and paper industries). A significant phase of steel manufacturing is the product cooling (likewise, drying in paper and textile production, or maturing in food production). This phase may be completed in different ways, but (1) it must be carried out in the finished product warehouse and (2) it must meet both production optimisation and customer needs. The latter requirement acquires a strategic relevance in JIT environments. The present study proposes a mathematical model to find the optimal production schedule of steel billets, based on the relevant parameters of the productive system (set-up and processing times, demand profile). In the industrial case examined, the negative impact of holding costs on cash flows is also linked to the space required by the cooling process, which depends on the production schedule adopted. In other <b>words,</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> product storage can be considered a part of the manufacturing cycle and impacts on it. In the case of steel plants operating in JIT environments, the warehouse must be promptly emptied and carefully managed to exploit the available space. Thus, the effect of inventory costs is examined in a production–inventory system with finite capacity, where products are made to order and share the same manufacturing facility. The study is completed by an experimental analysis to investigate the effect of variations in the relevant parameters of the problem...|$|R
