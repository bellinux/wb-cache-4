5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President Roosevelt and the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before it}} {{opened to the}} public, the C gave notice of its {{intention}} to submit another private bill to Parliament, to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards Islington. Because of <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> arrangement of King William Street station, the extension {{was not to be}} connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The bill was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} extension failed to make a connection to the existing line. In November 1891, the C published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington. The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section.|$|E

5|$|The prompt {{accomplishments of}} the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section and Mashbir's {{executive}} ability resulted in Mashbir being promoted to full colonel by General Douglas MacArthur after only one month. Mashbir then joined the forefront of MacArthur's intelligence activities and Japanese surrender negotiations, remaining the Commandant of ATIS until December 1945. He was made famous {{at the time in}} the motion picture and still photograph of the preliminary surrender negotiations at Manila, as the man who pushed the ink-well, indicating that General Richard K. Sutherland should correct the Japanese Instrument of Surrender; and also as the man who thumbed the Japanese Lieutenant General Torashirō Kawabe along as he attempted to shake hands. The second incident provoked some mixed feelings, including sentiment that it could have damaged surrender talks. Mashbir also played a critical role retrieving and translating the Z Plan and in organizing the final surrender of Japan. In his autobiography, Mashbir explained that he was not permitted to shake hands, and {{that it would have been}} rude to point, which ultimately lead to <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> thumbing motion that was photographed.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E
5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and {{a public}} consultation was held in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, and {{to build a new}} bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.|$|E

Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened {{for the first time}} since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle.|$|E

Because of this, instead of Game 2 of the Finals being shown on the first night after sweeps ended, CBS could show Game 6 of the Conference Finals.|$|E

25|$|The {{city has}} often been used as the {{backdrop}} for romances like Indiscreet (1958) with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman and A Touch of Class (1973), and has become popular for romantic comedies in recent years. This is at least {{partly due to the}} television and film writer Richard Curtis, who has written some of the most successful British films of recent years — The Tall Guy (1989), Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), Notting Hill (1999) and Love Actually (2003), all set or partly set in the city. The films follow <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> love lives of largely upper-middle class characters (aside from The Tall Guy, always including one played by Hugh Grant).|$|E
25|$|The {{city centre}} {{is laid out}} on a grid plan, {{a result of the}} westward {{expansion}} from the old medieval core during the Georgian era, initially into the area now called the Merchant City. Much of the initial grid can be credited to a surveyor named James Barry. The desire to create a regular layout of streets fits in well with the Enlightenment ideas about rationality: at the same time, similar developments were taking place in Edinburgh, with the creation of the New Town. Despite this, the layout is not very regular, due to <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> topography, with numerous drumlins, as well as the generation of point de vues out of the existing Palladian mansions in the Merchant City, all but one now demolished.|$|E
25|$|The game is {{sometimes}} alternatively {{known by its}} development title, Dizzy 4, with the Roman numeral IV visible {{at the top of}} the game screen, behind the player's score. A prequel, Into Magicland, was released to promote the game and featured a new character that was never seen in any of the series games again. The game was widely acclaimed by critics across the platforms with scores typically in the 80-95% region. Criticism was leveled at its similarity to previous games in the series and <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> inventory system. By November 1991 it was noted that the Dizzy games had sold more than half a million units across all platforms. A NES version titled Wonderland Dizzy was developed in 1993 and later released in October 2015.|$|E

25|$|In March 1916, RFC Scout C No.5313 {{was fitted}} with a Vickers machine gun, {{synchronised}} to fire through the propeller by <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> Vickers-Challenger synchronising gear, the only gear available to the RFC at that time. Six other Scouts, late Scout Cs and early Scout Ds, were also fitted with the same combination. Types using this gear (including the B.E.12, the R.E.8 and the Vickers F.B.19) all had the gun mounted {{on the port side}} of the fuselage. The attempt to use the gear for synchronising a centrally mounted gun on the Bristol Scout failed and tests, which continued at least until May 1916, resulted in the abandonment of the idea and no Vickers-armed Bristol Scouts were used in operations.|$|E
25|$|Catchers {{also are}} prone to knee ailments {{stemming}} from <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> crouching stance they assume. Because of this, catchers have a reputation of being slow baserunners; {{even if they have}} speed {{at the beginning of their}} careers, the eventual toll taken on their knees slows them down, although there are some exceptions, such as Manny Sanguillén and Alex Avila. Some players who begin their career as catchers are moved to other positions in order to preserve their running speed, increase their availability for games, and take advantage of their prowess with the bat. Prominent examples of catchers switching position in mid-career include Mike Napoli, Craig Biggio, B. J. Surhoff, Joe Mauer, Brandon Inge, and Dale Murphy (although Murphy was also known as a poor thrower to the pitcher and to second base, nearly hitting pitchers in the process).|$|E
25|$|At 9:07 Moscow Time Osoaviakhim-1 {{lifted off}} and soon made radio {{contact with the}} airfield. By 9:56 the {{aircraft}} reached 15,000 metres according to on-board altimeter; at around 17,700 metres its envelope expanded into a nearly perfect sphere and eventually reached static equilibrium at 19,500 metres, exactly as intended by design. The crew experienced problems with carbon dioxide absorbers, but {{it appeared to be}} manageable. Fedoseenko dumped 310 kilograms of ballast and by 10:50 the balloon passed its design altitude of 20,500 metres. This moment was later marked as the point of no return: at 20,500 metres Osoaviakhim-1 carried just enough ballast to stabilize descent speed. Further ascent and inevitable loss of hydrogen made this ballast insufficient; the only escape route was through bailing out on personal parachutes, provided that the crew could open <b>the</b> <b>awkward</b> hatch. After nearly an hour at 20,600 metres Osoaviakhim-1 climbed again, reaching 22,000 metres at 12:33 and hovered at this record altitude for 12 minutes.|$|E
