5|$|Although many in NASA's Voyager {{program were}} {{supportive}} of the idea, there were concerns <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> a picture of Earth {{so close to the}} Sun risked damaging the spacecraft's imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan's idea was put into practice, but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to Voyager 1 were also being laid off or transferred to other projects. Finally, NASA Administrator Richard Truly interceded to ensure that the photograph was taken.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{education}} {{was the product}} of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC. It comprised a tripartite system of education <b>that,</b> <b>taking</b> shape during the Hellenistic era, was maintained, with inevitable changes, up until the fall of Constantinople. The stages of education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education.|$|E

5|$|In {{the market}} for sculpture, plagued by fakes, {{the value of a}} piece {{increases}} significantly when its provenance can be established. A Rodin work with a verified history sold for US$4.8 million in 1999, and Rodin's bronze Eve, grand modele– version sans rocher sold for $18.9 million at a 2008 Christie's auction in New York. Art critics concerned about authenticity have argued <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> a cast does not equal reproducing a Rodin sculpture– especially given the importance of surface treatment in Rodin's work.|$|E
5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> into account the fact that he (Pořádek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate.

5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various {{things such as}} smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males go to war. This is because they believe <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> life interferes {{with the ability to}} preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included {{a number of significant}} figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a Celtic Revival, similar to <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Deus Ex was {{revealed}} by Eidos in 2001 through job listings advertising for designers {{to work on}} the game. Later that month at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Eidos confirmed that both the second Deus Ex and the next Thief game would be coming to consoles before arriving on PC; the explanation was <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> the restrictions of console hardware into account would make later ports to PC more effective. Eidos officially announced the game E3 2002; the platforms listed were PC, Xbox and PS2. It was later revealed that Ion Storm were struggling to work out how to port the game to PS2 given the extensive hardware differences between the three platforms, and were reluctant to do so due to these issues. Following the game's release, it was clarified that no PS2 version would be developed. As part of the promotion, the soundtrack was made available for download through the game's website. A demo was released in November 2003. The game was released in North America on December 2, 2003. Following the North American release, Ion Storm released a patch to fix issues with the graphics and additional gameplay elements such as quick saves. The game released in Europe on March 5, 2004. The Xbox version was also released in Japan. First announced in March 2004, the game was released on June 17.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone. The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.|$|E

5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E
5|$|Marlene (Merle Dandridge) is {{the leader}} of the Fireflies, a militia {{movement}} hoping to wrest control of the Quarantine Zones from the military. She was tasked by Ellie's mother, a close friend of hers, to look out for her daughter, but Ellie only met her after her infection. After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to her would help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a shot to the head, ensuring that no-one is left to come after them.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic-Republican congressional caucus convened February 25, 1804. Contrary to {{previous}} conventions, the proceedings were open and formal. Afraid <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> vice presidential nominations {{from the floor}} would precipitate divisive oratory, chairman Stephen Bradley called for open balloting for the nomination. New York's George Clinton received a majority with 67 votes; Breckinridge garnered 20 votes, mostly from western delegates, and the remaining votes were scattered among 4 other candidates. Historian James C. Klotter concluded that the solons felt a ticket composed of Jefferson, a Virginian, and Breckinridge, a former Virginian, made little political sense. Breckinridge acceded to the choice; some reports hold that he asked his colleagues not {{to vote for him}} at all. Before the caucus adjourned, a thirteen-man committee was formed to promote the election of the Democratic-Republican ticket; Breckinridge represented Kentucky on the committee.|$|E
5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact <b>that</b> <b>taking</b> the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E
