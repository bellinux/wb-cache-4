25|$|Metropolitan Stadium was {{the home}} of the Minnesota Kicks soccer team from 1976 until the team folded in November 1981. The Kicks, members of the North American Soccer League, were highly {{anticipated}} in Minnesota and had to delay their first game at the Met by 15 minutes to accommodate the large crowd waiting to buy tickets. To help speed <b>things</b> <b>along,</b> the Kicks' owners let two thousand fans enter the stadium for free. An NASL attendance record was set one month later, when Pelé and the New York Cosmos drew 46,164 fans to Metropolitan Stadium. Large crowds continued for the Kicks, who drew 41,505 for that year's opening playoff game. Four days later, another record was set when 49,571 fans came to see the Kicks defeat San Jose, 3-1. The team enjoyed great success in their first four seasons in Minnesota, winning a division title each year. Attendance dipped {{toward the end of the}} franchise's history, however, with an average of 16,605 per game in 1981, their final season. The size of the field for soccer games was 100 by 72 yards 1976–78 and 104 by 72 yards 1979–81.|$|E
500|$|The {{proprietary}} Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for {{the game}} to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities, and the Euphoria and Bullet engines handle further animation and environment rendering tasks. The team found they could render the game world with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had {{become familiar with the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360's hardware. Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now we know what the hardware's capable of, so it's become a lot easier to move <b>things</b> <b>along</b> and a lot more fun, too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions fit onto one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or external storage device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks. The team asserted that any differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions would be negligible.|$|E

500|$|Joan O'Connell Hedman of Slant Magazine {{felt the}} episode {{to be the}} strongest of the second series. She praised the [...] "uniformly fantastic" [...] guest cast and the [...] "drop dead gorgeous" [...] {{exterior}} and interior locations. She singled out writer Phil Ford for considerable praise feeling that he wrote the episode true to the characters [...] "while filling in backstory we {{had no way of}} imagining" [...] and delivered [...] "drama, action, and laughs". Brad Trechak of AOL TV felt the more comic episode was a welcome respite from darker episodes. He praised the episode for being [...] "light and fluffy yet it furthered <b>things</b> <b>along</b> with regard to the Torchwood universe and its characters". Reviewing the episode Brigid Cherry of Total Sci-Fi felt that [...] "contrary to expectation– it’s hilarious". She praised the comedy provided from Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd and Nerys Hughes in particular as well as the [...] "terrifying moments that threaten to tip over into gross-out horror-comedy." [...] She felt overall the [...] "offbeat self-parody" [...] made a welcome change from the show's more serious episodes and rated it eight out of ten. Den of Geek's Jack Kibble-White found the episode to be a [...] "surprise series highlight".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I think you should do it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves <b>things</b> <b>along...</b> We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
2500|$|In candid {{remarks to}} high-value donors at a {{secretly}} recorded May 2012 private fundraiser, Romney {{said of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [...] "I look [...] at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political [...] purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and [...] these thorny issues, and I say, 'There's just no way.' And so what you do [...] is you say, 'You move <b>things</b> <b>along</b> the best way you can.' You hope for some degree [...] of stability, but you recognize {{that this is going}} to remain an unsolved [...] problem. We live with that in China and Taiwan. All right, we have a [...] potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick [...] the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something [...] will happen and resolve it." [...] He also noted that he had recently received a call from a former U.S. Secretary of State who had suggested that there might be a prospect for accord after the Palestinian elections. Romney made clear in his remarks at the fundraiser that he was opposed to the U.S. exerting any pressure on Israel to help reach a compromise: [...] "The idea of pushing on the Israelis to give something up to [...] get the Palestinians to act is the worst idea in the world." ...|$|E

60|$|And so {{that journey}} {{was to him}} very long indeed. Of course, it seemed longer because of the {{constant}} frights which came one right after another. It really was a terrible journey.

You know it often happens that people are frightened more by what they don't know than by what they do know.|$|R
2500|$|To commemorate {{what would}} have been Gould's 75th birthday, the Canadian Museum of Civilization held an {{exhibition}} titled Glenn Gould: The Sounds of Genius. The multimedia exhibit was held in conjunction with Library and Archives Canada. The exhibition opened September 28, 2007 and looked at five aspects of Gould: [...] "The person," [...] "The musician," [...] "The broadcast personality and producer," [...] "The writer and theorist, composer and conductor," [...] and [...] "The Sounds of Genius". Curator Sam Cronk said [...] "The primary purpose of the exhibition is to remind Canadians of the many facets of Gould's musical genius." [...] John F. Burns of The New York Times reported, in an interview with Herbert Kallmann, that the exhibit will omit many of Gould's eccentricities in favour of highlighting Gould's talent. Of the numerous documents, there are essays, scripts, and music scores. The scores on display were used for some of his most important recordings, marked only for breaks between takes. Peter Goddard of the Toronto Star says that the exhibit will give patrons a feeling {{of what it was like}} at Gould's home: [...] "The cramped space conveys a sense of what his St. Clair Ave. apartment might have felt like, with his piano at the very centre of <b>things,</b> <b>along</b> with his low piano chair made by his father." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series {{introduced}} {{new love}} interests for both Tony and Ziva {{in the latter}} half of Season 8, and in February 2011, Michael Ausiello from TVLine announced that Ziva's boyfriend [...] "Ray arrives in this season's 20th episode and is described as a handsome, charming, intelligent federal agent of Mediterranean or Latin American descent. He has a strong, nice-guy demeanor but—I'm quoting from the casting notice here—'there's a hint of a mystery behind his smile.'" [...] A week later, Glasberg described the character as a [...] "fun, smart, exciting addition", and Michael Weatherly commented, [...] "I think it’s going to be interesting. Tony cares about Ziva and wants to make sure she’s not mixed up with the wrong kind of guy, so he’s going to be watchful and protective of her." [...] After Enrique Murciano was cast for the role of Ray Cruz, Cote de Pablo said, [...] "You never know if you're gonna have chemistry, and since I had no say in the casting, I was sort of waiting to meet this famous Enrique Murciano." [...] She went on to describe his appearance in the show: [...] "There's a lovely scene in which he basically brings his interpretation of 'fancy' candlelight dinner, which takes place by the vending machines at NCIS. It's really funny. There's kissing involved. We kept it light and we kept it fun, and we kept it like two people who are genuinely in to each other and wanting to move <b>things</b> <b>along.</b> It's about what's going on between the lines. These two people are touchy-feely, and that's different for Ziva." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kassner uses {{many ideas}} such as form, , whole, order, idea etc., to {{emphasize}} the holistic aspects of his approach. The activity that forms {{the basis of this}} type of perception is seeing and interpreting (deuten). It calls for seeing-together, for a synoptic vision. This is why Kassner rejects the ‘thing-in-itself’ that never manifests itself in phenomena. Kassner holds that the image includes the <b>thing</b> <b>along</b> with its movement, its dunamis. The phenomena are not the external covering of content. Form and content yield a unity, held together by imagination, whereas critical reason separates them. Imagination is synthetic; reason is analytic.|$|R
