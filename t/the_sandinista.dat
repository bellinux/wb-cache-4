5|$|In Latin America, {{revolutions}} brought {{changes in}} women's status {{in countries such}} as Nicaragua, where feminist ideology during <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> Revolution aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.|$|E
5|$|Lesbian {{consciousness}} {{began in}} Nicaragua in 1986, when <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> National Liberation Front expelled {{gay men and}} lesbians from its midst. State persecution prevented the formation of associations until AIDS became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was Nosotras, founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when Grupo Safo– Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 the Ethio-Somali War {{broke out}} over the disputed Ogaden region as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; {{although}} a former ally of Somali President Siad Barre, Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government of Ethiopia. He sent troops {{under the command of}} General Arnaldo Ochoa to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the Ethiopians to suppress the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, a measure Castro refused to support. Castro extended support to Latin American revolutionary movements, namely <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> National Liberation Front in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in July 1979. Castro's critics accused the government of wasting Cuban lives in these military endeavors; the anti-Castro Center for a Free Cuba has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign Cuban military actions. When U.S. state critics claimed that Castro had no right to interfere in these nations, he countered that Cuba had been invited into them, pointing out the U.S.' own involvement in various foreign nations.|$|E
25|$|Soon after <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> assumed power, <b>the</b> {{hierarchy}} {{began to}} oppose <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> government. <b>The</b> Archbishop was a vocal source of domestic opposition. The hierarchy was {{alleged to be}} motivated by fear {{of the emergence of}} the 'popular church' which challenged their centralized authority. The hierarchy also opposed social reforms implemented by <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> to aid <b>the</b> poor, allegedly because they saw it as a threat to their traditionally privileged position within society. In response to this perceived opposition, <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> shut down <b>the</b> church-run Radio Católica radio station on multiple occasions.|$|R
25|$|In the Nicaraguan general election, 1990, a {{coalition}} of anti-Sandinista parties (from {{the left and right}} of the political spectrum) led by Violeta Chamorro, the widow of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, defeated <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas.</b> <b>The</b> defeat shocked <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas,</b> who had expected to win. Commentators such as Noam Chomsky and Brian Willson attributed the outcome to the U.S.-Contra threats to continue the war if <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> retained power, <b>the</b> general war-weariness of the Nicaraguan population, and the abysmal Nicaraguan economic situation.|$|R
5000|$|The Pope's {{visit was}} a {{significant}} event in the civil war. It deepened tensions between <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> and <b>the</b> many Nicaraguan Catholics who supported <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas.</b> <b>The</b> controversial visit was also used by the [...] "Contras" [...] {{as a form of}} propaganda to give their organization moral legitimacy.|$|R
5|$|The {{response}} {{to requests for}} international aid was moderate. American church groups, Cuba, and Mexico collectively contributed around 2,500tons of food and medicine. The Canadian, Swedish, West German, Spanish, and Dutch Governments contributed aid amounting to 2million dollars (1988) each. No aid was sent by the United States government. The Soviet Union contributed an unknown sum. The slow {{response to}} requests for aid was contributed to by <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> Government's actions, which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press, as undermining the peace process championed by Óscar Arias. Those actions were the July 10 arrests of opposition activists and the closing down of independent radio stations. In addition, the government also barred foreign humanitarian groups from receiving American aid, as well as turning back a relief shipment days before the storm.|$|E
25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> {{revolution}} and the following Civil War, Cuba gave aid and support to <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government of Daniel Ortega. <b>The</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government was fighting the American backed Contras. The conflict ended with the 1990 presidential election where Ortega lost to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.|$|E
25|$|There were {{isolated}} protests among the population against the draft implemented by <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government, which even resulted in full-blown street clashes in Masaya in 1988. However, polls showed <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government still enjoyed {{strong support from}} Nicaraguans. Political opposition groups were splintered and the Contras began to experience defections, although United States aid maintained them as a viable military force.|$|E

[...] They believed that <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> knew they had fled Nicaragua together, and that even though Cardoza had not been politically active herself, she feared she would be interrogated about her brother's whereabouts and activities if she should return to Nicaragua. [...] She also mentioned that her own political opposition to <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> would {{be brought to the}} attention of the government. [...] For this reason, Cardoza feared she would be tortured if she returned to Nicaragua.|$|R
5000|$|Oppositional rebels, {{known as}} Contras, formed in 1981 to resist <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista's</b> Junta and {{received}} {{support from the}} American Central Intelligence Agency. The 1984 elections, described by international observers as fair and free, [...] were boycotted by the main opposition party. The FSLN won {{the majority of the}} votes. Those who did oppose <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> won approximately a third of the seats. Despite the clear electoral victory for <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas,</b> <b>the</b> Contras continued their violent attacks on both state and civilian targets, until 1989. The FSLN lost elections in 1990 to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, after revising the constitution in 1987 and after years of resisting the United States-supported Contras, but retained a minority of seats in the legislature.|$|R

25|$|A major {{turning point}} was the December 1972 Managua {{earthquake}} that killed over 10,000 people and left 500,000 homeless.

However, Pastora and his advisers sought to begin talks with <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas</b> rather than immediately initiating armed struggle. By March, El Negro's impatience led him to break with Pastora and ally with the FDN.|$|R

25|$|The {{women of}} Nicaragua prior to, {{during and after}} the {{revolution}} played a prominent role within the nation's society as they have commonly been recognized, throughout history and across all Latin American states, as its backbone. Nicaraguan women were therefore directly affected by all of the positive and negative events that took place during this revolutionary period. The victory of <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> National Liberation Front (FSLN) in 1979 brought about major changes and gains for women, mainly in legislation, broad educational opportunities, training programs for working women, childcare programs to help women enter the work force and greatly increased participation and leadership positions in a range of political activities. This, in turn, reduced the burdens that the women of Nicaragua were faced with prior to the revolution. During <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government, women were more active politically. The large majority of members of the neighborhood committees (Comités de Defensa Sandinista) were women. By 1987, 31% of the executive positions in <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government, 27% of the leadership positions of the FSLN, and 25% of the FSLN's active membership were women.|$|E
25|$|Judge Schwebel's dissent {{was twice}} as long as the actual judgment. Judge Schwebel argued that <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> {{government}} came to power with support of foreign intervention similar to what it was now complaining about. He argued that <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government achieved international recognition and received large amounts of foreign aid in exchange for commitments they subsequently violated. He cited evidence that <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> government had indeed supported the rebels in El Salvador and noted that Nicaragua’s own CIA witness contradicted their assertions that they had never at any point supported the rebels in El Salvador. The CIA witness said that {{there was no evidence of}} weapon shipments since early 1981, but Schwebel argued that he could not credibly explained why opponents of Contra aid such as Congressman Boland, who also saw the evidence, believed that weapon shipments were ongoing. He further argued that Daniel Ortega publicly admitted such shipments in statements in 1985 and 1986. Furthermore, there was no dispute that the leadership of the rebels operated in Nicaragua from time to time.|$|E

However, Chamorro and the middle-class {{supporters}} of the revolution had a different vision for the country than <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas.</b> When it became apparent that these differences could not be resolved, Violeta Chamorro resigned from the junta in 1980 and began to oppose <b>the</b> <b>Sandinistas.</b>|$|R

Some 200 meters from the gates of the “Olofito” convention center where <b>the</b> <b>Sandinista</b> Assembly was meeting, they were stopped by a larger pro-Ortega demonstration. For several minutes both bands literally went at each other with fists, stones and even clubs. The police had to intervene, placing themselves between the rival bands. In the Assembly, the official leadership responded by expelling Lewites and his campaign chief Víctor Hugo Tinoco from the party.|$|E
