5|$|Ireland's largest {{religious}} group is Christianity. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism representing over 73% {{for the island}} (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most {{of the rest of}} the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland). The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census. The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic's population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> religious service more than once a week.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, {{the farm}} was managed by Smith's younger brother, Herman W. Smith and nephew, Frank A. Harris. In 1900, the two married Lula and Florence Munger, sisters, and both {{resided in the}} house. William H. Smith deeded the house to his brother and nephew in 1921. Smith died in 1951 and his widow and Frank Harris, shortly before his death, sold {{the house and the}} 103 acres (41.6 hectare) of land to the Town of East Lyme for $34,000. The two widows {{continued}} to live in the house until <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nursing home. The land served as a farm under the Avery family including a dairy and cattle farm; the dairy farm would continue to operate under the Harris family. Portions of the land were later used for the construction of Interstate 95 and two East Lyme schools. The two schools are the East Lyme Junior High School (East Lyme Middle School) and Lillie B. Haines Elementary School.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon, on {{the active}} roster {{for the first}} time in the season, came off the bench in the third quarter to rally the Bears past the Buccaneers. He scored a {{touchdown}} on a quarterback sneak with six minutes to go, and tied the game with a touchdown pass to Neal Anderson with 1:28 to go. The Buccaneers allowed seven sacks, but led for most of the game. The Bears were aided by the Buccaneers' poor clock management and their reliance on a conservative offense in the fourth quarter. Perkins denied accusations that <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prevent defense and a three-man rush, but admitted that they played too conservatively on defense at the end. Steve DeBerg threw touchdown passes to Calvin Magee and Jeff Smith on the Buccaneers' first two possessions. On the Bears' next possession, Ron Holmes' hit on Mike Tomczak forced a fumble that was recovered in the end zone by Winston Moss to give the Buccaneers a 20–0 lead. The Bears scored two quick touchdowns in the second quarter, but the Buccaneers extended their lead with two Donald Igwebuike field goals. With the Bears struggling on offense, McMahon was inserted into the game. McMahon was 12 of 14 for 144yards and led the Bears to 156yards of offense in the last two drives, compared with 142 in the first 50minutes of the game. A win would have tied the Buccaneers with the Bears for first place in the NFC Central.|$|E

It is said that the Aztec god, Huitzlipochtli, instructed the Aztecs to found their city at the location where they saw an eagle, on a cactus, with a snake in its talons (which is on the current Mexican flag). The Aztecs, apparently, saw this vision on the small island where Tenochtitlan was founded.|$|E

Together <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> private poker game run by Joe Beevers and Ram Vaswani, with whom they became good friends. The four went on to be called The Hendon Mob.

During series 5 and 6, he commentated for the show, alongside Jesse May.|$|E
25|$|In 1490 he {{received}} his Doctorate in Theology, though he never made any original contribution to Theology. He just {{was not interested in}} this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the disputations that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he always comes off second best. He was more interested in the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left when <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at Tours. In this he set out a long list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their bishops, or monks of their abbots, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing celibacy among the clergy.|$|E

As Tangier was in Spanish territory, the theatre's wartime bar heaved with spies, refugees and underworld hoods, securing its place in cinematic history as the inspiration for Rick's Cafe in Casablanca." ...|$|E

500|$|Denning {{was noted}} for his {{excellent}} memory, repeating notes almost verbatim in his exams at Oxford {{and on one}} occasion identifying the exact book, page and paragraph of text in a judgment that covered a particular situation. As a judge he attempted to make his decisions and the law publicly understandable, believing that the public {{would not want to}} follow the law unless they believed and understood that it was just. In his cases he referred to the parties by name in his judgments rather than as [...] "plaintiff" [...] and [...] "defendant" [...] and used short sentences and a [...] "storytelling" [...] style of speech shown in the case Beswick v Beswick where his judgment started:Old Peter Beswick was a coal merchant in Eccles, Lancashire. He had no business premises. All he had was a lorry, scales, and weights. He used to take the lorry to the yard of the National Coal Board, where he bagged coal and took it round to his customers in the neighbourhood. His nephew, John Joseph Beswick, helped him in his business. In March 1962, old Peter Beswick and his wife were both over 70. He had had his leg amputated and was not in good health. The nephew was anxious to get hold of the business before the old man died. So <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> solicitor, Mr. Ashcroft, who drew up an agreement for them.|$|E
