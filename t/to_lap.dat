5|$|In the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher was {{involved}} in a race-ending collision whilst trying <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> David Coulthard in heavy spray. After the race he stormed into the McLaren garage and accused Coulthard of trying to kill him, and McLaren and Ferrari team members had to separate the drivers. Coulthard admitted some five years later that the accident had been his mistake.|$|E
5|$|Racing veteran Jarno Trulli (Trulli GP) {{started in}} the first group, as {{qualifying}} began at 12:00, and posted a strong time of 1:21.547 early in the session, being the first <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> the course in under 1:22. Also in the group was Nelson Piquet, Jr.– second in the championship– who ultimately managed only 13th place on the grid. As qualifying progressed, championship leader Lucas di Grassi and Monaco winner Sébastien Buemi came close to beating Trulli's time, but proved unable to do so, handing Trulli a surprising pole position, his first in Formula E.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton did {{go out on}} {{the softer}} tyres in Q2, setting the fastest time of the session, the first <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> in under 1 minute, 20 seconds. Behind him Vettel was second ahead of Rosberg. Räikkönen went out on the harder {{compound}} tyre, but aborted his running after spinning in turn one, leaving him fifteenth fastest with a grid penalty for his gearbox change yet to come. Max Verstappen put in a fast lap {{towards the end of the}} session, demoting his teammate Sainz, Jr. out of the top ten. Also eliminated were both Lotus and the second Sauber of Ericsson.|$|E

5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|The season points leader {{entering}} the race, Gil de Ferran, {{was awarded the}} pole position when qualifying was cancelled after a practice session was rained out. Bräck took the lead early in the race, and built a seven-second advantage before going off course while trying <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> another car. Carpentier took his place after the lap 64 incident, and held the lead until Tony Kanaan passed him on lap 95. After passing Carpentier for second, Alex Zanardi moved ahead of Kanaan {{after a series of}} pit stops between laps 121 to 123. Zanardi held the top spot entering his final scheduled pit stop with 12 laps remaining.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{heading into the}} first turn. Lieb passed Tandy to take over second position, while Fässler moved to third, after passing Tandy at the Bus Stop chicane at the first lap's conclusion. Tandy reclaimed third from Fässler shortly afterward. Team SARD Morand held the LMP2 lead before its car was overtaken by Tincknell and Bird on lap two. Duval moved in front of Wurz for fifth and the Toyota driver dropped to seventh. Jota Sport was issued with a drive-through penalty after its car was adjudged to have jumped the start and rejoined in sixth in LMP2, allowing Bird {{to the front of}} the category. Tandy drove to the inside of Estre <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> him, but made head-on contact with his car and went straight into the Pif Paf corner barrier. Both drivers continued, but Tandy drove into the pit lane for repairs, falling to the rear of the field. Fässler battled with Lieb for second as the two moved through slower traffic, but the Audi driver spun at the Bus Stop chicane allowing Lieb to take over second. Ryan Dalziel brought the No. 30 Extreme Speed Motorsports car into the team's garage to allow his mechanics to replace a broken boost line falling to the rear of the LMP2 field.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} with 59 <b>laps</b> <b>to</b> go. A {{number of}} cars began hitting pit road to make their final stop with 38 <b>laps</b> <b>to</b> go.

5|$|Massa {{was slow}} to {{accelerate}} leaving the turn six hairpin on lap 49, giving Alonso the opening he needed to take the lead. Smedley was later heard apologising to Massa over the radio. De La Rosa made his one and only pit stop of the event for super-soft compound tyres on lap 51. Di Grassi, at turn one on the same lap, hit a kerb damaging his car's rear suspension, which meant {{it was not possible}} for him to continue competing in the race. He was pushed into his garage by his team to retire. Vettel placed pressure on Massa by setting consecutive fastest laps to reduce the time gap between them. Petrov was on course to score one point but was told by his team to shift early into seventh gear on lap 58 otherwise his maximum revolutions per minute would be changed to a lower setting. De La Rosa attempted <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> Kovalainen around the inside of the second corner on the 60th lap but the two cars made contact. De La Rosa sustained damage to a section of his front wing while Kovalainen drove to his garage and got out of his car to become the race's fifth (and final) retirement on lap 61.|$|E
5|$|On lap 46, Vettel {{went past}} Hülkenberg for eighth {{at the final}} chicane. There was no contact between the two drivers, but the Force India car spun {{in order to avoid}} the wall on the outside of the final corner. Two laps later, Fernando Alonso was the first driver to retire from the race, his third {{consecutive}} retirement. On lap 52, Romain Grosjean tried <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> Will Stevens, cutting his rear left tyre in the process. The incident also brought him a five-second time penalty. The other Lotus of Pastor Maldonado also lost a position when Vettel moved past him for fifth on lap 56. Jenson Button joined his teammate in retirement two laps later, being called into the pit lane by his team. Felipe Massa went up into sixth overtaking Maldonado on lap 64. For the remaining laps, Hamilton managed to control the lead and went on to win in Montreal for the fourth time, finishing 2.2 seconds ahead of Rosberg, with Bottas in third a further 38 seconds behind.|$|E
5|$|On race day, a 30-minute warm-up {{session was}} held {{before the event}} began; Kanaan again posted the fastest time (35.288), {{followed}} by Zanardi and Paul Tracy. The 154-lap race began at 1:56p.m. local time; Bräck immediately took the lead, and Andretti went into second {{coming out of the}} first turn. They remained the top two in lap 20, with Dario Franchitti in third. Six laps later, Andretti passed Franchitti to reclaim second when the latter was unable to pass a slower car. Drivers near the lead begin making their first round of pit stops on lap 35, and continued doing so through lap 40. By lap 60, Bräck had built a lead of more than seven seconds. Carpentier had moved into second place, and Andretti, Tagliani, and Franchitti rounded out the top five. Bräck relinquished his lead on lap 64, when he went off course while attempting <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> Junqueira. The first caution flag of the day came out, but not before Carpentier took the lead as Bräck regained control of his car and re-entered the track in second place. Pit stops took place during the caution, with Carpentier, Bräck, and Andretti still in the top three positions.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} with 73 <b>laps</b> <b>to</b> go. Harvick beat Bayne to {{the line}} {{to take the lead}} with 72 <b>laps</b> <b>to</b> go.

40|$|Abstract. Lapping {{plate wear}} {{is of great}} {{influence}} on shape precision of workpiece. Investigation on the wear uniformity of uncertain eccentricity plane lapping {{was carried out in}} this research. The relative velocity function of the plate to the workpiece is obtained through kinematic analyses in the mode of uncertain eccentricity plane lapping, and material removal rate (MRR) function and wear uniformity function were deduced based on Preston equation. Effects of the ratio and eccentricities on the wear uniformity are discussed in detail through MATLAB simulation. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the ratio k 1 of workpiece revolution speed <b>to</b> <b>lapping</b> plate is the key to decide whether the lapping plate is lapped uniformly. Theoretically, when k 1 1, Besides, a bit bigger eccentricity e 1 is propitious <b>to</b> the <b>lapping</b> uniformly of the lapping plate, and bigger eccentricity e 2 are also helpful <b>to</b> <b>lapping</b> uniformly of the lapping plate. And the conclusion could be extended <b>to</b> single-side plane <b>lapping</b> and double-side plane lapping process...|$|R
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari were quickest {{in the first}} free practice session on Friday afternoon, with Räikkönen the only driver <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> the course in less than 1:38. The Mercedes team focused on long runs, running their cars on high fuel loads to examine tyre wear and were therefore down in 15th and 16th places respectively. Vettel's Ferrari showed problems early in the session, but Vettel was able to run without issues towards the end. Jenson Button spun out in turn one on {{the start of his}} first flying lap and was unable to run again as his team tried to change his car's battery. It was however an uplifting session for McLaren nonetheless, since Button's teammate Fernando Alonso finished in seventh place, just seven-tenths away from Räikkönen's fastest time. After China the week before, Jolyon Palmer once again took part in the first practice session for Lotus.|$|E
5|$|The race's first caution was necessitated on {{the same}} lap when Papis spun on the frontstretch, and slid {{backwards}} towards the first corner before getting his car facing in the racing direction. Vasser made contact with Tora Takagi who was sent into the frontstretch barrier. Bruno Junqueira and Memo Gidley spun in avoidance; the latter regained control of his car while Junqueira collided with the outside wall, causing him to become the race's first retirement. Max Wilson spun while gaining optimum tyre temperature {{and fell to the}} rear of the field. The race restarted on the ninth lap with de Ferran leading Bräck and Andretti. Bräck was held up by Wilson on the 23rd lap allowing de Ferran to establish a two-second lead over him. Wilson received a warning from the series' race control. Castroneves was passed by Franchitti for the fourth position seven laps later. Christian Fittipaldi attempted <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> Gidley on lap 37, but the latter drove defensively causing Fittipaldi to reduce his speed, and he was overtaken by Vasser, Adrián Fernández, and Carpentier.|$|E
5|$|While racing for {{position}} on lap 23, Sainz forced Jolyon Palmer {{off the track}} in turn two and was later handed a ten-second time penalty for the incident. Four laps later, Pascal Wehrlein tried to overtake Felipe Nasr for 16th, but was unsuccessful and in turn lost a position to Kvyat. His teammate Ricciardo overtook Kevin Magnussen for eighth on lap 29, but lost the position again and was in turn passed by Romain Grosjean. As Nico Rosberg started <b>to</b> <b>lap</b> backmarkers on lap 31, the gap to second-placed Hamilton started to come down, with his advantage dropping from more than eleven seconds to {{a little more than}} seven seconds by lap 36. Meanwhile, Verstappen was forced to retire due to power unit failure on lap 34, while running in sixth place. As Hamilton was told by his pit crew that he suffered from a water pressure problem, his gap to Rosberg started to increase again, staying at 13 seconds by lap 41. Wehrlein made a pit stop for new tyres on the same lap, but problems with his stop forced him stationary for almost a minute, resulting in him moving into last place on the road.|$|E
