5|$|With {{the tender}} relaunched in 2007 as the F-X2 competition, the Brazilian Defence Ministry looked to {{purchase}} at least 36 aircraft– {{with a potential}} for 84 additional aircraft– to replace the country's A-1Ms, F-5BRs, and Mirage IIIs. Among the participants were the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16BR, JAS Gripen NG, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and the modernized Su-35. Although the Brazilian government eliminated the Su-35 in 2008, Rosoboronexport subsequently offered to sell the country 120 aircraft with full technology transfer, as well as participation in the PAK FA programme. In December 2013, the Gripen NG light fighter was selected because of its low cost and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> to the Brazilian industry.|$|E

The rapid expanison of software engineering technology and the proliferation of tools and techniques made it difficult for an individual or organization to remain cognizant of the current status of the software engineering field. This situation resulted in the duplication of efforts in software research and seriously hampered the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> from the software research environment to the user sector of the software community.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that some joint ventures consist purely of the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> to Iran by the foreign partner without any capital commitment. Since Iranian {{authorities}} are very keen on the introduction of modern technologies, this path can prove very constructive. In August 2010, the 25% ceiling set for joint venture companies in enjoying facilities from the foreign exchange reserve account has been eliminated. Industry and mines, agriculture, transport, services (such as tourism), IT and the export of goods and services are the sectors authorized to enjoy the new facilities from the Foreign Exchange Reserve Account.|$|E
25|$|First and foremost, it {{is crucial}} to realize that Iranian {{authorities}} insist on a long-term commitment and a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> as a requisite for getting a share in the market. Foreign companies are therefore advised to adopt a medium- to long-term strategy for the Iranian market. Iran will almost never honor the interests of a company that does not show long-term commitment. Tenders are strictly required for government contracts for purchasing or projects. These are rarely competitive. Breaking up contracts into smaller parts is a common practice to try to incorporate at least 30% of the contract's value in local capability and also to negotiate on specific prices.|$|E
25|$|India is {{the third}} largest {{operator}} of MiG-21s, behind Russia and China. In 1961, the Indian Air Force (IAF) opted to purchase the MiG-21 over several other Western competitors. As part of the deal, the Soviet Union offered India full <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> and rights for local assembly. In 1964, the MiG-21 became the first supersonic fighter jet to enter service with the IAF. Due to limited induction numbers and lack of pilot training, the IAF MiG-21 played a limited role in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. However, the IAF gained valuable experience while operating the MiG-21 for defensive sorties during the war. The positive feedback from IAF pilots during the 1965 war prompted India to place more orders for the fighter jet and also invest heavily in building the MiG-21's maintenance infrastructure and pilot training programs.|$|E

25|$|The {{similarities}} of the Stallings series ceramics to {{the earlier}} Puerto Hormiga ceramics of Colombia, which were both associated with shell middens, {{and the presence of}} winds and ocean currents favoring journeys from South America to the Southeastern United States, led James A. Ford, among other archaeologists, to offer the hypothesis that the two areas had connections, and that the technology of fiber-tempered ceramics in the southeastern United States had been imported from Colombia. Other archaeologists have noted that there are no known archaeological sites between Colombia and Florida that are of a type or age consistent with such connections, and that the cultural traditions of the Southeastern United States show no significant changes associated with the appearance of ceramics, indicating that there was no migration or people, and no <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> or other elements of culture, other than the appearance of ceramics.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the main}} criticisms of the buyback {{contracts}} include lack of flexibility of cost recovery and in some cases, the NIOC's limited expertise to reverse field decline rates {{in comparison to the}} International Oil Company (IOC) that developed the field. The Integrated Petroleum Contract (IPC) will require the IOCs to fulfill Iran's local content requirement, which will be 51% of the contract and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology.</b> NIOC will set up joint ventures for crude oil and gas production with international companies which will be paid with a share of the output. IPCs will be offered for work on somewhere between 34 and 74 oil fields and could last for the duration of a field's life. In 2013 Iran also announced {{for the first time since}} the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the offering of production sharing contracts (PSCs) for the most complicated and difficult projects, such as deep-water wells in the Caspian Sea (the details of which will be revealed in December 2015 in London).|$|E

The United States also actively supports Turkey's membership bid to join the European Union, lobbying frequently on behalf of Ankara through its diplomatic missions in EU capital cities.

The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China.

[...] The hull of the German Marder armored personnel carrier was used, and the chassis was strengthened to support the increased weight of the TAM. [...] Two prototypes were manufactured in late 1976 and early 1977, which were put through extensive testing for two years and over a road range of [...] [...] Simultaneously, another prototype was manufactured to further the investigation of the new vehicle and complete the three prototypes as agreed in the contract.|$|E
