5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

25|$|Neuroimaging {{has been}} used to {{investigate}} ORS. Hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (HMPAO SPECT) demonstrated hypoperfusion of the frontotemporal lobe in one case. That is to say, part of the brain was receiving insufficient blood flow. In another, functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out while the person with ORS listened to both neutral words and emotive words. Compared to an age and sex matched healthy control subject under the same conditions, the individual with ORS showed more activation areas in the brain when listening to emotionally loaded words. <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> described as abnormal, but less pronounced as would be observed in the brain of a person with a psychotic disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{papillomavirus}} genome {{is divided}} into an early region (E), encoding six open reading frames (ORF) (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) that are expressed immediately after initial infection of a host cell, and a late region (L) encoding a major capsid protein L1 and a minor capsid protein L2. All viral ORFs are encoded on one DNA strand (see figure). This represents a dramatic difference between papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses, since the latter virus type expresses its early and late genes by bi-directional transcription of both DNA strands. <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> {{a major factor in}} establishment of the consensus that papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses probably never shared a common ancestor, despite the striking similarities in the structures of their virions.|$|E
25|$|In 1852 the Original Secession Church {{joined the}} Free Church; in 1876 {{most of the}} Reformed Presbyterian Church {{followed}} suit. However, a leadership-led attempt to unite with the United Presbyterians was not successful. These attempts began as early as 1863 when the Free Church began talks with the UPC {{with a view to}} a union. However, a report laid before the Assembly of 1864 showed that the two churches were not agreed as to the relationship between state and church. The Free Church maintained that national resources could be used in aid of the church, provided that the state abstain from all interference in its internal government. The United Presbyterians held that, as the state had no authority in spiritual things, it was not within its jurisdiction to legislate as to what was true in religion, prescribe a creed or any form of worship for its subjects, or to endow the church from national resources. Any union would therefore have to leave this question open. At the time <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> sufficient to preclude the union being pursued.|$|E

25|$|Santelli et al. {{explained}} {{more about}} the process after they determined the crystal structure of the PA/CMG2 complex. The structure of this complex shows the binding of CMG2 by both domain 2 and 4 of PA. This interaction demonstrates less freedom to unfold the Greek key. Further analysis shows that seven of the nine histidines in PA are on the domain 2/domain 4 interface. Protonation of these histidines causes the domains to separate enough to allow the Greek-key to flop out and help form the β-hairpin involved in insertion. In addition, when PA binds to CMG2, insertion no longer occurs at a pH of 6.5, as it does when inserted into an artificial membrane. Instead it requires a pH of 5.0 for insertion in natural cells. <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> explained {{to be the result}} of the pocket next to the MIDAS motif in CMG2. This pocket contains a histidine buried at the bottom where domain 2 attaches. This histidine is protonated at a lower pH and adds greater stability to PA. This added stability keeps the Greek-key from being able to move until more acidic conditions are met. These histidines all work in conjunction to keep the heptamer from inserting prematurely before endocytosis occurs.|$|E
500|$|In 1947 Willis Lamb, {{working in}} {{collaboration}} with graduate student Robert Retherford, found that certain quantum states of the hydrogen atom, which {{should have the same}} energy, were shifted in relation to each other, the difference came to be called the Lamb shift.

500|$|The moral {{concerns}} over the attacks {{have focused on the}} large number of civilian casualties and property damage they caused. For this and other reasons, British philosopher A.C. Grayling has concluded that the Allied area bombing campaigns against both Japan and Germany constituted moral crimes. Mark Selden described the summer 1945 peak of the bombing campaign as [...] "still perhaps unrivaled in the magnitude of human slaughter" [...] and stated that the factors contributing to its intensity were a combination of [...] "technological breakthroughs, American nationalism, and the erosion of moral and political scruples about killing of civilians, perhaps intensified by the racism that crystallized in the Pacific theater". Edwin P. Hoyt wrote in 1987 that Japanese people commonly regard the Allied bombing of civilians as the worst atrocity of the war. It has also been suggested that anti-Japanese sentiment was a factor motivating the USAAF's emphasis on firebombing during the campaign against Japan while most of its raids on Germany used precision bombing tactics. However, historian Richard B. Frank argues that <b>this</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> attributable to the evolution in views towards bombing {{over the course of the}} war, the limited intelligence on the structure of the Japanese economy available to the Allies and the much greater vulnerability of Japanese cities to incendiary bombs.|$|E

500|$|On August 20, 1845, Griswold married Charlotte Myers, a Jewish woman; she was 42 {{and he was}} 33. Griswold {{had been}} {{pressured}} into the marriage by the woman's aunts, despite his concern about their difference in religious beliefs. <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> strong enough that one of Griswold's friends referred to his wife only as [...] "the little Jewess". On their wedding night, he discovered that she was, according to Griswold biographer Joy Bayless, [...] "through some physical misfortune, incapable of being a wife" [...] or, as Poe biographer Kenneth Silverman explains, incapable of having sex. Griswold considered the marriage void and no more valid [...] "than {{there would have been}} had the ceremony taken place between parties of the same sex, or where the sex of one was doubtful or ambiguous". Still, the couple moved together to Charleston, South Carolina, Charlotte's home town, and lived under the same roof, albeit sleeping in separate rooms. Neither of the two was happy with the situation, {{and at the end of}} April 1846 she had a lawyer write up a contract [...] "to separate, altogether and forever,... which would in effect be a divorce". The contract forbade Griswold from remarrying and paid him $1,000 for expenses in exchange for his daughter Caroline staying with the Myers family. After this separation, Griswold immediately moved back to Philadelphia.|$|E

2500|$|When {{principal}} photography {{began on}} March 22, 1976 in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on Tatooine, the project faced several problems. Lucas fell behind schedule {{in the first}} week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns. Moreover, a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming. Taylor said, [...] "you couldn't really see where the land ended and the sky began. It was all a gray mess, and the robots were just a blur." [...] Given this situation, Lucas requested for heavy filtration, which Taylor rejected, who said: [...] "I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ... But George saw it differently, so we tried using nets and other diffusion. He asked to set up one shot on the robots with a 300mm, and the sand and sky just mushed together. I told him it wouldn't work, but he said that was the way he wanted to do the entire film, all diffused." [...] <b>This</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> later settled by 20th Century Fox executives, who backed Taylor's suggestion.|$|E
