Robust estimation improves registration accuracy by reducing or ignoring the contribution of voxels with large intensity differences, but existing approaches are limited to mono-modal registration. In this work, we propose a robust and inverse-consistent technique for cross-modal, affine image registration. The algorithm is derived from a contextual framework of image registration.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to study superspaces using methods from {{harmonic}} and Clifford analysis. This means {{that we have to}} construct a set of operators, such as a Laplace and a Dirac operator, acting on functions depending on both commuting and anti-commuting variables. We will show that, using proper definitions of such operators, several results of harmonic and Clifford analysis can be transferred to this new framework. First of all, it is possible to build a complete theory of spherical harmonics in superspace, and accordingly one can, to some extent, introduce orthogonal polynomials in superspace. Using these spherical harmonics, we can introduce an integral over the supersphere and an integral over the whole superspace in a unique way. This is the main result of this thesis, as we will prove that the resulting integral is equivalent with the so-called Berezin integral. This means that the ad hoc-notion of this integral can be given a mathematically sound denition based on harmonic analysis. Furthermore we will study the fundamental solution of the super Dirac and Laplace operators and all their natural powers. We will also study several integral transforms in superspace, such as a Fourier transform, a fractional Fourier transform and a Radon transform. Finally, we will also prove a Cauchy integral formula in superspace, which will enable us <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> with classical complex analysis...|$|E

"What I mean to submit here is a structural theory of the aesthetic, exploring its function vis-à-vis the political, and desire's implication in ideology. We will use as our framework and jumping-off point Kant's model of the aesthetic, but with some crucial revisions. From here, we will bring psychoanalysis to bear on ideological frameworks and aesthetic judgment, and the interplay between the two. Drawing on Freud's ego psychology and his theory of narcissism, as well as Lacan's theory of the mirror stage and I-formation, we may understand the function and status of primary narcissism as immanent and necessary to the formation and maintenance of ideology as it is constituted by its Subjects on the group level, and investigate the political ramifications of what we may term secondary ideological narcissism, {{and the role of the}} aesthetic in it. Later on, we will take Wagner's anti-semitism, Volkideologie, and his The Jews in Music as a case study in such a dynamic, posing the question of the importance of art to, and its role in, totalitarian culture. Utilizing psychoanalysis as our initial primary hermeneutic, we will ultimately find ourselves asking difficult questions of Freud, whose diagnostics of narcissism on the group level will seem more and more ontic and dissatisfying, lacking the vocabulary to ask the question of the material conditions in which the group subsists, such as the division of labor, and whether they can be superseded or aufgehoben; after all, the analogue of the group, nation, or state to the individual (the “body” politic), with a “character,” with all the same neuroses, is, when left uninterrogated, a blow to all notions of heteronomy or individual agency.

40|$|The Israeli-Palestinian {{conflict}} {{dates back}} to 1917, when British Prime Minister Balfour declared Britain’s support {{for the establishment of}} a homeland for Jews in the land of Palestine. The conflict has had many political, social, and artistic implications. On the political level, a struggle that has not been solved until this day has evolved. On a social level, many lives have been crushed: thousands of native citizens of the land became refugees, mainly in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, but also worldwide. Others, like the Arabs who stayed in what was in 1948 declared to be the state of Israel, have been suffering from an identity crisis; many of these Arabs face unlawful detention, demolition of houses, killing and racism. The Gaza strip has almost always been under siege by the Israeli military machine lately. Meanwhile, the Jewish society has never had a day of peace since the establishment of their state. On the artistic level, the conflict has always had implications for Arab/ Palestinian and Israeli writings., I seek to read the depiction of the conflict with its different violent confrontations from both Israeli and Palestinian perspectives starting with the Palestinian Nakba to the violent Israeli oppression of any Palestinian resistance in the Intifada. I also read literary texts about Palestinian resistance, actual material resistance of the first Palestinian Intifada as represented by both sides in postcolonial terms. In fact, I believe that both Palestinian and Israeli literature could be read in the context of postcolonial discourse. On the one hand, for Palestinian and Arab writers, Palestinian writing is and should be read as resistance literature, or ‘Adab al-muqawamah’, a term coined by Palestinian writer Ghassan Kanafani. Anna Ball’s study Palestinian Literature and Film in Postcolonial Feminist Perspective examines Palestinian literature and film in the light of postcolonial feminism. Ball places the conflict in the context of colonial/ postcolonial discourse and breaks the taboo against using the word colonialism when speaking about Zionism. In fact, the research problem is based on the idea of the inadequacy of ignoring Palestinian and Israeli literature as part of postcolonial studies simply for fear of revealing the colonial status quo of the land. According to Anna Bernard, who seeks to draw attention to what she calls ‘blind spots in postcolonial studies’, mainly Israel/ Palestine: ‘by dismissing a ‘postcolonial’ approach to Israel-Palestine studies outright, [critics like] Massad and Shohat overlook the value of a literary study that seeks to demonstrate the collective and cross-cultural impact of the various modern forms of colonialism and imperialism on artistic production across the globe’. Massad’s argument that there is difficulty in describing space, time and body in Israel/ Palestine as postcolonial is based on his interrogations: ‘Can one determine the coloniality of Palestine/ Israel without noting its ‘‘post-coloniality’’ for Ashkenazi Jews? Can one determine the post-coloniality of Palestine/Israel without noting its coloniality for Palestinians? Can one determine both or either without noting the simultaneous colonizer/colonized status of Mizrahi Jews? (Although one could debate the colonized status of Mizrahi Jews) How can all these people inhabit a colonial/postcolonial space in a world that declares itself living in a post-colonial time?’ Ella Shohat, likewise, is against what she calls the ‘ahistorical and universalizing deployments, and potentially [the] depoliticizing implications’ of the term ‘post-colonial,’ especially that, according to her, it is used instead of important terms like imperialism and neo-colonialism. In spite of the importance of paying attention to the correct description of states of imperialism and neo-colonialism, I still find it possible to read both Palestinian and Israeli texts in postcolonial perspective, agreeing with Bernard ‘that the tools that have been developed for reading these texts comparatively – including colonial discourse analysis, national allegory, minority discourse, and so on – can be usefully applied, tested, and revised in the analysis of Palestinian and Israeli literary and cultural production’. This view resonates with Ashcroft, Tiffin and Griffiths’s in their study The Postcolonial Studies Reader (1995), when they comment on this wide range of relevant fields that the term postcolonial suggests: ‘Postcolonial theory involves discussion about experience of various kinds: migration, slavery, suppression, resistance, representation, difference, race, gender, [and] place’. In fact, the term ‘postcolonial’ is not necessarily restricted to a real colonial period; it could be used, according to Ashcroft, Tiffin and Griffiths in The Empire Writes Back: ‘to cover all the culture affected by the imperial process from the moment of colonization to the present day. This is because there is continuity of preoccupations throughout the historical process initiated by European imperial aggression’. Between the view of the land of Palestine as a lawful possession of the Jews and that which sees Jewish presence as a settler or colonial one, a debate about reading the conflict and literary production tackling the conflict within theories of colonial and postcolonial studies arises. What makes reading the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and its literature and literary production within the paradigm of postcolonialism problematic is worth some further investigation. First, the preference and focus on the discursive practices of colonialism over the material practices has resulted in excluding the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict from the field of postcolonial studies by a number of critics like Ella Shohat and Joseph Massad, which is more elaborated on later. Second, the debate about the Zionist project as a settler colonial one could also problematize analysing the conflict within postcolonial theories. The first chapter explores the Israeli/ Palestinian and Arab writing of the conflict from a colonizer/colonized perspective. I mainly focus on the representation of violence as an essential element in a colonized society and the decolonization process, drawing on Frantz Fanon’s theory that violence is inevitable in any colonized community as the backbone of the analysis. For this purpose, I have chosen Syrian playwright Saad-Allah Wanous’s play Rape (1990), to compare with Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin’s play Murder (1997), since both plays represent violence as a vicious circle that does not lead anywhere in the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, even though it is an everyday act that has become a way of life for both sides. Crucial terms in the field of postcolonial studies such as resistance/terrorism are examined. Some similarities between the ways the two playwrights write the conflict are also highlighted, which supports the idea that literature can always find shared ground between any two conflicting parties. In Chapters Two and Three I write about the history of the conflict as a chain of endless violent confrontations; violence in this case is on the national level when the two nations fight each other. Chapter Two addresses some of the landmark events in the history of the Jewish and Palestinian peoples, mainly the Israeli War of Independence/Nakba as the same historical event seen from the two extremely different colonizer/colonized perspectives. The chapter also addresses what the Holocaust has to do with the two events and how the Holocaust was exploited by the Israeli state to silence any condemnation of the Israeli/Zionist settler colonial project in Palestine and later on to silence any international condemnation of the Israeli 1967 occupation of more Palestinian and Arab lands. To serve this purpose, the chapter examines Palestinian poet and playwright Burhan Al-Din Al-Aboushi’s play The Phantom of Andalusia (1949) and Palestinian playwright Amir Nizar Zuabi’s play I Am Yusuf and This Is My Brother (2010) compared to each other as two different Palestinian representations of the Nakba and compared to the Israeli narrative of the ‘War of Independence’ by Israeli playwright Motti Lerner in his play The Admission (2010). In addition to this, Joshua Sobol’s play Ghetto is examined as one of the classical Holocaust plays and compared to a contemporary play called Go to Gaza, Drink the Sea (2009) by Palestinian playwright Ahmed Masoud (co-written with Justin Butcher, author of The Madness of George Dubya) <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> between the living conditions of Jews in ghettoes to that of Palestinians in Gaza as part of the on-going Palestinian Nakba. Chapter Three examines another landmark of the history of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict: the Palestinian Intifada, an event which changed the nature of the conflict and showed that the Palestinians can act to decolonize their country. The Intifada, mainly described as ‘non-violent’, has led to huge impacts on the lives of both Israelis and Palestinians and how they see each other, both in reality and in theatre; however, again, the colonizer and colonized parties see it differently. The chapter examines these different perspectives by analysing the Israeli plays Masked (1990) by Ilan Hatzor and Coming Home (2002) by Motti Lerner, compared with The Stone Revolution (1997) by Egyptian playwright Alfred Farag and Al-Huksh (1992) by Palestinian playwright Adnan Tarabshi. The four plays present the Intifada as either a barbaric or a heroic act, depending on the political ideologies of the playwrights. I read the plays within the context of pro or anti-resistance propaganda. Chapter four is an attempt to read the concepts of diaspora, exile and homeland in both Jewish/Israeli and Palestinian experiences in the postcolonial paradigm. Concepts of exodus and diaspora are found in both Jewish and Palestinian history, but in two very different ways. Throughout the chapter I attempt to examine the similarities and/or differences between these notions in the two people’s memories through reading Yiddish playwright David Pinski’s The Last Jew (1905) in comparison with Palestinian playwright Ismail Al-Dabbagh’s play The Painful Events of the Life of Abu-Halima (2008), as two plays reflecting the notions of Jewish and Palestinian diaspora respectively. In addition to these works, the chapter examines Exile in Jerusalem (1989) by Israeli playwright Motti Lerner alongside In Spitting Distance (2008) by Palestinian actor and playwright Taher Najib. Exile, diaspora and homeland have occupied a significant space in postcolonial theories as outcomes of colonialism, and the aim of my chapter is to read Israeli and Palestinian plays discussing those themes from a postcolonial perspective, pointing out the differences and similarities between the Jewish and the Palestinian experiences of diaspora. It is very important to note that the choice of the plays is ultimately based on the thematic approach I tend to adopt in my presentation of the conflict. In other words, I have attempted to introduce the Israeli versus Arab/ Palestinian theatrical presentation of the same subject matter or the landmark events related to the conflict, again the materialist practices of colonialism regardless of the dates of the plays. This is not because their specific historical contexts are unimportant, but rather because the Israeli/Palestine conflict remains ongoing, in what could be seen as a historical deadlock. Finally, Chapter Five aims at examining the influence of the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict on Western theatre, showing how the West, as an outsider, sees and portrays the conflicted parties. I have chosen the following plays to examine the different approaches to the conflict: Dario Fo and Franca Rame’s An Arab Woman Speaks (1972), Arthur Milner’s Masada (2006) and Facts (2010), John Patrick Shanley’s Dirty Story (2003), Naomi Wallace’s The Fever Chart, Robin Soans’ The Arab Israeli Cook Book (2004), Alan Rickman and Catharine Viner’s My Name is Rachel Corrie (2003), David Hare’s Via Dolorosa (1998) and Wall (2009), Douglas Watkinson’s The Wall (2011), Caryl Churchill’s Seven Jewish Children (2009) and Richard Stirling’s Seven Other Children (2009) to examine the different approaches towards the conflict. Again, I approach this literature as postcolonial literature affected by imperialism and Israeli colonial aggression or as justifying and propagating the Zionist colonial project in Palestine or sometimes as both at the same time, depending on the author’s beliefs and ideologies...|$|E

40|$|Towards {{the last}} quarter of the 20 th century, {{philosophers}} of science began to develop a research programme to show that neo-Darwinian models of species evolution are analogous to the evolution of scientific theories. This programme is known as the evolutionary epistemology of theories (Bradie, p. 414, 1986). Karl Popper’s influential book The Logic of Discovery was one of <b>the</b> first accounts <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> out <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> between <b>the</b> evolution of biological species and the evolution of scientific theories. Many philosophers of science have later adopted this analogy, for Stephen Toulmin (1972), and Donald Campbell (1974). The aim of the metaphor is to not just be a model that explains how science progresses, but to actually account for how it does so. At the heart of this <b>analogy</b> is <b>the</b> fact that the generation of new scientific theories and scientific knowledge is conducted through a random process known as “blind variation” (Popper 1963, 1979 2 ̆ 6 Campbell 1974). If this analogy holds a philosophical consequence, it is that there is no logic of discovery. If there is no logic of discovery, this then supports the Fregean view that there is a gulf between the context of justification and context of discovery. If there is no logic of discovery, then the philosopher’s job is to analyze the justification rather than the discovery. 	However, Poppers analogy has come under pressure from fellow philosophers of science. Most notably, Paul Thagard argues that Popper’s analogy is a disanalogy because scientists don’t generate hypotheses blindly. My aim of this essay is to show that this is correct. My thesis is that Popper’s analogy is a disanalogy because there is a logic of discovery, thus making evolutionary epistemology of theory (EET) false. 	I will begin by explaining how Popper argues for the metaphor and the rejection of a logic of discovery. In section II, I will then build off of Thagard’s critiques of Popper to show that in order for science to progress, there needs to be some form of logic. Finally, I will argue that the most likely candidates for a logic of discovery are two types negative-logic: error-elimination and error-correction. I will then conclude that since there are suitable logics for discovery, Popper’s analogy is a disanalogy. This is important to philosophy because it allows for philosophers to analyze the context of discovery and not just the context of justification...|$|R
40|$|Classical Mechanics (CM), {{since its}} first {{systematic}} presentation in Newton’s Principia in 1687, has undergone various mathematical rewritings and conceptual reorganizations. From a non historical point of view, CM can be formulated, {{and is still}} taught and applied today, under two main guises: using vectorial equations of motion and using variational principles. These two formulations (roughly, the Newtonian and the Hamiltonian versions) are both logically and empirically equivalent, since a chain of mathematical deductions leads from the one to the other. Therefore, traditional approaches to theories (the so-called syntactic and semantic views of theories), which aim at giving a formal account of their logical structures, consider them as alternative formulations of the very same theory. On the other hand, non logical studies of scientific change, in the Kuhnian tradition, usually focus on conceptual differences between theoretical frameworks separated by revolutionary shifts; therefore, they also consider that such changes within the same theory are purely formal and have no bearing on its physical meaning. Nevertheless, these two versions {{are different from the}} point of view of the understanding of the cognitive agents who are supposed to learn, apply and sometimes develop the theory. I initially define one’s understanding of a theory as consisting both in knowing what the theory means (this is the representational aspect of understanding: being able to represent the phenomena by means of its system of concepts) and how it works (this is the computational aspect: being able to compute the various equations given by <b>the</b> theory <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> predictions and explanations about the phenomena). The two versions of CM are both representationally and computationally different: they do not represent the phenomena the same way, and applying one and the other does not consist in the same cognitive operation. Indeed, they are not applied in the same cases (in the case of constrained systems, Newtonian formulation is practically intractable), they do not use the same mathematical language, and their core concepts are different. Moreover, they do not enable one <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> same <b>analogies</b> with other fields of physics. I appeal to the so-called Conceptual Role Semantics (CRS) in order to give a more precise definition of one’s understanding of a theory and to account for the relation between its computational and representational aspects. My main claim is that such differences in understanding can be characterized as conceptual differences, which have a bearing on the physical meaning of the theory, and hence on its very identity, despite the logical and empirical equivalences of its formulations. According to CRS, the content of a concept, and hence the meaning of the term expressing it, depends on its role in the cognitive life of the agent; more precisely, it is defined by its inferential location within the set of the mental representations of the agent. One’s understanding of the meaning of one’s own words “is a kind of know-how: one knows how to proceed” 1. Newtonian and Hamiltonian versions of CM, though logically equivalent, do not consist in the same conceptual structure: they do not facilitate the same inferences and their concepts are not related the same way. For instance, the meaning of “force” in Newtonian Mechanics is given by Newton’s Second Law, and it is the basis of all inferences in that frame. It is defined as the cause of acceleration, operating by a local and instantaneous action on particles, whereas within Hamiltonian Mechanics, it is arrived at after a chain of mathematical deductions from Hamilton’s principle, whose core concept is “action”. I finally suggest that one’s understanding of a theory can be defined as a set of mental representations, and that the various versions of CM can be thought of as explicit and complete understandings of the same logical structure. This perspective enables us approach theorizing as the activity of scientific minds at work, rather than focusing on theories as purely logical structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of an externally applied electric _eld with a liquid can {{give rise to}} interesting ow instabilities and pattern formation. For example, it has been demonstrated that the application of an electric _eld to an initially at polymer-air or polymer-polymer interface may result in an electrohydrodynamic instability {{which leads to the}} formation of columnar structures. This phenomenon could be exploited in order to form well-controlled patterns at the microscale and nanoscale with many practical engineering applications. The scope of the present research project is to achieve fundamental understanding of the electrically-induced ow of viscoelastic liquid _lms and to investigate the e_ect of various factors (e. g. the complex uid rheology, the presence of surface active materials or free charge along the liquid-air or liquid-liquid interfaces, geometric con_guration, etc) that may {{play an important role in}} such a process. It is well known that the dynamics and stability of liquid _lms can be very rich and it is characteristic that despite the fact that the _rst attempts to address the stability of a simple system such as a clean (without surfactants) Newtonian liquid _lm under the e_ect of gravity appear in the literature in the late 50 's full understanding of the underlying mechanisms was not achieved until recently. One of the goals of the present study was to expand our understanding on the stability of the liquid _lms in the presence of surface active materials (surfactants). The reason for this is threefold. On one hand, the {{interaction of}} a surfactant-ladden _lm with an electric _eld is of interest for controlled pattern formation at the micro- and nano-scale. For example, ionic surfactants may interact with the electric _eld thereby a_ecting interfacial concentration and imposing speci_c patterns in the liquid. On the other hand, surfactants attribute non-Newtonian properties to the liquid, because the free surface attains surface elasticity and surface viscosity. Also, at high surfactant concentrations, micelles may form in the bulk and complicate its rheological behavior, rendering the solution viscoelastic. Finally, the governing equation that describes the conservation of surfactant concentration along the interface is identical to the equation that describes the conservation of free charge in the case of dielectric materials. These systems share many similar characteristics and it is possible <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> conclusions from <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> between them. To this end, we formulated the Orr-Sommerfeld equation for a surfactant-laden _lm with appropriate boundary conditions, and solved it numerically for arbitrary disturbances and analytically for long-wave disturbances. The results from our analysis demonstrate the signi_cant e_ect of surfactant solubility and sorption kinetics on the stability characteristics and provided useful insight in the non-linear dynamics of the ow. The results from this this work have been published to the Journal of Fluid Mechanics. In a subsequent paper that has also been submitted for publication to the Journal of Fluid Mechanics we have investigated the role of surfactants on the mechanism of the long-wave instability in liquid _lm ows. We have also made announcements to several local and international conferences. A second goal of this research project was to develop a robust numerical algorithm capable of handling the ow of viscoelastic material with large interfacial deformations…. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A key {{requirement}} for seamless human-robot collaboration {{is for the}} robot to make its intentions clear to its human collaborator. A collaborative robot’s motion must be legible, or intent-expressive. Legibility is often described in the literature as and effect of predictable, unsurprising, or expected motion. Our central insight is that predictability and legibility are fundamentally different and often contradictory properties of motion. We develop a formalism to mathematically define and distinguish predictability and legibility of motion. We formalize the two based on inferences between trajectories and goals in opposing directions, <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> action interpretation in psychology. We then propose mathematical models for these inferences based on optimizing cost, <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> principle of rational action. Our experiments validate our formalism’s prediction that predictability and legibility can contradict, and provide support for our models. Our findings indicate that for robots to seamlessly collaborate with humans, they must {{change the way they}} plan their motion.
