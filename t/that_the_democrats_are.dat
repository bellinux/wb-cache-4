The very far right group of Republicans' interest in Israel is not because they are so supportive of there being a Jewish state and making sure that Jews have a place that we can call home. It has references to Armageddon and biblical references that are more their interest. So I would encourage members [...] of the Jewish community to put their faith in Democrats, because our support for Israel is generally for the right reasons." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Lamborn {{insists that}} the {{difference}} between the Van Buren party and the Whigs is that, although the former sometimes err in practice, they are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in principle; and, better to impress this proposition, he uses a figurative expression in these words: [...] "The Democrats are vulnerable in the heel, but they are sound in the head and the heart." [...] The first branch of the figure--that is, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> vulnerable in the heel--I admit is not merely figuratively, but literally true. Who that looks but for a moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and their hundreds of others, scampering away with the public money to Texas, to Europe, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice, can at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of [...] "running itch"? It seems that this malady of their heels operates on these sound-headed and honest-hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song did on its owner: which, when he had once got started on it, the more he tried to stop it, the more it would run away. At the hazard of wearing this point threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems too strikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier, who was always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who invariably retreated without orders at the first charge of an engagement, being asked by his captain why he did so, replied: [...] "Captain, I have as brave a heart as Julius Caesar ever had; but, somehow or other, whenever danger approaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it." [...] So with Mr. Lamborn's party. They take the public money into their hand for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate; but before they can possibly get it out again, their rascally [...] "vulnerable heels" [...] will run away with them.|$|E

The first part concerns the founders {{and the legal}} positions they supported {{on the question of}} slavery in the territories. The second part is addressed to the voters of the southern states by clarifying the issues between Republicans and Democrats. He rebukes claims made by the Democrats that they are [...] "conservative", arguing instead that the Republicans' position on slavery is in fact the [...] "conservative" [...] policy, as Lincoln claims it coincides with the views of the American founding fathers, who he said opposed slavery. By supporting slavery, Lincoln claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> in opposition to the teachings of the founding fathers and [...] "reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new."

5000|$|The main {{issues for}} the party are law and order, {{increased}} help {{for the elderly and}} disabled, and a restrictive immigration and asylum policy. The principles of the Democrats are built on Christian values, and Norwegian culture and tradition. The party opposes mass immigration and increased Islamic influence, fearing that Western liberal values such as human rights and the Christian heritage will be endangered. It also seeks drastic measures against crime. When questioned about the party's place on the political spectrum, former Democrats' leader Vidar Kleppe responded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> [...] "in many ways a centrist party." [...] As of 2015, the party officially describes itself as a [...] "national value-conservative" [...] party. The Democrats consider the Danish People's Party and the Sweden Democrats to be its sister parties. The party has been characterised by media and scholars as a radical-right populist party.|$|E
5000|$|Roll Call {{reported}} in January 2008 that CREW files {{most of its}} complaints against members of Congress, and [...] "all but a handful ... have targeted Republicans". The article stated that CREW had issued press releases against Democrats but usually had not filed complaints against them, {{with the exception of}} now former Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA), a conservative Democrat. CREW defended itself to Roll Call: [...] "CREW is a nonpartisan organization that targets unethical conduct", Director Naomi Seligman wrote... "Now <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> in power, they will have opportunities for corruption that were previously reserved to Republicans and it is likely we will see more Democratic corruption." [...] After the article was published, CREW stated that it was [...] "baseless" [...] and [...] "omitted key facts".

Hoover also won a number of counties in the far southern coastal regions, whose soils had always proved unsuitable for cotton plantations.
