He was arrested on 5 May 1950, and held in the notorious Sighet prison (alongside three of his brothers — Ștefan Tătărescu included — and his former collaborator Bejan). His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> an institution (where he died in 1955). Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> {{reversing the}} Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing {{the arms race}} with the West. Partly {{as a way to}} fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E

On September 21, Taylor launched his attack on the city, but failed to synchronize his two forces. Poor Mexican leadership allowed the Americans to avert disaster, and after some intense urban fighting, General Ampudia offered Taylor an eight-week ceasefire that was highly favorable to the Mexicans. Taylor accepted, which caused President James K. Polk, furious at the agreement, to transfer most of his forces to Winfield Scott.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1928, Horch {{arranged}} for the American Bond and Mortgage Company to underwrite a bond of $1,925,000 to cover costs. The bonds, which were linked {{to the price of}} gold, were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company.

5|$|Towards 15:00, {{after hours}} of resistance, the Russian army was in dire straits, but the French forces were {{exhausted}} and had neither the necessary stamina nor the necessary will to carry out another assault. At this crucial juncture, Murat's chief of staff, General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor's Headquarters and, according to General Ségur who wrote {{an account of the}} campaign, told him that the Russian line had been breached, that the road to Mozhaysk, behind the Russian line, was visible through the gaping hole the French attack had pierced, that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating, and that a final push would be enough to decide the fate of the Russian army and of the war. Generals Daru, Dumas and Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier also joined in and told the Emperor that everyone thought the time had come for the Guard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> battle.|$|E
5000|$|Comparison level {{correlated}} with the rewards and costs of a relationship determine satisfaction and commitment for a particular person in a relationship. However, there are some situations where people may <b>be</b> <b>committed,</b> but not have a satisfying relationship {{or they may be}} satisfied in their relationship, but not <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> it. Thus, the quality of alternatives helps people understand the 'alternatives' they have outside of their current relationship. [...] Alternatives can be any other option rather than the one currently held. When people have good alternatives, they tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> their relationships. By contrast, when people have poor alternatives, they tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> their relationships.|$|R

5|$|The AN {{comprised}} one {{battalion of}} infantry of 1,000men hurriedly enlisted in Sydney, plus 500naval reservists and ex-sailors who {{would serve as}} infantry. The 1st Battalion, AN was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell Watson, while the naval reservists were formed into six companies under Commander Joseph Beresford. Also included were two machine gun sections, a signals section and a medical detachment. Another battalion of militia from the Queensland-based Kennedy Regiment—which had been dispatched to garrison Thursday Island—also contributed 500volunteers. Recruitment began on 11 August, with the {{very few of the}} infantry having had previous military experience. Under the overall command of Colonel William Holmes, the force departed Sydney on 19 August aboard HMAS Berrima and halted at Palm Island off Townsville until a New Zealand force, escorted by the battlecruiser HMAS Australia, cruiser HMAS Melbourne and the French cruiser Montcalm, occupied Samoa on 30 August. The AN then moved to Port Moresby, where it met the Queensland contingent already aboard the transport Kanowna. The force sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, although Kanowna was left behind when her stokers refused to work. The militia were also left in Port Moresby after Holmes decided they were not sufficiently trained or equipped <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the anticipated fighting.|$|E

It advocated {{the creation of an}} [...] "all-Northern Ireland" [...] identity as a basis for independence and as a solution to the Troubles.

40|$|Reflecting recent {{economic}} developments in Japan, {{there is a}} growing interest in how monetary policy should be conducted under low inflation and nominal interest rates. Among several proposed solutions, the conventional wisdom seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> lower future short-term nominal interest rates through some variation on price-level targeting. We confirm the effectiveness of such a policy in a large-scale dynamic general equilibrium model: the Japanese Economic Model. However, uncertainty - which affects how monetary policy should be conducted - increases {{in the presence of the}} zero bound on nominal interest rates. We posit that the increased uncertainty may explain why the central bank cannot fully <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> a certain fully specified policy scheme far into the future when the economy is caught in a liquidity trap.

However, blue discharge holders faced difficulties in civilian life because the blue discharge carried with it a negative association.
