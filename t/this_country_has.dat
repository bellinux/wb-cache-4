25|$|In {{a fitting}} {{tribute to the}} legacy of Clerk, other West Indian missionaries and the Basel Mission, the British Governor of the Gold Coast during World War I, Frederick Gordon Guggisberg, reacted to the {{expulsion}} of Basel Mission as alien security risk from the Gold Coast by lamenting that, the forced departure was “the greatest blow which education in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> ever suffered;” describing their work as the “first and foremost as regards quality of education and character training” – {{a testament to the}} mission’s approach of combining academic study with practical training for life. While propagation of the Gospel was the main objective of the West Indians and the Basel Mission, the domestic socioeconomic and dire educational environment motivated them to establish the first formal schools and colleges in the country, open to pupils from all walks of life. Moreover, the missionaries provided alternative sources of employment to rural inhabitants through the establishment of mechanized agriculture and commerce-driven small-scale industries such as construction and craftsmanship including printing, tile manufacturing and weaving in order to create self-sufficiency among the natives.|$|E

He went on to say, [...] "our effort in Namibia will be the largest peacekeeping commitment in which <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> ever participated. It may also be the most difficult".

500|$|In his {{personal}} life, Sellers struggled with depression and insecurities. An enigmatic figure, he often {{claimed to have}} no identity outside the roles that he played. His behaviour was often erratic and compulsive, and he frequently clashed with his directors and co-stars, especially in the mid-1970s when his physical and mental health, together with his alcohol and drug problems, were at their worst. Sellers was married four times, and had three children from his first two marriages. He {{died as a result}} of a heart attack in 1980, aged 54.

500|$|Until recently, {{the full}} panoply of {{potential}} federal resources {{had not been}} brought to bear effectively on corruption schemes {{at the state and}} local level. These schemes are at least as corrosive of the governmental process as corruption at the federal level. From the time of Tammany Hall <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> been painfully aware of the existence of corrupt practices in many of our metropolitan areas, and of the [...] "machines" [...] and [...] "rings" [...] which siphon off millions of dollars from public treasuries for private gain. Most state and local prosecutors, beset by inadequate resources and the overwhelming demands of a rising rate of street crime, are simply unable to deal with this type of corruption. Moreover, in some cases, local law enforcement is part and parcel of the problem itself, due to the outright corruption of its own establishment.|$|E

This misfortune, added to the failure of General Clarke's Expedition, has filled the people with great dismay. Many talk of retiring to the East side of the Mountain early in the Spring. Indeed there is great reason to apprehend that the Savages, & perhaps the British from Detroit will push us hard in the Spring, and I believe there never were Posts—nor a Country—in a worse state of defence.|$|E

500|$|Ketèlbey's concert {{music was}} {{less well known}} in England than in {{continental}} Europe, where he conducted many programmes of his own works for the Concertgebouw Orchestra and others. The composer's more avowedly serious music was less widely esteemed by his compatriots. In a 1928 profile the magazine The British Musician commented, [...] "There {{is no need to}} explain here why his serious music, whether written thirty years ago or as recently as 1927... has not won the popularity of, say, Edward German's dances: it is pleasant music, delightfully scored; but it is not so fascinating as that from which it derives—the music of the Viennese writers of dance music, of Délibes and Gounod and the like."

500|$|In December 1954, a {{memorial}} service for Robey was held at St Paul's Cathedral. The diverse congregation consisted of royalty, actors, hospital workers, stage personnel, students and taxi drivers, among others.

[...] Performers gave readings at the service, including the comedian Leslie Henson, who called Robey [...] "that great obstinate bullock of variety". In his lifetime, Robey helped to earn more than £2,000,000 for charitable causes, with £500,000 of that figure being raised during the First World War. In recognition of his efforts, the Merchant Seaman's Convalescent Home in Limpsfield, Surrey, named a ward after him, and managerial staff at the Royal Sussex Hospital later bought a new dialysis machine in his memory. In the 1960s, a public house in Finsbury Park, North London, was named [...] "The George Robey".|$|E
500|$|Mr. Pound has shaken {{the dust}} of London from his feet with not too {{emphatic}} a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to <b>this</b> <b>country....</b> <b>has</b> been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon {{more than one of}} the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture, and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus... With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E

500|$|Hepburn {{returned}} to Stratford {{in the summer}} of 1960 to play Viola in Twelfth Night and Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra. The New York Post wrote of her Cleopatra, [...] "Hepburn offers a highly versatile performance ... once or twice going in for her famous mannerisms and always being fascinating to watch." [...] Hepburn herself was proud of the role. Her repertoire was further improved when she appeared in Sidney Lumet's film version of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962). It was a low-budget production, and she appeared in the film for a tenth of her established salary. She called it [...] "the greatest [...] <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> ever produced" [...] and the role of morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone [...] "the most challenging female role in American drama", and felt her performance was the best screen work of her career. Long Day's Journey Into Night earned Hepburn an Oscar nomination and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. It remains one of her most praised performances.|$|E

A. A. Gill for The Times recommended that people should [...] "eat here at least once to find out what is really going on in your mouth". Also in 2005, German food critic Wolfram Siebeck visited the restaurant complained of the delays in service and of several of the dishes, described the mustard ice cream in a red cabbage gazpacho soup as a [...] "fart of nothingness", while chef Nico Ladenis said of the restaurant, [...] "Someone who makes egg and bacon ice cream is hailed a genius. If you vomit and make ice cream out of it, are you a star?" [...] Tony Naylor of The Guardian enjoyed his trip to the restaurant in 2008, and afterwards criticised those who thought that spending £323.13 on a meal for two at lunchtime was too much.|$|E
500|$|Harrison Clark {{subsequently}} sought {{protection from}} the British South Africa Company. He negotiated concessions with two neighbouring chiefs, Chintanda and Chapugira, each of whom signed over the mining and labour rights for his respective territory {{in return for a}} specified fee whenever Clark wished to use them. In August 1897, Clark wrote to the Company administrator in Salisbury, Earl Grey, requesting that the Company honour these holdings, enclosing copies of the concessions he had secured. Also providing a cursory description of gold mining prospects in the region, Clark criticised the actions of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Warton, who was in the vicinity representing the North Charterland Exploration Company, a BSAC subsidiary. [...] "Mashukulumbwe can be occupied without fighting," [...] he wrote. [...] "I am on friendly terms with all the natives, and, if necessary, can raise a force of three to seven thousand to operate on Mfisini [...] or Mashukulumbwe. Colonel Warton's Administration of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>has</b> been a mistake; the country is rich in alluvial and reef gold." [...] The Company took little notice of Clark, but he continued in the same vein, acquiring similar concessions from the chiefs Chetentaunga, Luvimbie, Sinkermeronga and Mubruma over the following two years.|$|E
