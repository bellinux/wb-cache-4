30|$|Tatu {{claims that}} the infinitive {{absolute}} (môṯ) here, which accompanies a finite form of the same root verb, {{plays the role of}} Finite; however, the elements associated with the Finite, i.e. person and <b>tense,</b> are morphologically <b>part</b> of the second-person masculine imperfect verb form tāmûṯ, and not the infinitive absolute form môṯ; therefore, it makes little sense to analyze the infinitive absolute as the Finite and the finite verb as the Predicator. This fact is obscured in Tatu’s gloss, where the English Finite operator will and the second person pronoun are associated with the infinitive absolute form instead of the word where those elements are realized morphologically. As far as this example is concerned, Bandstra, Barry (2008): 145) analysis of the infinitive absolute as a modal Adjunct expressing certainty seems much more apt, since this structure does indeed express certainty, although since it is a verbal form, it would seem more appropriate to locate this word within the verbal group complex.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} study was to first identify to what extent first-year college violinists physically struggle with the vibrato motion, and further, to identify physical problems within the motion that are contributing to their challenges during the learning process. The 16 {{participants in this study}} were chosen randomly from the College Music Society Directory of Music Faculties in Colleges and Universities (2013 - 2014 edition). Participants completed a questionnaire of 32 quantitative and qualitative questions addressing the vibrato of their 2013 - 2014 first-year violinists. 62 % of participants’ first-year students had a physical problem with vibrato, 70 % of participants’ students were working on correcting physical problems in vibrato during lessons. Participants also reported that 15 % of their students were not able to create a vibrato motion at all. Almost all professors (n= 15) indicated that students with a problematic vibrato were too <b>tense</b> in <b>parts</b> of the arm or hand and this negatively affected the motion and thus, the sound. Specific problems also included vibrato being too narrow, but rarely too wide, vibrato being too fast or too slow caused by tension, problems with when and how vibrato was being applied, problems with maintaining intonation before or during use of vibrato, and problems with not understanding the motion needed or imagining an intended sound. Most professors used movement terminology to describe physical problems with vibrato as well as aural problems with vibrato. Only a few professors discussed aural problems in vibrato using terminology depicting the sound. Participants revealed that the most commonly used types of vibrato amongst their first-year students were arm vibrato and a combination vibrato (use of wrist, arm and finger vibratos). Most participants also listed these combined parts of finger, wrist and arm in their own definitions of a good-sounding vibrato. Results from this study can be directed to the attention of classroom teachers, studio teacher and private instructors to these specific physical and aural problems before a student begins to study vibrato early in learning. Conclusions suggest possible ways in which the college or pre-college teacher can address these issues in students that have a problematic vibrato motion...|$|R

50|$|The {{suspicion}} of some earlier scholars that the Praefatio and the Versus {{might be a}} modern forgery is refuted by the occurrence of the word vitteas, which is the Old Saxon fihtea, corresponding to the Old English fitt, which means a canto of a poem. It is impossible that a scholar of the 16th century could have been acquainted with this word, and internal evidence shows clearly that both the prose and the verse are of early origin. The Versus, considered in themselves, {{might very well be}} supposed to relate to Caedmon; but the mention of the five ages of the world in the concluding lines is obviously due to recollection of the opening of the Heliand (lines 46-47). It is therefore certain that the Versus, as well as the Praefatio, attribute to the author of the Heliand a poetic rendering of the Old Testament. Their testimony, if accepted, confirms the ascription to him of the Genesis fragments, which is further supported {{by the fact that they}} occur in the same MS. with a portion of the Heliand. As the Praefatio speaks of the emperor Ludwig in the present <b>tense,</b> the former <b>part</b> of it at least was probably written in his reign, i.e. not later than AD. 840. The general opinion of scholars is that the latter part, which represents the poet as having received his vocation in a dream, is by a later hand, and that the sentences in the earlier part which refer to the dream are interpolations by this second author. The date of these additions, and of the Versus, is of no importance, as their statements are incredible.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (English)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 Narratives are {{the product}} of a basic human {{tendency}} to make sense of real or imagined experiences. The research question posed in the dissertation is: how is narrativity encoded in East African English? Can the narrativity model in the dissertation distinguish between registers that prototypically focus on narration versus registers that do not primarily focus on narration? The narrativity model consists of four main groups of features, namely Agency, Causation, Contextualisation and Evaluation. These groups are representative of the fundamental structure of narratives: things happen to people at a specific time and place. Agency concerns the people who either instigate or are affected by the events. The things that happen can be denoted by Causation when they are the result of cause and effect in the world. Contextualisation refers to the grounding of events in time and space. Lastly, Evaluation concerns the reactions and attitudes people have towards the events. Eighteen linguistic features such as third person pronouns (part of the Agency group) and past <b>tense</b> verbs (<b>part</b> of the Contextualisation group) were analysed as micro-level indicators of narrativity. The corpus-based investigation analysed the linguistic features used to encode narrativity across 22 spoken and written registers of the East African component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-EA) using WordSmith Tools 4. 0. The raw scores for each feature were standardised across all registers to enable comparisons between features, as well as between registers. The results indicate that narrativity is a gradient phenomenon that occurs across a variety of East African English spoken and written registers. After the initial analyses were done, the narrativity model was revised to include only 11 core narrativity features. These features are past tense verbs, third person pronouns, proper nouns for persons, activity verbs, time and place adverbials, perfect aspect, emotional stance verb feel, first person pronouns, evaluative adjectives and non-finite causative clauses. ICE-EA registers that focus on narration as a MEANS to make sense of experiences (the objective or END) are Fiction, Social letters, Oral narratives, Face-to-face conversation and Legal cross-examination. In other words, the core narrativity features are the MEANS and the END is to make sense of experiences and facilitate understanding using narration. Twelve registers have an intermediate focus on narrativity. Narration is a secondary or simultaneous objective in these registers alongside primary objectives such as scientific exposition, persuasiveness, information presentation or interpersonal interaction. There are five registers with low scores for the core narrativity features: Student writing, Business letters, Popular writing, Academic writing and Instructional writing. These registers do not primarily focus on narration and have other primary and even secondary objectives such as scientific exposition and persuasiveness. The narrativity model sheds light on the way narrativity is encoded using linguistic features and gives insight into East African English register variationMaster...|$|R
40|$|Jobs are {{important}} in maintaining social cohesion. Employment provides income, but also a sense of self-worth and a meeting place for social interactions that weave the social fabric. With over 200 million unemployed globally, {{the number of jobs}} created has taken centre stage, especially in countries hit hard by the economic crisis. And yet, labour relations have become <b>tense</b> in many <b>parts</b> of the world, including those still experiencing economic growth. In 2010, China witnessed a marked increase in strikes, labour disputes and even suicides in the workplace. Understanding the economic and institutional determinants of good labour relations matters for designing and implementing better labour market policies. The increase in labour disputes in China coincided {{with the end of the}} era of surplus labour. While labour was abundant in rural hinterlands, manufacturing firms could rely on cheap labour as migrant workers would still be better off than if they stayed at home. As it became increasingly difficult for manufacturing firms in urban centres and the coastal provinces to recruit labour, wages were bid up throughout the economy. This process however, was all but smooth, as the increase in labour disputes shows. What is needed is a set of labour market institutions that help the transition in labour markets to be not only efficient, but also peaceful and equitable. This paper by Cai Fan and Wang Meiyan, from the Institute of Population and Labour Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, documents the increase in labour disputes in China and seeks to understand their determinants. The main finding is that the increase in disputes is linked to a change in regime in the labour market with the end of surplus labour. The paper therefore calls for further advances in establishing labour market institutions to adapt to the new labour market situation. The paper finds that disputes result from a better awareness of rights on the part of workers and that they are more common in thriving and export-oriented areas. The authors go on to discuss the Chinese government’s responses to the growing problem, from pro-active labour market policy to increasing the importance of collective contracts. In doing so, this paper provides an important building block in the understanding of the role of labour market institutions for social cohesion. ...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 68 - 74 Any language {{itself is}} a complex structure, therefore acquisition of any language is highly complex. The fact remains that studying the acquisition process is a relatively complex field. No single process has been proven to account for all of second language acquisition. Ellis' (1985) statement that "second language acquisition {{is the product of}} many factors pertaining to the learner {{on the one hand and}} the learning situation on the other" (p. 4) explicitly explains the complexity of the acquisition process. The interaction of different learners, different learning styles, and different ways of learning brings about this complexity and diversity as well. Understanding this, researchers attempt to follow an inductive procedure to arrive at general principles. That is, researchers reasoning from findings of previous studies try to identify some aspects of the acquisition process that are common to larger groups of learners. In this respect the interim stages a learner goes through in his interlanguage continuum are of crucial importance in second language acquisition research. This study is concerned with the interim stages of learners in the interlanguage continuum in terms of tense acquisition. In this study American native speakers and Turkish learners of English as a Foreign Language are compared in terms of their abilities to match particular temporal and aspectual references with particular English tenses. The baseline for comparing Turkish nonnative speakers with native speakers is native speakers' responses rather than the knowledge given in English grammar books. The aim of this study was to find out whether Turkish learners from three different language experience levels demonstrate a development in approximating the native speaker responses in accord with their language experience level. In this study the participants were 13 American native speakers and 83 Turkish learners of English from three different levels of language experience. The source of data was a questionnaire in which the participants were asked to match particular English temporal and aspectual references with particular English sentences. The data analysis in this study involved two steps. First, the statistical analysis of differences between American native speakers and the Turkish speaker groups was performed using a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In order to explain the patterns of variation, which remain obscure in the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA), the data was analyzed by means of percentages in the second step of the analysis. The results of the study suggest variability in the progression of learning English <b>tenses</b> on the <b>part</b> of students' having different language learning experiences. Yet, the findings of the study are subject to potential limitations. For this reason, the findings of the study cannot be considered as a strong evidence for idiosyncrasy because it does not disprove a stable orderBarın, SerapM. S...|$|R
40|$|Verb Combination, Control Verbs, Control Adjectives, English GrammarThis {{lesson was}} {{developed}} by John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 Making English Grammar Meaningful and Useful Mini Lesson # 8 Control Verbs and Control Adjectives: Difficult to Remember The purpose of this lesson is to learn about verb plus verb combinations, a topic that {{is very difficult for}} ELLs to master, but one that will help them use Verb Forms correctly. Many English sentences contain two verbs used {{in such a way that}} the first verb is part of the Subject-Verb Combination, and the second verb conveys additional information but is not part of the Subject-Verb Combination. In such sentences, the first verb must be used in one of twelve tenses. The second verb is not used as a <b>tense</b> or as <b>part</b> of a <b>tense.</b> Instead, the second verb is used in one of three Verb Forms: the To Form, the ING Form or the Simple Form. It is the first verb which controls which form the second verb takes. Therefore, these first verbs are called Control Verbs. The following sentences illustrate three kinds of Control Verbs. The instructor asked the student to give the right answer. The instructor watched the student giving the right answer. The instructor helped the student give the right answer. In these three sentences, the first verbs, ‘ask’, ‘watch’, and ‘help’ are Control Verbs. They control the form of the second verb, ‘give’. Notice that the first verbs are all in the Simple Past Tense. They could be used in any tense, depending upon the time that the sentence communicates. However, the second verbs are not in past tense. They are used as Verb Forms and their forms will always be the same, regardless of the tense of the first verbs as illustrated in these three sentences. The instructor will ask the student to give the right answer. The instructor is watching the student giving the right answer. The instructor has helped the student give the right answer. Control Verbs are difficult for ELLs because no apparent explanation can be given for why some Control Verbs are followed by the TO Form of the second verb, why others are followed by the ING Form of the second verb, and why still others are followed by the Simple Form of the verb. Some Control Verbs can be followed by two forms. ‘Watch’, for example, can be followed by both the ING Form (I watched her dancing.) and the Simple Form (I watched her dance.). ‘Like’ can be followed by both the To Form (I like to dance.) and the ING Form (I like dancing.). This lesson {{was developed by}} John Nelson and Tymofey Wowk, 2012 English has dozens of Control Verbs. They are found in sentences where the first verb is immediately followed by the second verb (I want to go.). They are found in sentences where the first verb is followed by an object which becomes the doer of the second verb (I want him to go.). Control Verbs which are followed by the To Form include ‘ask’, ‘tell’, ‘like’, and ‘want’. Control Verbs followed by the ING Form include ‘admit’, ‘avoid’, ‘enjoy’ and ‘report’. Control Verbs followed by the Simple Form include ‘make’, ‘help’, ‘let’, and ‘have’. However, there are many Control Verbs. ELLs need to be aware of why Control Verbs are important, and then they need to learn which ones are followed by which forms as they encounter them. English also has certain adjectives which function in the same way that Control Verbs function. These are called Control Adjectives. They are usually followed by a preposition followed by the ING Form of the verb. These sentences are examples of Control Adjectives: The professor is opposed to dismissing the class early. The professor is concerned about dismissing the class early. The students are interested in dismissing the class early. Control Verbs and Control Adjectives are difficult to master, but for ELLs who are interested in making their English productions accurate, they are very useful to know...|$|R
