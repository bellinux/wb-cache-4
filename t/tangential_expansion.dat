40|$|SummaryEvolution of the {{mammalian}} brain encompassed {{a remarkable}} increase in {{size of the}} cerebral cortex, which includes tangential and radial expansion. However, the mechanisms underlying these key features are still largely unknown. Here, we identified the DNA-associated protein Trnp 1 as a regulator of cerebral cortex expansion {{in both of these}} dimensions. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo demonstrate that high Trnp 1 levels promote neural stem cell self-renewal and <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion.</b> In contrast, lower levels promote radial expansion, with a potent increase of the number of intermediate progenitors and basal radial glial cells leading to folding of the otherwise smooth murine cerebral cortex. Remarkably, TRNP 1 expression levels exhibit regional differences in the cerebral cortex of human fetuses, anticipating radial or <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion.</b> Thus, the dynamic regulation of Trnp 1 is critical to control tangential and radial expansion of the cerebral cortex in mammals...|$|E
40|$|The neurons of the {{mammalian}} neocortex are {{organised into}} six layers. By contrast, the reptilian and avian dorsal cortices only have three layers which {{are thought to}} be equivalent to layers I, V and VI of mammals. Increased repertoire of mammalian higher cognitive functions is likely a result of an expanded cortical surface area. The majority of cortical cell proliferation in mammals occurs in the ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ), with a small number of scattered divisions outside the germinal zone. Comparative developmental studies suggest that the appearance of SVZ coincides with the laminar expansion of the cortex to six layers, as well as the <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> of the cortical sheet seen within mammals. In spite of great variation and further compartmentalisation in the mitotic compartments, the number of neurons in an arbitrary cortical column appears to be remarkably constant within mammals. The current challenge is to understand how the emergence and elaboration of the SVZ has contributed to increased cortical cell diversity, <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> and gyrus formation of the mammalian neocortex. This review discusses neurogenic processes that are believed to underlie these major changes in cortical dimensions in vertebrates...|$|E

However, how the mammalian neocortex emerged during evolution remains elusive. Because all modern reptiles have a homolog of the neocortex at the dorsal pallium, developmental analyses of the reptilian cortex are valuable to explore {{the origin of the}} neocortex. However, reptilian cortical development and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, mainly due to technical difficulties with sample collection and embryonic manipulation. Here, we introduce a method of embryonic manipulations for the Madagascar ground gecko and Chinese softshell turtle. We established in ovo electroporation and an ex ovo culture system to address neural stem cell dynamics, neuronal differentiation and migration. Applications of these techniques illuminate the developmental mechanisms underlying reptilian corticogenesis, which provides significant insight into the evolutionary steps of different types of cortex and the origin of the mammalian neocortex...|$|R

40|$|In adulthood, the isocortex {{of several}} species is {{characterized}} by a gradient in neurons per unit of cortical surface area with fewer neurons per unit of cortical surface area in the rostral pole relative to the caudal pole. A gradient in neurogenesis timing predicts differences in neurons across the isocortex: neurons per unit of cortical surface area are fewer rostrally, where neurogenesis duration is short, and higher caudally where neurogenesis duration is longer. How species differences in neurogenesis duration impact cortical progenitor cells across its axis is not known. I estimated progenitor cells per unit of ventricular area across the rostro-caudal axis of the isocortex in cats (Felis catus) and in dogs (Canis familiaris) mostly before layers VI-II neurons are generated. I also estimated the ventricular length across the rostro-caudal axis at various stages of development in both species. These two species were chosen because neurogenesis duration in dogs is extended compared with cats. Caudally, cortical progenitors expand more tangentially and in numbers in dogs compared with cats. Rostrally, the cortical proliferative zone also expands more tangentially in dogs compared cats. However, the <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> in the rostral cortical proliferative zone occurs without a concomitant increase in progenitor cell numbers. The <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> of the ventricular surface in the rostral cortex is mediated by a reduction in cell density. These different developmental growth patterns account for the disproportionate expansion of the rostral (i. e., frontal cortex) and caudal cortex (e. g., primary visual cortex) when neurogenesis duration lengthens in evolution...|$|E

Here we have used the monkey areas 17 and 18, which show striking cytoarchitectonic differences, as a model system for studying how developmental events establish areal boundaries in the adult.

40|$|As {{a system}} to study the {{regulation}} of growth anisotropy, we studied thinning of the primary root of maize (Zea mays L.) occurring developmentally or induced by water stress. Seedlings were transplanted into vermiculite at a water potential of approximately - 0. 03 MPa (well-watered) or - 1. 6 MPa (water-stressed). The diameter of roots in both treatments decreased with time after transplanting; the water-stressed roots became substantially thinner than well-watered roots at steady state, showing that root thinning is a genuine response to water stress. To analyze the thinning responses we quantified cell numbers and the spatial profiles of longitudinal, radial, and <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> rates separately for the cortex and stele. The results showed {{that there was no}} zone of isotropic expansion and the degree of anisotropy varied greatly with position and treatment. Thinning over time in well-watered roots was caused by rates of radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> being too low to maintain the shape of the root. In response to low water potential, cell number in both tissues was unchanged radially but increased tangentially, which shows that thinning was caused wholly by reduced cell expansion. Water stress substantially decreased rates of tangential and radial expansion in both the stele and cortex, but only in the apical 5 mm of the root; basal to this, rates were similar in well-watered and water-stressed roots. By contrast, as in previous studies, longitudinal expansion was identical between the treatments in the apical 3 mm but in water-stressed roots was inhibited at more basal locations. The results show that expansion in longitudinal and radial directions can be regulated independently...|$|E
40|$|A dorsalization {{mechanism}} {{is a good}} candidate for the evolutionary origin of the isocortex, producing a radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> of the dorsal pallium (and perhaps other structures that acquired a cortical phenotype). Evidence suggests that {{a large part of the}} dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) of reptiles and birds derives from the embryonic ventral pallium, whereas the isocortex possibly derives mostly from the dorsal pallium. In early mammals, the development of olfactory-hippocampal associative networks may have been pivotal in facilitating the selection of a larger and more complex dorsal pallium which received both collothalamic and lemnothalamic sensory information. Finally, although it is not clear exactly when mammalian brain expansion began, fossil evidence indicates that this was a late event in mammaliaform evolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{cerebral}} cortex of large mammals undergoes massive surface area expansion and folding during development. Specific mechanisms to orchestrate {{the growth of}} the cortex in surface area rather than in thickness are likely to exist, but they have not been identified. Analyzing multiple species, we have identified a specialized type of progenitor cell that is exclusive to mammals with a folded {{cerebral cortex}}, which we named intermediate radial glia cell (IRGC). IRGCs express Pax 6 but not Tbr 2, have a radial fiber contacting the pial surface but not the ventricular surface, and are found in both the inner subventricular zone and outer subventricular zone (OSVZ). We find that IRGCs are massively generated in the OSVZ, thus augmenting the numbers of radial fibers. Fanning out of this expanding radial fiber scaffold promotes the tangential dispersion of radially migrating neurons, allowing for the growth in surface area of the cortical sheet. Accordingly, the <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> of particular cortical regions was preceded by high proliferation in the underlying OSVZ, whereas the experimental reduction of IRGCs impaired the tangential dispersion of neurons and resulted in a smaller cortical surface. Thus, the generation of IRGCs {{plays a key role in}} the <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> of the mammalian cerebral cortex. Â© 2010 The Author.

Targeted deletion of Fgf 10 delays RG differentiation, whereas overexpression has opposing effects. Delayed RG differentiation in Fgf 10 mutants occurs selectively in rostral cortex, paralleled by {{an extended period of}} symmetric NC divisions increasing progenitor number, coupled with delayed and initially diminished production of neurons and BPs.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} {{architecture of}} the Carboniferous seed fern Lyginopteris oldhamia is investigated from development stages including naturally decorticated stems. The growth form shows a relatively long semi-self-supporting phase of growth, with prolonged retention of the primary outer "dictyoxylon" cortex contributing significantly during early and mature growth. The outer cortex is retained on the stem despite significant secondary vascular growth via radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> and proliferation of interstitial parenchyma and longitudinal division of the radial bands of fibers. In {{the final stages of}} development, the outer "mechanical dictyoxylon" cortex is sloughed from the stem after periderm development in the inner cortex. Loss of the outer cortex results in a decrease in calculated bending stiffness. Calculations of mechanical stem properties based on the overall development indicate for a climber a comparatively stiff mechanical architecture that is comparable with certain types of extant lianas. Mechanisms that allow L. oldhamia to retain and then shed the outer cortex show developmental and mechanical strategies analogous to those of extant climbing plants. The study indicates that relatively sophisticated climbing stem architectures had already evolved by the Late Carboniferous...|$|E
40|$|Gyrification, the {{developmental}} buckling of the cortex, {{is not a}} random process-the forces that mediate expansion do so {{in such a way}} as to generate consistent patterns of folds across individuals and even species. Although the origin of these forces is unknown, some theories have suggested that they may be related to external cortical factors such as axonal tension. Here, we investigate an alternative hypothesis, namely, whether the differential <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> of the cortex alone can account for the degree and pattern-specificity of gyrification. Using intrinsic curvature as a measure of differential expansion, we initially explored whether this parameter and the local gyrification index (used to quantify the degree of gyrification) varied in a regional-specific pattern across the cortical surface in a manner that was replicable across independent datasets of neurotypicals. Having confirmed this consistency, we further demonstrated that within each dataset, the degree of intrinsic curvature of the cortex was predictive of the degree of cortical folding at a global and regional level. We conclude that differential expansion is a plausible primary mechanism for gyrification, and propose that this perspective offers a compelling mechanistic account of the co-localization of cytoarchitecture and cortical folds...|$|E
40|$|The {{exterior}} of the mammalian brain - the cerebral cortex - has a conserved layered structure whose thickness varies little across species. However, selection pressures over evolutionary time scales have led to cortices that have a large surface {{area to volume ratio}} in some organisms, with the result that the brain is strongly convoluted into sulci and gyri. Here we show that the gyrification can arise as a nonlinear consequence of a simple mechanical instability driven by <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> of the gray matter constrained by the white matter. A physical mimic of the process using a layered swelling gel captures the essence of the mechanism, and numerical simulations of the brain treated as a soft solid lead to the formation of cusped sulci and smooth gyri similar to those in the brain. The resulting gyrification patterns are a function of relative cortical expansion and relative thickness (compared with brain size), and are consistent with observations {{of a wide range of}} brains, ranging from smooth to highly convoluted. Furthermore, this dependence on two simple geometric parameters that characterize the brain also allows us to qualitatively explain how variations in these parameters lead to anatomical anomalies in such situations as polymicrogyria, pachygyria, and lissencephalia...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{rapid growth}} of the human cortex during {{development}} is accompanied by the folding of the brain into a highly convoluted structure 1 - 3. Recent {{studies have focused on}} the genetic and cellular regulation of cortical growth 4 - 8, but understanding the formation of the gyral and sulcal convolutions also requires consideration of the geometry and physical shaping of the growing brain 9 - 15. To study this, we use magnetic resonance images to build a 3 D-printed layered gel mimic of the developing smooth fetal brain; when immersed in a solvent, the outer layer swells relative to the core, mimicking cortical growth. This relative growth puts the outer layer into mechanical compression and leads to sulci and gyri similar to those in fetal brains. Starting with the same initial geometry, we also build numerical simulations of the brain modelled as a soft tissue with a growing cortex, and show that this also produces the characteristic patterns of convolutions over a realistic developmental course. All together, our results show that although many molecular determinants control the <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> of the cortex, the size, shape, placement and orientation of the folds arise through iterations and variations of an elementary mechanical instability modulated by early fetal brain geometry...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the degree of anisotropic expansion of plant tissues is controlled by the degree of alignment of cortical microtubules or cellulose microfibrils. Previously, for the primary root of maize (Zea mays L.), we quantified spatial profiles of expansion rate in length, radius, and circumference and the degree of growth anisotropy separately for the stele and cortex, as roots became thinner with time from germination or in response to low water potential (B. M. Liang, A. M. Dennings, R. E. Sharp, T. I. Baskin [1997] Plant Physiol 115 : 101 – 111). Here, for the same material, we quantified microtubule alignment with indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and microfibril alignment throughout the cell wall with polarized-light microscopy and from the innermost cell wall layer with electron microscopy. Throughout much of the growth zone, mean orientations of microtubules and microfibrils were transverse, consistent with their parallel alignment specifying the direction of maximal expansion rate (i. e. elongation). However, where microtubule alignment became helical, microfibrils often made helices of opposite handedness, showing that parallelism between these elements was not required for helical orientations. Finally, contrary to the hypothesis, the degree of growth anisotropy was not correlated with the degree of alignment of either microtubules or microfibrils. The mechanisms plants use to specify radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> rates remain uncharacterized...|$|E
40|$|Neurodevelopment is a complex, dynamic {{process that}} {{involves}} a precisely orchestrated sequence of genetic, environmental, biochemical, and physical events. Developmental biology and genetics have shaped {{our understanding of}} the molecular and cellular mechanisms during neurodevelopment. Recent studies suggest that physical forces {{play a central role in}} translating these cellular mechanisms into the complex surface morphology of the human brain. However, the precise impact of neuronal differentiation, migration, and connection on the physical forces during cortical folding remains unknown. Here we review the cellular mechanisms of neurodevelopment with a view towards surface morphogenesis, pattern selection, and evolution of shape. We revisit cortical folding as the instability problem of constrained differential growth in a multi-layered system. To identify the contributing factors of differential growth, we map out the timeline of neurodevelopment in humans and highlight the cellular events associated with extreme radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion.</b> We demonstrate how computational modeling of differential growth can bridge the scales-from phenomena on the cellular level towards form and function on the organ level-to make quantitative, personalized predictions. Physics-based models can quantify cortical stresses, identify critical folding conditions, rationalize pattern selection, and predict gyral wavelengths and gyrification indices. We illustrate that physical forces can explain cortical malformations as emergent properties of developmental disorders. Combining biology and physics holds promise to advance our understanding of human brain development and enable early diagnostics of cortical malformations with the ultimate goal to improve treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|To {{test the}} role of {{cortical}} microtubules in aligning cellulose microfibrils and controlling anisotropic expansion, we exposed Arabidopsis thaliana roots to moderate levels of the microtubule inhibitor, oryzalin. After 2 d of treatment, roots grow at approximately steady state. At that time, the spatial profiles of relative expansion rate in length and diameter were quantified, and roots were cryofixed, freeze-substituted, embedded in plastic, and sectioned. The angular distribution of microtubules {{as a function of}} distance from the tip was quantified from antitubulin immunofluorescence images. In alternate sections, the overall amount of alignment among microfibrils and their mean orientation as a function of position was quantified with polarized-light microscopy. The spatial profiles of relative expansion show that the drug affects relative elongation and <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> rates independently. The microtubule distributions averaged to transverse in the growth zone for all treatments, but on oryzalin the distributions became broad, indicating poorly organized arrays. At a subcellular scale, cellulose microfibrils in oryzalin-treated roots were as well aligned as in controls; however, the mean alignment direction, while consistently transverse in the controls, was increasingly variable with oryzalin concentration, meaning that microfibril orientation in one location tended to differ from that of a neighboring location. This conclusion was confirmed by direct observations of microfibrils with field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Taken together, these results suggest that cortical microtubules ensure microfibrils are aligned consistently across the organ, thereby endowing the organ with a uniform mechanical structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} geometric {{changes that}} occur in swelling of corn starch granules during heating throughout the range of gelatinization (63 - 72 °C) and at higher temperatures when substantial amount s of soluble starch are released from the granule were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Corn starch granules begin to swell radially, then undergo radial contraction and random <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion.</b> They form complex geometrical structures at the midpoint range (67 - 70 °C) unlike the more uniform single-dimensional tangential swelling that occurs with lenticular granules of wheat starch. At higher temperatures, when starch begins to solubilize, corn starch granules lose their distinct ridges and appear to melt into thin flat disks. These progressive configurational changes {{are reflected in the}} rheological properties of more concentrated starch dispersions cooked for 75 minutes. At the early stages of gelatinization (6 3 - 65 °C) the granules are relatively rigid and at high enough concentration shovv dilatant behavior (viscosity increasing with shear rate). At these temperatures, granules remain rigid and maintain their birefringence but are mechanically sheared by stirring during cooking. Once the granules undergo extensive swelling, develop ridges, and lose their birefringence (67 - 70 °C), they are soft enough to exhibit shear thinning behavior (viscosity decreasing with shear rate). The extent of shear thinning depends on concentration, because viscosity and shear stress increase with concentration and the granules become more susceptible to deformation. At high enough concentrations (and associated stresses), the ridges are not as clearly defined as they are at lower concentrations. Granules become more flat and flexible when cooked above 75 °C...|$|E
40|$|The {{central nervous}} system areas {{displaying}} the highest structural and functional complexity correspond to the so called cortices, i. e. concentric alternating neuronal and fibrous layers. Corticogenesis, i. e. {{the development of the}} cortical organization, depends on the temporal-spatial organization of several developmental events: (a) the duration of the proliferative phase of the neuroepithelium, (b) the relative duration of symmetric (expansive) versus asymmetric (neuronogenic) sub phases, (c) the spatial organization of each kind of cell division, (e) the time of determination and cell cycle exit and (f) the time of onset of the postmitotic neuronal migration and (g) the time of onset of the neuronal structural and functional differentiation. The first five events depend on molecular mechanisms that perform a fine tuning of the proliferative activity. Changes in any of them significantly influence the cortical size or volume (<b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> and radial thickness), morphology, architecture and also impact on neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis affecting the cortical wiring.

Amylograph breakdown (r = 0. 87 [superscript]**), setback (r = - 0. 93 [superscript]**), and consistency (r = - 0. 91 [superscript]**) of milled rice flour (10 %, as-is basis) showed strong correlations with cooked rice stickiness, {{and can be}} used as good indices of cooked rice stickiness, especially among rices with a narrow range of amylose content;The changes of physical appearance of isolated rice starch and milled rice were observed during heating by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Rice starch granules begin to swell radially, then undergo radial contraction and random <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> to form complex structures in the gelatinization temperature range. At the end of the gelatinization temperature range, starch granules begin to lose their granular structures. At higher temperatures, rice starch granules soften and melt into thin flat disks and then stretch into thin filaments to form a three-dimensional network. During this transition, rapid increases in swelling power and solubility occur. These progressive configurational changes are reflected in the amylograph curves. Susceptibility of the starch granules dispersed in excess water to changes during heating is dependent on gelatinization temperature range during initial swelling and on the ratio of amylose to amylopectin in the latter stage of swelling. Birefringence end-point temperature (BEPT) was affected mainly by the degree of crystallinity (r = 0. 67 [superscript]**);The progressive structural changes of milled rice grains proceed from the periphery {{toward the center of the}} endosperm as water diffuses. The rate of water diffusion seems to depend on cell arrangement of the endosperm and protein content of milled rice, and gelatinization temperature range and amylose content of starch.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} neocortex {{consists of}} six layers. By contrast, the reptilian and avian cortices have only three, which {{are believed to}} be equivalent to layers I, V and VI of mammals. In mammals, the majority of cortical cell proliferation occurs in the ventricular and subventricular zones, but there are a small number of scattered individual divisions throughout the cortex. Neurogenesis in the cortical subventricular zone is believed to contribute to the supragranular layers. To estimate the proportions of different forms of divisions in reptiles and birds, we examined the site of proliferation in embryonic turtle (stages 18 - 25) and chick (embryonic days 8 - 15) brains using phospho-histone H 3 (a G 2 and M phase marker) immunohistochemistry. In turtle, only few scattered abventricular H 3 -immunoreactive cells were found outside the ventricular zone; the majority of the H 3 -immunoreactive cells were located in the ventricular zone throughout the entire turtle brain. Ventricular zone cell proliferation peaks at stages 18 and 20, before an increase of abventricular proliferation at stages 23 and 25. In turtle cortex, however, abventricular proliferation at any given stage never exceeded 17. 5 +/- 2. 47 % of the total division and the mitotic profiles did not align parallel to the ventricular zone. Phospho-histone H 3 immunoreactivity in embryonic chick brains suggests the lack of subventricular zone in the dorsal cortex, but the presence of subventricular zone in the ventral telencephalon. We were able to demonstrate that the avian subventricular zone is present in both pallial and subpallial regions of the ventral telencephalon during embryonic development, and we characterize the spatial and temporal organization of the subventricular zone. Comparative studies suggest that the subventricular zone was involved in the laminar expansion of the cortex to six layers in mammals from the three-layered cortex found in reptiles and birds. Within mammals, the number of neurons in a cortical column appears to be largely constant; nevertheless, there are considerable differences between the germinal zones in mammalian species. It is yet to be determined whether these elaborations of the subventricular zone may have contributed to cell diversity, <b>tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> or gyrus formation of the neocortex and whether {{it might have been the}} major driving force behind the evolution of the six-layered neocortex in mammals...|$|E
40|$|Most {{dicotyledonous}} {{species with}} secondary growth possess a single cylindrical vascular cambium. However, anomalous types are not uncommon. The various classification systems for anomalous patterns of secondary thickening are compared {{and the distribution}} of successive cambria in about 20 families of 13 orders is summarized. The distribution of this feature within the Phytolaccaceae is detailed including new observations showing successive cambia in Stegnosperma. Serial sections of different developmental stages of plant axes permitted precise three-dimensional reconstruction of the vascular system. Macerations of increments adjacent to the plant of transverse sectioning allowed comparison of xylem-cell dimensions between successive increments, different parts of individual plants, and all three species. Comparisons between species reveal that S. cubense has secondary xylem with the largest diameter pores, longest vessel elements, longest fiber-tracheids, and largest diameter fiber-tracheid pits. S. watsonii has the greatest number of pores per square mm, smallest fiber-tracheid diameter, and the largest ratio of fiber-tracheid to vessel-element length. Pore diameter, fiber-tracheid length, and the ratio of fiber tracheid to vessel-element length were less in small stems than in large stems and less in large stems than in roots. Pores per square mm, fiber-tracheid diameter, and vessel-element length were more or less constant between small stems and roots. Most xylary cell dimensions remain constant between successive increments of wood at a given level. The anomalous cambia arise in the conjunctive tissue and function bidirectionally. They are first evident as dedifferentiated parenchyma and then as small fascicular areas. <b>Tangential</b> <b>expansion</b> of existing regions produces larger arcs and rings of vascular tissue. Radial and tangential interconnections between vascular bundles are common in Stegnosperma. Dye movement traced through the axis confirms the presence of a complex network. At the upper and lower limits of a given ring or arc of anomalous vascular tissue, a radial connection occurs with the adjacent inner increment. The resulting pattern is a series of concentric cylinders of cambial zones, which anastomose with inner layers at their top and bottom. The normal increment of secondary thickening is the innermost cylinder and each successive layer forms a shorter but wider sheath around the previous layers. The apical organization of Stegnosperma consists of four zones: tunica, central mother cells, peripheral, and pith-rib meristem. A cambium-like or transition zone was not observed. The primary shoot vasculature is described as open, lacking direct vascular connections between sympodia, and followed a 2 / 5 phyllotaxy. Patterns of differentiation in shoot apices are detailed. The organization of the root apex as determined from seedling studies is analyzed by the constituent histogens. The vasculature of seedlings was found to follow the common dicotyledonous pattern. The initiation of secondary growth in the hypocotyl and its acropetal development is also typical of other dicotyledons. Secondary growth ascends the shoot helically according to phyllotaxy. The vascular cambium descends in the root, first appearing opposite the phloem and then in the pericycle. These observations are discussed in light of their differences with earlier studies, compared with other Phytolaccaceae, and examined with regard to the physiological function of the anomaly. Systematic implications are summarized and a tentative phyllogeny of the Phytolaccaceae is given...|$|E
