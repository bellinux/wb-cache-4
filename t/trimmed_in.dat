5|$|Grissom's crew {{received}} {{approval in}} June 1966 {{to design a}} mission patch with the name Apollo 1. The design's center depicts a Command/Service Module flying over the southeastern United States with Florida (the launch point) prominent. The Moon {{is seen in the}} distance, symbolic of the eventual program goal. A yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes, <b>trimmed</b> <b>in</b> gold. The insignia was designed by the crew, with the artwork done by North American Aviation employee Allen Stevens.|$|E
5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress cap that was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were <b>trimmed</b> <b>in</b> red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E

5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade <b>trimmed</b> <b>in</b> neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within.|$|E

25|$|Doctor's robes usually use wool flannel, panama (worsted), superfine cloth, damask, or brocade, and are brightly {{coloured}} (or black, but {{faced with}} a bright colour) to distinguish them from lower degrees.

Many doctoral gowns have a special undress version so adding to the cost of a full set.|$|E

25|$|The {{enlargement}} of the club's library, {{and the fact of}} its growing postgraduate or honorary membership roll, compelled it {{from time to time to}} enlarge its accommodations. Finally, in 1881, it determined to tear down the old house where it had so long met, on Harvard street and build a new structure its site. The new structure is of brick, handsomely <b>trimmed</b> <b>in</b> stone, and rises to the height of four stories, with about seventy or eighty feet of frontage on Harvard street. Two large stores claim a part of the ground floor, but they do not encroach on the broad and handsome entrance to the club's apartments.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2010–11 season, the Islanders retired their inaugural {{navy blue}} Edge uniforms, {{replacing}} them with the throwback design as their new home jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders' draft party at Nassau Coliseum. For the following season, they unveiled an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with blue and white trim. The Islanders crest {{was placed on the}} shoulder yoke. Diagonal side panels, blue <b>trimmed</b> <b>in</b> orange and gray, combined with similar panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each player.|$|E
25|$|Doc Martens {{were dark}} shoes or boots with air-cushioned soles that were worn by both sexes in the 1980s. They were an {{essential}} fashion accessory for the skinhead and punk subcultures in the United Kingdom. Sometimes Doc Martens were paired with miniskirts or full, Laura Ashley- style dresses. They were an {{important feature of}} the post-punk 1980s Gothic look which featured long, back-combed hair, pale skin, dark eyeshadow, eyeliner, and lipstick, black nail varnish, spiked bracelets and dog-collars, black clothing (often made of gabardine), and leather or velvet <b>trimmed</b> <b>in</b> lace or fishnet material. Corsets were often worn by girls. British bands that inspired the gothic trend include The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Cult. This trend would return in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|The Knicks would {{introduce}} an iconic logo that would endure {{for the next}} three decades. Designed by Bud Freeman, the word 'Knicks' superimposed over a brown basketball is known as the 'Classic Roundball Logo', with minor changes throughout its lifespan such as maroon wordmark and orange basketball. An alternate logo featuring the full team name inside an orange basketball was used during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. As the 1960s began, the Knicks updated their uniforms again. This time the lettering is in serifed fonts, and the blue lettering and numbers on the home uniforms are now <b>trimmed</b> <b>in</b> orange, while on the away uniforms it is in monotone white. Side stripes were also added to the uniform. The 'NY' monogram is on the left leg of the shorts.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{a series}} script {{appeared}} on the front fenders and the white Tenelite steering wheel {{that had been used}} previously was traded in for a black one, in order match the change from a two-tone woodgrain instrument panel to a two-tone gray instrument panel, with silver tone instruments. A new optional custom trim option was offered, consisting of cloth upholstery with leather bolsters with the robe cord cover and lower door panels <b>trimmed</b> <b>in</b> leatherette. Convertibles acquired power windows, seat and top as standard equipment. But the biggest advancement was the introduction of Dynaflow, the first passenger car torque converter transmission. Optional on Roadmaster in its first year, it was so popular that by the following it was standard equipment. Overall sales were just under 80,000 in both 1947 and 1948, over four times greater than in any prewar year.|$|E
25|$|On September 19, 2012, the Spurs {{unveiled}} a silver alternate uniform. In breaking {{from the traditional}} practice of placing the team or city name in front, the Spurs' new uniform features only the stylized spur logo, with the black number <b>trimmed</b> <b>in</b> white and silver on the upper right. The Spurs primary logo is atop the player name and number on the back (replaced by the NBA logo prior to the 2014–15 season), while the Eurostile 'SA' initials (for San Antonio) are on the left leg of the shorts. Black, silver and white side stripes are also featured on the uniform. The uniforms are worn for select home games. A variation of this uniform, featuring military camouflage patterns {{instead of the usual}} silver, was used for two games in the 2013–14 season; a sleeved version was used the next season. Another variation, this time in black, was unveiled for the 2015–16 season.|$|E
50|$|The DeVille {{received}} a facelift for the 1997 model year, and added the d'Elegance trim line {{to replace the}} Cadillac Fleetwood. The name was shortened from Sedan DeVille to simply DeVille. New headlights and a new grille were added, the rear wheel skirts were removed, the interior was redesigned, and the black/chrome trim {{was replaced by a}} double chrome <b>trim</b> <b>in</b> the base DeVille, chrome and gold <b>trim</b> <b>in</b> the d'Elegance, and chrome and body colored <b>trim</b> <b>in</b> the Concours. The Concours received real-time damping and Integrated Chassis Control System ICCS as standard. The interior gained a new dashboard design that hid the passenger airbag seams and new door panels with front side-airbags and the availability of OnStar system. Production of this generation ended in July 1999.|$|R
