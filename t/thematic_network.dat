40|$|Objectives: to {{describe}} a ‘hearts and minds’ approach to community Baby Friendly Initiative implementation developed from the views of multidisciplinary professionals. Design: a qualitative descriptive study utilising focus groups and interviews, with <b>thematic</b> <b>networks</b> Analysis conducted. Setting: forty-seven professionals were consulted from two primary health-care facilities located in the North-West of England. Findings: <b>thematic</b> <b>networks</b> analysis generated a global theme of a ‘hearts and mind sapproach’ to BFI implementation, which embodies emotional and rational engagement. The three underpinning organising themes (and their associated basic themes) : ‘credible leadership’, ‘engagement of key partners’ and ‘changing attitudes and practice’ reflect the context, processes and outcomes of a ‘hearts and minds’ approach. Conclusions and implications for practice: a ‘hearts and minds’ approach transcends the prescriptive aspects of a macro-level intervention with its emphasis upon audits, training, statistics and ‘hard’ evidence through valuing other professionals and engaging staff at all levels. It offers insights into how organisational change may move beyond traditional top-down mechanisms for driving change to incorporate ways that value others and promote cooperation and reflection...|$|R
