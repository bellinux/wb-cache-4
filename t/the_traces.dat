In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather <b>the</b> <b>traces</b> of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E

Like many leftists at the time, he believed that fascism was a temporary, extreme expression of capitalist society that would soon be overcome by socialism. He nevertheless expressed admiration for the German archaeological establishment under the Nazi government, highlighting that the British state lagged far behind in terms of funding excavations and encouraging the study of archaeology in universities; he refrained from commenting on the political agenda that the Nazis had in promoting archaeology.|$|E

40|$|In the {{system-on-chip}} (SOC) debugging {{and performance}} analysis/optimization, monitoring the on-chip bus signals are necessary. But, such signals {{are difficult to}} observe since they are deeply embedded in a SOC and no sufficient I/O pins to access those signals. Therefore, we embed a bus tracer in SOC to capture the bus signals and store them. <b>The</b> stored <b>trace</b> memory can be loaded to <b>the</b> <b>trace</b> analyzer software for analysis. In this paper, we propose an embedded multi-resolution AMBA trace analyzer that provides the trade-off between <b>the</b> <b>trace</b> granularity and <b>the</b> <b>trace</b> depth. It consists of two major <b>trace</b> approaches: (1) <b>the</b> signal monitor/tracing which provides the levels of. Abstraction, and (2) <b>the</b> <b>trace</b> reduction. In <b>the</b> first approach, it allows designers to zoom-in/out to preferred level of abstraction to serve different debugging purposes In the second approach, <b>the</b> <b>trace</b> analyzer compresses <b>the</b> <b>traced</b> data according to signal characteristics {{and the cost of}} on-chip storage is reduced. <b>The</b> <b>trace</b> data will be decompressed on the host for further observation and debugging.
