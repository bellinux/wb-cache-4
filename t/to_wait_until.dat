5|$|After {{evaluating}} the imagery sent {{down from the}} late inspection, the ground team officially cleared the orbiter's thermal protection system for re-entry. Initially, NASA had planned on releasing Endeavour from its stand-by status following the late inspection, but managers on the ground decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> Atlantis had performed the de-orbit burn before standing down the STS-400 rescue mission officially.|$|E
5|$|After {{using the}} plot of the aborted 1884 {{collaboration}} with Archer to complete Widowers' Houses (it was staged twice in London, in December 1892), Shaw continued writing plays. At first he made slow progress; The Philanderer, written in 1893 but not published until 1898, had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 1905 for a stage production. Similarly, Mrs Warren's Profession (1893) was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage.|$|E
50|$|On {{board the}} Enterprise, {{gameplay}} basically amounts <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> the ship arrives at its next destination, and occasionally conversing with various crewmembers for advice.

5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} {{over whether the}} object would be classified as a planet or a minor planet, because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects, the decision on what to name the object had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> after the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling. As a result, for a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, RFC 1738 {{formally}} defined relative {{and absolute}} URLs, refined the general URL syntax, defined how to resolve relative URLs to absolute form, and better enumerated the URL schemes then in use. The agreed definition and syntax of URNs had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> {{the publication of}} RFC 2141 in May 1997.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that the beta decay of 239Np must produce an isotope of element 94 (now called plutonium), but the quantities involved in McMillan and Abelson's original experiment were too small to isolate and identify plutonium along with neptunium. The discovery of plutonium had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the end of 1940, when Glenn T. Seaborg and his team identified the isotope plutonium-238.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Woodfull {{was being}} {{encouraged}} to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack, not least {{by members of}} his own side such as Vic Richardson, or to include pace bowlers such as Eddie Gilbert or Laurie Nash to match the aggression of the opposition. But Woodfull refused to consider doing so. He had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{supported}} The New York Times in its 1971 {{suit against}} the government, requesting permission to publish the Pentagon papers. The court upheld the Times and ACLU in the New York Times Co. v.

5|$|The {{spirit of}} peace and {{reconciliation}} established by the Dictum of Kenilworth lasted {{for the remainder of}} Henry III's reign and into the 1290s. In 1270, Prince Edward left the country to go on crusade in the Holy Land. When his father died in 1272, Edward felt in a safe enough position <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 1274 before returning home to claim the throne.|$|E
50|$|The pad can be reused {{by placing}} it in boiling water for 10-15 minutes, which redissolves the sodium acetate trihydrate in the {{contained}} water and recreates a supersaturated solution. Once the pad has returned to room temperature it can be triggered again. Triggering the pad before it has reached room temperature results in the pad reaching a lower peak temperature, as compared <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> it had completely cooled.|$|R

5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the next election season.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E

5|$|Brigadier General J.F.K. Mansfield, {{commander}} of the Department of Washington, argued that Northern Virginia should be occupied {{as soon as possible}} in order to prevent the possibility of the Confederate Army mounting artillery on the hills of Arlington and shelling government buildings in Washington. He also urged the erection of fortifications on the Virginia side of the Potomac River to protect the southern terminuses of the Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge. His superiors approved these recommendations, but decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> after Virginia voted for or against secession.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{promising}} start Reid failed {{to recapture the}} form he had shown at Forest and had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> May before netting for his new club, coming against Aston Villa in a 5–1 win {{at the end of}} the season. Making only 20 starts in 26 appearances he scored just one goal for Tottenham leading him to be listed by one journalist as one of the worst signings of the January Transfer market.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{departure}} from Luton, Whalley joined Shrewsbury Town, recently promoted to League One, on 6 June 2015. Making only sporadic substitute {{appearances in the}} early part of the season, Whalley had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 28 December to make his first league start for the club, scoring a late winning goal in a 2–1 away victory over Crewe Alexandra. He scored another late winner away at the league-leaders Burton Albion the following month, eventually ending the season with seven goals in all competitions as Shrewsbury avoided relegation with a game to spare.|$|E
5|$|Her {{armament}} {{arrived in}} Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work {{needed to be done}} on the armament, but it had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E
5|$|In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's {{stability}} {{continued to}} attract manpower {{from the surrounding}} regions, especially after 1533 when the Confederation sacked its erstwhile ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the larger kingdoms' attention turned to him.|$|E
