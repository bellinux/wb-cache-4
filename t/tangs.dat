500|$|Woon was {{the first}} Attorney-General in {{more than ten years}} to {{personally}} appear in court. On 28 July 2008, he argued before the Court of Appeal that a woman who had manipulated her teenage lover into killing her husband should be given a life sentence. The Court held that a life sentence was inappropriate due to the defendant's psychiatric condition, and affirmed the nine-year jail term imposed by the High Court. Woon elected to take proceedings against Tang Wee Sung, chairman of the company C.K. Tang which owns <b>Tangs</b> department store, for the illegal purchase of a human organ– a kidney– in the first case of its kind in Singapore. The decision to do so was criticised by Dr. Lee Wei Ling, Director of the National Neuroscience Institute and daughter of Minister Mentor and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in an article published in The Straits Times on 5 September 2008. Woon replied, pointing out a number of misconceptions she held as to the facts and the law, and emphasising that the prosecution had been brought as no one was above the law. Subsequently, in response to further comments by Dr. Lee, he wrote an extended article entitled [...] "Wrong Facts and Faulty Logic" [...] that appeared in The Straits Times on 18 September 2008.|$|E

2500|$|The handle, used to {{grip and}} {{manipulate}} the blade safely, may include a tang, {{a portion of}} the blade that extends into the handle. Knives are made with partial <b>tangs</b> (extending part way into the handle, known as [...] "stick tangs") or full <b>tangs</b> (extending the full length of the handle, often visible on top and bottom). The handle may include a bolster, a piece of heavy material (usually metal) situated at the front or rear of the handle. The bolster, as its name suggests, is used to mechanically strengthen the knife.|$|E
2500|$|In a [...] "full" [...] tang (most {{commonly}} used in knives and machetes), the tang has about the same width as the blade, and is generally the same shape as the grip. In European or Asian swords sold today, many advertised [...] "full" [...] <b>tangs</b> may actually involve a forged rat-tail tang.|$|E

2500|$|The Model 620 was {{introduced}} in 1927 and is a streamlined version of the original 520. [...] The safety was initially located inside the trigger housing just like the Model 520 but by 1929 it had been changed to a cross-bolt located behind the trigger. [...] The stock was attached by a bolt connecting the receiver and trigger <b>tangs</b> through {{the grip of the}} stock. [...] Initially the 620 was only offerd in 12 gauge but a 16 gauge followed in 1928 and a 20 gauge {{was introduced}} in 1930.|$|E
2500|$|The Model 620A began {{production}} in 1940. [...] The main {{difference between the}} 620 and the 620A was how the stock attaches.

[...] Without the trigger tang, a flat main spring had no place to attach and the 620A had a shortened trigger housing using a coil main spring.

2500|$|In 1984, a Beaker period copper dagger blade was {{recovered}} from the Sillees River near Ross Lough, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. The flat, triangular-shaped copper blade was [...] long, with bevelled edges and a pointed tip, and featured an integral tang that accepted a riveted handle. Flint arrow-heads and copper-blade daggers with handle <b>tangs,</b> found in association with Beaker pottery in {{many other parts of}} Europe, have a date later than the initial phase of Beaker People activity in Ireland. Also the typical Beaker wristguards seem to have entered Ireland by cultural diffusion only, after the first intrusions, and unlike English and Continental Beaker burials never made it to the graves. The same lack of typical Beaker association applies to the about thirty found stone battle axes. A gold ornament found in County Down that closely resembles a pair of ear-rings from Ermegeira, Portugal, has a composition that suggests it was imported. Incidental finds suggest links to non-British Beaker territories, like a fragment of a bronze blade in County Londonderry that has been likened to the [...] "palmella" [...] points of Iberia, even though the relative scarcity of beakers, and Beaker-compatible material of any kind, in the south-west are regarded as an obstacle to any colonisation directly from Iberia, or even from France. Their greater concentration {{in the northern part of}} the country, which traditionally is regarded as the part of Ireland least blessed with sources of copper, has led many authorities to question the role of Beaker People in the introduction of metallurgy to Ireland. However, indications of their use of stream sediment copper, low in traces of lead and arsenic, and Beaker finds connected to mining and metalworking at Ross Island, County Kerry, provide an escape to such doubts.|$|E
