40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} determine the tax effort and tax capacity of 96 countries and the main variables from which they depend. The results and the model allow us to clearly determine which countries are near their tax capacity and which are some way from it, and therefore, could increase their tax revenue. Our study corroborates previous analysis inasmuch as the positive and significant relationship between tax revenue as percent of GDP {{and the level of}} development (per capita GDP), trade (imports and exports as percent of GDP) and education (public expenditure on education as percent of GDP). The study also demonstrates the negative relationship between tax revenue and inflation (CPI), income distribution (GINI coefficient), the ease of tax collection (agricultural sector value added as GDP percent), and corruption. tax effort, <b>tax</b> <b>frontier,</b> tax capacity, tax revenue, stochastic <b>tax</b> <b>frontier,</b> inefficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|Taxation is an {{important}} tool to enhance the economic development and to finance the expenditure responsibilities of a government. This paper attempts to measure the tax capacity and tax effort of 14 major Indian states from 1992 - 92 to 2010 - 11 using Stochastic Frontier Analysis. The use of tax capacity frontier helps to identify those states which are operating near their tax capacity and states which are away from <b>tax</b> <b>frontier.</b> The results indicate presence of large variation in tax effort index across states and {{which seems to be}} increasing over time. Econometric analysis suggests that economic and structural variables have significant impact on the tax capacity. While per-capita gross state domestic product has positive effect on states ' own tax revenue, relative size of agriculture sector of a state has adverse effect on its own tax revenue. The evidence on tax efficiency suggests that the higher inter-governmental transfers tend to reduce tax efficiency. Outstanding liabilities and expenditure on debt repayment also indicate adverse effect on tax efficiency, but the adverse effect of the latter is lesser than the former. Enactment of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act seems to have improved the tax efficiency which has been further strengthened by the better law and order inside states. Higher political competition inside a state, represented by effective number of parties, ha...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a simple Logistic {{relationship between the}} relative size of the Hidden Economy in New Zealand, and the effective tax rates for the major tax components. The model that we estimate from annual time-series data is used to simulate the effects of changes in both the overall tax "burden", and in the tax "mix", {{on the size of}} the Hidden Economy as a percentage of measured GDP in that country. At recent taxation levels, we find that for every percentage point reduction in the tax/GDP ratio, the Hidden Economy/GDP ratio drops by about 0. 2 percentage points. We also find that the latter ratio is very responsive to changes in the tax "mix" in favour of relatively more indirect taxation; and that at an effective tax rate of about 21 % of GDP, the impact of tax changes on underground activity begins to decelerate. The latter results suggests a <b>tax</b> evasion-efficient <b>frontier</b> for the tax/GDP ratio in New Zealand. Hidden Economy, Underground Economy, Tax Evasion, Tax Gap...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} {{economic}} and fiscal impacts in Canada of the exploration tax credit introduced in December 1985. It has examined such issues as the extent of exploration directly attributable to the credit, {{the cost of the}} credit to the federal government in forgone tax revenue, the impact of the credit on findings of undiscovered resources, {{and the degree to which}} the credit has accomplished its original objectives. The analysis concludes that the exploration tax credit has provided little stimulus to exploration activity in the oil and gas industry due to the fact that exploration costs are a small percentage of overall costs in most offshore oil and gas projects, offshore oil and gas projects are highly risky, and the exploration tax credit is moderate and taxes are only one of the factors for budget exploration by many companies. Moreover, the incentive seemed not to be introduced solely out of concern about exploration in Canada. Providing assistance to accompany the phasing out of the Petroleum Incentives Program was indeed a main objective. exploration <b>tax</b> credit, <b>frontier</b> energy policy, oil and gas, offshore drilling, cost effectiveness, incrementality...|$|R
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} the excise law also caused concern. The law {{required}} all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 {{miles away from the}} small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey <b>tax</b> along the <b>frontier.</b> Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident Federal tax official.|$|R
40|$|Progressivity in both {{marginal}} {{and average}} tax rates {{seems to be}} a universal phenomenon. Yet the optimal taxation literature does not, by and large, imply progressivity and most of the investigations of politically determined tax schedules deal with linear taxation. This paper considers the determination of the tax structure by majority rule when tax schedules are characterized by three parameters and individuals differ in ability. It is shown that if the rankings of income and of ability always coincide the set of schedules preferred by the individual with median ability is contained in the set of local majority winning schedules. Under some additional restrictions this result is extended to any (global) movement along the <b>tax</b> possibility <b>frontier.</b> The paper uses this result to demonstrate that the existence of both marginal and average progressivity of tax schedules can be explained as the outcome of a majority voting process in which the median individual is pivotal with respect to the tax schedule chosen by the political process. Marginal progressivity is more likely the stronger the right hand skewness and the larger the variance in the distribution of abilities. It is also more likely if the labor supply response to increased tax burdens of high ability individuals is smaller in absolute value than that of low ability individuals. The paper also discusses conditions for uniqueness of the tax schedule...|$|R
40|$|A {{country needs}} {{stronger}} incentives to increase exploration investment in high-risk isolated frontier and deepwater areas. Tax consolidation {{is one of}} the possible incentives to raise exploration investment level in those <b>frontier</b> areas. <b>Tax</b> consolidation means that expenditures of non-producing contract(s) can be deducted from the income of producing contracts of the same contractor(s) for determination of taxable income. From the government point of view, the application of tax consolidation represents its current investment for future income. In this study, risk analysis of the application of <b>tax</b> consolidation in <b>frontier</b> areas was taken with Monte Carlo simulation to identify its impact on the Government of Indonesia (GOI) income and on the profitability of contractor as well as quantifying the risk involves respectively. The result showed, that from contractor’s financial aspect, tax consolidation was more attractive incentive compared to increase in production sharing split. On the other hand, it was less attractive to the GOI, not only because it reduced GOI’s NPV, but it also posed high risk to the GOI...|$|R
40|$|Russell Cooper and Andrew John {{have written}} an {{economics}} text aimed directly at students from its very inception. You’re thinking, ”Yeah, sure. I’ve heard that before. “ This textbook, Economics: Theory Through Applications, centers around student needs and expectations through two premises: …	Students {{are motivated to}} study economics if they see that it relates to their own lives. …	Students learn best from an inductive approach, {{in which they are}} first confronted with a problem, and then led through the process of solving that problem. Many books claim to present economics {{in a way that is}} digestible for students; Russell and Andrew have truly created one from scratch. This textbook will assist you in increasing students’ economic literacy both by developing their aptitude for economic thinking and by presenting key insights about economics that every educated individual should know. How? Russell and Andrew have done three things in this text to accomplish that goal: 1. Applications Ahead of Theory: They present all the theory that is standard in Principles books. But by beginning with applications, students get to learn why this theory is needed. The authors take the kind of material that other authors put in ”applications boxes“ and place it at the heart of their book. Each chapter is built around a particular business or policy application, such as (for microeconomics) minimum wages, the stock exchange, and auctions, and (for macroeconomics), social security, globalization, and the wealth and poverty of nations. Why take this approach? Traditional courses focus too much on abstract theory relative to the interests and capabilities of the average undergraduate. Students are rarely engaged and the formal theory is never integrated into the way students think about economic issues. And traditional books are organized around theoretical constructs that mean nothing to students. The authors’ applications-first approach ensures that students will not see chapters with titles like ”Cost Functions“ or ”Short-Run Fluctuations“. They introduce tools and ideas as and when they are needed. Each chapter is designed with two goals. First, the application upon which the chapter is built provides a ”hook“ that gets students’ attention. Second, the application is a suitable vehicle a vehicle for teaching the principles of economics. 2. Learning through Repetition: Important tools appear over and over again, allowing students to learn from repetition and to see how one framework can be useful in many different contexts. Each piece of economic theory in this text is first introduced and explained in the context of a specific application. Most are re-used in other chapters, so students see them in action on multiple occasions. As students progress through the book, they accumulate a set of techniques and ideas. These are collected separately in a ”toolkit“ that provides students with an easy reference and also gives them a condensed summary of economic principles for examination preparation. 3. A Student’s Table of Contents vs. An Instructor’s Table of Contents: There is no further proof that Russell and Andrew have created a book aimed specifically at educating students about economics than their two tables of contents. The Student’s Table of Contents speaks to students, piquing their interest to involve them in the economics, and a Instructor’s Table of Contents with the economics to better help you organize your teaching—and frankly, you don’t need to get excited by economics, you already are.
