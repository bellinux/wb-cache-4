5|$|Taoism {{tends to}} {{emphasize}} various <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> I Ching, the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, detachment from desires, {{and most important}} of all, wu wei.

5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E
5|$|Each poem {{has five}} {{sections}}. The later poems {{connect to the}} earlier sections, with Little Gidding synthesising the <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier poems within its sections.

50|$|The minuet is in strict danceable form. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minuet is a {{variation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first movement — one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most explicit examples of cyclic form in Haydn's work.|$|R
5|$|Opposition to class, {{death and}} its impacts, {{experiencing}} adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry's consideration {{and respect for}} others extends to the lowly, non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick. According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.|$|E
5|$|Paine's creed encapsulates many of {{the major}} <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a {{skepticism}} regarding most supernatural claims (here the afterlife, later in the text, miracles); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and {{an emphasis on the}} individual's right of conscience.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{growth and}} forms of heroism are central <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story, along with motifs of warfare.

The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finale {{is almost}} {{directly}} borrowed from <b>the</b> finale <b>of</b> his earlier string trio, Op. 9, No. 3 in C minor; the themes are very closely related. <b>The</b> principal <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first movement echoes that of Haydn's Opus 50, No. 1 quartet.|$|R

5|$|The {{illustrations}} and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass that {{of other}} Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, together with Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major illustrations.|$|E
