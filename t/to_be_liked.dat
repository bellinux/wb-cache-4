It has been reported that Barlow based her portrayal of Mavis on a woman she had seen working in Granada studios (where Coronation Street is filmed) as well as [...] "dozens of northern women she had seen battered into submission by worry". [...] Discussing the woman who inspired Mavis's characterisation, Barlow said, [...] "She had a strong core, but didn't show it. She was desperate <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> but she didn't want to appear pushy." ...|$|E
500|$|In Stage three (good {{intentions}} {{as determined}} by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They {{try to be a}} [...] "good boy" [...] or [...] "good girl" [...] to live up to these expectations, having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the [...] "golden rule". [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." [...] Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that [...] "they mean well".|$|E
500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked.</b> You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E

500|$|In 1930, Grant toured {{for nine}} months in a {{production}} of the musical, The Street Singer. After the production came to end in early 1931, the Shuberts invited him to spend the summer performing on the stage at The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri; he appeared in twelve different productions, putting on 87 shows. He received praise from local newspapers for these performances, gaining {{a reputation as a}} romantic leading man. Significant influences on his acting in this period were Sir Gerald du Maurier, A. E. Matthews, Jack Buchanan and Ronald Squire. He later admitted that he was drawn to acting because of a [...] "great need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> and admired". Grant was eventually fired by the Shuberts {{at the end of the}} summer season when he refused to accept a pay cut because of financial difficulties caused by the Depression. His unemployment was short lived; impresario William B. Friedlander offered him the lead romantic part in his new musical, Nikki, in which Grant starred opposite Fay Wray as a soldier in post-World War I France. The production opened on September 29, 1931 in New York, but was stopped after just 39 performances due to the effects of the Depression.|$|E
500|$|Body Talk Pt. 2 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 76, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Jaime Gill of BBC Music called the album a [...] "brief, brilliant record that leaves you panting, Body Talk, Part 2 {{is the latest}} evidence that Robyn is probably the best, most versatile pop star currently at work." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine referred to the album as [...] "pretty fucking fantastic", despite stating that it was [...] "a minor letdown following the near-perfection of its predecessor". Tom Ewing of The Guardian said that [...] "the second episode [...] has a different flavour from the first." [...] Ewing named [...] "U Should Know Better" [...] the best song on the record, calling it the [...] "unlikeliest success". In contrast, he considered [...] "Criminal Intent" [...] the worst song, but said that [...] "even that has a lovely, draggy vibe." [...] Dan Martin of the NME wrote that the album [...] "doesn't quite end with a severed hand, but it does swing a little lower with an awesomeness that tries less hard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> straight away." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is {{assigned}} {{six hours of}} counseling with Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) after he physically reprimanded his nephew Luke (Evan Peters) in [...] "Nepotism", but Michael refuses to speak to Toby. One hour into their session, Toby tells Michael {{that he will not}} fill in the official assessment form unless Michael talks to him, so Michael begins telling ridiculous stories. Toby then tries the common counseling method of playing games with the client to get them to open up more. The method works, and Michael opens up to Toby about his personal history and relationships with people (he mentions seeing a baseball game with his stepfather where he was told that the team's manager deserved respect and how he never forgot that), and Toby makes an important discovery that Michael needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked.</b> Michael realizes what is happening, gets angry at Toby, and denigrates his counseling ability. Toby gives up and gives Michael the official form, allowing him to fill it out however he wants. In his haste, Michael accidentally checks off on the form that he is severely depressed and homicidal. Gabe contacts Toby, confused by his extreme assessment of Michael. Although Michael initially blames Toby for the mishap, he turns his ire to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), even making Toby laugh. Michael openly offers to return to the break room with Toby and [...] "bang this out". At the end of the episode, they are both talking and drawing pictures.|$|E

He for instance noted that while in Pakistan she presented herself as a conservative Muslim [...] who always wore her head covered, while as a student in Oxford she adopted a more liberal lifestyle, tending to wear a T-shirt and jeans and occasionally drinking wine. Muñoz concurred, describing Bhutto as [...] "a woman of contradictions". As a politician, she was conscious of how her image was presented in Pakistan; she dressed modestly, was never photographed with a glass lest it be interpreted as containing alcohol, and would refuse to shake men's hands.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{considered}} the possibility {{at the end of}} the second season, Cleese left the Flying Circus {{at the end of the}} third. He later explained that he felt he no longer had anything fresh to offer the show, and claimed that only two Cleese- and Chapman-penned sketches in the third series ("Dennis Moore" [...] and the [...] "Cheese Shop") were truly original, and that the others were bits and pieces from previous work cobbled together in slightly different contexts. He was also finding Chapman, who was at that point in the full throes of alcoholism, difficult to work with. According to an interview with Idle, [...] "It was on an Air Canada flight on the way to Toronto, when John (Cleese) turned to all of us and said 'I want out.' Why? I don't know. He gets bored more easily than the rest of us. He's a difficult man, not easy to be friendly with.

2500|$|In early 1967, Disney {{released}} Mosby's Marauders, a now mostly forgotten but successful Civil War drama {{told from}} a southern perspective with Adams {{in the role}} of a cruel Union army sergeant. Adams guest-starred in five episodes of four TV series that year, including an installment of his friend Robert Conrad's The Wild Wild West, an appearance in Combat! and two episodes of Hondo (a short-lived western which also had an ex-Confederate theme). Throughout 1967 and early 1968 he also worked in three low-budget films. One of these was Mission Mars (1968) which has been described as [...] "rarely seen, and utterly dreadful." [...] Adams' costume for this movie included an off-the-shelf motorcycle helmet. Reacting to Mission Mars over 30 years later, SciFi reviewer Gary Westfahl wrote, [...] "The only quality that Adams could persuasively project on film was a desperate desire to be popular, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked...</b> which helps to explain why Adams got his foot in many doors." [...] Adams' last U.S. production was a more solid B picture, a movie filmed in Iowa called Fever Heat. His last film appearance was in the little-seen Spanish-language western Los Asesinos, filmed in Mexico City, Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{was widely}} {{considered}} {{by those who}} knew him as a likeable and friendly person; a person who wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked.</b> He said of himself when appointed captain of Australia, [...] "The one thing in my favour is that I will never change. I hope I will always be a likeable enough, easy-to-get-along-with type of person." [...] His biographer noted, [...] "riends, team-mates, coaches, teachers, officials, close observers. Almost all mentioned Kim's niceness. He addresses people by their first name. He loves being around and encouraging children. He likes being people's best friend." [...] As captain Hughes was popular and obliging with the press and the public. English journalist Frank Keating said [...] "Pulled this way and that by photographers, fringers, high commissioners, low commissioners, book commissioners, and hall-porter commissioners, [...] never stopped being softly obliging." [...] The journalist Adrian McGregor said of Hughes, [...] "He was almost too amenable, too nice a guy. He was great with the media, would answer all sorts of questions, never told people to piss off. [...] It was almost like he didn't have the appropriate personality [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|At the Elimination Chamber {{event and}} on the {{following}} Raw, Batista was heavily booed by the fans during matches against Del Rio. Batista won the match at Elimination Chamber, but continued to suffer a torrid fan reaction with [...] "Boo-tista" [...] chants. Batista responded to the audience on the February 28 episode of SmackDown, saying {{that he did not}} come back <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked,</b> then mocked the other wrestlers by stating that they were not [...] "real men" [...] and promised to be the next WWE World Heavyweight Champion, thus turning heel. After Orton retained his title at the Elimination Chamber, the scheduled WrestleMania XXX main event was Batista vs. Orton, however Bryan was added to the match after defeating Triple H in the opening contest of the show. Batista ultimately lost the triple threat match at WrestleMania after Bryan forced him to submit to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. The next night on Raw, Batista and Orton teamed together to face The Usos for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but the match ended in a double count out. Later that night, Batista and Orton, along with Kane, attacked Bryan before he was set to defend his title against Triple H. Before Triple H could defeat Bryan, The Shield interrupted by spearing Triple H and taking out Batista, Orton and Kane, causing Bryan to retain his title via disqualification. On the April 14 episode of Raw, Batista, Triple H and Randy Orton came down to the ring to attack The Shield after their 11-on-3 handicap match, using the name and the theme of Evolution. At both Extreme Rules and Payback, Evolution lost to The Shield. On the June 2 episode of Raw, Batista quit WWE after Triple H denied him a shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. After the episode, he made one last appearance for WWE at an NXT event on June 12, cutting a promo with Bo Dallas before attacking him with a spinebuster. Batista legitimately quit the WWE due to creative differences soon after.|$|E
