5|$|After {{appearing}} in 12 {{games for the}} Tigers in 1913 and playing {{in the minor leagues}} in 1914, he was purchased by the Yankees before the 1915 season. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> their starting first baseman. He and Home Run Baker led an improved Yankee lineup that led the league in home runs. He led the American League in home runs in 1916 and 1917. With Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Joe Dugan, and Waite Hoyt, the Yankees won three consecutive American League pennants from 1921 through 1923, and won the 1923 World Series. In 1925, he lost his starting role to Lou Gehrig, after which he finished his major league career with Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|Numerous colleges showed {{interest}} and recruited Heyward, including UCLA, which offered a full-ride scholarship {{due in part}} to the family connection. Heyward was also especially interested in Clemson and Georgia Tech. Concurrently, the hometown Atlanta Braves had followed and scouted him for years, while attempting to conceal their excitement. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the 14th overall selection in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. Despite signing a National Letter of Intent with UCLA, Heyward chose professional baseball over college and signed a contract with them worth $1.7 million – $170,000 more than MLB's slot recommendation of $1.53 million on the following August 12. It was the same as the 2006 14th-slot amount that the Toronto Blue Jays gave Travis Snider.|$|E

He was {{attached}} to the 14th Light Armoured Motor Battery of the Machine Gun Corps, but the British High Command decided they could not risk his life and so <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> an officer in charge of transport (Ford Model T cars). Within months of being posted to Mesopotamia, he mastered spoken as well as written Arabic and was often relied upon as a translator with the locals. He was awarded a Military Cross on August 26, 1918.|$|E
25|$|The {{second meeting}} in New York was {{attended}} by Levine, Bellanca, and Chamberlin. With check in hand, Levine added a stipulation that Columbia Aircraft would select the crew on the flight, which Lindbergh objected to. Reminding Lindbergh that the WB-2 was the only plane that could make the flight at the time, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> leave and call {{back the next day}} to reconsider. The terms did not change, and Lindbergh returned to St. Louis without an airplane. Lindbergh then approached Travel Air Manufacturing Company, asking for a Travel Air 5000 modified with a Wright Whirlwind motor and was declined. Lindbergh also inquired what it would cost to buy a Fokker for the attempt; he was given a quote of $100,000 for a custom trimotor, and was told that Fokker would not build a single-engine craft for a transatlantic flight. Lindbergh instead purchased a single-place aircraft from Ryan aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, for $6000.|$|E
25|$|The Jat power made rapid {{progress}} {{during his}} leadership. Essentially Machiavellian in approach, he could change postures {{to serve his}} end. An implacable rebel {{till the end of}} Aurangzeb’s reign, he later found it convenient to profess loyalty to the Mughal throne. In turn he, for the first time, gained the royal favours. But he reverted to his old ways and tried to fish in troubled waters during the reign of Farrukh Siyar. Efforts at his suppression were tried but failed and in the end Churaman received additional concessions. However, the concessions offered from a position of apparent helplessness defeated their very objective. Instead of making Churaman sincerely loyal, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> conscious of his mischief potential and thus eventually whetted his contumacious designs. Side by side the dictates of self-interest drew him closer to the mighty Sayyids and the latter themselves, for reasons already explained extended their support to churaman to the point of infuriating Farrukh Siya. With the Emperor demanding his annihilation and the Wazir and the Mir Bakhshi offering him full protection, the Jat problem in general and Churaman’s case in particulars assumed interesting dimension.|$|E

500|$|In a 2005 {{lecture at}} Harvard after Jackson's trial, Jackson's {{attorney}} Thomas Mesereau said the following about Jordan Chandler: [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get}} him to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] In 2006, Jordan accused Evan of attacking him with a barbell, choking him and spraying his face with Mace. The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} intended Cheers to be {{a comedy}} about a comedy itself set in the Boston bar, but, as Burrows claimed, the [...] "Sam and Diane" [...] story arc predominated the show for five years and, as he hypothesized, {{would have made the}} bar more of a minor role and more irrelevant if Shelley Long had not left the show as Diane Chambers in 1987. With Diane written out in [...] "I Do, Adieu" [...] and Long departing the series, the producers planned to revamp the show's format without losing the bar, which has been their choice of intent, and then was relieved that the series would survive without Shelley Long. As Les Charles observed, Sam was a [...] "straight man" [...] to Diane; with Diane gone, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> more [...] "carefree" [...] and a [...] "goof-off." ...|$|E

He's played 300 matches and scored from the halfway line the other month, but Forest say he has an eyesight problem. The whole thing stinks. Alex McLeish wanted to sign him. It's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to me." [...] Peterborough subsequently said that with Boyd's contract expiring in the summer, they would be prepared to offer him a new contract or let him leave on loan when the emergency loan window opened, with at least one club having signalled their interest in doing so.|$|E

[...] He said that he found it exciting and weird to work with the EastEnders cast, but <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> feel comfortable. However, he admitted to feeling nervous about having to dance in front of professional dance group Flawless in the series finale, saying that learning to dance was [...] "very, very, very stressful." [...] The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved.

500|$|The {{character}} Grossberg's {{design was}} changed for Trials and Tribulations, with his brown suit {{changed to a}} red one: this was because the Game Boy Advance system's screen made his previous design blend in too much with the brown courtroom. Iwamoto based the design of Godot on Rutger Hauer's role in Blade Runner. He was originally going to be depicted as drinking bourbon whiskey and smoking, {{as part of his}} [...] "hard-boiled" [...] image; when the development team realized that this could have a bad influence on children, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> drink coffee instead. As Takumi and Hideki Kamiya had joined Capcom around the same time and had desks near each other, Kamiya had asked Takumi for a voice role ever since the development of Justice for All; eventually, Takumi gave him the role of Godot. Takumi explained the role as a hard-boiled guy, so Kamiya decided to adapt the dialogue and shout [...] "Objection, baby!". Takumi said {{that it was a good}} take, but that the in-game graphics just say [...] "Objection!", so it could not be used.|$|E
500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't.

It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had npt spoken to her son in 11 years. At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that she had never heard of her own attorney. However, she said she never witnessed any molestation.|$|E

500|$|... "Practice Date" [...] {{marked a}} turning point for the {{character}} Jerry. Prior to the episode, Jerry had appeared in every episode, but his personality had not yet been developed. Schur said the Parks and Recreation staff liked Jim O'Heir, so they cast him in the show and [...] "figured we'd work it out later". After the scene when Mark inadvertently reveals Jerry was adopted, the writers built upon that joke and established Jerry as the co-worker the rest of the department picks on. Schur said after [...] "Practice Date", [...] "We realized that's who he is: He's the guy who wants to put his head down and get his pension, but is asking for it all the time. In the next three scripts, it was like throwing chum into the water. Every script after that had 15 slams on Jerry. [...] "Practice Date" [...] marked the first of several appearances by Jay Jackson as Pawnee news reporter Perd Hapley. The character was only originally intended for one appearance, but Schur said the staff enjoyed his performance so much that <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a recurring character.|$|E
500|$|Particularly-negative reviews {{included}} that of The New York Times Elvis Mitchell, {{who said}} the film was [...] "second-rate and ordinary," [...] while Variety's Todd McCarthy considered it [...] "a pretender {{in the realm of}} bona-fide superheroes." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "C-", criticizing the story as [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "slipshod", saying, [...] "Daredevil is the sort of half-assed, visually-lackadaisical potboiler that makes you rue the day that comic-book franchises ever took over Hollywood." [...] Time Outs Trevor Johnston praised Ben Affleck, feeling he [...] "persuades us of the pain of sightlessness and supersensitive hearing," [...] but also felt writer/director Johnson's construction fails all involved in the film. Slates David Edelstein believed Johnson copied a lot of Batman, and concluded by saying [...] "that's not so bad: The movie looks best when it looks like other, better movies." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Wilmington thought the film grabs the attention, but felt it does not reward it. The New York Posts Lou Lumenick panned the film, describing it as a [...] "mind-numbing, would-be comic-book franchise, which often seems as blind as its hero -- not to mention deaf and dumb." [...] Character co-creator Stan Lee himself felt, [...] "hey just wrote the whole thing wrong. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> too tragic." [...] Ben Affleck won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his work in the movie, as well as for Gigli and Paycheck.|$|E
500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] were improvised by the actors. For example, Nick Offerman improvised the line [...] "Put it in an e-mail?", which he said when Leslie told him she had a very long story to tell him. Schur thought the line was [...] "my {{favorite}} thing in the show", and <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> say in it every subsequent take during filming. Aziz Ansari also improvised a majority of the scene in which he helped Leslie prepare for her ethics board review. Dean Holland, Parks and Recreations editor, said it was his favorite scene from the entire first season. Amy Poehler improvised the line at the courtyard gathering, after she accidentally spilled several beer bottles, [...] "I feel like I'm already in the boys' club. Look at those bitches cleanin' up after me." [...] Schur said the line helped develop Leslie's character in future episodes because [...] "we realized that Leslie can be a little bit cooler than we had originally thought". The scene with Ron describing his ideal government was written for a different episode, but was moved to [...] "Boys' Club" [...] when the producers decided it fit better there. Schur said it was his favorite moment in the episode. [...] "Boys' Club" [...] ends with Leslie and Mark toasting a beer to each other because Schur said, [...] "It's a running joke in the writer's room that every episode should end with clinking beers." ...|$|E
