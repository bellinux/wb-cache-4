5|$|Python allows boolean {{expressions}} {{with multiple}} equality relations {{in a manner}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.|$|E
5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

25|$|A {{contemporary}} {{description of}} the color vision system provides an understanding of primary colors <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> modern color science. The human eye normally contains only three types of color photoreceptors, known as long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), and short-wavelength (S) cone cells. These photoreceptor types respond to different (though overlapping) ranges of the visible electromagnetic spectrum, and middle wavelengths stimulate more than one photoreceptor type. Humans and other species with three such types of color photoreceptor are known as trichromats.|$|E

25|$|Momentum is a {{measurable}} quantity, and the measurement {{depends on the}} motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a frame of reference, in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> those same physical laws.|$|E

25|$|Constraint {{modeling}} theories concern {{families of}} directed graphs related by a partial order. In these applications, graphs are ordered by specificity, meaning that more constrained graphs—which are more specific and thus contain a {{greater amount of}} information—are subsumed by those that are more general. Operations between graphs include evaluating {{the direction of a}} subsumption relationship between two graphs, if any, and computing graph unification. The unification of two argument graphs is defined as the most general graph (or the computation thereof) <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> (i.e. contains all of the information in) the inputs, if such a graph exists; efficient unification algorithms are known.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, a {{photograph}} surfaced on Twitter {{showing that the}} Holborn Sainsbury's franchise responded to anti-Semitic threats by removing kosher products from its shelves. Complaints began appearing on social media that removing food <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> Jewish dietary restrictions and is produced {{all over the world}} was an act of discrimination against Jews. In response to the negative publicity, the kosher products were restored to the shelves and the staffer who removed them was reprimanded. However, in a call by i24news correspondent Jonathan Sacerdoti to the Sainsbury's Careline, the Sainsbury's representative defended the store's actions, calling them prudent in the face of threatened obstruction to the store.|$|E
25|$|In the {{scientific}} method, parsimony is an epistemological, metaphysical or heuristic preference, not an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result. As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the data available {{at a given}} time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available. That is, science {{is open to the}} possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.|$|E
