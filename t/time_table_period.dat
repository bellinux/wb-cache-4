Over 500, 000 foreign affiliates established by 60, 000 parent companies throughout the world employed about 35 million people in 1998 (World Investment Report, 1999).

50|$|From 1850, {{the rail}} {{revolution}} is expanding trough Quebec Province {{and all of}} Canada. Quebec City stays isolated on St-Lawrence River north shore; two private companies fail to get financing while Grand Trunk Railway lobbies against it in London. Finally, Quebec City grants 1 $ million to North Shore Railway (NSR), founded by Quebec’s bourgeoisie, to connect Quebec and Montreal by rail. Around 1872, the NSR builds the first Palais Station. In 1875, the lack of funds drives the NSR to transfer its assets to the Quebec Government which founds the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa & Occidental Railway (QMO&OR). By the end of 1877, the QMO&OR had built the railway between Quebec and Ottawa. From 1880 to 1890, the Quebec and Lake St-John Railway (QLSJR) joined the QMO&OR to enter Quebec City from the west and reach Palais Station as indicated on the <b>time</b> <b>tables</b> of the <b>period.</b> In 1882, the QMO&OR sells the Montreal-Ottawa line to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and, the Quebec-Montreal line in 1885.|$|R
30|$|The fire {{performance}} of mattresses is regulated in the United States using {{two types of}} ignition source; smoldering and open flame ignition. The current U.S. mattress flammability standards that have the most significant impact on industry and the consumer are 16 CFR 1632 (16 CFR 1632 Standard for the flammability of mattresses and mattress pads [1991]) and 16 CFR 1633 (16 CFR 1633 [2007]). The two federal flammability regulatory standards (16 CFR 1632 and 16 CFR 1633) are mandatory, and all manufacturers must comply with {{them in order to}} sell residential mattresses in the U.S. (Table 1). The 16 CFR 1632 regulation, introduced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in 1973, defines the fire resistance of mattresses to cigarette ignition, a smoldering source. The smoldering ignition test measures the char length over the mattress surface and the extent of damage to the mattress after a specified <b>time</b> <b>period</b> (<b>Table</b> 1).|$|R
30|$|It is {{surprising}} that {{one-half of the}} models show poor results that are not {{much better than the}} Reference Model (Table 1). The Smoothing M and Zoning M Models are based on the moderate-size earthquake catalog. Although the observation period is much longer than that of the small earthquake catalog, 72 vs. 18 years, the results based on the moderate-size earthquake catalog are far less successful. Despite declustering, moderate-size earthquakes tend to cluster near large earthquakes during the observation period, i.e., 1926 – 1997, where historical earthquakes rarely occurred. In other words, we find no recurrence of large earthquakes in the same cell during the past 400 years. However, the Smoothing and Zoning M Models do show high occurrence probability near the epicenter of large earthquakes for 1926 – 1997 and fail to reproduce the spatial distribution of large earthquakes in other <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> (<b>Table</b> 1).|$|R

It {{does not include}} stubble burning, which is covered under SNAP code 100300, or forest fires, which is covered under SNAP code 110300. The open burning of rubber tyres or waste oil on farms has also not been included. Examples of agricultural wastes that might be burned are crop residues (e. g. cereal crops, peas, beans, soya, sugarbeet, oil seed rape etc.) wood, leaves, animal carcasses, plastics and other general wastes. Straw and wood are often used as the fuel for the open burning of agricultural wastes. Poultry and animal excreta are difficult to burn except under controlled conditions. 2 CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL EMISSIONS The open burning of agricultural waste {{is likely to be}} widespread, although it will rarely be a significant source of emissions except on a local scale for short <b>time</b> <b>periods.</b> <b>Table</b> 1 : Contribution to total emissions of the CORINAIR 90 inventory (28 countries) Source-activity SNAP-code Contribution to total emissions [%...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} solving a specific class of timetabling problems. The solution introduced here proceeds in two phases: {{the construction of a}} <b>time</b> <b>table</b> that generally is not optimal, and a subsequent improvement of the <b>time</b> <b>table.</b> The first phase was successful solved using constraint programming (finite domain), the second one was realized as a multi-agent system. Results of the proposed optimization process have been verified by data from a college <b>time</b> <b>table.</b> The language Oz served as programming language and the system DFKI-Oz as convenient implementation tool. Introduction The <b>time</b> <b>tabling</b> approach described in this paper was inspired by the way in which school <b>time</b> <b>tables</b> were made in those <b>times</b> when <b>time</b> <b>tabling</b> programs were not yet available. Then, a <b>time</b> <b>table</b> was done by hand by some authorized person which usually was not optimal.

Using “Big Number Times Tables” (BNTT) can make the teaching and learning of long division algorithm much easier. BNTT needs children to only memorizing <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> up to table 9. Instead of doing trial and error as they normally do, children are guided to build the <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> systematically and they can build their own <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> with bigger number. Results of the early research show that majority children chose to use big number <b>times</b> <b>table</b> to solve problems because they make less error. Since BNTT guides children to build <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> in a systematic way, this gives the children the confidence to proceed with all the problems given. Teachers also find this technique very helpful. Furthermore, once anyone understands the steps being taken, BNTT can be used not only with one or two digits numbers but it can be applied with any bigger number which has more than two digits...|$|R

40|$|Hydrological {{conditions}} {{are considered to}} be among the main drivers influencing the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems, and hydrology is likely to alter due to climate change. We built a mesocosm experiment by using peat profiles from a pristine and from a drained (drained in 1978) peatland. A several-week-long low water <b>table</b> <b>period</b> followed by a high water <b>table</b> <b>period,</b> that is, a setting mimicking drought followed by flood, released relatively more DOC from pristine peat than from drained peat. From pristine peat profiles DOC was released into soil water in such quantities that the concentration of DOC remained stable despite dilution caused by added spring water to the mesocosms. In drained peat the DOC concentrations decreased during the high water <b>table</b> <b>period</b> indicating stronger dilution effect in comparison to pristine peat. At the landscape level DOC load from a drained peatland to the recipient water body may, however, increase during flooding because of high water runoff out of the peatland containing high DOC concentrations relative to the forest and agricultural areas. During the high water <b>table</b> <b>period</b> neither peat type nor water table had any clear impact on carbon dioxide (CO 2 -C) fluxes...|$|R

In case of exam scheduling there are two cases, first with student can have exam of two or more subjects consecutively and in second, student can’t have exam of two or more subjects consecutively. In this paper it is attempted to do comparison between two ways to schedule exam based on graph coloring approach for both cases mentioned above...|$|R
