40|$|Often <b>turbo-compressors</b> {{exhibit the}} maximum {{efficiency}} condition {{very close to}} the stall limit, so that it would be highly interesting to have a deep comprehension of this phenomenon. Despite the large diffusion of the multi-stage centrifugal compressors in different fields of the technology, such as natural gas pipe-lines or chemical factories, at the best authors’ knowledge, to date no theoretical model exists for rotating stall in these machines. This paper deals with a model for simulating multi-stage centrifugal compressor flow pattern during rotating stall. The model is not able to capture the stall inception, so the velocity and pressure fields are calculated throughout the machine once rotating stall has developed. The model consists of an implementation of that proposed by Moore for single-stage centrifugal compressors, so the simplifying hypotheses are: irrotational upstream fluid flow, inviscid and incompressible flow, stationary flow in the frame rotating at the same frequency of the stall cell; infinite blades are supposed both in rotors and return channel. Even if these fluid-dynamic hypotheses are really strong, it is worth of note that the reference models for rotating stall simulation in <b>turbo-compressors</b> (namely the Moore’s models) are based, at the present time, on them. In a previous step of this research, the authors utilized a semiempirical approach, with phases changes between first and second diffuser based on experimental data.

The mathematical model is solved by numerical way, leaving the original semianalytical scheme of Moore, so allowing the stall cell propagation frequency to be calculated.

50|$|Larger engines usually use a {{separate}} blower for scavenging {{and it was}} {{for this type of}} operation that the Roots blower has been utilized. Historically, many designs of blower have been used, from separate pumping cylinders, 'top hat' pistons combining two pistons of different diameter the larger one being used for scavenging, various rotary blowers and centrifugal <b>turbo-compressors,</b> including turbochargers. Turbocharging two-stroke engines is difficult, but not impossible, as a turbocharger does not provide any boost until it has had time to spin up to speed. Purely turbocharged two stroke engines may thus have difficulty when starting, with poor combustion and dirty exhausts, possibly even four-stroking. Some two-stroke turbochargers, notably those used on Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive engines, are mechanically driven at lower engine speeds through an overrunning clutch to provide adequate scavenging air. As engine speed and exhaust gas volume increase, the turbocharger no longer is dependent on mechanical drive and the overrunning clutch disengages.|$|R

Almost all automotive and industrial diesel engines and most of the high performance SI engines are equipped with turbocharger. Even though past few decades have seen continuous performance improvement, there is still lack of wide range research on acoustical behavior of turbochargers. A turbocharger consists of compressor which is driven by an exhaust turbine. Turbocharger produces high frequency aerodynamic sound due to the high speed rotating blade.

Many researchers approach this important issue by developing numerical models, whereas others approach it through experimental studies specifically carried out in order to better comprehend this phenomenon.

The test facility is set up in order to obtain i) the compressor performance maps at rotational speeds up to 25, 000 rpm and ii) the compressor transient behavior during surge. By using two different test rig layouts, instabilities occurring in the compressor, beyond the peak of the characteristic curve, are identified and investigated These two types of analysis are carried out thanks to pressure, temperature and mass flow sensors located in strategic positions along the circuit.

40|$|<b>Turbo-compressors</b> play {{a crucial}} role in the {{operation}} of air-breathing engines and special attention is given to the compressor’s ability to withstand adverse operating conditions. Various methods have been devised in order to enhance compressor stability and increase compressor stall margin, usually with some sacrifice of performance and efficiency. Active methods make use of external devices injecting and/or bleeding air from the compressor duct. Passive methods are primarily based on casing treatments, often involving flow paths into the rotor casing, to affect the behavior of the flow in favorable ways. In either case, it is desirable that the stability enhancing method be as simple as possible and that it keep performance and/or efficiency degradation to a minimum. The present work consists of a CFD analysis performed to evaluate the impact of a novel form of passive stability control on the operation of an axial flow fan stage. The casing treatment consists of “studs,” which are solid structures protruding from the casing into the duct. These structures are located slightly downstream of the fan rotor trailing edge. The stage that is studied in this investigation is the NASA SDT 2 R 4 transonic turbofan. The simulation software used is “Tenasi,” an in-house developed flow solver. Various simulations were conducted of the turbofan operation with and without casing treatment. Measures of performance and efficiency of the turbofan stage with no casing treatment were computed, and the results showed good agreement with available experimental data. The computed results from simulation with casing treatment suggest that protruding studs have the potential to improve the stability of the turbofan. The computed stall margin increase using an initial configuration of protruding studs is about 5. 4 % in terms of mass flow rate, with a decrease in efficiency of about 1. 6 %.

40|$|This {{preliminary}} phase 1 report {{summarizes the}} background and {{the work on the}} ''Increased Flexibility of <b>Turbo-Compressors</b> in Natural Gas Transmission through Direct Surge Control'' project to date. The importance of centrifugal compressors for natural gas transmission is discussed, and the causes of surge and the consequences of current surge control approaches are explained. Previous technology development, including findings from early GMRC research, previous surge detection work, and selected publications, are presented. The project is divided into three Phases to accomplish the project objectives of verifying near surge sensing, developing a prototype surge control system (sensor and controller), and testing/demonstrating the benefits of direct surge control. Specification for the direct surge control sensor and controller developed with guidance from the industry Oversight Committee is presented in detail. Results of CFD modeling conducted to aid in interpreting the laboratory test results are shown and explained. An analysis of the system dynamics identified the data sampling and handling requirements for direct surge control. A detailed design process for surge detection probes has been developed and explained in this report and has been used to prepare drag probes for the laboratory compressor test and the first field test. The surge detection probes prepared for testing have been bench tested and flow tested to determine and calibrate their sensitivity to flow forces as shown in data presented in this report. The surge detection drag probes have been shown to perform as expected and as required to detect approaching surge. Laboratory test results of surge detection in the SwRI centrifugal compressor demonstrated functionality of the surge detection probes and a change in the impeller inlet flow pattern prior to surge.

The compressed air is subsequently fed into the rocket combustion chamber where it is ignited along with stored liquid hydrogen. The high pressure ratio allows the engine to provide high thrust at very high speeds and altitudes. The low temperature of the air permits light alloy construction to be employed and allow a very lightweight engine—essential for reaching orbit.

The losses from carrying the added weight of systems shut down during the closed cycle mode (namely the precooler and <b>turbo-compressor)</b> as well as the added weight of Skylon's wings are offset by the gains in overall efficiency and the proposed flight plan. Conventional launch vehicles such as the Space Shuttle spend about one minute climbing almost vertically at relatively low speeds; this is inefficient, but optimal for pure-rocket vehicles. In contrast, the SABRE engine permits a much slower, shallower climb, breathing air and using its wings to support the vehicle therefore increasing payload fraction.|$|E
