40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay was to do a {{research}} about if the language in Swedish role-playing books is used correctly and if the composition along with the possible language errors makes <b>the</b> <b>books</b> hard <b>to</b> understand.

I read them trough, noted the mistakes made and put them together in a scoring table. I also did a LIX-test on <b>the</b> <b>books</b> and interviewed one of the authors. The results shows that <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>to</b> Eon is harder <b>to</b> read than <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>to</b> Drakar och Demoner and this agrees with the vision the authors of <b>the</b> <b>books</b> claims <b>to</b> have. <b>The</b> results also shows that {{it is not only the}} language mistakes and the composition that makes <b>the</b> <b>books</b> hard <b>to</b> read, but also the choice of difficult words and badly formulated rules...|$|R
