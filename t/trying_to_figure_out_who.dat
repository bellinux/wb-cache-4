500|$|Headstrong is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Ashley Tisdale, {{released}} on February 6, 2007, by Warner Bros. Records. [...] Tisdale {{began working on}} the project after the first installment of High School Musical (2006), and after she had achieved the feat {{of being the first}} female artist to debut with two songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Tisdale describes her work on the album saying. [...] "I didn't really know who I was and I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> to do.

Rotem, Ryan Tedder, Evan [...] "Kidd" [...] Bogart, and Kara DioGuardi, among others. Commenting that the album garnered its title from her personality, Tisdale said she wanted to use her first album to formally introduce herself personally, and as not one of the characters she portrays.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> would do something like this, {{the only way to make}} sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2016, the ABC-owned {{cable network}} Freeform {{announced}} Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, {{based on the}} characters of the same name, with a straight-to-series order for 2018. The network confirmed that the series would be [...] "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a [...] "superhero love story", a premise that Variety called [...] "a seamless fit for Freeform" [...] given the network's target audience of [...] "Becomers" [...] (the 14-34 age demographic). This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important {{to both of us}} to find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" [...] in Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors and Hulu's Runaways. In November 2017, it was announced that New Warriors would no longer air on Freeform and was being shopped to other networks.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of , Nimoy was once again asked to direct. Production was delayed for several months while Shatner {{negotiated}} for a pay increase. This resulted in Bennett considering replacing the entire main cast, and filming a prequel instead, {{with the idea that}} it would cut down on both Shatner and Nimoy's increasing wage costs and be far more profitable. Shatner, Nimoy and Roddenberry were against the re-boot idea, and when eventually Shatner agreed a new contract the impetus to replace the cast was lost. Nimoy, on the evolution of Spock in , said [...] "He's a very different Spock. A Spock who's evolving, who's confused. He's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>who</b> he's supposed to be and how he's supposed to function". He identified the moment when Spock rediscovered himself as the scene where the character says [...] "No, but it is the human thing to do."
