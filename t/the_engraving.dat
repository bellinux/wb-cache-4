5|$|Hamilton's {{portrait}} {{has been}} {{featured on the}} front of the U.S. $10 bill since 1928. The source of <b>the</b> <b>engraving</b> is John Trumbull's 1805 portrait of Hamilton, in the portrait collection of New York City Hall. In June 2015, the U.S. Treasury announced a decision to replace <b>the</b> <b>engraving</b> of Hamilton with that of a woman. Before the bill was actually redesigned, the decision was changed due to the unanticipated popular success of the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|A meter {{in length}} canes, dated between 1850 and 1920, {{are used to}} make an entry into a village or in dance ceremonies. The canes were fired to give black patina over the {{engraved}} parts; <b>the</b> <b>engraving</b> designs consist of geometrical real images from the pilou dance, agricultural motifs and village scenes of fishing or building a Grand Hut or case. These were also stuffed with magic herbs to ward off evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|Dürer's {{well-known}} engraving Melencolia I {{depicts a}} frustrated thinker sitting by a truncated triangular trapezohedron and a magic square. These two objects, and <b>the</b> <b>engraving</b> as a whole, {{have been the}} subject of more modern interpretation than the contents of almost any other print, including a two-volume book by Peter-Klaus Schuster, and an influential discussion in Erwin Panofsky's monograph of Dürer.|$|E
5000|$|According to the RKD he {{illustrated}} bibles.He {{was probably}} the brother of <b>the</b> <b>engraver</b> Mathäus Küsel. His daughter Johanna Sibylla married his pupil, <b>the</b> <b>engraver</b> Johann Ulrich Kraus.|$|R
50|$|Many light switchplates from {{companies}} such as Leviton or Lutron can be laser engraved. Again, experimentation {{may be necessary to}} develop the correct laser settings to result in <b>engraving</b> <b>the</b> surface rather than melting it. Often <b>the</b> laser <b>engraving</b> is followed by back filling with paint on <b>the</b> <b>engraved</b> surface to produce more contrast between <b>the</b> <b>engraved</b> surface and <b>the</b> surrounding surface.|$|R
50|$|Until 1860, artists {{working for}} {{engraving}} had to paint or draw {{directly on the}} surface of the block and the original artwork was actually destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>engraver.</b> In 1860, however, <b>the</b> <b>engraver</b> Thomas Bolton invented a process for transferring a photograph onto the block.|$|R
5|$|She {{had enjoyed}} {{developing}} {{the book with}} Warne, and, on July 2, sent him {{the remainder of the}} book, expressing her regret that its production was over. On July 25, proofs sent to her from the publisher showed spottiness that may have been caused by the summer heat affecting the chemicals used in <b>the</b> <b>engraving</b> process; the plates were re-engraved in September.|$|E
5|$|The {{cover of}} the British Library pocket guide Treasures in Focus - Stamps {{features}} the 1913 King George V seahorse master dye proof, part of the Harrison Collection. The engraver, J.A.C. Harrison, took proofs during {{the creation of the}} die of which this image is one. <b>The</b> <b>engraving</b> was used on the high value stamps 2/6, 5/-, 10/- and £1.|$|E
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from <b>the</b> <b>engraving.</b> Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E

50|$|To make a print, <b>the</b> <b>engraved</b> {{plate is}} inked all over, then the ink is wiped off the surface, leaving only ink in <b>the</b> <b>engraved</b> lines. <b>The</b> plate is then put through a {{high-pressure}} printing press {{together with a}} sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from <b>the</b> <b>engraved</b> lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the printing plate shows much sign of wear, except when drypoint, which gives much shallower lines, is used.|$|R
5|$|Early in 1794, {{engraver}} Robert Scot began preparing {{designs for}} the silver dollar. Scot's initial design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse featured an eagle, both required by the 1792 Coinage Act. Scot's design closely followed his design for the cent, but with the Phrygian cap removed. Government officials later instructed Scot to include a wreath around the eagle and to move the denomination from the reverse face {{to the edge of}} the coin. After receiving approval, Scot began engraving the hubs for the new silver dollar. Extra care was taken during <b>the</b> <b>engraving</b> of this denomination, because the dollar would be the largest American coin, and would thus receive the most scrutiny from foreign nations. The lettering was executed by Frederick Geiger, who had worked as a typographer for various books and newspapers. After the dies were created, several copper test pieces were struck. Officials decided to add fifteen stars around the periphery, representing the fifteen states that had ratified the Constitution to that point, to the right-facing Liberty on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Modern humans coexisted with woolly mammoths {{during the}} Upper Palaeolithic {{period when the}} humans entered Europe from Africa between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Prior to this, Neanderthals had coexisted with mammoths during the Middle Palaeolithic, and already {{utilised}} mammoth bones for tool making and building materials. Woolly mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. William Buckland published his discovery of the Red Lady of Paviland skeleton in 1823, which {{was found in a}} cave alongside woolly mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, Édouard Lartet found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the Abri de la Madeleine cave in Dordogne, France. <b>The</b> <b>engraving</b> was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.|$|E
5|$|R.S. Yeoman's 2014 {{edition of}} A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the Lafayette dollar at $650 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) ranging upwards to $19,000 in near-pristine MS-66. One in MS-67 condition, tied with {{multiple}} others {{for the best}} condition known, sold in 2004 for $66,700. Most Lafayette dollars display contact marks from other coins as the pieces were mechanically ejected from the press into a hopper and no {{attempt was made to}} preserve their appearance for collectors. Although whether the specimen is well-struck or not rarely affects value, clearly struck specimens will show <b>the</b> <b>engraving</b> line separating Lafayette's boot from the rest of his uniform, and details of the lower part of his clothing will also be distinct. The highest points on the coin, at which wear should be most apparent, are Washington's cheekbone on the obverse and the face of Lafayette on the reverse.|$|E

50|$|Galle {{was born}} in Haarlem in the Netherlands, {{where he was a}} pupil of <b>the</b> humanist and <b>engraver</b> Dirck Volkertsz. Coornhert. According to the RKD, he married Catharina van Rollant on 9 June 1569. They had five {{children}} who later became active as artists: Theodoor, Cornelis, Philips II, Justa (who married <b>the</b> <b>engraver</b> Adriaen Collaert) and Catharina (who married <b>the</b> <b>engraver</b> Karel de Mallery).|$|R
5|$|Another {{range of}} {{extensions}} came {{in relation to}} what could be copyrighted. The Statute only referred to books, and being an Act of Parliament, {{it was necessary to}} pass further legislation to include various other types of intellectual property. <b>The</b> <b>Engraving</b> Copyright Act 1734 extended copyright to cover engravings, statutes in 1789 and 1792 involved cloth, sculptures were copyrighted in 1814 and the performance of plays and music were covered by copyright in 1833 and 1842 respectively. The length of copyright was also altered; the Copyright Act 1814 set a copyright term of either 28 years, or the natural life of the author if this was longer. Despite these expansions, some still felt copyright was not a strong enough regime. In 1837, Thomas Noon Talfourd introduced a bill into Parliament to expand the scope of copyright. A friend of many men of letters, Talfourd aimed to provide adequate rewards for authors and artists. He campaigned for copyright to exist {{for the life of the}} author, with an additional 60 years after that. He also proposed that existing statutes be codified under the bill, so that the case law that had arisen around the Statute of Anne was clarified.|$|E
5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre {{piece in the}} tondo of both bowls. As the same image was used for both bowls, the {{implication}} is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one woman with a baby on her shoulders – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. <b>The</b> <b>engraving</b> is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un mariage, chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E

25|$|In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used {{engraving}} {{to decorate}} and inscribe metalwork. It {{is thought that}} they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew <b>the</b> <b>engraving</b> of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as old master prints in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of <b>the</b> <b>engraving</b> was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as Martin Schongauer, Albrecht Dürer, and Lucas van Leiden.|$|E
