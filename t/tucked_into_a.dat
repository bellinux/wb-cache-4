Most huipils hang loose but some can be tied at the waist or can be <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> skirt like a blouse. In some cases, such as in San Juan Copala, Oaxaca, the extra length of the huipil is rolled up onto the waist when worn with a skirt.|$|E
25|$|The town {{reached its}} peak of growth and {{prosperity}} just prior to World War I. In World War II this area of Abruzzo was directly affected {{by some of the}} most intense warfare of the Italian Campaign. On {{the other side of the}} peaks of the Majella from Pacentro, was the German Gustav Line. Many of the towns near the German defenses were bombed or destroyed, but Pacentro's geographic position of being <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mountain pass preserved it from aerial bombardment.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the upper}} part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a {{close-fitting}} shirt-like garment called a chemise in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise underneath their gowns or robes, sometimes with petticoats over the chemise. Elaborately quilted petticoats might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the farthingale was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with reed or willow rods so that it stood out from a woman's body like a cone extending from the waist.|$|E
50|$|Some {{alternative}} closures {{on these}} jumpsuits include zippers that zip {{from top to}} bottom (they are separating zippers similar to those found on coats) and <b>tuck</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> small pocket found below waist level.|$|R

At the end of 2007 National Braai Day changed its name to Braai4Heritage and the initiative received the endorsement of South Africa's National Heritage Council (NHC).|$|R
25|$|Elliott pitted on lap 314. He had {{a quicker}} pit stop since {{he still had}} use of first gear. He came out ahead of Kulwicki on the track. Terry Labonte led lap 315, then he pitted. Elliott re-assumed the lead on lap 316, and led the final 13 laps. Elliott's laps led total came to 102 – one lap fewer than Kulwicki's 103. With Elliott leading, Kulwicki <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{comfortable}} second, conserved fuel, and did not mount a challenge for the lead. Kulwicki and his crew had already figured out that if Elliott led {{the rest of the}} way, Kulwicki would still clinch the five bonus points. Furthermore, Kulwicki had a comfortable lead over third place, and was not being challenged.|$|E

50|$|Tuck and Turner, {{who were}} both under the {{influence}} of recreational drugs, said they were told that Ritcheson, also {{under the influence}} of drugs, tried to kiss 12-year-old Danielle Sons. Sons's statement threw <b>Tuck</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rage, and <b>Tuck</b> punched Ritcheson. The first punch was so powerful it broke Ritcheson's cheekbone and knocked him unconscious, stated Dr. Red Duke, the emergency physician who treated him.|$|R
50|$|The build of an A-shirt is simple: {{the neck}} and armholes are often {{reinforced}} for durability. One usually has large armholes and neck holes and a neckline that can reach down {{as far as the}} bottom of the chest. (Women's A-shirts have smaller holes, to conceal their breasts.) They are also sometimes made long to make <b>tucking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pair of jeans/shorts easier. In almost all cases, they are buttonless, collarless, and pocketless. An A-shirt worn as an undershirt is designed for a tight fit and is often made of ribbed cotton.|$|R

2500|$|In his Behind the Mask: On Sexual Demons, Sacred Mothers, Transvestites, Gangsters, Drifters, and Other Japanese Cultural Heroes, Ian Buruma {{describes}} Tani as {{the most}} celebrated porn star of her time, [...] "combin the savage and the maternal." [...] To explain her popularity he says she [...] "looked like a Japanese mother, her ample breasts <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> matronly kimono. She was the ideal object for men to take their anxieties out in, like the patient mother being pummelled by her sons. She was the Mother Goddess in bondage, the passive cross-bearer of masculine inadequacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Separate (non integral) hoods are of two types: {{one which}} extends {{only to the}} base of the neck, and the other a {{standard}} wetsuit hood with a large flange. Hoods are never tucked into the neck seal as they would be <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> wetsuit, as this would compromise the watertight integrity of the seal. Some suits are designed with a second (non-watertight) [...] "warm neck collar" [...] around the neck seal, which allows the flange of a standard wetsuit hood to tuck in around the outside of the seal. This can keep the neck significantly warmer, since the seal itself provides little insulation.|$|E
50|$|The {{heavy-bodied}} abdomen (or opisthosoma) {{exhibits a}} narrow pedicel, or waist, where it {{attaches to the}} prosoma. Curiously, there is a complex coupling mechanism between the prosoma and opisthosoma. The front margin of the opisthosoma <b>tucks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> corresponding fold {{at the back of}} the carapace. The advantages of this unusual system are not well understood, and since the genital opening is located on the pedicel (another rather unusual feature) the animals have to 'unlock' themselves in order to mate. The abdomen is divided dorsally <b>into</b> <b>a</b> series of large plates or tergites, each of which is subdivided <b>into</b> <b>a</b> median and lateral plate.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "tuck", meaning food, is slang and {{probably}} originates from such phrases as [...] "to <b>tuck</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> meal". It {{is closely related}} to the Australian English word [...] "tucker", meaning food. A tuck shop typically sells confectionery, sandwiches, finger-food, such as sweets, crisps, soft drinks and such. Recently there have been moves to change to a wider variety of [...] "healthier" [...] foods. In Australia, where the tuck shop will typically be the only source of bought food at the school/club, the menu is more substantial and is more similar to the school dinners provided by the British government.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{valley and}} {{bisected}} by a river, Tegucigalpa {{is prone to}} flooding during the rainy season, as experienced to the fullest during Hurricane Mitch {{and to a lesser}} degree every year during the rainy season. [...] Despite being several thousand feet above sea level, the city currently lacks an efficient flood control system, including canals and sewerage powerful enough to channel rainwater back into the river to flow down to the ocean. [...] The river itself is a threat since it isn't deep enough below the streets, nor are there levees high enough to prevent it from breaking out. [...] There are currently more than 100 neighborhoods deemed zones of high risk, several of them ruled out as uninhabitable in their entirety.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of November 10, 1912, just {{three days after the}} finish of Eugene V. Debs' 4th — and arguably most {{successful}} — campaign as the Socialist Party's candidate for President of the United States, [...] Wayland retired upstairs to his bedroom. There he opened a drawer and removed a loaded handgun. He carefully wrapped the revolver with a sheet to muffle the sound of the explosion. He drew a breath, placed the gun in his hand, raised it to his open mouth, and shot himself in the brain. Wayland never regained consciousness, dying shortly after midnight, November 11, 1912. Harried by the government, despondent over the failure of the Socialist movement to win the support of more than {{a small fraction of the}} laboring classes, tired of life, Wayland left an epitaph <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> book on his bedside table: [...] "The struggle under the competitive system is not worth the effort; let it pass." ...|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} general modes of {{attachment}} in the MOLLE arena; the [...] "Natick Snap", {{which uses a}} polyethlyene reinforced webbing strap with the 'pushthedot' snap for security; the polymer [...] "Malice" [...] clip, developed by Tactical Tailor {{as an alternative to}} the Natick Snap concept, which interweaves like the Natick Snap but terminates in a semi-permanent closure that requires a screwdriver or other flat-tipped object to disengage; and a variety of attachments that fall into the [...] "Weave & Tuck" [...] category, in which the end of an interwoven strap is <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> item's backing after attachment to a vest or pack (Paraclete's SofStrap and Spec Ops Brand's hybrid attachment).|$|R
5000|$|The juveniles of the {{butterfly}} kingfish {{are characterized by}} enormous pelvic fins that are longer than the length of its head, and that become more proportional as the fish grows. At any size, the pelvic fin <b>tucks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> deep ventral groove, {{in much the same}} way as the first dorsal spines do in all scombrids. This species has very large cycloid scales, below which is a thick layer of fat. The swim bladder has two anterior projections that extend into the back of the skull, near the inner ear. [...] This fish lacks the median keel on the caudal peduncle - it only has the characteristic pair of small keels on each side of the base of the caudal fin, as do other scombrids. It has 21 precaudal vertebrae, plus 23 caudal vertebrae.|$|R

He will not pray, because he is unwilling to take pure clothes out of his box; but he smokes when he can get other people's tobacco, and groans between the whiffs, conjugating the verb all day, for he is of active mind. He can pick out his letters, and he keeps in his bosom a little dog's-eared MS. full of serious romances and silly prayers, old and exceedingly ill written; this he will draw forth at times, peep into for a moment, devoutly kiss, and restore to its proper place with the veneration of the vulgar for a book. He can sing all manner of songs, slaughter a sheep with dexterity, deliver a grand call to prayer, shave, cook, fight; and he excels in the science of vituperation: like Sa'ad, he never performs his devotions, except ...|$|E
60|$|As for Good and myself, the armour did not suit us {{nearly so}} well. To begin with, Good insisted upon keeping on his new-found trousers, and a stout, short gentleman with an eye-glass, and {{one half of}} his face shaved, arrayed in a mail shirt, {{carefully}} <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> very seedy pair of corduroys, looks more remarkable than imposing. In my case, the chain shirt being too big for me, I put it on over all my clothes, which caused it to bulge in a somewhat ungainly fashion. I discarded my trousers, however, retaining only my veldtschoons, having determined to go into battle with bare legs, {{in order to be}} the lighter for running, in case it became necessary to retire quickly. The mail coat, a spear, a shield, that I {{did not know how to}} use, a couple of tollas, a revolver, and a huge plume, which I pinned into the top of my shooting hat, in order to give a bloodthirsty finish to my appearance, completed my modest equipment. In addition to all these articles, of course we had our rifles, but as ammunition was scarce, and as they would be useless in case of a charge, we arranged that they should be carried behind us by bearers.|$|E

John was requested to order home {{a dozen or so}} of little pots and an extra quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be attended to at once. As John firmly believed that 'my wife' was equal to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use. Home came four dozen delightful little pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for her. With her pretty hair <b>tucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> little cap, arms bared to the elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her success, for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array of pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling, straining, and fussing over her jelly. She did her best, she asked advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but that dreadful stuff wouldn't 'jell'.|$|E
