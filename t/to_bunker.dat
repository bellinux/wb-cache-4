By 1960, BP had assumed a 50% interest in C-65 {{and became the}} operator. After large discoveries in the Sirte Basin in 1958 and 1959, a reflection seismology survey was conducted on C-65, followed by an aeromagnetic survey showing the existence of large structures. Later that year, BP began drilling in C-65, 80, and 81, targeting Paleocene and Cretaceous carbonates that had yielded discoveries in the Nasser (Zelten), Defa, Raguba field, and Bahi fields. Mobil discovered Cretaceous basal sand at Amal in 1959, but early results did not recognize its full potential.|$|E

25|$|O'Connor {{was living}} in Italy in 1968 when {{producer}} Norman Lear first {{asked him to come}} to New York to star in a pilot he was creating for ABC called Justice For All, with O'Connor playing Archie Justice, a lovable yet controversial bigot. After three pilots done between 1968 and 1970, a network change to CBS, and the last name of the character changed <b>to</b> <b>Bunker,</b> the new sitcom was renamed All in the Family. The show was based on the BBC's Till Death Us Do Part, with Bunker based on Alf Garnett, but somewhat less abrasive than the original. O'Connor's Queens background and New York accent is said to have influenced Lear to set the show in Queens.|$|E
500|$|Alberti opines that, {{rather than}} denying All in the Familys {{influence}} on The Simpsons, the series writers [...] "mockingly embrace it" [...] by having Homer visually likened <b>to</b> <b>Bunker</b> {{as he sits}} on his chair. Alberti also noted {{that one of the}} security officer's use of the word [...] "pinko", a term used for a person who is regarded as sympathetic towards communism, is [...] "ironic" [...] as it was used by Bunker, whose chair Homer is sitting in. When the other officer complains about citizens [...] "hiding behind the Bill of Rights", Homer shields himself from the officers blows with the actual manuscript, making the officer's previous statement literal.|$|E
500|$|Fegelein's {{wife was}} {{then in the}} late stages of {{pregnancy}} (the baby was born in early May). Hitler considered releasing him without punishment or assigning him to Mohnke's troops. Junge—an eye-witness <b>to</b> <b>bunker</b> events—stated that Braun pleaded with Hitler to spare her brother-in-law and tried to justify Fegelein's actions. He {{was taken to the}} garden of the Reich Chancellery on 28 April, and was [...] "shot like a dog". Rochus Misch, who was the last survivor from the Führerbunker, disputed aspects of this account in a 2007 interview with Der Spiegel. According to Misch, Hitler did not order Fegelein's execution, only his demotion. Misch claimed to know the identity of Fegelein's killer, but refused to reveal his name.|$|E

500|$|The bunkers {{were well}} {{constructed}} and camouflaged, while visibility {{was limited to}} just [...] among the dense vegetation and consequently many were not located by the Australians until they were upon them. The bunkers were sited to be mutually supporting, and the North Vietnamese defending them responded with a crossfire of RPG-2 rocket-propelled grenades, although the heavy armour of the Centurions proved impervious and they remained undamaged. During a three-hour battle the Australians and North Vietnamese fought each other from bunker <b>to</b> <b>bunker.</b> However, with aerial reconnaissance revealing that the bunker system {{was part of a}} much larger base area, and with the Australian force judged too small to deal with it, Bennett directed Hammett to retire by late afternoon. Amidst a heavy rain the Australians broke contact at 16:00 under the cover of artillery and mortar fire, and they moved quickly back to FSB Coral. Fourteen bunkers had been destroyed, while seven North Vietnamese bodies were counted and quantities of weapons, ammunition and documents were also captured. Yet many more men were undoubtedly entombed in the bunkers after being crushed by the tanks, making a comprehensive body count impossible. Although it had been a fierce engagement the Australians suffered no casualties, a fact which was attributed to the effectiveness of the tanks, and further validated Dunstan's decision to call them forward from Nui Dat. Second Lieutenant John Salter was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during this and other actions.|$|E
500|$|Several {{instances}} of this unspecific language {{in reference to}} equipment {{can be found in}} documents concerning Auschwitz concentration camp. A letter dated August 21, 1942 referred <b>to</b> <b>Bunker</b> 1 and Bunker 2 (farmhouses west of Birkenau converted into gas chambers) as [...] "Badeanstalten für Sonderaktionen" [...] (bathing installations for special actions). In the letter, this is given in quotes, further suggesting the euphemistic nature of what is meant. On blueprints, the basement gas chambers of Crematoria II and III were simply marked as [...] "Leichenkeller 1" [...] (basement morgue 1), and the basement undressing rooms were marked as [...] "Leichenkeller 2". However, a letter dated November 27, 1942 to chief Auschwitz architect SS-Sturmbannführer Karl Bischoff referred to morgue 1 of Crematorium II as the [...] "Sonderkeller" [...] (special cellar). A letter from SS-Sturmbannführer Rudolf Jährling concerning Crematoria II and III to oven builders J.A. Topf and Sons dated March 6, 1943, refers to morgue 2 as an [...] "Auskleideraum" [...] (undressing room). The units of prisoners forced to empty gas chambers and load bodies into ovens were known as the Sonderkommando (special squads). A document dated August 26, 1942 granted the camp authorities to send a truck [...] "... to Dessau to pick up material for special treatment..." [...] - Dessau was one of two places where Zyklon B was manufactured. Standard usage of the term for killing at Auschwitz applied. A letter dated October 13, 1942, signed by Bischoff, states that construction of new crematoria facilities [...] "... was necessary to start immediately in July 1942 because of the situation caused by the special actions." [...] On September 8, 1943, 5,006 Jews were transferred from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz under the designation [...] "SB six months." [...] Six months later on March 9, 1944, those still alive were gassed.|$|E

The B-58 training school was transferred from Carswell <b>to</b> <b>Bunker</b> Hill Air Force Base, Indiana where SAC's other B-58 wing, the 305th Bombardment Wing was located.

2500|$|By now {{public opinion}} of the Act {{appeared}} to be waning, with a Gallup poll {{response to the question}} [...] "Based on what you have read or heard, do you think the Patriot Act goes too far, is about right, or does not go far enough in restricting people's civil liberties in order to fight terrorism?" [...] showing that between 2003 and 2004 nearly a quarter of all Americans felt that the Act went too far, while most felt that it was either just right or did not go far enough. In response, the Department of Justice established a website, www.lifeandliberty.gov, that defended the Act from such organizations as the ACLU (which itself had created a website that campaigned against the Patriot Act called Safe and Free). At the same time, Attorney General Ashcroft toured 16 cities giving speeches to invite only crowds defending the Patriot Act and touting its importance. In the speeches [...] which among other things made allusions <b>to</b> <b>Bunker</b> Hill, Antietam, the Argonne, Iwo Jima, Normandy and Abraham Lincoln [...] he defended the Patriot Act's provisions that eliminated the [...] "wall" [...] preventing foreign intelligence agencies from sharing information with domestic law enforcement agencies, roving wiretaps and the expanded capabilities of the U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force. He also claimed that they had [...] "neutralized alleged terrorist cells in Buffalo, Detroit, Seattle and Portland [...] brought 255 criminal charges. One hundred thirty two individuals have been convicted or pled guilty. All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries. Many more have met a different fate." [...] Among those arrested was Sami Amin Al-Arian and seven others who were indicted on 50 counts, including using an Islamic think tank to funnel funds to the group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is classed as a terrorist organization by the United States government. Ashcroft cited the arrests to show how the Patriot Act had broken down information sharing barriers between agencies. The speeches themselves were met with support, but in many states Ashcroft attracted protests and a number of critical editorials were written [...] in one particularly stinging column, The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that there was [...] "an air of desperation about it." ...|$|E
