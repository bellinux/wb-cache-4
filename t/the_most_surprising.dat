Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> case is Syria where 74.30% {{of women are}} salaried. This is the largest percentage in the Middle East {{and one of the}} highest in the entire Muslim world.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> results came in Punta Gorda, where 5 UDP {{candidates}} were elected but not Mayoral nominee Charles Selgado; and in Benque Viejo, where the PUP's Armando Chulin sneaked {{on to the}} council by 17 votes. In the Amandala of Sunday, March 5, 2006, publisher Evan X Hyde claimed the Punta Gorda result showed the maturity of Belizean voters in selecting a bipartisan council.|$|E

The US outbound holiday market is sensitive in the short term, but possibly one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> results from the September 11, 2001 attacks was that by February 2002 it had bounced back. This quick revival was generally quicker than many commentators had predicted only five months earlier.|$|E
25|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> hunting {{behaviour}} occurs {{among the}} araneophagous Salticidae, and it varies greatly in method. Many of the spider-hunting species quite commonly will attack other spiders, whether fellow salticids or not, {{in the same}} way as any other prey, but some kinds resort to web invasion; nonspecialists such as Phidippus audax sometimes attack prey ensnared in webs, basically in acts of kleptoparasitism — sometimes they leap onto and eat the web occupant itself, or simply walk over the web for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|Of the Roman {{citizens}} sine suffragio (which {{were mainly}} Italic tribes wholly annexed to the Roman state) Hannibal scored one major success: the defection {{of most of}} the Campanians. This was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> of the defections, as the Campanians had been loyal allies of Rome since the 340's BC, when they requested Roman protection from Samnite incursions. They had also remained loyal during the Pyrrhic invasion, as Pyrrhus was the champion of the Campanians' other main rivals, the Italiote Greeks. The deciding factor in Capua's defection from Rome appears to have been the prospect of replacing Rome as Italy's leading city.|$|E

25|$|It {{is known}} from Hammond & Anderson {{that the first}} {{printing}} appeared on March 1, 1938. A library copy of the third printing has been seen with a check-out date of November 28, 1938. If we accept, then, that the first edition consisted of multiple runs on the evidence of emendations to the text block, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> fact arising out of the dating {{is that the first}} three printings appeared within nine months of each other. It is not known whether a planned larger, single run was shortened and broken up for the corrections, or whether demand was simply strong enough to warrant new runs with corrections made opportunistically.|$|E
25|$|The Liberals paid dearly {{by calling}} a snap {{election}} three years into their mandate in 1990. Before Peterson called the election, his government stood at a 54% approval rating in the polls. However, the early election call {{turned out to}} be his undoing as the public interpreted it as arrogance. Several scandals also broke out after the election call and some suspected the Liberals of calling an election just to dodge the upcoming recession. In <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> election results in Ontario's history, the NDP was able to win a majority government, however with only 37% of the vote. This government was Ontario's second social democratic government (after the United Farmers government of Ernest Drury 1919-1923), and its track record would keep the NDP out of serious contention for power in Ontario until the present.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 2009, Castle {{announced}} his candidacy in the 2010 special election {{for the seat}} in the United States Senate held by Democrat Ted Kaufman. Kaufman, appointed by Governor Ruth Ann Minner to fill the vacancy created by Joe Biden (who resigned to become Vice President of the United States), was not a candidate in the special election. The election would determine who would fill the balance of Biden's term, which would end on January 3, 2015. In one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> election results of the 2010 campaign season, Castle was defeated in the Republican primary for the US Senate seat by Christine O'Donnell. He would have been heavily favored {{in the general election}} against Democrat Chris Coons, who went on to easily beat O'Donnell by 17%.|$|E

25|$|Branch and Terrell Owens {{each had}} 100 yards {{receiving}}, marking {{the third time}} in Super Bowl history, one player from each team had over 100 yards in a Super Bowl. Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII, and Branch and Muhsin Muhammad the second a year earlier in Super Bowl XXXVIII. Branch also became the fourth player to have at least 100 yards receiving in back-to-back Super Bowls, joining John Stallworth, Jerry Rice and Antonio Freeman. Also, Mike Vrabel and David Givens became just the 14th and 15th players to score a touchdown in consecutive Super Bowls. Vrabel is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> person on this list because he is a linebacker and he scored his on offense. They also became just the 7th and 8th players to catch a touchdown in back-to-back Super Bowls.|$|E
25|$|In early 1962, Mangeshkar {{was given}} slow poison. A doctor was called. He came with an x-ray machine to examine her, {{and gave her}} an {{injection}} to render her unconscious, because she was in pain. For three days, she had a close brush with death. After ten days, she began to recover. The doctor told her that somebody had given her slow poison. The slow poison incident rendered her very weak. She was bedridden for nearly 3 months. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> thing was that soon after the incident, the cook {{who used to work}} at Lataji's home, suddenly vanished without taking his wages. The cook had earlier worked with some Bollywood people. Bollywood lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri used to regularly visit Lataji at her home daily at 6 pm. Majrooh used to first taste the food and then allow Lata to eat. He used to recite poems and stories to keep Lata in good humour.|$|E
25|$|There were {{questions}} about the actual content of the map. Witten had pointed out that it bore strong resemblances to a map made in the 1430s by Italian mariner Andrea Bianco, but others found some of {{the similarities and differences}} very strange—the map cuts off Africa where Bianco's map has a page fold, but distorts shapes, and includes major revisions in the far east and west. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> revision is that, unlike, for example, the famous Cantino World Map, the Vinland Map depicts Greenland as an island, remarkably close to the correct shape and orientation (while Norway, of which Greenland was just a colony, is wildly inaccurate) although contemporary Scandinavian accounts—including the work of Claudius Clavus in the 1420s—depict Greenland as a peninsula joined to northern Russia. For practical purposes, Arctic sea ice may have made this description true, and Greenland is not known to have been successfully circumnavigated until the 20th century. Skelton wondered also whether the revisions in the far east were meant to represent Japan—they seem to show not only Honshu, but also Hokkaido and Sakhalin, omitted even from Oriental maps in the 15th century.|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the films has been varied, but several are regarded as classic television ghost stories. Sarah Dempster, writing in The Guardian in 2005, noted that [...] "Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> aspect ... is how little its adaptations ... have dated. They may boast the odd signifier of cheap 1970s telly – outlandish regional vowels, inappropriate eyeliner, a surfeit of depressed oboes – but lurking within their hushed cloisters and glum expanses of deserted coastline is a timelessness at odds with virtually everything written, or broadcast, before or since." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Näslund {{made his}} first and only {{appearance}} in the Winter Olympics at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. He scored his first and only two Olympic goals during a 7–1 win against Germany. After going undefeated in the round-robin and heralded as medal favourites, Sweden was defeated by Belarus 4–3 in the quarterfinal. The loss was widely considered one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> results in Olympic history, while Näslund described the defeat in a post-game interview as [...] "devastating...for us and our country." [...] He finished the tournament with two goals and an assist over four games, ranking fourth on the team in scoring.|$|E
500|$|In {{an end of}} {{the year}} review, British {{magazine}} Q said [...] "It could all have been so different. As the London 2012 Summer Olympics approached, the tide of scepticism seemed almost irreversible. There was the heavy-handed sponsorship, the draconian security, the ticketing problems, the ballooning budget, and the lurking fear that the Opening Ceremony might be, in director Danny Boyle's pungent description, 'shite'. It took less than four hours on the night of Friday 27 July to turn the whole country around. [...] Not only was the ceremony demonstrably not shite, it was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising,</b> moving, spectacular cultural event this country had ever seen...modern Britain, in all its berserk, multi-faceted glory." ...|$|E
5000|$|The band {{released}} their self-titled {{debut on}} September 17, 2013, via Downtown Records to positive reviews. NPR called the record [...] "one of <b>the</b> year's <b>most</b> <b>surprising,</b> ambitious, evocative and moving records," [...] praising Ludwig-Leone {{for his ability}} to write a collection of songs [...] "as easy to love as they are to admire." [...] Pitchfork also gave the album a positive review, declaring the album's lead single [...] "Sonsick", which was released December 2012, [...] "deliriously infectious."

500|$|Since its rediscovery, {{the play}} {{has been studied}} and {{analyzed}} by scholars interested in its place in Verne's oeuvre, though it remains relatively little-known among his works. The American Verne scholar Arthur B. Evans has called it [...] "delightful," [...] saying it [...] "shows [...] at his most whimsically science-fictional."

500|$|During the 2000s, {{two more}} ex-members of the Byrds died when drummer Kevin Kelley succumbed {{of natural causes}} in 2002 and bassist Skip Battin, who was {{suffering}} from Alzheimer's disease, died {{at his home in}} 2003. [...] Former members Gene Parsons and John York both remain active and continue to perform and record various musical projects. [...] Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> development in the Byrds' story during the 2000s, however, was the acquisition by David Crosby of the rights to the band's name in 2002. [...] Ownership of the Byrds' name had reverted to Clarke's estate upon his death in 1993 and Crosby's purchase served to effectively bring the convoluted battle for control of the group's name to an end.|$|E
500|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> {{development}} {{within the}} Byrds {{at this time}} was the emergence of bass player Chris Hillman as both a lead vocalist and the band's third songwriter. [...] Prior to the recording of Younger Than Yesterday, Hillman had never sung lead vocals on a Byrds' recording and his only writing contribution with the band had been a shared credit for the instrumental track [...] "Captain Soul". [...] On this album, however, he is credited as the sole songwriter of [...] "Have You Seen Her Face", [...] "Time Between", [...] "Thoughts and Words", and [...] "The Girl with No Name", with all four tracks featuring him as the lead vocalist.

500|$|Belgium {{qualified}} {{for only one}} of eight major tournaments during the 1950s and the 1960s: the 1954 World Cup. The day before the tournament began, the RBFA was among the three UEFA founders. Dutch journalists considered the draw of the 1954 Belgian team in their opener against England to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> result of that match day, even more than Switzerland's victory over the Italian [...] "football stars". However, Belgium were eliminated after a loss to Italy in the second (and last) group match. Two bright spots in these decades were wins against World Cup holders: West Germany in 1954, and Brazil in 1963. Between these, Belgium defeated Hungary's Golden Team in 1956. The combination of failure in competitive games, and success in exhibition matches, gave the Belgians the mock title of [...] "world champion of the friendlies".|$|E
2500|$|Snape's character, {{which becomes}} more layered and enigmatic as the series progresses, was widely {{acclaimed}} by readers and critics.

50|$|There {{was much}} {{anticipation}} surrounding the 2004 championship as Valentino Rossi had made surprising {{move to the}} Yamaha team and, Gibernau's preseason and early season speed would indicate {{he was in a}} good position to win the title. Gibernau finished on the podium in the first three races, winning two of them and, had gained the promising start to the season with Rossi at times struggling {{to come to terms with}} his new bike. However, a run of victories went Rossi's way after the French round and didn't abate until the Brazilian Grand Prix where, one of <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>surprising</b> incidents of Gibernau and Rossi's rivalries occurred.|$|R
