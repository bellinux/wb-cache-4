5|$|In general, A.subrubescens can be {{distinguished}} from other Albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A.subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A.ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A.subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics {{can be used to}} reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A.subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A.ovinus, and A.ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5µm. Other similar species include A.tianschanicus, described from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A.cantharellus. Unlike A.subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> are darker than the spaces between <b>the</b> <b>scales.</b> Also, <b>the</b> <b>scales</b> of A.subrubescens are not much darker than the area between <b>the</b> <b>scales.</b> Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A.subrubescens: those of A.cantharellus are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5µm, while those of A.tianschanicus are 5–7 by 4–5µm.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scales</b> on {{butterfly}} {{wings are}} pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of <b>the</b> <b>scales.</b> This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of <b>the</b> <b>scales.</b> The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{effective}} approach for <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> registration of $m$-D point sets. Different from the rigid transformation, <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> registration {{can not be}} formulated into the common least square function due to the ill-posed problem caused by <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> factor. Therefore, this paper designs a novel objective function for <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> registration problem. <b>The</b> appearance of this objective function is a rational fraction, where the numerator item is the least square error and the denominator item is the square of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> factor. By imposing <b>the</b> emphasis on <b>scale</b> factor, <b>the</b> ill-posed problem can be avoided in <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> registration. Subsequently, <b>the</b> new objective function can be solved by <b>the</b> proposed <b>scaling</b> iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which can obtain <b>the</b> optimal <b>scaling</b> transformation. For <b>the</b> practical applications, <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> ICP algorithm is further extended to align partially overlapping point sets. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on public data sets and applied to merging grid maps of different resolutions.

The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end.

5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane.

Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. <b>The</b> <b>scales</b> of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E

30|$|Finally, we {{prove that}} <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> choice of Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is order-optimal. First, {{we show that}} no scaling order larger than this results in higher throughput.

Choosing a larger scaling than Q[*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) for Q, does not help improving <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> order of R 1. That is because R 1 [*]=[*]Θ(log 2 (ρ)) is <b>the</b> best achievable <b>scaling</b> even in <b>the</b> case of Q[*]=[*]∞. Thus, increasing <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> order of Q does not help improving <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> order of R 1.
