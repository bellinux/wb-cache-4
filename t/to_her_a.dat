5|$|The life of Queen Catherine {{has been}} one of the most popular themes in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, {{attracting}} the attention of scholars from the neighbouring countries of Croatia and Serbia as well. With the rise of ethnic nationalism, historians attempted to ascribe <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> particular national identity – Croat, Serb or Bosniak, which is completely anachronistic to medieval times.|$|E
25|$|With {{the start}} of 2007, a serial killer is on the loose in Pine Valley, killing the women of Fusion Cosmetics. Once Babe passes on eating a stack of pancakes {{secretly}} meant for her by the Satin Slayer, and Dixie eats them instead, Tad and JR rush to Dixie's bedside at P.V. Hospital where she dies. JR says an emotional goodbye to his mother, returns <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> necklace in which she adored, and cries in his wife's arms.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 2014, {{the exact}} day of Mae's death, WWE {{pay tribute to}} her with a posthumous video which {{included}} highlights of her career, and another one six days later on January 20.

25|$|In April 1725, the seven-year-old infanta {{was sent}} back to Madrid — Louis did not even say goodbye <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> new {{candidate}} was sought urgently because, should Louis die with no heir, and assuming Philippe V of Spain did not seize the throne, then it would pass to the new duc d'Orléans, son of the deceased regent; the House of Orléans and the House of Condé were rivals, so this would cast Monsieur le Duc into the political wastelands.|$|E
25|$|The Nimbarka sampradaya {{worship of}} the {{youthful}} Krishna, alone or with his consort Radha, {{is one of the}} earliest dating at least to the 12th century, just as Rudra Sampradaya does. According to Nimbarka, Radha was the eternal consort of Vishnu-Krishna and there is also a suggestion, though not a clear statement, that she became the wife of her beloved Krishna. It should be noted that Nimbarka rescues Radha from the presumed immoral implication of much of the literature, and gives <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> dignity unattained elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Holliday and Horony {{had many}} fights. After a {{particularly}} nasty, drunken argument, Holliday kicked her out. County Sheriff Johnny Behan and Milt Joyce {{saw an opportunity}} and exploited the situation. They plied Horony with more booze and suggested <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> way to get even with Holliday. She signed an affidavit implicating Holliday in an attempted robbery and murder of passengers aboard a Kinnear and Company stage coach on March 15, 1881, carrying US$26,000 in silver bullion (about $ in today's dollars). Three cowboys had stopped the stage between Tombstone and Benson, Arizona and robbed it.|$|E

McKnight and LeBlanc {{had been}} {{introduced}} in 1997 by her friend Kelly Phillips, wife of actor Lou Diamond Phillips, and LeBlanc proposed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> year later. Their daughter Marina Pearl, born in 2004, began suffering seizures when she was eight months old.

He also had two step-children through McKnight's first marriage, Tyler (b. 1991) and Jacqueline Esposito.|$|E
25|$|She {{moved in}} with Annie Pécher (1944-1985), whom she had first met when {{she worked as a}} {{counsellor}} in a seaside camp in her youth. Annie, who was 11 years her junior, became warmly attached <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>a</b> sentiment that Deckers did not reciprocate at the time. Nevertheless, Pécher visited Deckers regularly in her convent, went to live near where Deckers stayed when sent to study at Leuven, and even fell into a deep depression and tried to kill herself when it seemed Deckers was about to be sent to a mission country.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E

25|$|After returning, Jason {{began to}} suffer from {{life-threatening}} headaches, seizures and amnesia. Sam is there for Jason when he eventually loses his memory {{as a result of}} his illness. Sam convinces Jason to undergo treatment with the help Dr. Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough). He and Sam fall in love all over again and he proposes <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> second time before he begins his treatment. After the treatment, Jason gets his memory back and remembers his life with Sam, but the procedure causes a brain aneurysm. Jason initially refuses to have surgery to repair the damage, and he and Sam move to Hawaii to live out his last days peacefully. However, Jason realizes that he wants to live to be with Sam, and returns to Port Charles to have the surgery, which ended up saving his life.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf {{gives this}} version of the legend in his 1889 book Il Diavolo : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have {{children}} and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>a</b> veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, {{for the first time in}} his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.|$|E
500|$|After she {{was awarded}} the Nobel Peace Prize, there was praise, but also some disapproval of the {{decision}} to award it <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> Norwegian jurist, Fredrik Heffermehl, commented on being awarded the Nobel Prize: [...] "This is not for fine people who have done nice things and are glad to receive it. All of that is irrelevant. What Nobel wanted was a prize that promoted global disarmament." ...|$|E

500|$|The news of {{her death}} {{produced}} sincere mourning in Brazil. The Brazilian poet and journalist Artur Azevedo wrote of the general view toward Teresa Cristina after her death: [...] "I never spoke to her, but also never passed her without respectifuly removing my hat and bowing myself, not to the Empress, but to the sweet and honest figure of a poor, almost humble, bourgeoise. I saw many extremist republicans do the same." [...] He continued: [...] "They called her {{the mother of the}} Brazilians, and we all really attributed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> kind of a filial veneration. That is the truth." ...|$|E

She later performed alongside Bette Midler in a 1999 New York concert {{to raise money for the}} Breast Cancer Research Foundation.|$|E
500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} rumours began to {{circulate}} that Blyton had not written {{all the books}} attributed <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>a</b> charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children {{to let her know}} if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated [...] "a 'company' of ghost writers" [...] persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.|$|E

Nothing untoward was found; on the bed, a suit and shirt lay alongside a book on Greek shipping millionaires, and Lucan's wallet, car keys, money, driving licence, handkerchief and spectacles were on a bedside table. His passport was in a drawer and his blue Mercedes-Benz parked outside, its engine cold and its battery flat. Ranson then visited Veronica Lucan at St George's Hospital. Although heavily sedated, {{she was able to}} describe what had happened <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> police officer was left to guard her, should her assailant return. Rivett's body was taken to the mortuary, and a search was undertaken of all local basement areas and gardens, skips and open spaces.|$|E
500|$|... "Baelor" [...] {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of the German actress Sibel Kekilli, {{in the role of}} the prostitute Shae. Executive producer George R. R. Martin commented that she was extraordinary in her audition, in which she read the scene where Shae meets Tyrion in a tent the night before the battle of the Green Fork. According to Martin, [...] "a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. [...] But there's another dimension to Shae as well. She's not as practiced and hardened at this as a more seasoned pro. There's still a girl next door quality <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>a</b> sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. [...] All of our Shaes were hot as hell. But only a handful of them captured that other quality, maybe three out of twenty, and Sibel was the standout. [...] Watching those auditions, any red-blooded male would want to take every one of our Shae candidates to bed. But Sibel made you fall in love with her as well." ...|$|E

He rushes off to the scene and pleads the old lady to give Tom a second chance. When the police arrive, she tells them she made a prank call, which meant to give Tom another chance. Two days later, Mr. Yeo meets the conmen and gives them thousands of dollars of hell money; the conmen are then arrested by real police officers who have been waiting in ambush close by, and then Mr.Yeo heard the news of the big succeed with his company, which Tom and Mr.Yeo remain overjoyed.|$|E
