5|$|In Sonora, the {{hurricane}} destroyed 450homes and damaged another 5,000dwellings in Etchojoa and Huatabampo, which both have large Mayo Indian populations. The storm's precipitation flooded nearby agricultural fields, stopping wheat production, forcing local government to fumigate the region <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a dengue fever outbreak. In the Yaqui River valley, {{two people were}} killed, and another 70homes were destroyed by Henriette's winds. Throughout the state, 24,000families were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5000|$|...Not {{only is the}} {{destruction}} of Melos considered an example of realism {{but it is also}} pinpointed as an important example of genocide. This gives the impression that genocide can be explained in terms of realism. However, I find fault in this idea. Cases of genocide and realism do not generally go hand in hand. Therefore, because people are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find an explanation for genocide, they may turn to realism but realism as an answer leaves questions unanswered. This example of genocide is important when it comes <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> further genocides in the future and also when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find an explanation and solution <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> further genocides from taking place.|$|R

5|$|Some Black Hebrews renounced their American {{citizenship}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> more deportations. In 1990, Illinois legislators helped negotiate {{an agreement}} that resolved the Black Hebrews' legal status in Israel. Members of the group are permitted to work and have access to housing and social services. The Black Hebrews reclaimed their American citizenship and have received aid from the U.S. government, which helped them build a school and additional housing. In 2003 the agreement was revised, and the Black Hebrews were granted permanent residency in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game's history, TSR took {{no action}} against small publishers' {{production}} of D compatible material, and even licensed Judges Guild to produce D materials for several years, such as City State of the Invincible Overlord. This attitude {{changed in the}} mid-1980s when TSR took legal action <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> others from publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies. Although TSR took legal action against several publishers {{in an attempt to}} restrict third-party usage, it never brought any court cases to completion, instead settling out of court in every instance. TSR itself ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.|$|E
5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E

5|$|Habsburg saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa in July 1866, though she was not {{significantly}} engaged during the battle. In 1870, she was used {{in a show of}} force <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the Italian annexation of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the Franco-Prussian War, though the Italians took the city regardless. The ship's armament was revised several times in the 1870s and 1880s, before she was ultimately withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola in 1886. She served in this role until 1898 when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 18991900.|$|E
5|$|Hifz-ur Rahman saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War in 18771878, where she {{operated}} on the Danube <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Russian forces from crossing the river. While defending {{the port of}} Sulina, she engaged Russian gunboats in an inconclusive action. She was laid up for twenty years, until {{the outbreak of the}} Greco-Turkish War in 1897, which highlighted the badly deteriorated state of the Ottoman fleet. A large-scale reconstruction program was put in place, and Hifz-ur Rahman was rebuilt in the Imperial Arsenal in the early 1890s. Nevertheless, she saw no further service of any significance, and she was sold for scrap in 1909.|$|E

Herbert's identity remained hidden from many until the publication of E. Keble Chatterton's biography of the man - Amazing Adventure - in 1935. With that, The Times noted that Herbert had [...] "packed into his sea-life sufficient material for half-a-dozen thrillers".|$|R
40|$|Malaria, which kills {{more than}} one million people every year, {{including}} one child every 30 seconds, is rising steeply worldwide. For example, cases of malaria in South Africa have skyrocketed by over 1000 percent {{in the last five years}} alone. Current attempts to control this mosquito-borne plague, which debilitates an estimated 300 million people yearly, include anti-malarial drugs, especially for visitors to the infamous “Malaria Belt ” of sub-Saharan Africa, and pesticide-impregnated bed netting for residents of malaria-ridden countries. In addition <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> infection with prophylactics like this, public-health officials spray various pesticides indoors to repel, irritate, and kill the mosquito vectors of the disease.

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E
5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E

Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{remained}} in the Austro-Hungarian fleet for the next twenty years, but severely reduced naval budgets owing to Hungarian disinterest in naval matters led to an uneventful career.

They were rearmed with newer guns in 1874 and again in 1882. Both ships were converted for secondary duties in 1886, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max becoming a tender to the gunnery training school from 1889 to 1908, while Habsburg was employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola until 1898, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap. Erzherzog Ferdinand Max {{remained in}} the inventory until 1916 when she too was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The {{furniture}} store Haskins, which originated in Shepton Mallet in 1938, has its principal showroom in the High Street within Haskins Retail Centre, {{which also includes}} {{a number of others}} shops including Aldi supermarket, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home, Pavers Shoes and an outlet clothing store. Retail jobs in the town increased in number in 2006–7 when a new shopping development, including a large Tesco supermarket, a clothes store and other retailers, was constructed on a site just south of the town centre, which had once been a factory making Clarks shoes and later Doc Martens boots. This development attracted national media attention when protesters occupied the site <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the felling of an avenue of trees dating back to the 19th century. It has also divided opinion in the town, between those who hoped it would help to revitalise the town, and others who feared that local traders would be unable to compete, leading to a further decline of Shepton Mallet's High Street. There is also the Mulberry Factory Shop located on Kilver Street, near to the former Mulberry headquarters.|$|E
5000|$|Brought up by {{her mother}} to {{consider}} War as the greatest evil and appalled by the violence and brutality of the Nazi regime, Grant Duff committed herself <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a future war. Acting upon the advice of Arnold Toynbee, she sought to discover the cause of war by becoming a foreign correspondent. After her application was turned down by The Times, she moved to Paris, where she worked in Paris for a time under the Chicago Daily News Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Edgar Ansel Mowrer. Mowrer had reported from Europe since 1917 before living inside Germany from 1924 and, having a long personal knowledge of the Nazi leadership, was forced out of Berlin in June 1933 at the birth of Adolf Hitlers Third Reich. This leading American newspaper-man was of central importance to Grant Duff for disabusing her of the anti-Versailles Treaty assumptions she had learned at Oxford and from von Trott. Mowrer, who predicted World War II from 1933 and was labelled [...] "a sworn and proven enemy" [...] by the Nazi Press [...] gave further urgency and impetus to Grant Duff, and can be credited for the increasing antagonism she developed against the complacency displayed by von Trott in his relationships to noted [...] "appeasers" [...] of the 1930s.|$|R

5|$|The tunnel also suffers regular {{problems}} with strikes from over-height traffic, and vehicles {{running out of}} fuel. On 10 December 1996, a man drove a Mercedes truck supporting a crane towards the southbound tunnel, ignored warnings that his vehicle was over-height, and struck a gantry, breaking a steel reinforcement frame in the process. The entire tunnel was immediately closed, not only to retrieve the vehicle, but to perform additional safety checks. Because the Limehouse Link tunnel, which runs near to {{the north end of}} the Blackwall Tunnel, and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, part of the Dartford Crossing, were also closed on the same day, the accident caused one of the worst traffic jams in the capital. In February 2011, TfL reported that the tunnel had been closed 1,200 times in the previous year for a total of 157 hours, while New Civil Engineer magazine claimed it shut 1,448 times in 2010. <b>To</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> closures of this nature, an LED noticeboard was set up in the northbound approach, counting the number of breakdowns and accidents per month occurring inside the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{notified}} the McCann, Savage, and Farrell {{families of the}} deaths {{on the evening of}} 6 March. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of Sinn Féin, was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mairéad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. Northern Irish authorities flooded the neighbourhoods where McCann, Farrell and Savage had lived with soldiers and police <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> public displays of sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at. At the border, the authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between the police {{and the members of the}} procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse.|$|E

The mark for silver meeting the sterling standard of purity is the Lion Passant, but there have been other variations over the years, most notably the mark indicating Britannia purity. The Britannia standard was obligatory in Britain between 1697 and 1720 <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help <b>prevent</b> British sterling silver coins from being melted to make silver plate. It became an optional standard thereafter, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland is now denoted by the millesimal fineness hallmark [...] "958", with the symbol of Britannia being applied optionally.
