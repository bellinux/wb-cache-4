Potential patients are shifting to the role of customers more than ever. This paper analyses the hybridisation process that healthcare and business discourses are undergoing today. Through the study of healthcare selected websites as opposed to corporate ones, there emerges that not only has the language of business permeated healthcare communication, but that also companies are in turn employing some <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> ethically-related <b>communication</b> strategies traditionally belonging to the healthcare/medical domain. This is in part confirmed by the study carried out on the US institutional healthcare website (hhs. gov), a manifesto of Obama’s healthcare reform.

40|$|The {{development}} of the Riksbank’s <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> since its independence in 1999 is reviewed. The Riksbank’s record on the management of market expectations of future policy rates {{after the publication of}} policy-rate paths in February 2007 is examined, with a focus on the exceptional deviations of market expectations from published policy-rate paths since April 2009. The possible explanations discussed include differing views of future economic developments, communication challenges associated with very low interest rates and perhaps exaggerated lower-bound problems. The consequences of such large deviations of market expectations may be severe and potentially imply a much more restrictive monetary policy than intended. Whether the Riksbank’s <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> are sufficient for effective accountability and evaluation is assessed, and it is shown that tools are available for the effective real-time evaluation of the Riksbank’s policy. Some conclusions and suggestions for possible improvements in the Riksbank’s <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> are offered. JEL Classification: E 52, E 5...|$|E

The methods known from aeronautical and automotive industry such as concurrent engineering have often been referred to as possible way for radical process improvement of AEC industry, however the implementation of the so called integrated building design (IBD) in the planning practice has not succeeded yet. This paper will present the results of the multiple case study research of best-practice planning processes for five energy efficient buildings, with aim to determine the success factors, optimization potentials and deficits of the processes.

Interpretations of the significance of this movement, however, have differed widely. To some, inflation targeting mandates the single-minded, rule-like pursuit of price stability without regard for other policy objectives; to others, inflation targeting represents nothing more than the latest version of cheap talk by central banks unable to sustain monetary commitments. Advocates of inflation targeting, including the adopting central banks themselves, have expressed the view that the <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> of the inflation targeting framework grant the central bank greater short-run flexibility in pursuit of its long-run inflation goal. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe are interested, in this paper, in {{studying}} the effects that central banks exert on private sector forecasts by means of their <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> measures. We analyze the impact of central bank transparency on {{the accuracy of the}} consensus forecasts (usually calculated as the mean or the median of the forecasts from a panel of individual forecasters) for a series of macroeconomic variables: inflation, Real output growth and the current account as a share of GDP for 7 advanced economies. Interestingly, while it is found of significance of central bank <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> measures on forecasts themselves, there appear some limits of the same measures when we study their impact on forecast errors. Our findings, indeed, suggest that deviations of the economic forecast data from the realized ones (RGDP and the current account as a share of GDP) are a bit affected by the central bank transparency measures considered in the paper. Inflation forecast errors, especially, are not affected at all by those measures. A possible explanation (among others) could be attributed to the inefficiency of the mean forecasts. Inefficiency of the consensus forecasts is not a new issue from a theoretical point of view, but its empirical relevance is for the first time (to our knowledge) questioned on data extracted from the Economist poll of forecasters. More particularly, our paper extracts practical implications over the effectiveness of transparent announcements in forecast formation process. We rely on two noisy information models, though having different mechanisms (Kim et al, 2001; Morris and Shin, 2002) both of which are consistent with overweighting issue to explain the inefficiency of the consensus forecast...|$|E

The {{objective of the}} study is to evaluate the critical factors that can accomplish the project lead’s task to manage the project well. The root cause of software project failures is due to the problems in customer-supplier relations. An analysis of the literature suggests that the managing customer- supplier relations in tailored offshore software development have been relatively unexplored. Therefore, a detailed investigation of the critical factors in managing customer-supplier relations in offshore software development is presented. In this study we collected qualitative data through theme-based open-ended interviews, and analyzed it through a grounded theory approach.

40|$|This paper assesses {{inflation}} targeting {{in emerging}} market economies (EMEs), and develops applied prescriptions for {{the conduct of}} monetary policy and inflation-targeting design in EMEs. We verify that EMEs have faced more acute trade-offs - higher output and inflation volatility - and worse performance than developed economies. These results stem from more pronounced external shocks, lower credibility, and lower level of development of institutions in these countries. In order to improve their performance, we recommend high levels of <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> with the public and the development of more stable institutions. At an operational level, we propose a procedure that a central bank under inflation targeting can apply and communicate when facing strong supply shocks, and suggest a monitoring structure for an inflation-targeting regime under an IMF program. ...|$|E
40|$|Computer systems <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> {{technologies}} {{are making a}} strong and influential presence in the different fields of medicine. The cornerstone of a functional medical information system represents the electronic health records management system. Due to a very sensitive nature of medical information, such systems {{are faced with a}} number of stringent requirements, like security and confidentiality of patients' related data, different media types management, diversity of medical data that need to be processed etc. At present most clinical software systems are closed with little or no operability between them, and the medical information are locked in a variety of different incompatible databases. As the result of these facts, it is very hard for the developers to provide the solution for an integrated health computing environment, which would considerably improve the quality of medical care in general. This paper presents the framework for a functional EHR management system that meets these demands, but also follows the initiative taken by the Next Generation Network (NGN) approach, which includes user mobility, service <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> common <b>communication</b> platform for transferring and serving different types of information, services and media...|$|R
