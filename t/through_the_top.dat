5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of their skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
5|$|The area {{above the}} eyes, {{including}} the forehead, crown and nape, {{is a deep}} blue-black, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> edge of the mantle. The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning to a dark gray at the median, greater and primary coverts and the alula. The secondaries and inner primaries are fringed in gray-blue. The central rectrices are gray-blue, and the outer rectrices are a blackish-gray, paling towards the tips.|$|E
5|$|The main {{damage done}} by mole crickets is {{as a result of}} their {{burrowing}} activities. As they tunnel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> few centimetres of soil they push the ground up in little ridges, increasing evaporation of surface moisture, disturbing germinating seeds and damaging the delicate young roots of seedlings. They are also injurious to turf- and pasture-grasses as they feed on the roots of the grasses, leaving the plants prone to drying-out and damage by use.|$|E

5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown {{into the lower}} section of the furnace {{through a series of}} pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting {{from the top of the}} furnace. The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E

5|$|PlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed {{simply as}} PlayStation 4 or PS4) was {{unveiled}} on September 7, 2016. It is {{a revision of}} the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined form factor. The new casing is 40% smaller, and carries a rounded body with a matte finish {{on the top of}} the console rather than a two-tone finish. The two USB ports on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed. It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the light bar visible <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the touchpad and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black. The PS4 Slim was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price point as the original PS4 model. Its model number is CUH-2000.|$|E

25|$|Critics of {{the project}} {{proposed}} an eastern route, via Bayreuth and Hof through eastern Thuringia and western Saxony, with a connection from Leipzig and Dresden. This option and an option that would have run near the existing lines with an approximately 42kilometre-long tunnel through the Franconian Forest were examined and discarded. Others suggested an eight-kilometer tunnel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the crest.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} feature for the boiler is the vertical copper firebox (the large vessel {{to the right}} in the illustration here). Within the vertical vessel was the inner firebox and {{the space between the}} two was filled with water (to a level just about the same as the driver’s ankle). (Coke) fuel was added from the top, where a tube passed down <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the firebox. This firebox construction was not dissimilar to some types of vertical boiler, but this was only part of Ericsson’s design.|$|E

25|$|In operation, the {{bloomery}} is preheated {{by burning}} charcoal, and once hot, iron ore and additional charcoal are introduced <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> in a roughly one-to-one ratio. Inside the furnace, carbon monoxide from the incomplete combustion of the charcoal reduces the iron oxides in the ore to metallic iron, without melting the ore; {{this allows the}} bloomery to operate at lower temperatures than the melting temperature of the ore. Since the desired product of a bloomery is easily forgeable, nearly pure iron, with a low carbon content, the temperature and ratio of charcoal to iron ore must be carefully controlled to keep the iron from absorbing the carbon and becoming unforgeable. Limestone could also {{be added to the}} bloomery, about 10% of the ore weight, which would act as flux and help carry away impurities.|$|E
25|$|However, the War Office {{judged the}} Tett turret {{to be too}} cramped and not {{bulletproof}} against heavy fire, its isolated nature did not allow adequate command and control and the open top was vulnerable to a well-thrown grenade. The most striking feature was {{that the only way}} in and out was <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> – {{there was no way to}} escape without being exposed to enemy fire – it was to be a fight to the death. Burbridge went back to the drawing board and came up with a new version that instead of being positioned over a pipe was placed on a concrete slab over an underground chamber of brick or concrete slabs. This allowed access from a tunnel or slit trench to the rear. The company's brochure shows a wooden seat suspended from the turret by a metal frame.|$|E
25|$|The Solar Water Purifier, {{developed}} and manufactured by an Australian company, is a low-maintenance, low operational cost solution that {{is able to}} purify large amounts of water, even seawater, to levels better than human consumption standards set by the World Health Organization. This device works through the processes of evaporation and UV radiation. Light passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> layer of glass to the black plastic layer underneath. Heat from the solar radiation is trapped by the water and by the black plastic. This plastic layer {{is a series of}} connected troughs that separate the water as it evaporates and trickles down through the levels. The water is also subjected to UV radiation {{for an extended period of}} time as it moves through the device, which kills many bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. In a sunny, equatorial area like much of Africa, this device is capable of purifying up to 45 litres per day from a single array. Additional arrays may be chained together for more capacity.|$|E

25|$|Pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel {{consists}} of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into Zircaloy tubes that are bundled together. The Zircaloy tubes are about 1cm in diameter, and the fuel cladding gap {{is filled with}} helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179-264 fuel rods per fuel bundle and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters long. In PWR fuel bundles, control rods are inserted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> directly into the fuel bundle. The fuel bundles usually are enriched several percent in 235U. The uranium oxide is dried before inserting into the tubes to try to eliminate moisture in the ceramic fuel {{that can lead to}} corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. The Zircaloy tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet-cladding interaction which can lead to fuel rod failure over long periods.|$|E
25|$|There were {{problems}} of congestion at Smethwick {{caused by the}} time taken to traverse the locks and with supplying sufficient water to the summit level. John Smeaton was engaged to advise on a solution. He specified a 1000-yard cutting <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> eighteen feet of the summit, eliminating three locks from each end, and doubling {{the capacity of the}} descent at Smethwick locks by building a parallel flight of three locks, in use until the 1960s. The changes were made in two phases with a new cut to the side to remove two locks from each end and lower the summit by twelve feet, and then another parallel cut another six feet lower, removing another lock at each end and the provision of a parallel set of three locks at the Smethwick end. In 1790, after 2½ years the cutting was completed. The canal was closed for only 14 days. The lowered summit was at the Wolverhampton Level and simplified water supply. Water was also pumped from several local coal mines. The Spon Lane engine was removed and sold but the Smethwick Engine continued to be used to pump used water from the Birmingham Level.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the morning}} {{session of the}} {{previous}} day, England initially gave themselves some grounds for optimism. The wicket of Symonds fell early and only Warne provided any resistance as the tail was cleaned up, with Australia all out for 419 (a lead of 260). The originally bowler-friendly pitch appeared to have flattened out considerably, and the total did not appear as imposing {{as it might have}} otherwise been. Unfortunately for England the four Australia bowlers gave no quarter, and England went from 0/41 to 3/49 as the pacemen ripped <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> order. The pressure did not relent, and ultimately England succumbed midway through the final session to be all out for a mere 161 runs. The victory margin was an innings and 99 runs, giving Ponting his first innings victory in an Ashes test match, in what was clearly England's poorest performance of the series thus far. Brett Lee took his best wicket haul of the series with 4/87. Shane Warne was named Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 5/39 and 2/46, and his resilient 40* with the bat. Warne's dismissal of Harmison was also his 999th International wicket (combining Test and ODI wickets), leaving him one shy of becoming only the second player in history to reach the 1000th International wicket milestone (after Muttiah Muralitharan).|$|E
