5|$|<b>Tetrabenazine</b> was {{approved}} in 2008 {{for treatment of}} chorea in Huntington's disease in the US. Other drugs that help to reduce chorea include neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Compounds such as amantadine or remacemide are still under investigation but have shown preliminary positive results. Hypokinesia and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, can be treated with antiparkinsonian drugs, and myoclonic hyperkinesia can be treated with valproic acid.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} HD. Full-time care is {{required}} in the later stages of the disease. Treatments can relieve some symptoms and in some improve quality of life. The best evidence for treatment of the movement problems is with <b>tetrabenazine.</b> HD affects about 4 to 15 in 100,000 people of European descent. It is rare among Japanese, while the occurrence rate in Africa is unknown. The disease affects men and women equally. Complications such as pneumonia, heart disease, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy. Suicide {{is the cause of}} death in about 9% of cases. Death typically occurs fifteen to twenty years from when the disease was first detected.|$|E
25|$|Medications that {{impede the}} release of {{excitatory}} neurotransmitters {{have been used to}} control or prevent spasms. Treatment with intrathecal baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, decreases muscle tone and has been shown to decrease the frequency of muscle spasms in ADCP patients. <b>Tetrabenazine,</b> a drug commonly used in the treatment of Huntington's disease, {{has been shown to be}} effective treating chorea.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} {{characterized}} further by the gradual onset of defects in behavior and cognition, including dementia and speech impediments, {{beginning in the}} fourth or fifth decades of life. Death usually occurs within 10–20 years after a progressive worsening of symptoms. Caused by the Huntingtin gene, the disease eventually contributes to selective atrophy of the Caudate nucleus and Putamen, especially of GABAergic and acetylcholinergic neurons, with some additional degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices of the brain. The disrupted signaling in the basal ganglia network is thought to cause the hyperkinesia. There is no known cure for Huntington’s Disease, yet there is treatment available to minimize the hyperkinetic movements. Dopamine blockers, such as haloperidol, <b>tetrabenazine,</b> and amantadine, are often effective in this regard.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{prescribing}} {{medication for}} these conditions which often resolve spontaneously, recommendations {{have pointed to}} improved skin hygiene, good hydration via fluids, good nutrition, and installation of padded bed rails with use of proper mattresses. [...] Pharmacological treatments include the typical neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol and perphenazine which block dopamine receptors; these are {{the first line of}} treatment for hemiballismus. [...] Quetiapine, sulpiride and olanzapine, the atypical neuroleptic agents, are less likely to yield drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. [...] <b>Tetrabenazine</b> works by depleting presynaptic dopamine and blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, while reserpine depletes the presynaptic catecholamine and serotonin stores; both of these drugs treat hemiballismus successfully but may cause depression, hypotension and parkinsonism. [...] Sodium valproate and clonazepam have been successful in a limited number of cases. Stereotactic ventral intermediate thalamotomy and use of a thalamic stimulator {{have been shown to be}} effective in treating these conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of tics {{present in}} {{conditions}} such as Tourette’s syndrome begins with patient, relative, teacher and peer education about {{the presentation of the}} tics. [...] Sometimes, pharmacological treatment is unnecessary and tics can be reduced by behavioral therapy such as habit-reversal therapy and/or counseling. [...] Often this route of treatment is difficult because it depends most heavily on patient compliance. [...] Once pharmacological treatment is deemed most appropriate, lowest effective doses should be given first with gradual increases. [...] The most effective drugs belong to the neuroleptic variety such as monoamine-depleting drugs and dopamine receptor-blocking drugs. [...] Of the monoamine-depleting drugs, <b>tetrabenazine</b> is most powerful against tics and results in fewest side effects. [...] A non-neuroleptic drug found to be safe and effective in treating tics is topiramate. Botulinum toxin injection in affected muscles can successfully treat tics; involuntary movements and vocalizations can be reduced, as well as life-threatening tics that have the potential of causing compressive myelopathy or radiculopathy. Surgical treatment for disabling Tourette’s syndrome has been proven effective in cases presenting with self-injury. [...] Deep Brain Stimulation surgery targeting the globus pallidus, thalamus and other areas of the brain may be effective in treating involuntary and possibly life-threatening tics.|$|E
50|$|On December 6, 2007 Prestwick Pharmaceuticals {{presented}} {{information to}} the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding <b>tetrabenazine.</b> <b>Tetrabenazine</b> was a drug that helped treat chorea, a symptom associated with Huntington’s disease. Wexler posted a note of action to her Hereditary Disease Foundation regarding the safety of this drug. In her letter, Wexler stated that she would speak {{in front of the}} FDA committee regarding her own personal experience with HD and why she believed <b>tetrabenazine</b> could benefit those with HD. Until this point, there were no approved treatments in the United States for chorea associated with HD. She urged patients suffering from chorea to speak to the potential for this much needed use of <b>tetrabenazine.</b> It was with the aid of Nancy Wexler that <b>tetrabenazine</b> was able to be approved by the FDA.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tetrabenazine</b> is a {{drug for}} the {{symptomatic}} treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders. It is marketed under the trade names Nitoman in Canada and Xenazine in New Zealand, some parts of Europe and in the United States as an orphan drug. On August 15, 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of <b>tetrabenazine</b> to treat chorea associated with Huntington's disease. Although other drugs had been used [...] "off label," [...] <b>tetrabenazine</b> was the first approved treatment for Huntington's disease in the U.S. The compound has been known since the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{mechanism}} of action of <b>tetrabenazine</b> is unknown. Its anti-chorea effect {{is believed to be}} due to a reversible depletion of monoamines such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine from nerve terminals. <b>Tetrabenazine</b> reversibly inhibits vesicular monoamine transporter 2, resulting in decreased uptake of monamines into synaptic vesicles, as well as depletion of monoamine storage.|$|E
5000|$|Deutetrabenazine is a deuterated {{version of}} <b>tetrabenazine.</b> The non-deuterated version of <b>tetrabenazine</b> is an {{approved}} drug for the involuntary movements in Huntington’s disease, however its short half-life limits its clinical efficacy. Deutetrabenazine has a longer half-life than the parent drug and has completed clinical trials. The United States Food and Drug Administration approved it in April 2017.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Joseph Jankovic, Professor of Neurology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, was {{featured}} in USA Today in 2008 for his work to obtain FDA approval to treat people with Huntington's disease with the drug <b>tetrabenazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dihydrotetrabenazine or DTBZ is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula C19H29NO3. It {{is a close}} analog of <b>tetrabenazine.</b> DTBZ and its derivatives, when labeled with positron emitting isotopes such as carbon-11 and fluorine-18, are used as PET radioligands for examining VMAT2.|$|E
5000|$|Chemically, deutetrabenazine is an {{isotopic isomer}} of <b>tetrabenazine</b> in which six {{hydrogen}} atoms {{have been replaced}} by deuterium atoms. The incorporation of deuterium slows the rate of drug metabolism, allowing less frequent dosing. [...] In May, 2017, published data showed deutetrabenazine effective in tardive dyskinesia.|$|E
50|$|Reserpine (RES), Methoxytetrabenazine (MTBZ), and {{the drug}} Amiodarone bind to the RES binding site conformation. <b>Tetrabenazine</b> (TBZ, also called Nitoman and Xenazine), Dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZOH), Ketanserin (KET), {{and the drug}} Lobeline bind to the TBZ binding site/conformation. Amphetamine, methamphetamine and GZ-7931 are also known to {{interact}} with VMAT2.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the {{condition}} include not using or using the lowest possible dose of neuroleptics. Treatment include stopping the neuroleptic medication if possible or switching to clozapine. Other medications such as valbenazine, <b>tetrabenazine,</b> or botulinum toxin {{may be used to}} lessen the symptoms. With treatment some see a resolution of symptoms while others do not.|$|E
50|$|Medications that {{impede the}} release of {{excitatory}} neurotransmitters {{have been used to}} control or prevent spasms.

50|$|VMAT2 is {{believed}} to possess at least two distinct binding sites, which are characterized by <b>tetrabenazine</b> (TBZ) and reserpine binding to the transporter. Amphetamine (TBZ site) and methamphetamine (reserpine site) bind at distinct sites on VMAT2 to inhibit its function. VMAT2 inhibitors like <b>tetrabenazine</b> and reserpine reduce the concentration of monoamine neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft by inhibiting uptake through VMAT2; the inhibition of VMAT2 uptake by these drugs prevents the storage of neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles and reduces the quantity of neurotransmitters that are released through exocytosis. Although many substituted amphetamines induce the release of neurotransmitters from vesicles through VMAT2 while inhibiting uptake through VMAT2, they facilitate the release of monoamine neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft by simultaneously reversing the direction of transport through the primary plasma membrane transport proteins for monoamines (i.e., the dopamine transporter, norepinephrine transporter, and serotonin transporter) in monoamine neurons. Other VMAT2 inhibitors such as GZ-793A inhibit the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine, but without producing stimulant or reinforcing effects themselves.|$|E
50|$|Two known binding {{sites for}} VMAT inhibitors include the Reserpine (RES) binding {{site and the}} <b>Tetrabenazine</b> (TBZ) binding site. Some {{evidence}} suggests these two sites may overlap or may actually exist as two separate conformations of the same binding site. VMAT inhibitors tend to fall into two classes; those that interact with the RES binding site and those that interact with the TBZ binding site.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetrabenazine</b> was {{approved}} in 2008 {{for treatment of}} chorea in Huntington's disease in the US. Other drugs that help to reduce chorea include neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Compounds such as amantadine or remacemide are still under investigation but have shown preliminary positive results. Hypokinesia and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, can be treated with antiparkinsonian drugs, and myoclonic hyperkinesia can be treated with valproic acid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second step}} in the {{treatment}} process is medication. The medications focus on the chemicals released by neurotransmitters in the nervous system, which control muscle movement. The medications {{on the market today}} are anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, baclofen, dopaminergic agents/dopamine-depleting agents, and <b>tetrabenazine.</b> [...] Each medication is started on a low dosage and gradually increased to higher doses as the disease progresses and the side effects are known for the individual.|$|E
50|$|Oxypertine (Equipertine, Forit, Integrin, Lanturil, Lotawin, Opertil) is an {{antipsychotic}} used in {{the treatment}} of schizophrenia. It was also evaluated for the treatment of anxiety at a dosage of 20 mg per day. Chemically, it is an indole derivative similarly to molindone {{and a member of the}} phenylpiperazine class. Like reserpine and <b>tetrabenazine,</b> oxypertine depletes catecholamines, though not serotonin, possibly underlying its neuroleptic efficacy. The molecular structure is strongly similar to solypertine and milipertine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetrabenazine</b> (TBZ) and Dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZOH) are {{believed}} to bind to a different binding site from the RES/substrate binding site, or to a different conformation of the RES/substrate binding site. This site {{is believed to be}} located at the N-terminus, based on studies done in bovine VMAT2. Tyrosine-434 and aspartate-461 are identified as being responsible for the high-affinity interaction of TBZ, serotonin, and histamine in VMAT2. Unlike methamphetamine, amphetamine binds to the TBZ site on hVMAT2.|$|E
50|$|Due to neuroferritinopathy’s genetic etiology, the {{disorder}} is not currently curable. Furthermore, progression of {{the disorder}} is unable to be effectively halted. Therefore current treatment focuses on managing symptoms of the disorder. No medication is available to treat all symptoms. Botox {{has been shown to}} help with focal dystonia. The dopamine depleter <b>Tetrabenazine</b> shown to help with involuntary movements. Symptoms affecting movement (dystonia) have also been treated with L-Dopa, orphenadrine, benzhexol, sulpiride, diazepam, clonazepam, and deanol. Parkinsonian symptoms were not decreased by L-Dopa. Iron supplements should be avoided.|$|E
5000|$|An {{effective}} treatment {{has yet to}} be found. In many cases electrical stimulation of the globus pallidus has been shown to produce improvement of dystonia severity, however it has not been shown to delay neurodegeneration. [...] There is often overlap in the phenotypes of the symptoms both between different NBIA disorders and between NBIA and other disorders, leading to misdiagnoses. [...] Treatments typically treat or ameliorate the symptoms and do not address the accumulation of iron. [...] Psychotherapy, such as dopaminergic drugs, anticholinergics, <b>tetrabenazine,</b> is often used to treat the symptoms but does not improve the long term outcome of the patient.|$|E
5000|$|NMS {{may also}} occur in people taking dopaminergic drugs (such as levodopa) for Parkinson's disease, most often when the drug dosage is {{abruptly}} reduced. In addition, other drugs with anti-dopaminergic activity, {{such as the}} antiemetic metoclopramide, can induce NMS. [...] Even drugs without known anti-dopaminergic activity {{have been associated with}} NMS; examples include amoxapines and lithium. Also, desipramine, dothiepin, phenelzine, <b>tetrabenazine,</b> and reserpine have been known to trigger NMS. At the molecular level, NMS is caused by a sudden, marked reduction in dopamine activity, either from withdrawal of dopaminergic agents or from blockade of dopamine receptors.|$|E
5000|$|Several [...] reuptake inhibitors of VMATs {{are known}} to exist, {{including}} reserpine (RES), <b>tetrabenazine</b> (TBZ), dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZOH), and ketanserin (KET). It is thought that RES exhibits competitive inhibition, binding to the same site as the monoamine substrate, {{as studies have shown}} that it can be displaced via introduction of norepinephrine. TBZ, DTBZOH, and KET are thought to exhibit non-competitive inhibition, instead binding to allosteric sites and decreasing the activity of the VMAT rather than simply blocking its substrate binding site. [...] It has been found that these inhibitors are less effective at inhibiting VMAT1 than VMAT2, and the inhibitory effects of the tetrabenazines on VMAT1 is negligible.|$|E
