40|$|<b>Torsional</b> <b>moment</b> {{develops}} in structural concrete members {{as a result}} of asymmetrical loading or member geometry, or {{as a result of}} structural fram-ing. For example, spandrel beams built integrally with the floor slab are subject to <b>torsional</b> <b>moment</b> resulting from the restraining negative bending moment at the exte-rior end of the slab. The restraining moment is proportional to the torsional stiffness of the spandrel beam. In complex structures such as helical stairways, curved beams, and eccen-trically loaded box beams, torsional effects dominate the structural behavior. <b>Torsional</b> <b>moment</b> tends to twist the structural member around its longitudinal axis, inducing shear stresses. However, structural members are rarely subjected to pure <b>torsional</b> <b>moment.</b> In most cases, torsional moments act concurrently with bending moment and shear forces.

However, there is no systematic comparison of simplified beam analyses and three-dimensional plate analyses so far. In this paper, simplified beam analyses and three-dimensional plate analyses are systematically compared by considering a plate structure under wind loads. Numerical analysis shows that <b>torsional</b> <b>moments</b> from beam analyses are quite different from those from plate analyses and member forces along width directions cannot be exactly calculated from beam analyses.

40|$|Flight {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} with a medium-size single-rotor helicopter, one blade of which was equipped with strain gages, to deter-mine the effects of retreating-blade stall on the rotor blade bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>moments</b> during high-speed flight and pull-up maneuvers. The results indicate that retreating-blade stall has a substantial effect on the periodic rotor blade moments. In the stalled condition, the higher harmonics can become almost as large numerically and as impor-tant from a fatigue standpoint as the lower harmonics. Since these increased <b>moments,</b> particularly the <b>torsional</b> <b>moments,</b> cause increased periodic control loads and increased vibration in the helicopter control system, they may tend to restrict the normal operating l&nits of futnre high-performance helicopters unless an adequate combination of means to reduce these moments and means to design for their fatigue effects is devised...|$|R
40|$|In skew bridges torsion occurs. This {{leads to}} a {{substantial}} amount of reinforcement stirrups. Minalu already did research to torsion in bridge decks with different types of finite element models. The question when torsion cracks will really occur is still unanswered. This question is the main subject of this research. The focus of the research is on a skew bridge with a skew angle of 45 degrees. In that bridge the largest <b>torsional</b> <b>moments</b> will occur. Beside that also a straight bridge is analysed, the <b>torsional</b> <b>moments</b> in a straight bridge are always lower than in a skew one under the same loading. The loads of Eurocode 1991 - 2 are used. Two important load configurations governing for <b>torsional</b> <b>moments</b> and shear force are used: a configuration which is used in daily practice at Spanbeton and a configuration developed by Minalu. An attempt is made to model the whole bridge including physically non-linear behaviour with the program ATENA 3 D to analyse the torsion effects. With the current state-of-the-art modelling technology that appeared to be impossible. For that reason a simplified model is developed to simulate the stress state and cracking in one ZIP girder. It was concluded {{that it is important to}} use more quadratic elements over the thickness of the web to obtain correct torsion shear stresses. From the simplified model it is concluded that, despite some shortcomings, clearly a substantial length at the ends of the girder is uncracked. To be sure that the computer model is correct a calculation of the principal stresses is carried out at the ultimate limit state. The stresses due to prestressing, own weight and the weight of the fresh poured concrete can be calculated by hand. The calculation of the force distribution of the loads on the deck can be carried out using finite element methods. Scia Engineer (orthotropic plate model) and ATENA 3 D (volume elements) are used for this calculation. Especially the determination of the <b>torsional</b> <b>moments</b> from ATENA by using an analysis of the rotations is interesting. This calculation results in the <b>torsional</b> <b>moments,</b> bending moments en shear forces acting on the ends of the girder. The main conclusion of this research is that in ultimate limit state no cracking will occur in the end of the considered girder in the skew bridge. This means that only the minimal shear reinforcement must be applied and the full torsional stiffness can be used in finite element calculations. A practical method to check this for other bridges using ZIP-girders is proposed. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Studies on wind-induced torsional loads on low buildings are very limited. Wind-induced torsion provisions in the American Society of Civil Engineers Standard (ASCE/SEI 7 - 10, 2010), the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC, 2010), and the European Code (EN 1991 - 1 - 4, 2005) were reviewed and compared for three gabled-roof (18. 4 °) low buildings.

Most of the time aramid fiber is used as an externally bonded reinforcement to increase flexural and shear strength of RC beams.

Brittle failure of structures occurs due to <b>torsional</b> <b>moment.</b> Different patterns of aramid fiber strips are selected to wrap around RC beams and torsional behavior of these strengthened beams is studied.

However, not all the collected beams can be considered trustworthy for {{the comparative}} analysis focused on their global behavior (not only for the resistance torque).

Previous studies have show n that, ignoring <b>torsional</b> <b>moment</b> may lead to brittle shear failure of the columns triggering collapse of the entire {{or part of the}} bridge structure. Therefore, rational models n e ed to be developed to consider the effect of torsion in the design of RC bridge columns. Performance based seis mic design is an emerging design concept which calls for accurate prediction of the hysteresis behavior of structural elements to ensure safe and sustainable design under earthquake loadi ng. However, very few investigations in the past focused on the development of analytical model to accurately predict the response of RC members under cyclic torsion.

Hysteresis models taking into account pinching and stiffness degradation effect under cyclic torsional loading are scarce.

A five-storey three-dimensional steel structure with asymmetry in both horizontal directions is assumed as the basic model. A parametric study shows that assuming an L-shaped plan for the buildings leads to more critical results. The eccentricity of the L-plan building is changed {{to a wide range of}} plan dimensions. Seven ground motions are selected based on the site specifications and the distance of the site to the fault rupture. The mean peak responses are compared to the corresponding responses of the fixed base system to investigate the effectiveness of base isolation. They are also compared with those of the corresponding symmetric system to highlight the effect of torsional coupling. The effects of the center of stiffness of the isolation system being coincident with the superstructure’s center of mass are investigated as a technique for reducing the response. The <b>torsional</b> <b>moments</b> are shown to be reduced even in cases with large structural eccentricities and the response reduction has a greater impact in the lower storeys. When the superstructure’s center of mass coincides with the base-isolation system’s center of stiffness, this causes a reduction in the relative displacement of the exterior edges, the storey rotation and the amount of damage. Therefore, eliminating asymmetry at the base level is proposed as a practical tool to enhance the performance of asymmetric base-isolated buildings...|$|R
