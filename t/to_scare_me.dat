2500|$|In 1999, {{undercover}} MCSO deputies arrested James Saville, then 18 years old, {{and charged}} him with plotting to kill Arpaio with a pipe bomb. A local television station had been tipped off to the arrest by the MCSO, and broadcast footage of the arrest that evening. The MCSO {{held a news conference}} shortly after the arrest, and Arpaio appeared in interviews on local television stations, saying [...] "If they think they are going <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> away with bombs and everything else, it's not going to bother me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Been hiding there, have you?" [...] said Lingard. [...] "Well, {{what do you}} want? Speak out, {{confound}} you. You did {{not come}} here <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> to death, for fun, did you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Crack! Crack! Crack... The reports {{rang out}} in quick succession. A bullet whistled over me, another struck the gravel {{and sent a}} shower of dust into my face. I pitched my rifle up over the bank and began to dig my fingers and toes into the loose ground. As I gained the top two more bullets sang past my head so close that I knew Bill was aiming <b>to</b> more than <b>scare</b> <b>me.</b> I dragged myself over the edge and was safe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, take a rest! The man slaves harder every year. It {{used to be}} so that he'd take {{a little}} time off now and then; but I declare, he hardly ever seems to breathe now away from his office. And this year he says he doesn't intend to go down to Lapham, except to see after the works for a few days. I don't {{know what to do with}} the man any more! Seems as if the more money he got, the more he wanted <b>to</b> get. It <b>scares</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think what would happen to him if he lost it. I know one thing," [...] {{concluded}} Mrs. Lapham. [...] "He shall not go back to the office to-day." ...|$|R
500|$|The American poet Robert Frost {{expressed}} his bleak thoughts in his poem, Desert Places, which {{ends with the}} stanza [...] "They cannot <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> with their empty spaces / Between stars - on stars where no human race is. / I have it in me so much nearer home / <b>To</b> <b>scare</b> myself with my own desert places." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heh!" [...] ejaculated Mombi, {{giving a}} sort of grunt; [...] "that rascally boy has been playing tricks again! Very good! ve--ry good! I'll beat him black- and-blue for trying <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> in this fashion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your enemies {{might find}} some harsher name for it," [...] said Astley with a sneer. [...] "Nay, {{you need not}} think <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> by glaring at me, Sir Robert, nor will your ill-pleasure change my thoughts. I have faced fiercer eyes than thine, and I have not feared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help {{it if he}} does," [...] said Danny stoutly. [...] "You get out of here, Sam French, and don't {{be trying}} <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me.</b> I mean to be honest, and how can I be if I don't own up to Mr. Walters that I've been {{stealing}} his trout all summer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Let me {{tell you}} one thing. I'd sooner feed mush and milk to feebs than milk cows with the frost on the ground. Mrs. Bopp was <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> let <b>me</b> play with her children. And I was scared, too. They used to make faces at me when nobody was looking, and call me [...] "Looney." [...] Everybody called me Looney Tom. And the other boys in the {{neighbourhood}} threw rocks at me. You never see anything {{like that in the}} Home here. The feebs are better behaved.|$|R
5000|$|The play {{consists}} of 17 scenes which are presented out of order. This is particularly unique for Ridley {{as the majority}} of his plays adhere mostly to Aristotle’s unities of drama, where the play’s action takes place in one location and spans out in real time. When interviewed about the play Ridley explained: “Something started <b>to</b> happen that <b>scared</b> <b>me</b> and excited me in equal measure in that I liked what I was doing but found it was telling a more interesting story when I started to break the narrative. And I thought: yes… chronologically is only one way to tell a story, and there’s another story waiting to be told here, which is to really deconstruct the whole story and just present these little fragments of it, and not only leave huge gaps between each fragment but then rearrange the fragments so that they tell another story.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{serial killer}} storyline {{received}} a huge surge in viewers with 624,000 {{tuning in to}} see Joey revealed as the killer and over 600,000 tuning into the characters demise. The accurate portrayal of Joey led many to fear for Barker's safety, and for producer Jason Daniel to ensure Barker will be kept safe from angry fans. Barker hoped his portrayal would influence viewers, stating; [...] "Grandmothers are going to hate me, kids are going <b>to</b> be <b>scared</b> of <b>me,</b> teenagers {{are going to think}} I'm hilarious - hopefully, and all those cynical people who don't like Shortland Street, but have got stuck into watching it, I think they'll appreciate it." [...] The storyline was referred to as a [...] "water cooler" [...] topic.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know now}} what you meant," [...] the girl cried gayly, raising herself and looking into his face; [...] "you were trying <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me,</b> and make me show how much I--cared for you--first!" [...] There was a soft smile on her lips and a tender light in her eyes. [...] "But I don't mind it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm doubtful," [...] Jim replied. [...] "Somehow I {{feel the}} fellow was bluffing; he wanted <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> so I'd agree to his terms. Although I reckon {{he meant to}} charge me high when I came to him next time, I don't think he sent the log down. I haven't much ground for the conclusion, but there it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't you try {{to smooth}} it over!" [...] snarled Aaron Poole. [...] "I know you of old, Dave Porter! You are always up to some underhanded tricks. Nat knows you, too! Maybe you didn't mean to kill me, but you meant <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me,</b> and you took a big chance, for I might have been hit. I think I'll swear out a warrant for your arrest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anything happens! What do you mean?" [...] Janet's {{words had}} frightened Lise, the {{withdrawal}} of Janet's opposition bewildered her. But above all, she was cowed by the sudden change in Janet herself, by the attitude of steely determination eloquent of an animus persons of Lise's type are incapable of feeling, and which to them is therefore incomprehensible. [...] "Nothing's {{going to happen to}} me," [...] she whined. [...] "The place is all right--he'd be <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> send <b>me</b> there if it wasn't. It costs something, too. Say, you ain't going to tell 'em at home?" [...] she cried with a fresh access of alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what {{happened}} to his grandfather?" [...] broke out St. John, filling out another bumper. [...] "Here's to the greatest monarch England ever saw; here's to the Englishman that made a kingdom of her. Our great King came from Huntingdon, not Hanover; our fathers didn't look for a Dutchman to rule us. Let him come and we'll keep him, and we'll show him Whitehall. If he's a traitor let us have him here to deal with him; and then there are spirits here as great as any that have gone before. There are men here that can look at danger in the face and not be frightened at it. Traitor! treason! what names are these <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> you and <b>me?</b> Are all Oliver's men dead, or his glorious name forgotten in fifty years? Are there no men equal to him, think you, as good--ay, as good? God save the King! and, if the monarchy fails us, God save the British Republic!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Throsby later {{recalled}} {{the death of}} her brother [...] "I was 17 when he died and I had one exam left in my HSC. I went to the exam and did all that stuff because I thought you had to keep on doing that stuff and I didn't stop... Those things affect you. I think it has made <b>me</b> <b>scared.</b> It made <b>me</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> travel because he died when he was in Bangkok. It made <b>me</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> get on a motorcycle, which I've never done. It made <b>me</b> <b>scared</b> when other people travel away from me." [...] After earning a B.A. degree (major in English) from the University of Sydney, Throsby worked at an art house video store for several years and travelled overseas, including living in Austin, Texas for six months.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{must take}} the chances," [...] {{declared}} Savine. [...] "While {{there was a man}} I could trust to handle things, I let this weakness master me. Now the poor fellow's helpless, somebody must take hold before chaos ensues, and I haven't quite forgotten everything. You'll have to nurse Geoffrey, and it's no use trying <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me.</b> Fill my big flask with the old brandy and get my furs out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he {{answered}} with impatience, [...] "this is all hailstones and burnt grass" [...] (meaning {{that the one}} would melt and the other blow away, or in our English idiom, stuff and rubbish). [...] "Why are you always trying <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> with your fancies, Allan? Dingaan is our friend, not our enemy. So let us take the gifts that fortune gives us and be thankful. Come, march." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You women cer'nly are a sketch!" [...] he caroled. [...] "Going back to mamma, are you? Sure! That's {{what the}} first Mrs. Schwirtz was always doing. Let's see. Once she {{got as far as}} the depot before she came back and {{admitted}} that she was a chump. I doubt if you get that far. You'll stop on the step. You're too tightwad to hire a taxi, even to try <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> and make it unpleasant for me." ...|$|E

[...] "See here, mister! he cried, with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes, [...] "you're not trying <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> over this, are you? If the lady is hurt {{as bad as you}} say, who was it that wrote this note?" [...] He tossed it forward on to the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless your heart, no! It was all {{a mistake}} of old Mr. Chadwick's.

60|$|But I fixed him. I lacerated his {{feelings}} and pride several dollars' worth. He tried <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>me</b> {{by threatening to}} come in after me and kick the stuffing out of me. In return, I promised to kick {{him in the face}} while he was climbing in. The advantage of position was with me, and he saw it. So he kept the door shut and called for help {{from the rest of the}} train-crew. I could hear them answering and crunching through the gravel to him. And all the time the other door was unlatched, and they didn't know it; and in the meantime the gay-cat was ready to die with fear.|$|E
