40|$|The {{purpose of}} this audit was to review the Department`s {{acquisition}} and use of support <b>service</b> <b>contractors</b> and subcontractors. The audit objectives were {{to determine if the}} Department (1) paid fees to both support <b>service</b> <b>contractors</b> and subcontractors for services exclusively performed by subcontractors, (2) used support <b>service</b> <b>contractors</b> to perform inherent government functions, and (3) rolled over unearned award fees to subsequent evaluation periods and had adequate management controls to ensure that contractor performance would be evaluated. The Department did not always obtain support services in the most economical and effective manner. The Department negotiated and paid four of six support <b>service</b> <b>contractors</b> an estimated $ 5. 1 million in fees for services exclusively provided by subcontractors because the Department did not have a policy which addressed the inclusion, at the pre-award phase, of subcontract labor in the support service contractors` fee determinations. Furthermore, while the authors found no instances where support <b>service</b> <b>contractors</b> performed inherent government functions, they did note that the Department maintained minimal administration over major portions of contracted-for services on three of six support service contracts. This occurred because contractors subcontracted extensively for support services. Consequently, the Department may have decreased their ability to control cost growth on these three contracts. As discussed in Part 4, the Department`s process was sufficient in five of six cases to evaluate support <b>service</b> <b>contractor</b> performance. However, one of six cost-plus-award-fee contractors received award fees that exceeded its performance ratings by $ 89, 000 because one Departmental office elected to rollover unearned portions of fees from prior evaluation periods and make them available in the next evaluation period...|$|R

40|$|Transport is {{a crucial}} {{component}} in logistics, which joints each activity in the logistics chain. The performance of logistics heavily relies on the efficiency of <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> However, until now {{there has not been}} a clear definition about <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, along with the rapid rise of fuel prices, the input-output ratio of transport has been trapped in an unreasonable situation, which causes the poor performance of logistics. Therefore, the research on <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> and <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> efficiency is urgently required. In this paper, we propose to use semantic web technologies to construct a conceptual model of <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> and thus present a clear structure of the <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> hierarchy. Furthermore, we propose a semantic search engine based on this <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> ontology, in order to provide an efficient tool for users to query <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> providers. This design can also be seen as a potentially alternative approach for solving the issue of <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> inefficiency...|$|R

This research analyses {{the development of}} rural <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> in Kemalang Sub-district, Klaten District, Central Java Province using qualitative research method and Case Study research approach. Primary data were collected by in-depth interviewing of 26 respondents, which was supported by secondary data from institutional survey. <b>Transport</b> <b>service</b> development was reviewed in three development stages; those are before 1990, 1990 - 2005 and 2005 - 2010. There have been alterations in the dominant <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> used during those three periods, from non-motorized private <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> to motorized public <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> and then to private <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> of motorcycles. That development has led to positive changes {{in the character of}} <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> such as the increase of <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> availability, flexibility and capability in solving nature’s restrictions, so that they promote mobility and accessibility.

40|$|For most {{applications}} {{the used}} <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> providers are predetermined {{during the development}} of the application. This makes it difficult to consider the application communication requirements and to exploit specific features of the network technology. Specialized protocols that are more efficient and offer a qualitative improved service are typically not supported by most applications because they are not commonly available. In this paper we propose a concept for the realization of protocol independent <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Only a <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> is predetermined during {{the development of the}} application and an appropriate <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> provider is dynamically selected at run time. This enables to exploit specialized protocols if possible, but standard protocols could still be used if necessary. The main focus of this paper is how a <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> could provide a new <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> provider transparently to existing applications. A prototype is presented that maps TCP/IP based applications to an ATM specific <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> provider which offers a reliable and unreliable <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> like TCP/IP...|$|R
