5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Pollack’s career {{led into}} politics. A summer {{internship}} with the American Jewish Congress prompted a one-year role with the AJC. He {{worked as a}} lobbyist on legislation <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> religious headwear for active military personal in noncombat settings. Pollack then relocated to Los Angeles to work for Winner & Associates, a leading political public relations firm. He was assigned to consult the Major Baseball League during the labor strife in the early-1990s. The inception of Pollack’s career in sports business occurred in 1992 when he realized—while flying from LA to New York—that there was a niche {{to fill in the}} industry.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{there was}} strong {{interest}} in discovering a Northwest Passage <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> navigation between the Atlantic (or inland North America) and the Pacific Ocean. Many ships in the area, especially those under Spanish and British command, searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to Hudson Bay or the Missouri River. The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of Bruno de Heceta, who in 1775 sighted the river's mouth. On {{the advice of his}} officers, he did not explore it, as he was short-staffed and the current was strong. He considered it a bay, and called it Ensenada de Asunción. Later Spanish maps based on his discovery showed a river, labeled Rio de San Roque, or an entrance, called Entrada de Hezeta. Following Heceta's reports, British maritime fur trader Captain John Meares searched for the river in 1788 but concluded that it did not exist. He named Cape Disappointment for the non-existent river, not realizing the cape marks the northern edge of the river's mouth.|$|E

United States.|$|E
25|$|Caledonian opposed BUA's {{advocacy}} of large-scale route transfers from the corporations. Rather than creating {{spheres of influence}} between the corporations and the independents, it advocated organic development through new licensing opportunities <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> competition with the corporations on an equal footing, especially on North Atlantic routes, and security of tenure upon which to build a sound economic future.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, {{the members}} of the Saskatchewan Older Boys' Parliament debated a {{resolution}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> young women to join the organisation. One of the members at the time was former Saskatchewan premier Lorne Calvert, who gave a (reportedly tongue in cheek) speech against admitting female members. It was not until 1972 that females and non-Christians were allowed to join. At that time, the name was changed to Saskatchewan Youth Parliament.|$|E

25|$|From 1929 to 1933, the {{industrial}} economy had {{been suffering from}} a vicious cycle of deflation. Since 1931, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, {{the voice of the}} nation's organized business, promoted an anti-deflationary scheme <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> trade associations to cooperate in government-instigated cartels to stabilize prices within their industries. While existing antitrust laws clearly forbade such practices, organized business found a receptive ear in the Roosevelt Administration.|$|E
25|$|When Stanton {{introduced}} a resolution at the National Woman's Rights Convention in 1860 favoring more lenient divorce laws, leading abolitionist Wendell Phillips not only opposed it but attempted {{to have it}} removed from the record. When Stanton, Anthony, and others supported a bill before the New York legislature <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> divorce in cases of desertion or inhuman treatment, Horace Greeley, an abolitionist newspaper publisher, campaigned against it {{in the pages of}} his newspaper.|$|E
25|$|Dorval {{and other}} {{suburban}} communities challenged the province's legislation before the Quebec Superior Court, which rejected their submission in June 2001. Following this, Yeomans led Dorval council {{in bringing the}} case forward to the Quebec Court of Appeal; this court also ruled against the anti-merger claimants in October 2001. In late 2001, Yeomans announced his support for a proposal sponsored by opposition Quebec Liberal leader Jean Charest <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> municipalities to withdraw from forced amalgamations.|$|E

25|$|During the 20th century, several {{efforts were}} made to declare Florida as a municipality. First, on April 14, 1949, House Representative Francisco Díaz Marchand {{presented}} a project to create a legislative commission that would study the economic and social conditions of the barrio, to determine the suitability of it as an independent municipality. The project was unsuccessful. On 1960, Manuel Frías Morales presented a law <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> the study to establish the municipality but it didn't succeed either.|$|E
25|$|BUA's {{advocacy}} of large-scale route transfers from the corporations {{had not been}} envisaged by the committee and was opposed by the corporations and trade unions.

25|$|To {{compensate}} for lost {{revenue from the}} state government, communities raised local property tax rates, helping drive up the average residential property tax bill by 22percent {{over the course of}} Romney’s tenure. In response to complaints about the high residential property taxes, Romney supported and signed into law legislation that allowed communities to shift some of the burden of rising property taxes from residential property owners onto business owners. He also expressed approval for state tax law changes <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> communities to raise local sales taxes and fees if the local voters agreed.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, an {{alliance}} was formed between over 30 Romanian NGOs {{under the name}} of Coalition for Family. The coalition's main activity consisted in promoting and collecting signatures for a citizen's initiative aiming to revise the Constitution and prevent interpretations <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> gay marriage. By May 2016 the coalition had gathered over 3 million signatures. The proposal is actively supported by the Romanian Orthodox Church. On 20 July 2016, the nine judges of the Constitutional Court ruled unanimously that the proposal to change the constitution's definition of marriage was valid.|$|E
25|$|At {{first the}} board of {{directors}} discussed having boats similar to the dimensions on the Erie Canal, i.e. 13½ feet wide with a draft of 3 feet, traveling at 2½ miles per hour. Later, Chief Engineer Benjamin Wright submitted a suggestion with the dimensions of the boats being 14½ feet wide, 90 feet long, with a 5-foot draft, {{to take advantage of the}} lock sizes and prism depth. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> boats with cargo up to 130 tons. Wright also suggested for passenger boats, having a draft of 10 inches (not including the keel) pulled by 4 horses at 7 miles per hour.|$|E
25|$|The Sultan {{also ordered}} his vassal Muhammad Ali not to {{withdraw}} his army from the Peloponnese. But the Allies despatched envoys to Alexandria {{to demand that}} the Egyptian prince do precisely that. This left Muhammad Ali in a dilemma. On the one hand, as an experienced statesman, he knew that with the Great Powers backing Greek autonomy, the game {{was up in the}} Peloponnese. On the other, he was reluctant to be seen as betraying his overlord, especially now that he had declared jihad, and also to inflict on his son Ibrahim the humiliation of a forced withdrawal. So he played for time, engaging the Allies in lengthy but inconclusive negotiations, in the hope that in the meantime the Sultan would himself reach an agreement with the Allies <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> Ibrahim a face-saving departure.|$|E

25|$|The British Government {{developed}} a two-pronged {{approach to the}} decolonisation of dependent territories that were then still part of the British Empire. It encouraged the development of self-government {{with the aim of}} granting independence to any territory that wanted it. For those territories that wished to continue an association with the United Kingdom it would work with the democratically elected representatives to define arrangements <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> it. In the opinion of the British Government, the position with regard to Gibraltar was complicated by provisions in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht that required the British to offer the territory to the Spanish crown if Britain were to relinquish it, which limited the options for independence. The Government of Gibraltar does not share this opinion but so far has opted to retain the link with the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 825, Niu Sengru {{was still}} serving as chancellor, {{but he was}} feeling {{powerless}} to stop {{what he saw as}} Emperor Jingzong's frivolousness and poor governance. He asked to be sent out of the capital. Emperor Jingzong made him the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (武昌, headquartered in modern Ezhou, Hubei). Also, that year after Emperor Jingzong declared a general pardon, Li Fengji submitted a proposed edict announcing the general pardon <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> those exiled officials who had previously received a movement toward Chang'an be given another one, but not stating anything with regard to those exiled officials who had never received a previous movement toward Chang'an. Wei pointed out that this wording was intended by Li Fengji to prevent Li Shen's movement toward Chang'an. At Wei's suggestion, the edict was revised, allowing Li Shen to be moved to Jiang Prefecture (江州, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi) to serve as its secretary general.|$|E
25|$|Clarkson {{describes}} {{one of her}} earliest memories as that {{of hiding}} in several Hong Kong basements during the Japanese invasion of the territory in 1941. It was only through his Canadian government connections that her father gained his family the opportunity in 1942 to flee the occupation to Canada, {{as part of the}} repatriating of Canadian government staff from the fallen city. Even so, the Chinese Immigration Act, 1923, prevented the Poys' immediate entry into the country until the Department of External Affairs intervened and cited an unfilled quota in the prisoner of war exchange programme with the Japanese Imperial Forces <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>permit</b> the Poy family free passage into Canada. The family settled in Ottawa, though William had lost almost all of his substantial fortune, and the Poys lived in a cramped duplex. Clarkson attended public school in the city and, in October 1951, was lined up with her class to see Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), as the royal motorcade passed through the city.|$|E
