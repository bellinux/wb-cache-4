40|$|Using e + e Γ {{annihilation}} events accumulated {{with the}} AMY detector at the <b>TRISTAN</b> <b>collider,</b> we {{have studied the}} Bose-Einstein correlations in the distributions of like-sign charged tracks. As reference samples we used the opposite-sign charged track pairs and mixed pairs, which are like-sign pairs synthesized from tracks belonging to different events. The results of the different reference samples give approximately 0. 45 for the correlation strength and approximately 0. 65 fm for the source size. Previous measurements of these parameters in e + e Γ annihilation at energies from CESR to LEP show remarkably flat dependence on p s. Our results conform well with this picture. 1 Introduction Bose-Einstein correlations have been observed in multi-hadron events as an enhancement {{of the number of}} like-sign pion pairs in the region of low Q, where Q is the difference in four-momentum between members of the pair. The effect is a consequence of the constraint imposed by quan [...] ...|$|E

This contract (DE-AS 05 - 80 ER 10713) covers the period from August 1, 1980 to January 31, 1993. Task B of this contract, headed by Professor Alexander Abashian, is described in this final report. This program has been pursued on many fronts by the researchers in a search for axions at SLAC, in electron-positron collisions in the AMY experiment at the <b>TRISTAN</b> <b>collider</b> in Japan, in measurements of muon decay properties in the MEGA and RHO experiments at the LAMPF accelerator, in a detailed analysis of scattering effects in the purported observation of a 17 keV neutrino at Oxford, in a search for a disoriented chiral condensate with the MiniMax experiment at Fermilab, and in an R&D program on resistive plate counters that could find use in low-cost high-quality charged particle detection at low rates...|$|E

40|$|Generation {{dependent}} discrete symmetries {{often appear}} in models derived from superstring theories. In particular, {{in the framework}} of E_ 6 models the presence of such symmetries is required in order to allow for the radiative generation of naturally small neutrino masses. Recently it was shown that by imposing suitable generation dependent discrete symmetries, a class of models can be consistently constructed in which the three sets of known fermions in each generation {{do not have the same}} assignments with respect to the 27 representation of E_ 6. In this scenario, the different embedding in the gauge group of the three generations implies in particular that the known charged leptons couple in a non [...] universal way to the new neutral gauge bosons (Z_β) present in these models. We exploit this fact to study the signature of this class of models at present and future e^+e^- colliders. We show that some signals of deviation from lepton universality as well as some other discrepancies with the standard model predictions which have been observed at the <b>TRISTAN</b> <b>collider</b> in the production rate of μ and τ, can be accounted for if the Z_β mass is not much heavier than 300 GeV. We also study the discovery limits for lepton universality violation of this type at LEP- 2 and at the 500 GeV e^+e^- Next Linear Collider (NLC). We show that models predicting unconventional assignments for the leptons will give an unmistakable signature, when the Z_β mass is as heavy as ∼ 800 GeV (LEP- 2) and ∼ 2 TeV (NLC) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} open charm {{production}} in γγ collisions with the TOPAZ detector at the <b>TRISTAN</b> e^+e^- <b>collider.</b> In this study, charm quarks {{were identified by}} electrons (and positrons) from semi-leptonic decays of charmed hadrons. The data corresponded to an integrated luminosity of 95. 3 pb^- 1 at a center-of-mass energy of 58 GeV. The results are presented as the cross sections of inclusive electron production in γγ collisions with an anti-tag condition, {{as well as the}} subprocess cross sections, which correspond to resolved-photon processes. The latter were measured by using a sub-sample with remnant jets. A comparison with various theoretical predictions based on direct and resolved-photon processes showed that our data prefer that with relatively large gluon contents in a photon at small x (x < 0. 1), with the next-to-leading order correction, and with a charm-quark mass of 1. 3 GeV.

40|$|The {{shape of}} jets {{produced}} in (quasi-) real photon-photon collisions {{as well as}} in e^+e^- annihilation process has been studied with a cone jet finding algorithm, using the data taken with the TOPAZ detector at the <b>TRISTAN</b> e^+e^- <b>collider</b> at an average center-of-mass energy of 58 GeV. The results are presented in terms of the jet width {{as a function of the}} jet transverse energy(E^jet_T) as well as a scaled transverse jet energy, x_T(= 2 E^jet_T/root(s)). The jet width narrows as E^jet_T increases; however, at the same value of E^jet_T the jet width in gamma-gamma collisions at TRISTAN is significantly narrower than that in gamma p collisions at HERA. By comparing our results with the data in other reactions, it has been shown that the jet width in gamma-gamma, gamma p, pp̅ collisions as well as the e^+e^- annihilation process has an approximate scaling behavior as a function of x_T.

40|$|We {{point out}} that in {{processes}} involving the parton content of the photon the usual effective photon approximation should be modified. The {{reason is that the}} parton content of virtual photons is logarithmically suppressed compared to real photons. We describe this suppression using several simple, physically motivated ansätze. Although the parton content of the electron in general no longer factorizes into an electron flux function and a photon structure function, it can still be expressed as a single integral.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{tests of}} quantum electrodynamics (QED), {{the theory of}} the electromagnetic force, at order α 4 in the dimensionless coupling. The data were accumulated, using the TOPAZ detector at the <b>TRISTAN</b> e+e- <b>collider,</b> in KEK, Japan 2 ̆ 7 s National Laboratory for High Energy Physics. An integrated luminosity of 221. 8 pb- 1, taken at an average center of mass energy 3 ̆c√(s) 3 ̆e= 57. 77 GeV, was analyzed. Differential cross sections for the reaction e+e-→ e+e-μ+μ- are presented and various kinematic distributions are compared with theoretical predictions. Strengthening of the electromagnetic coupling with increasing momentum transfer has been observed, by comparing two photon muon production with single photon muon production. We measure α(Q 2) - 1 to change from its known value of about 137. 036 at Q 2 ≈ 0 (GeV/c) 2 to 129. 24 ± 2. 00 (stat) ± 0. 77 (sys) at Q 2 = (57. 77 GeV/c) 2. These results agree with QED to a high degree of precision and suggest that the forces of nature have strengths which converge as the momentum transfer rises, thus supporting the idea of unification. ...|$|R

The newly fabricated magnets were designed to satisfy high quality required for the KEKB. The recycled magnets were also overhauled in need.
