2500|$|On 6 September 2010, Body Talk Pt. 2 was {{released}} in the UK. It was preceded by the lead single, a dance version of [...] "Hang with Me" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, on 5 September. The album includes a duet with American rapper Snoop Dogg, [...] "U Should Know Better". Robyn performed [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] with deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on 12 September. In a BBC Newsbeat interview, Robyn explained her decision to release three albums in one year: [...] "It was just something I felt like I needed to do. I just never thought about selling records or not, making this decision. I just did it for myself. It's a way of, for me, to stay inspired {{and to be able}} to do the things I like to do". She said that she would not do it again: [...] "When you do 16 or 13 songs in one go, you kind of empty yourself, and it takes a while to fill back up and have new <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> so I think it's good for everyone". Robyn announced the release of the single, [...] "Indestructible", on 13 October 2010; an acoustic version appeared on Body Talk Pt. 2. The song {{was released}} on 17 November in Scandinavia and 22 November in the UK. Co-written by Klas Åhlund, it was described as a [...] "pulsating full power version [...] takes every ounce of that emotion and wraps it up in another exceptional disco-pop record worthy of any dance-floor or passion-laden sing-a-long." [...] Robyn planned to collaborate with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song, [...] "Time Machine"; Martin produced Robyn's US singles [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", both of which peaked in the top 10 on the Billboard 100 in 1997. Combined, the Body Talk albums have sold 91,000 copies in the US ...|$|E

60|$|I began, {{by being}} {{singularly}} cheerful and light-hearted; {{all sorts of}} half-forgotten <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> came rushing into my mind, and made me hold forth in a most unwonted manner. I laughed heartily at my own jokes, and everybody else's; called Steerforth to order for not passing the wine; made several engagements to go to Oxford; announced that I meant to have a dinner-party exactly like that, once a week, until further notice; and madly took so much snuff out of Grainger's box, that I was obliged {{to go into the}} pantry, and have a private fit of sneezing ten minutes long.|$|E

No doubt we two should find many <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> by ourselves in reference to our common calling, added little Fyne portentously in his grave undertones, as if the Mercantile Marine were a secret society.|$|E
60|$|One final judgment, however, might {{with due}} caution be hazarded. I {{do not think}} that, on the whole, the English are quite as fond of humour as we are. I mean they are not so willing to welcome at all times the humorous point of view as we are in America. The English are a serious people, with many serious things to think of--football, horse racing, dogs, fish, and many other {{concerns}} that demand much national thought: they have so many national preoccupations of this kind that they have less need for jokes than we have. They have higher <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> whereas on {{our side of the}} water, except when the World's Series is being played, we have few, if any, truly national topics.|$|E
60|$|Professor Calderwood {{has such}} an {{exceptional}} {{interest in his}} students that he asks {{every one of them}} to his house. This is but one of many things that makes him generally popular; he also invites his ladies' class to meet them. The lady whom you take down to supper suggests Proposition 41 as a nice <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> and asks what you think of the metaphysics of ethics. Professor Calderwood sees the ladies into the cabs himself. It is the only thing I ever heard against him.|$|R

It {{might very well}} be that she admired him--though this did not seem <b>to</b> her a <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> But that this {{brilliant}} stranger--this sudden apparition, who had barely heard the sound of her voice--took that sort of interest in her that was expressed by the romantic phrase of which Mrs. Penniman had just made use: this could only be a figment of the restless brain of Aunt Lavinia, whom every one knew to be a woman of powerful imagination.|$|R
5000|$|The slow {{decline of}} the bridge's central role began in 1754: [...] "Starting in 1754, {{the first year of}} the vogue, the madness of the boulevards, it was no longer the <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the Cours Champs-Elysées, and still less of this poor Pont-Neuf. To the Boulevard, at once, long live the Boulevard!". Still the bridge {{remained}} a lively place through the end of the century. With time, people became wary of its reputation and other changes subdued its atmosphere. In 1840, Lacroix wrote: [...] "Once the pont Neuf was a perpetual fair; at present, it is just a bridge to be crossed without stopping." ...|$|R
6000|$|They had a {{succulent}} meal {{ready for}} me, and, what I call, fair enough whisky out of Scotland. Here again I remarked that Felicia ate very little, and Marmaduke nothing at all. He drank wine, too--and, good heavens, champagne wine!--a needless {{waste of money}} surely when there was whisky on the table. My appetite being satisfied, my son-in-law {{went out of the}} room, and returned with his hat in his hand. [...] "You and Felicia have many <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> on your first evening together. I'll leave you for a while--I shall only be in the way." [...] So he spoke. It was in vain that his wife and I assured him he was not in the way at all. He kissed his hand, and smiled pleasantly, and left us.|$|E

There ain't a ridiculous person she's ever seen but what she's got something from them to make you laugh at; and I don't believe we've ever had anybody in the house since the girl could talk that she hain't got some saying from, or some trick that'll paint 'em out so't you can see 'em and hear 'em. Sometimes I want to stop her; but when she gets into one of her gales there ain't any standing up against her. I guess it's lucky for Irene that she's got Pen there to help entertain her company. I can't ever feel down where Pen is." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{weather was}} {{intensely}} and bitterly cold; {{a great deal}} of snow fell from time to time; and the wind was intolerably keen. Mr Squeers got down at almost every stage--to stretch his legs as he said--and as he always came back from such excursions with a very red nose, and composed himself to sleep directly, there is reason to suppose that he derived great benefit from the process. The little pupils having been stimulated with the remains of their breakfast, and further invigorated by sundry small cups of a curious cordial carried by Mr Squeers, which tasted very like toast-and-water put into a brandy bottle by mistake, went to sleep, woke, shivered, and cried, as their feelings prompted.

40|$|Conversational {{interaction}} occasionally lapses as topics become exhausted or {{as participants}} {{are left with}} no obvious <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> next. In this article I look at episodes of ordinary conversation to examine how participants resolve issues of speakership and sequentiality in lapse environments. In particular, I examine one recurrent phenomenon—sequence recompletion—whereby participants bring to completion a sequence of talk that was already treated as complete. Using conversation analysis, I describe four methods for sequence recompletion: turn-exiting, action redoings, delayed replies, and post-sequence transitions. With this practice, participants use verbal and vocal resources to locally manage their participation framework when ending one course of action and potentially starting up a new on...|$|R
