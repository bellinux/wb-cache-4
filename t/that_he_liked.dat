5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked.</b> This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|Thornton {{signed a}} {{contract}} with CMH Records to release the album. Following a contractual dispute, Fanatik J was released from the project. The album's production was completed by the One-Watt Sun production team based upon three completed vocal recordings and older unfinished recordings. Thornton had little involvement with the production of the album. He later stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the completed product, but that it hurt his musical reputation.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood, though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen. Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, {{though he did not}} go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience. When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the series anyway. The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.|$|E

5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop is tied closely to Soundgarden, since Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman funded Soundgarden's early releases, and the band's success led {{to the expansion of}} Sub Pop as a serious record label. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was a fan of Soundgarden's music, and reportedly Soundgarden's involvement with Sub Pop influenced Cobain to sign Nirvana with the label. Cobain also stated that Soundgarden was one of the only Seattle bands <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> along with Tad and Mudhoney. In rare footage in the 2015 documentary , Cobain can be seen impersonating Chris Cornell singing Outshined.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden, and {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show.

Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked.</b> When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, {{he thought she was}} a really nice woman who was very mature. Crittenden was only 23 years old at the time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, he {{was still}} {{struggling}} to find scripts <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked.</b> A script named Street Smart had been lying in his house for years, and after re-reading it, he had it green-lit at Cannon Films. He starred opposite Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for his first Academy Award for the film. The film received excellent reviews but performed poorly at the box office, possibly because Cannon Films had failed to properly advertise it.|$|E

25|$|From 1947 to 1949, {{when the}} Republicans {{controlled}} the Senate, Taft was his party's leading voice in domestic policy. He {{was reluctant to}} support farm subsidies, a position that hurt the party in rural areas (especially in the Midwest) in the 1948 elections. Taft engineered {{the passage of the}} Housing Act of 1949, which funded slum clearance and the construction of 810,000 units of low-income housing over a period of six years.

25|$|Taylor {{was careful}} with his fitness, {{following}} an ankle injury in 1964 {{kept him from}} the first seven games of the season. Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois inners and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut away all the padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> to feel the ball in his palm and if taking the ball correctly {{most of the time}} the bruising wasn't too troublesome. This can be contrasted with Knott who preferred plenty of padding on his palms.|$|E

Cage argued defamation and damage to character and won the case, resulting in retractions, legal fees, and a donation to charity.|$|E
