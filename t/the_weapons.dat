5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked the weight of <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, {{as well as how}} to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> during filming sessions.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Hurst was re-armed in 1940 {{with two}} 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns and {{a unit of}} the Isle of Wight Rifles was {{stationed}} there, controlled from the Fire Control Needles. Searchlights and two more 6-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed the next year, when the 37-strong detachment was retitled the 129 Coastal Battery Royal Artillery, followed by the installation of Bofors anti-aircraft guns. A tower, called the Director Tower, was built along the west wing. As the war progressed, <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> were stood down and the battery finally closed in July 1945, with most of <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> being removed after the war.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>weapon</b> was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} replacement for <b>the</b> coaxial <b>weapon</b> in <b>the</b> American M60 tank. <b>The</b> <b>weapon</b> was evaluated by both the US Army and <b>the</b> US Naval <b>weapon</b> center, who reported that the performance of <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> was outstanding during all phases of testing. However, neither chose to adopt <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>weapon</b> was {{designed}} by Umberto Onorati; very little information of <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> is available other than that. As no pictures of <b>the</b> actual <b>weapon</b> exist, it can be assumed that <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> never advanced past prototype stages.The Onorati used a dual-bolt system and fed from two 20-round detachable box magazines inserted into <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
25|$|Because {{of the use}} of {{electricity}} and the claim of <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> being non-lethal, controversy has sprouted over particular incidents involving <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> and <b>the</b> use of <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> in general. In essence, controversy has been centered on the justification {{of the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> in certain instances, and, in some cases, health issues that are claimed to be due to the use of <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
5|$|In August 2007, a B-52H {{ferrying}} AGM-129 ACM {{cruise missiles}} from Minot Air Force Base to Barksdale Air Force Base for dismantling was mistakenly loaded with six missiles with their nuclear warheads. <b>The</b> <b>weapons</b> {{did not leave}} USAF custody and were secured at Barksdale.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that Menem was {{under investigation for}} his role in the 1995 Río Tercero explosion, which is alleged to have been part of <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> scandal involving Croatia and Ecuador. Following an Appeals Court ruling that found Menem guilty of aggravated smuggling, he was sentenced to seven years in prison on June 13, 2013, {{for his role in}} illegally smuggling weapons to Ecuador and Croatia; his position as senator earned him immunity from incarceration, and his advanced age (82) afforded him the possibility of house arrest. His minister of defense during <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> sales, Oscar Camilión, was concurrently sentenced to five and a half years.|$|E

50|$|The GBU-15 {{may be used}} {{in either}} a direct or an {{indirect}} attack. In a direct attack, the pilot selects a target before launch, locks <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> guidance system onto it and launches <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>weapon</b> automatically guides itself to the target, enabling the pilot to leave the area. In an indirect attack, <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> is guided by remote control after launch. The pilot releases <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> and, via remote control, searches for the target. Once the target is acquired, <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> can be locked to the target or manually guided via the Hughes Aircraft AN/AXQ-14 data-link system.|$|R

5|$|In the {{northern}} {{section of the}} fort, similar actions were taking place, as the airborne troops raced to destroy or otherwise disable the fortifications housing artillery pieces. Objective No. 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine-guns whose arcs of fire covered {{the western side of}} the Fort; to destroy the casemate, the airborne troops used a flamethrower to force the Belgian soldiers manning <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> to retreat, and then detonated shaped charges against the fortification to disable it. Another observation cupola fitted with machine-guns, Objective No. 19, was destroyed, but two further objectives, Nos. 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations. Unexpected complications came from Objective No. 23, a retractable cupola housing two 75mm artillery pieces. It had been assumed that <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> in this fortification could not stop the airborne assault, but this assumption was found to be false when <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> opened fire, forcing the airborne troops in the area to go to cover. The rapid fire of <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> led to air support being summoned, and a Stuka squadron bombed the cupola. Although the bombs did not destroy the cupola, the explosions did force the Belgians to retract it {{throughout the rest of the}} fighting. Any exterior entrances and exits located by the airborne troops were destroyed with explosives to seal the garrison inside the Fort, giving the garrison few opportunities to attempt a counter-attack. The airborne troops had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling the artillery pieces that the fort could have used to bombard the captured bridges, but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled. A number of these included anti-aircraft weapons and machine-guns.|$|E
5|$|Often ingenious {{methods were}} {{developed}} for administering <b>the</b> <b>weapons.</b> The 10th-century Olga of Kiev {{is reported to}} have tied burning tinder to birds which, when released, flew back to their nests in the hostile town and set them alight.|$|E

50|$|The {{charging}} handle of <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> {{is based on}} the AR-15 design at the back of <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b> This is to ensure that cocking <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> does not interfere with any optics mounted onto the Picatinny rail. The weapon's rails are made out of cast steel and <b>the</b> standard <b>weapon</b> overall weighs 2.1 kg. The semi-automatic version of <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> can be registered as a Short-Barreled Rifle in most states in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|Different law {{enforcement}} agencies in different countries have different regulations regarding how machine pistols are loaded and carried. Depending {{on the type of}} machine pistol, some agencies train their officers to carry <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> with a round in <b>the</b> chamber, <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> cocked and <b>the</b> safety on. Other agencies may prefer that officers carry <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> without a round in the chamber. While this makes <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> safer to carry and reduces the likelihood of an accidental discharge, it also means {{that there will be a}} longer delay before the officer can fire <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 14 June, Ilić went to Tuzla {{to bring}} <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> to Sarajevo. Miško Jovanović hid <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> {{in a large}} box of sugar. On 15 June, the two went {{separately}} by train to Doboj where Jovanović handed off the box to Ilić. Later that day, Ilić returned to Sarajevo by train, being careful to transfer to a local train outside Sarajevo and then quickly transfer to a tram to avoid police detection. Once at his mother's house, Ilić hid <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> in a suitcase under a sofa. Then, on approximately 17 June, Ilić traveled to Brod (Dedijer puts it on 16 June, but trial records put it on 18 June). Questioned at trial, Ilić gave a confused explanation {{of the reason for}} his trip, first saying he had gone to Brod to prevent the assassination and then saying he had returned to Sarajevo from Brod to prevent the assassination. Dedijer puts forward the thesis (citing Bogijević) that Ilić went to Brod to meet an emissary of Apis, Djuro Ŝarac, who had instructions to cancel the assassination and then later Rade Malobabić was dispatched from Serbia to Sarajevo to reauthorize the assassination.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May Prvanović's revenue sergeants {{assembled}} and Sergeant Budivoj Grbić accepted the task and led Princip and Grabež by foot to Isaković's Island, a small island {{in the middle of}} the Drina River that separated Serbia from Bosnia. They and their weapons reached the island on 31 May. Grbić passed the terrorists and their weapons to the agents of the Serbian Narodna Odbrana for transport into Austro-Hungarian territory and from safe-house to safe-house. Princip and Grabež crossed into Austria-Hungary on the evening of 1 June. Princip and Grabež and <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> were passed from agent to agent until on 3 June they arrived in Tuzla. They left <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> in the hands of the Narodna Odbrana agent Miško Jovanović and rejoined Čabrinović.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{delivery}} of <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> in combat were assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Weapons</b> Committee, which was chaired by Ramsey, and answerable to Captain William S. Parsons. Ramsey drew up tables of organization and equipment for the Project Alberta detachment that would accompany the USAAF's 509th Composite Group to Tinian. Ramsey briefed the 509th's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, {{on the nature of}} the mission when the latter assumed command of the 509th. Ramsey went to Tinian with the Project Alberta detachment as Parsons's scientific and technical deputy. He was involved in the assembly of the Fat Man bomb, and relayed Parsons's message indicating the success of the bombing of Hiroshima to Groves in Washington, DC.|$|E
50|$|The key to sniping is accuracy, which {{applies to}} both <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> and <b>the</b> shooter. <b>The</b> <b>weapon</b> {{should be able}} to {{consistently}} place shots within tight tolerances.

50|$|Soldier Blade's {{weapon system}} was {{unique in that}} every <b>weapon</b> <b>the</b> player would pick up, <b>the</b> {{previous}} <b>weapon</b> would be stocked as a Special <b>Weapon.</b> <b>The</b> Special <b>Weapon</b> attack was different depending on <b>the</b> particular <b>weapon.</b> <b>The</b> Red <b>Weapon</b> Special would make the ship's robot temporarily invulnerable, <b>the</b> Green <b>Weapon</b> Special would send out a homing energy blast while <b>the</b> Blue <b>Weapon</b> Special unleashed an enormous laser beam. Collecting a <b>Weapon</b> pick-up of <b>the</b> same color once <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> in-use was fully upgraded results in a large explosion that clears the screen of smaller enemies and attacks.|$|R
5|$|The first {{significant}} conflict involving the JNA in the Bjelovar area occurred on 1 September, when 14 JNA officers and soldiers were disarmed at a Croatian checkpoint.

Tensions greatly increased after 18 ZNG troops from the 105th Brigade, deployed from Bjelovar, went missing during the Battle of Kusonje on 9 September. The civilian authorities in the city demanded that the JNA provide information on their fate, but the JNA declared it {{had no knowledge of}} the matter.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Final Fantasy games, players cannot {{manually}} equip characters with armor. Instead, newly acquired armor replaces the main character's current equipment, or upgrades a {{current version of}} a weapon, e.g. obtaining the knight sword will replace the steel sword. Using the L and R buttons allows the user to cycle through <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> that have been collected so far. Benjamin uses four types of weapons: swords, axes, bombs, and claws. Although <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> share a similar function in battle, all have different purposes when exploring the field map. The Dragon Claw, for example, doubles as a grappling hook.

5|$|A major {{earthquake}} {{occurs in}} Los Angeles, caused by terrorists detonating explosives at focal points (places where fault lines intersect). Kate Warner is also kidnapped by the terrorist cell, along with Governor James Radford who is kidnapped for assassination but is then rescued by the CTU. A conspiracy involving Radford in the day's attacks is uncovered by the CTU and Radford is {{killed by the}} terrorist cell because he attempts to back out. Fort Lesker, U.S. Military base and {{the epicenter of the}} earthquakes, is attacked and taken over by terrorists, who then begin stealing weapons-grade plutonium before attempting to smuggle <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> out of the U.S. to the Middle East.
