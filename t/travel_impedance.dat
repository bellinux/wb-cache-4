40|$|Abstract. Economic {{potential}} {{measures of}} accessibility {{seem to have}} been rediscovered in the research literature recently, as well as in research that informs policy formulation. These new applications are using more and more sophisticated sources of data but are in large measure still operationalising the familiar concepts of market potential. Such potential is calculated for any zone by summing the representative economic mass of all other zones in the system each divided by some measure of the intervening <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> between that zone and every other zone. In this straightforward calculation it becomes necessary to incorporate the eco-nomic mass of the zone under consideration itself and to decide on the appropriate <b>travel</b> <b>impedance.</b> This apparently simple task is the focus of this paper. Most research of this type uses a weighting of the radius of the circle equalling the area of the zone in question to approximate the <b>travel</b> <b>impedance.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate that the choice of weighting is important in determining the nature of the resultant potential surface...|$|E
40|$|Background: Access to skilled {{attendance}} at childbirth {{is crucial to}} reduce maternal and newborn mortality. Several different measures of geographic access are used concurrently in public health research, {{with the assumption that}} sophisticated methods are generally better. Most of the evidence for this assumption comes from methodological comparisons in high-income countries. We compare different measures of <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> in a case study in Ghana’s Brong Ahafo region to determine if straight-line distance can be an adequate proxy for access to delivery care in certain low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. Methods: We created a geospatial database, mapping population location in both compounds and village centroids, service locations for all health facilities offering delivery care, land-cover and a detailed road network. Six different measures were used to calculate <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> to health facilities (straight-line distance, network distance, network travel time and raster travel time, the latter two both mechanized and non-mechanized). The measures were compared using Spearman rank correlation coefficients, absolute differences, and the percentage of the same facilities identified as closest. We used logistic regression with robust standard errors to model the association of the different measures with health facility use for delivery in 9, 306 births. Results Non-mechanized measures were highly correlated with each other, and identified the same facilities as closest for approximately 80 % of villages. Measures calculated from compounds identified the same closest facility as measures from village centroids for over 85 % of births. For 90 % of births, the aggregation error from using village centroids instead of compound locations was less than 35  minutes and less than 1. 12  km. All non-mechanized measures showed an inverse association with facility use of similar magnitude, an approximately 67 % reduction in odds of facility delivery per standard deviation increase in each measure (OR[*]=[*] 0. 33). Conclusion: Different data models and population locations produced comparable results in our case study, thus demonstrating that straight-line distance can be reasonably used as a proxy for potential spatial access in certain LMIC settings. The cost of obtaining individually geocoded population location and sophisticated measures of <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> should be weighed against the gain in accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Healthy {{populations and}} {{access to health care}} {{services}} are significant factors influencing economic development and prosperity. Since geographic access is an essential feature of an overall health system, it is important for health service researchers to develop accurate measures of physical access to health. In this paper we develop a series of gravity-based health care accessibility measures for all the counties in Indiana. The measures go beyond local availability of health care services within a county and account for <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> via distance-discounted health care services accessible throughout the state. When applied to Indiana counties, the results show sharp disparities in health care accessibility with extensive pockets of poor accessibility in rural and peripheral areas. The research concludes with a demonstration of how spatial accessibility measures can be beneficially used to evaluate of policies indicative of changes in the provision of health services. spatial accessibility, health care, geographic information systems (GIS),...|$|E
30|$|This {{approach}} {{allows the}} modelling of infrastructure policies by modifying mode-specific <b>travel</b> <b>impedances</b> generically for transport {{in the whole}} EU, selected countries or selected NUTS- 2 regions, which however does not allow the consideration of network effects of infrastructure policies.|$|R
30|$|For the {{creation}} of the hypernet, regions have been connected in the hypernet if: either the zones are bordering each other and have an ETISplus network link that connects both zones, or they are connected by a ferry link in the ETISplus network. A representative NUTS- 3 zone, i.e. the NUTS- 3 zone containing the largest city/ capital city within the NUTS- 2 zone, was chosen for each NUTS- 2 zone. Each hypernet node is allocated an access/ egress <b>impedance</b> to model <b>travel</b> <b>impedances</b> to access the inter-regional hypernet links. The intra-zonal impedances are based on inter-NUTS- 3 impedance values from ETISplus and can be influenced by policies. Also the inter-zonal impedances are based on the ETISplus <b>impedance</b> matrices. Future <b>travel</b> <b>impedances</b> up to the model’s forecast horizon 2050 were calculated from enhanced ETISplus networks, including all infrastructure projects planned on the TEN-T core and comprehensive networks (see European Union, 2013).|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{in order}} to allow the {{consideration}} of network effects in the strategic assessment of transport infrastructure policies, a “hypernet” approach was developed. The hypernet approach allows the change of <b>travel</b> <b>impedances</b> on a virtual link between two NUTS- 2 regions. After running a shortest-path algorithm new impedance matrices are obtained, thus covering the network dimension of the infrastructure policy. The hypernet is an optional submodule covering road and rail and is linked to the passenger demand module.|$|R
40|$|The {{stressful}} {{characteristics of}} commuting constraints are conceptualized {{in terms of}} both physical and perceptual conditions of <b>travel</b> <b>impedance.</b> This study develops and operationalizes the concept of subjective impedance, as a complement to our previously developed concept of impedance as a physically defined condition of commuting stress. The stress impacts of highimpedance commuting were examined in a study of 79 employees of two companies in the follow-up testing of a longitudinal study. Subjective impedance was overlapping but not isomorphic with physical impedance, and these two dimensions have differential relationships with health and well-being outcomes. The physical impedance construct received further confirmation in validational analyses and in predicted effects on various illness measures and job satisfaction. The newly constructed subjective impedance index was significantly related to evening home mood, residential satisfaction, and chest pain. Job change was also influenced primarily by commuting satisfaction. The results are discussed within an ecological framework emphasizing interdomain transfer effects and situational moderators of commuting stress...|$|E
30|$|In an {{intermediate}} step, four indicators are subsequently computed {{in order to}} integrate the trip distribution and the modal split model. First, Generalized Travel Times (GTTijm) are computed by the cost functions based on <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> indicators, such as travel time, travel distance and level of service. All inter-zonal public transport modes (rail, air, coach) are considered by the GTT calculation as trip chains consisting of access mode, main mode and egress mode. GTTs follow the concept of travel time in which the cost unit refers to minutes rather than to monetary terms. Second, based on GTTs, Expected Minimum Costs (EMCij) and market shares of transport modes (Sijm) are computed by a Nested Logit model following the concept of logsums (De Jong et al. 2007). Third, Deterrence Values (DVij) are calculated by the deterrence model {{and in the last}} step, Accessibilities (Aij) are computed based on EMCs and DVs. Finally, Aij are used by the trip distribution model for the computation of the O/D trip matrix, and Sijm by the modal split model in order to divide the matrix by transport mode.|$|E
40|$|In {{rapidly growing}} urban areas, it is deemed vital to expand (or contract) an {{existing}} network of public facilities to meet anticipated {{changes in the}} level of demand. We present a multi-period capacitated median model for school network facility location planning that minimizes transportation costs, while functional costs are subject to a budget constraint. The proposed Vintage Flexible Capacitated Location Problem (ViFCLP) has the flexibility to account for a minimum school-age closing requirement, while the maximum capacity of each school can be adjusted by the addition of modular units. Non-closest assignments are controlled by the introduction of a parameter penalizing excess travel. The applicability of the ViFCLP is illustrated on a large US school system (Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina) where high school demand is expected to grow faster with distance to the city center. Higher school capacities and greater penalty on <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> parameter reduce the number of non-closest assignments.

40|$|Different {{measures}} of cycling accessibility {{have been widely}} introduced in transportation planning. However, those measurements are mainly restricted by the availability of travel behavior data. In addition, there has been limited comprehensive research {{on the importance of}} cycling accessibility to destinations based on the travel time or distance. In this paper, a new index for measuring bikeability in metropolitan areas is introduced. A Cycling Accessibility Index (CAI) is developed for quantifying cycling accessibility within local areas in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. CAI is defined according to gravity-based {{measures of}} accessibility. This index measures cycling accessibility levels in terms of diversity of different land uses, number of activities in statistical areas, and the <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> between origins and destinations. The Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) dataset was used to evaluate the index and investigate the association between the cycling accessibility levels and the number of bicycle trips in local areas. The index is assessed by investigating the association between levels of cycling accessibility and the number of bicycle trips in statistical areas. Key findings indicate that there is a significant positive association between bike trips and the CAI...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} and perceptual dimensions of commuting <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> were again {{found to have}} stressful consequences {{in a study of}} 99 employees of two companies. This quasi-experimental replication study, which focuses here on home environment consequences, investigated the effects of physical impedance and subjective impedance on multivariate measures of residential satisfaction and personal affect in the home. Both sets of residential outcome measures were found to be significantly related to the two impedance dimensions. As predicted, gender was a significant moderator of physical impedance effects. Females commuting on high physical impedance routes were most negatively affected. Previously found subjective impedance effects on negative home mood, regardless of gender, were strongly replicated with several methods and were buttressed by convergent results with objective indices. The theoretical conjecture that subjective impedance mediates the stress effects of physical impedance was supported for the personal affect cluster but only for one variable in the residential satisfaction cluster. Traffic congestion has increased in metropolitan areas nationwide, and commuters, families, and organizations are absorbing associated hidden costs. The results are reviewed in terms of our ecological model, and the moderating effects of gender are discussed in terms of choice and role constraints...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the impacts of bicycle-train {{integration}} policies on train ridership and job accessibility for public transport users. To do so, we integrate multi-modal transport network modelling and accessibility modelling. Firstly, we extended an already operational Dutch national multi-modal transport network model to estimate the effects of detailed bicycle-train integration policy measures on train ridership and potential job accessibility by public transport in Randstad South, the wider metropolitan area of Rotterdam - the Hague in the Netherlands. A detailed transport network was implemented, in which access and egress modes (bicycle, bus/tram/metro and walking) are connected to the main modes (public transport and car). Moreover, mode and station type specific value of time estimates were added in the <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> function, based on stated choice experiments, to represent the attractiveness of boarding and alighting stops. Bicycle-train integration policy scenarios are developed that reduce access/egress waiting time penalties and thus affect travel demand (destination and mode choice, route choice of public transport users). Secondly, a potential job accessibility measure is estimated based on the outputs of the multi-modal transport model, and a number of bicycle-train integration scenarios are developed and estimated. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to examine the public transport accessibility impacts of bicycle-train integration policies.|$|E

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of power swing {{blocking}} is to distinguish faults from power swings. However, the faults occur during a power swing should be detected and cleared promptly. This paper proposes an adaptive concentric power swing blocker (PSB) to overcome incapability of traditional concentric PSB in detecting symmetrical fault during power swing. Based on proposed method, two pairs of concentric characteristics are anticipated which {{the first one is}} placed in a stationary position (outer of zone 3) but the position of the second pair is adjustable. In order to find the position of the second pair of characteristic, Static Phasor Estimation Error (SPEE) of current signal is utilized in this paper. The proposed method detects the abrupt change in SPEE and puts the second pair of characteristic in location of impedance trajectory correspondingly. Second concentric characteristic records <b>travelling</b> time of <b>impedance</b> trajectory between outer and inner zones and compares to threshold value to detect symmetrical fault during power swing. If recorded time is lower than threshold, three-phase fault is detected during power swing. Intensive studies have been performed and the merit of the method is demonstrated by some test signals simulations.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: There {{are several}} routes between some OD pairs {{in the urban}} rail transit network. In order {{to carry out the}} fare allocating, {{operators}} use some models to estimate which route the passengers choose, but there are some errors between estimation results and actual choices results. The aim of this study is analyzing the passenger route choice behavior in detail based on passenger classification and improving the models to make the results more in line with the actual situations. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the passengers were divided into familiar type and strange type. Firstly passenger integrated <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> functions of two types were established respectively, after that a multi-route distribution model was used to get the initial route assignment results, then a ratio correction method was used to correct the results taking into account the transfer times, crowd and demand for seats.

The examination of the 2000 Census data showed that {{there were significant differences}} in the transit share of the work trip at the block group level. In order to understand this variation, which is required to plan and implement transportation policy in the region, the study area was categorized into three groups based on the level of relative job accessibility. Commuting patterns in these areas were examined and compared to each other. First, the conceptual and measurement issues surrounding accessibility are reviewed. Next, <b>travel</b> time <b>impedance</b> functions were developed using the journey to work data from Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) 2000, considering both transit and auto travel time between all origin-destination pairs in the Boston Metropolitan area thanks to the Central Transportation Planning Staff (CTPS), the transportation network data from Massachusetts Geographic Information Systems (MassGIS), and the job location data from Initiatives for a Competitive Inner City (ICIC). (cont.) Then, job accessibility by auto and transit were calculated based on a hypothesis that job accessibility {{is an important factor in}} determining transit mode share from both residential and workplace perspectives. Finally, the spatial robustness of the general trip distribution was examined using GIS to compare mode choice behavior in block groups with different land use characteristics: block groups in the high relative job accessibility areas, block groups in the low relative job accessibility areas, and block groups in the entire study area. The comparison led to the conclusion that it is unrealistic to think that simple models such as those developed earlier in this research could be generally applied to all block groups in the metropolitan area. The geographical analyses suggested that a disaggregate approach should be applied not only to data collection (e. g., collecting individual survey data) but also to developing mode split models in order to improve their explanatory power. by Jeeseong Chung.

Fractures {{play a crucial role in}} controlling almost all of the fluid transport in tight reservoirs. Current seismic methods to characterize fractures depend on various anisotropic wave propagation signatures that can arise from aligned fractures.

Our goal is to go beyond the current state-of-the art to develop and demonstrate next generation methodologies for detecting and quantitatively characterizing fracture zones using seismic measurements. Our study incorporates 3 key elements: (1) Theoretical rock physics studies of the anisotropic viscoelastic signatures of fractured rocks, including up scaling analysis and rock-fluid interactions to define the factors relating fractures in the lab and in the field.

40|$|Abstract Primary care is {{recognized}} {{as the most important}} form of healthcare for maintaining population health because it is relatively inexpensive, can be more easily delivered than specialty and inpatient care, and if properly distributed it is most effective in preventing disease progression on a large scale. Recent advances in the field of health geography have greatly improved our understanding of the role played by geographic distribution of health services in population health maintenance. However, most of this knowledge has accrued for hospital and specialty services and services in rural areas. Much less is known about the effect of distance to and supply of primary care on primary care utilization, particularly in the U. S. For several reasons the shortage of information is particularly acute for urban areas, where the majority of people live. First, explicit definitions and conceptualizations of healthcare access have not been widely used to guide research. An additional barrier to progress has been an overwhelming concern about affordability of care, which has garnered the majority of attention and research resources. Also, the most popular measures of spatial accessibility to care – <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> to nearest provider and supply level within bordered areas – lose validity in congested urban areas. Better measures are needed. Fortunately, some advances are occurring on the methodological front. These can improve our knowledge of all types of healthcare geography in all settings, including primary care in urban areas. This paper explains basic concepts and measurements of access, provides some historical background, outlines the major questions concerning geographic accessibility of primary care, describes recent developments in GIS and spatial analysis, and presents examples of promising work. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{component}} {{of work and}} non-work travel may be plausibly explained by the need for individuals to be co-present in order socially interact. Successful socializing requires maintaining and exploiting relationships, fulfilling obligations, and perhaps optimization of contacts. A social network {{is a way to}} map relationships and to quantify conduits of information, services, opportunity, and power. People must be able to navigate both their relationships and physical space in order to find other people and facilities which can provide the services they need. The result is that travel behavior and social structures affect each other. This research examines hypotheses of the interactions between social networks and trip generation. Models of social networks should be used by planners if their effects are significant and distinguishable from factors currently incorporated into transportation models. A multi-agent-based network evolution model is presented in which social visits are generated by a set of attraction parameters which include agent attributes, <b>travel</b> <b>impedance,</b> and descriptors of the actors’ position in the social network topology. The trips are constrained by the agent’s travel budget, and dynamic equilibrium is maintained by removing or weakening old links. The destination choice is thus a tradeoff between cost and the need for co-presence, marked by correlations between actors in the changing social network. The interactions are monitored using a statistical toolbox from social network analysis and placed in the context of findings from network science literature on network evolution, as well as from empirical work in sociology on real social networks. The behavior model used for social networking is described, and results from an ensemble run are presented. A sample case of a transportation “improvement ” is also presented, to illustrate {{the way in which the}} social network adapts to changes in transportation costs that ease spatial searches Keywords social networks, social simulation, dynamic networks, multi-agent based modelling, spatia...|$|E
40|$|Health is an {{important}} indicator to determine the overall development of a Country. Disease free nation leads to high level of productivity of human being {{and so it is}} {{an important}} element. This disease free nation can be attained by improving the health and nutritional status of the population. One of the ways of achieving it, is through improved access to and utilization of health services with special focus on the underserved and under privileged segment of population. Fortunately, the health care services in India are equivalently provided to all, ignoring the caste, color, creed and sex. The task of accessibility can be attained by establishing sub centers, primary health centers, community health centers and hospitals in remote and inaccessible areas. Primary health centers are an effective way of delivering health care in the rural areas. It is an imperative strategy to provide "Health For AH" and is widely acknowledged as a universal solution for improving well being of population in the world. The present study focuses on the evaluating the status of accessibility and utilization of health care facilities in the second highest populated country of the world. The number and type of barriers to accessibility of primary health centers differ from country to country and time to time. Affordability, acceptability and accommodation are the three non spatial barriers to the utilization and accessibility are spatial in context. Availability in context to PHC refers to the number of health care service points and accessibility is <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> i. e., distance or time between the residential or demand areas and PHC. In this paper, availability and accessibility are considered as spatial accessibility and the aim is to determine if PHC's are equitably distributed in the Nadia District of West Bengal state of India. The future allocation of the lowest order central facility is done with the help of Geographical Information Centre...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Long {{distance}} {{travel is}} {{a critical component of}} American life, generating immense impacts on a variety of aspects of the society. In 1995, American households took about 656 million long distance domestic trips (100 + miles, one way), which totaled 1 billion person trips. Compared to the well-studied intra-urban travel, long distance travel needs further in-depth analysis and modeling efforts, for which the long distance travel data serve as a substantial basis. While MPOs periodically collect both supply and demand data to support the development of regional models, supply-side data reflecting transportation service and costs at corridor, interregional, and national level are scarce. To merge the gap, {{there is a need to}} establish a national data framework, with available datasets integrated to support implementing quantitative methods on a national highway network to resolve network loading issues for long distance travel. This research intends to address this imperative. The research scope embraces the long distance passenger travel on national highways within the contiguous United States. The framework developed comprises not only a data warehouse where a plethora of datasets reside and interact, but also a complete modeling methodology to infer network loading conditions of long distance travel. Applying the national data framework approach, this research answers a pivotal question: how can we gain knowledge and insights of distributive patterns of long distance passenger travel at interregional level given existing data resources? This research elaborates the methodologies for the framework design and addresses the technical and theoretical challenges particularly in issues of <b>travel</b> <b>impedance</b> estimation and long distance travel network loading. Findings from this research lay a solid foundation for building the fundamental theoretical framework urgently needed for long distance travel studies and contribute significantly to the understanding of the supply side of long distance travel, from available infrastructure capacity and networks loading conditions to the induced environment challenges, infrastructure congestion, and investment costs, as well as facilitating policy making and evaluation pertain to long distance travel at national level...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccessibility {{is defined}} as a measure of the ease with which an {{individual}} can pursue an activity of a desired type, at a desired location, by a desired mode, and at a desired time. It influences the modal choice of a trip maker preferring public transport. Estimation of ridership of a public transport system is to predict the behavioral patterns of individuals and their influence on mode selection. Formulation of a framework for evaluating the accessibility of urban transportation networks and assessing its influence on the ridership of bus transit system is the main focus of the paper. The accessibility measures encompass a range of available opportunities with respect to the attractiveness and <b>travel</b> <b>impedance.</b> In this approach the accessibility measures were considered in geographically aggregated level mainly because of two reasons. One is that this framework is intended for planning decisions which by necessity deals with areas and not with individuals living in it. Another reason is to showcase the methodology of interrelating the accessibility measures and ridership of a transport system. Hence these measures are indispensable to be of plain and easy to understand and work with. The bus route (21 G) from Tambaram to Broadway in Chennai city was chosen for this study. It is of 35 km in length. Bus passenger opinion was collected at the bus stops of the study route. The questionnaire was prepared {{in such a way that}} it records the passengers’ accessible distance, time and cost of trips from their home to destination including transfers. Global Positioning System (GPS) and Electronic Ticketing Machines (ETM) are provided in all the buses operated in the route and these data were collected for a week. The OD pattern of travelers was taken from the Chennai City Traffic Study (CCTS) of Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and updated with the ETM and passenger opinion survey data. The in-vehicle travel time of the trips and headway of buses at each bus stop were obtained from GPS data. The headway of the trips alludes the waiting time of the passenger at bus stops. The study route was split up into 16 zones. Accessibility Index (AI) of the each zone was determined using Composite Impedance Gravity measure of Urban Accessibility Index tool of TransCAD. Multinomial Logit Model was chosen for aggregation of the accessibility measures in 2 dimensions viz. Time and Purpose. The AIs of the zones were presented in graphical form to show in which areas the accessibility of the public transportation is to be improved. A model was developed to relate the boarding and alighting of passengers at each bus stop with that of the AIs using Multiple Linear Regression. The various parameters of accessibility measures were determined and specific indices to represent the accessibility level of the transit corridor pertaining to key factors influencing the trip production and attraction are presented. It is demonstrated in the paper that how this approach could be developed into a decision supporting tool to assist in a range of transport and land-use planning activities. The impact on ridership for changes in the Accessibility Indices due to variation in bus transit fare and travel time is reported...|$|E
