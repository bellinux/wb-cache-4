5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E

5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth.

The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest.

40|$|The paper explores quantum {{mechanics}} of half-spin particle {{motion in the}} field of Reissner-Nordstroem (RN) naked singularity. It is shown that for any quantum mechanical Dirac particle, irrespective of availability and sign of its electrical charge, <b>the</b> RN <b>naked</b> singularity is separated by an infinitely high positive potential barrier. With like charges of a particle and the source of <b>the</b> RN <b>naked</b> singularity, near <b>the</b> origin there exists the second completely impenetrable potential barrier. It has been proved that {{in the field of}} <b>the</b> RN <b>naked</b> singularity, bound states of half-spin particles can exist. The conditions for appearance of such states were revealed and computations were performed to find energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Comment: 20 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

But he worked to design makeup for all skin tones. The idea was to empower a woman by revealing her natural beauty, and not to cover her up with layers of product." ...|$|R

40|$|Starch granule {{proteins}} (SGPs) are minor components {{bound with}} starch granule, whose variation could impact starch properties. This study investigated, {{for the first}} time, the variation of SGPs in <b>the</b> cultivated <b>naked</b> barley from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. The relationship between SGPs and starch content was preliminarily dealt with. Ten major SGPs and 16 types of patterns were present in <b>the</b> 66 cultivated <b>naked</b> varieties, indicating that the SGPs in cultivated naked barley from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China are polymorphic. <b>The</b> SGPs of <b>naked</b> barley in Tibet and Sichuan were greatly different and the SGP patterns were specific to sampling regions.

5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of {{the stars in the}} Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
