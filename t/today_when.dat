5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows.

The only part that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits <b>today.</b> <b>When</b> the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Metropolitan & St. John's Wood Railway was to run to underground north-east to Hampstead Village, and indeed this appeared on some maps.

This is still visible <b>today</b> <b>when</b> traveling on a southbound Metropolitan line service.|$|E

5|$|The wooden mock-up {{was ready}} for {{inspection}} {{at the end of}} April, and work started on two prototypes late in May. The J79 engine was not yet ready, so both prototypes were instead designed to use the Wright J65, a licensed built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire. Construction of the first prototype XF-104 (US serial number 53-7786, Buzz number FG-786) began in summer 1953 at Lockheed's Burbank, California factory. This aircraft was powered by a non-afterburning Buick-built Wright J65-B-3 turbojet. The first prototype was completed by early 1954, and started flying in March. The total time from award of the contract to first flight was only one year, a very short time even then, and unheard of <b>today,</b> <b>when</b> 10–15 years is more typical. Construction of the second prototype (s/n 53-7787) proceeded at a slower pace.|$|E

25|$|The offline combustion/reduction has {{the highest}} {{accuracy}} and precision for hydrogen isotope measurement without limits for sample types. The analytical uncertainty is typically 1~2‰ in δD. Thus it is still being used <b>today</b> <b>when</b> highest levels of precision are required. However, the offline preparation procedure is very time-consuming and complicated. It also requires large sample size (several 102 mg). Thus the online preparation based on combustion/reduction coupled with the subsequent continuous flow-IRMS (CF-IRMS) system has been more commonly used nowadays. Chromium reduction or high temperature conversion are the dominant online preparation methods {{for the detection of}} hydrogen isotope by IRMS.|$|E

25|$|Throughout most {{of human}} {{prehistory}} and history, listening to recorded music was not possible. Music {{was made by}} common people during both their work and leisure, as well as during religious activities. The work of economic production was often manual and communal. Manual labor often included singing by the workers, which served several practical purposes. It reduced the boredom of repetitive tasks, it kept the rhythm during synchronized pushes and pulls, and it set the pace of many activities such as planting, weeding, reaping, threshing, weaving, and milling. In leisure time, singing and playing musical instruments were common forms of entertainment and history-telling—even more common than <b>today,</b> <b>when</b> electrically enabled technologies and widespread literacy make other forms of entertainment and information-sharing competitive.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the early}} {{industries}} to establish itself in Johnstown was the Knox gelatine plant. It was built in 1890 by Charles B. Knox, a prominent Johnstown resident, who developed the granulated, unflavored gelatin still used in food preparation <b>today.</b> <b>When</b> Knox died in 1908, his wife Rose Knox assumed management of the business. She {{became one of the}} earliest successful American businesswomen. The Knox family and its philanthropic foundation were generous to the city. Results of their philanthropy can still be found there today. They gave the city the block of land known as Knox Field, where the playgrounds, athletic fields, and bridle path are located. Knox Junior High School was named in honor of the family. The Knox Gelatin plant, once a major employer in Johnstown, closed in 1975 following the sale of the company to the Lipton Tea Company.|$|E
25|$|The {{poor quality}} of the land though meant that {{employment}} for villagers was often of a casual nature. Straw plaiting was the chief occupation {{of women and children}} during most of the 19th century. The plait was sent to Luton or London. The availability of daily train services to London also provided income from pheasant rearing. Until the Second World War agriculture had been the principle industry in the area. During the 20th century, much of the land was gradually taken out of agricultural use until <b>today</b> <b>when</b> only a minimal acreage is given over to or cattle and sheep-grazing or arable farming. The relative closeness to Chesham provided opportunity for work within, for example, one of the many mills or boot factories. The arrival of the railway to Chesham during the 1880s, the relative closeness to London and other conurbations and improvement to the road networks and public transport resulted in work being sought from further afield. The village supported a number of small shops until the 1960s when supermarkets and increased car ownership sealed their fate.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reasons which had brought about this {{situation}} – most significantly in the early 20th century there was no firmly upheld legislation to protect what is now {{considered to be the}} nation's heritage. Additionally, public opinion did not have the sentiment and interest in national heritage that is evident in Britain <b>today.</b> <b>When</b> the loss of Britain's architectural heritage reached its height at the rate of one house every five days in 1955, few were particularly interested or bothered. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, to the British public still suffering from the deprivations of food rationing and restriction on building work the destruction of these great redundant houses was of little interest. From 1914 onwards there had been a huge exodus away from a life in domestic service; having experienced the less restricted and better paid life away from the great estates, few were anxious to return – this in itself was a further reason that life in the English country house was becoming near impossible to all but the very rich.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{inability}} {{at the time}} to speak Hong Kong Cantonese or read Chinese, Wu successfully completed his first movie, Yonfan's Bishonen in 1998. Still <b>today,</b> <b>when</b> he receives a Cantonese script, his assistant reads the entire piece, while he is making notes on the pronunciation. The day after Bishonen wrapped, Wu was offered the leading role in Mabel Cheung's City of Glass (for which Wu was nominated as best new actor at the 18th Hong Kong Film Awards), and later, a supporting part in Young and Dangerous: The Prequel, from Andrew Lau's gangster film series. Around this time, Wu met superstar Jackie Chan at a restaurant opening, and was quickly signed to Chan's JC Group with agent Willie Chan. Wu's breakthrough performance came in 1999 with his role in Benny Chan's Gen-X Cops. He followed this success with roles in a variety of movies including big-budget thriller Purple Storm, art-house production Peony Pavilion, and the extremely successful Love Undercover. In 2001, Wu received criticism from the Hong Kong media for sexual scenes with Suki Kwan in Cop on a Mission, but Wu says that same criticism attracted the attention of directors and the film represented {{a turning point in the}} types of roles he chose in the future.|$|E
