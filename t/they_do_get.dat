25|$|Aimé De Mesmaeker is a hot-tempered {{businessman}} who often visits the office (which he increasingly, {{and with some}} justification, sees as a madhouse) in order to sign some important contracts. However, the contracts are irrevocably jinxed: before De Mesmaeker can apply pen to paper, Gaston's latest gimmick comes along, provokes mayhem and causes the hapless businessman to storm out, rip the contracts up, {{or in some cases}} pass out. Even when <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> signed, Gaston can always be counted on to accidentally destroy them.|$|E
500|$|The second episode {{included}} {{the death of}} a main character. The idea was originally going {{to be used in the}} series finale. However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that [...] "the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [...] do risk their lives on our behalf and <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people." [...] The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly. Although Spooks is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt that anybody who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those people make jokes even though they have seen [...] "heinous things". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.|$|E

2500|$|Women {{should wait}} {{a few years after}} they first have {{intercourse}} before they start screening, and should not be screened before age 21. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and others recommend starting screening at age 21 (since that is a few years after initial sex for most American women). [...] Many other countries wait until age 25 or later to start screening. For instance, some parts of Great Britain start screening at age 25. ACOG's general recommendation is that people with uteruses age 30–65 have an annual well-woman examination, that they not get annual Pap tests, and that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> Pap tests at three-year intervals.|$|E

Bobby Ray Inman, the CIA's deputy director in 1981 and 1982, said LaRouche {{and his wife had}} visited him offering information about the West German Green Party, and a CIA spokesman said LaRouche met Deputy Director John McMahon in 1983 to discuss one of LaRouche's trips overseas. An aide to William Clark said when LaRouche's associates discussed technology or economics, they made good sense and seemed to be qualified. Norman Bailey, formerly with the National Security Council, said in 1984 that LaRouche's staff comprised [...] "one of the best private intelligence services in the world[...] [...] [...] They do {{know a lot of people}} around the world. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> to talk to prime ministers and presidents."
