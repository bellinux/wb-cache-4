40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the safety and efficacy of two device combinations used in parenchymal division during hepatic resections in non-cirrhotic patients and without inflow vascular occlusion. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 47 patients who underwent liver resection at our Institution from 2004 to 2010 using the TissueLink with either the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) or <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel.</b> <b>The</b> TissueLink was used with the CUSA in 27 patients and with <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> in 20 patients. ResultsMedian estimated blood loss (EBL) in <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> and CUSA groups was 250 and 1035  mL respectively (p <  0. 05). Three patients were transfused banked blood perioperatively in <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> group and 11 in the CUSA group (p <  0. 05). Median operative time in <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> and CUSA groups was 185 and 290  min respectively. Length of stay (LOS) was shorter in <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> group at 6 days compared to 7 days in the CUSA group (p <  0. 05). Perioperative complications were documented in 20 % and 26 % in <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> and CUSA groups, respectively. ConclusionsOur results show <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> with TissueLink to be a safe, effective method of parenchymal division with significantly less EBL and LOS when compared to CUSA with TissueLink...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate and compare laparoscopic pyloromyotomy methods involving <b>the</b> laparoscopic <b>scalpel</b> and <b>the</b> harmonic <b>scalpel</b> in pigs. <b>The</b> experiment was conducted on 4 subgroups of 12 animals subjected to laparoscopic-assisted pyloromyotomy with a surgical <b>scalpel</b> and <b>the</b> harmonic <b>scalpel,</b> as well as laparoscopic pyloromyotomy with Berci’s laparoscopic <b>scalpel</b> and <b>the</b> harmonic <b>scalpel.</b> No postsurgical complications were observed. Four weeks after the surgery, the animals were sacrificed and autopsy was performed. In one animal peritoneal adhesions between the intestines and the mini-laparotomy incision were found. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy and laparoscopic-assisted pyloromyotomy performed in pigs enabled the selection of laparoscopic entry sites, instruments for pyloromyotomy and evaluation of the applied surgical procedures in animals. The results of this study indicate that the methods applied can be safely used in clinical practice in dogs and cats due to minimal post-operative complications and fast healing of laparoscopic incisions in comparison with classical surgical wounds, and that <b>the</b> harmonic <b>scalpel</b> is a safe surgical instru-ment.

As though with <b>the</b> <b>scalpel</b> of a surgeon removing tumors, he deftly, coolly, cuts through the ephemeral malarkey that hitherto obscured his subjects.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the benefits and risks when using an Ultracision Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> in <b>the</b> surgical treatment of oral and oropharyngeal carcinomas. Study design: Prospective non-randomized. Setting: Clinica Otorinolaringoiatrica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria. Trieste, Italy. Subjects and methods: In this study, conducted from April 2008 to August 2010, 36 consecutive patients underwent resection of oral or oropharyngeal carcinoma and lateral lymphadenectomy using <b>the</b> Ultracision Harmonic <b>Scalpel.</b> Evaluation criteria included length of the surgical procedure, intraoperative blood loss, quantity of neck drainage on the first, second and third postoperative days, postoperative complications, and a subjective assessment of postoperative pain and lymphatic oedema of the neck. Results were compared with previous surgical procedures carried out between May 2006 and March 2008 using cold knife and bipolar haemostasis (n ¼ 36) when <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> was not available. Results: In patients treated with <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel,</b> operating time was significantly reduced, both for resection of the carcinoma and the lateral lymphadenectomy. Intraoperative blood loss and neck drainage on {{the first and second}} postoperative days were significantly less and pain scores were significantly lower than in the cold knife group. No postoperative complications were noted in <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> group. <b>The</b> only disadvantage noted in <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> group was <b>the</b> high incidence of lymphatic oedema of the neck. Conclusions: Use of <b>the</b> Harmonic <b>Scalpel</b> during resection of oral cancer and lateral lymphadenectomy is safe and confers some advantages over conventional methods...|$|R
