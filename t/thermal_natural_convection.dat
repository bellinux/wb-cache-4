Physical and/or mathematical models {{can be used in}} order to achieve optimum conditions for the clean steel during steelmaking processes. In the present study, important metallurgical transport phenomena in steelmaking ladles and tundishes have been investigated using both mathematical and physical (water) models. Through appropriate solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, the intermixing of fluid within gas-stirred ladles can be modelled quite satisfactorily. It is shown that off-centered bubbling gives the most consistent results in terms of minimising mixing times, since angular velocity components intermix fluid across the width of a ladle. Comparisons between mathematical and experimental data are presented. Fluid flow, heat transfer and inclusion flotation have been modelled mathematically for testing the behaviour of several tundish designs.

40|$|The mixed {{convection}} heat transfer and fluid flow behaviors in a lid– driven square cavity filled with high Prandtl number fluids at low Reynolds number {{have been studied}} using Thermal Lattice Boltzmann Method (TLBM). The LBM has built up on the D 2 Q 9 model called the Lattice-BGK (Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook) model. The Lattice Boltzmann momentum and energy equations are considered simultaneously to solve the problem. Effects of non dimensional mixed convection parameter, namely buoyancy parameter or Richardson number (Ri) in presence of heat generation (q) with moving lid are discussed to investigate the thermal and fluid flow behaviors.

40|$|Yucca Mountain, Nevada {{has been}} {{designated}} as the nation's high-level radioactive waste repository and the U. S. Department of Energy has been approved {{to apply to the}} U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license to construct a repository. Heat transfer in the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) drift enclosures is an important aspect of repository waste emplacement. Canisters containing radioactive waste are to be emplaced in tunnels drilled 500 m below the ground surface. After repository closure, decaying heat is transferred from waste packages to the host rock by a combination of <b>thermal</b> radiation, <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> and conduction heat transfer mechanism?. Current YMP mountain-scale and drift-scale numerical models often use a simplified porous medium code to model fluid and heat flow in the drift openings. To account for <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> heat transfer, the thermal conductivity of the air was increased in the porous medium model. The equivalent thermal conductivity, defined as the ratio of total heat flow to conductive heat flow, used in the porous media models was based on horizontal concentric cylinders. Such modeling does not effectively capture turbulent <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> in the open spaces as discussed by Webb et al. (2003) yet the approach is still widely used on the YMP project. In order to mechanistically model <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> conditions in YMP drifts, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT (Fluent, Incorporated, 2001) has been used to model <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> heat transfer in the YMP emplacement drifts. A two-dimensional (2 D) model representative of YMP geometry (e. g., includes waste package, drip shield, invert and drift wall) has been developed and numerical simulations made (Francis et al., 2003). Using CFD simulation results for both <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> and conduction-only heat transfer in a single phase, single component fluid, equivalent thermal conductivities have been calculated for different Rayleigh numbers. Correlation equations for equivalent thermal conductivity as a function of Rayleigh number were developed for the Yucca Mountain geometry and comparisons were made to experimental data and correlations found in the literature on <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> in horizontal concentric cylinders, a geometry similar to YMP. The objective of this work is to compare the results of CFD <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> simulations and conduction-only calculations that used the equivalent thermal conductivity to represent heat transfer by turbulent <b>natural</b> <b>convection.</b> The FLUENT code was used for both simulations with heat generation boundary condition at the waste package and constant temperature boundary condition 5 meters into the host rock formation. Comparisons are made of temperature contours in the drift air and temperature profiles at surfaces of the different engineered components using the two approaches.

The differences in temperature profiles reflect the use of a constant equivalent thermal conductivity. The effect of the differences is discussed...|$|R

The validated method is then used to rapidly predict the distribution of power in the PCB based on knowledge of the total input power and on discrete thermal probe data for the PCB. The principle of thermal superposition is fairly well documented for systems in which forced convection is dominant. This principle enables thermal characterization of systems and is particularly useful when used in conjunction with a design oriented CFD tool. This recent development makes it possible to complete most of the computational analysis before accurate electrical power information is available, with almost no compromise in accuracy.

Superposition breaks down as soon as there is significant <b>thermal</b> radiation and/or <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> in the system.

As a hybrid approach {{based on a}} common multi-scale Boltzmann-type model, the LB-DCM scheme is easy to implement and has an excellent flexibility {{in dealing with the}} irregular geometries. Separate particle distribution functions in the LBM are used to calculate the density field, the velocity field and the thermal field.

Then, bifurcation diagrams and dual solutions are presented for relevant radiative parameters, such as convection-radiation parameter Rc and optical thickness τ. Numerical results show that the presence of volumetric radiation changes the static temperature gradient of the fluid, and generally results in an increase in the flow critical value. Besides, the existence and development of dual solutions of transient convection in the presence of radiation are greatly affected by radiative parameters.

40|$|A <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> heat {{transfer}} experiment using a vertical plate held at constant heat flux in mercury with gas injection and a transverse magnetic field was performed. The experiment {{was conducted with}} heat fluxes up to 16 kW/m 2 (105 3 ̆c Bo x 3 ̆c 109), gas injection rates up to 9 cm 3 /sec and magnetic field intensities up to 0. 5 Tesla. Local {{heat transfer}} and bubble measurements were made using thermo-couple and double conductivity probes. ^ Measurements at low heat flux, where the flow was mostly laminar, indicated that gas injection enhanced the heat transfer coefficient two to three times. At high heat flux, where the flow was mostly turbulent and strong stratification was present, the observed enhancement was less pronounced. The enhancement mechanism at low heat flux was attributed to the bubbles which populate and induce turbulence inside a thick laminar thermal boundary layer. At high heat flux, however, the bubbles reside mostly outside a thin turbulent thermal boundary layer and act to suppress the stratification. ^ In {{the presence of a}} transverse magnetic field, the single-phase data at low heat flux agreed with the theoretical results of past investigations, while, at high heat flux, the heat transfer coefficient did not decrease as much in contrast with the same theory. This was attributed to the increasing influence of three-dimensional effects in turbulent magneto-fluid-mechanic <b>natural</b> <b>convection.</b> With the addition of gas injection at low heat flux, a magnetic field intensity of 0. 07 Tesla decreased the heat transfer coefficient six-fold in contrast to the enhanced value observed with injection. At a field intensity of 0. 35 Tesla, the reduction was fifteen-fold. At high heat flux, equivalent field intensities reduced the heat transfer coefficient slightly at 0. 07 Tesla and two-fold at 0. 35 Tesla. These results were attributed to the suppression of both thermally and bubble-induced fluid motions at low heat flux while mainly the thermally-induced turbulence was suppressed at high heat flux. These trends were further explained in terms of the changes in the bubble size and rise velocity with magnetic field intensity. ^ The influence of <b>thermal</b> stratification in <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> was additionally investigated. A new stratified Nusselt number, sNu, incorporating the stratification parameter, S, was introduced through theoretical arguments and shown to successfully correlate both present and past stratified <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> data. ^ Some theoretical considerations have also been forwarded to analyze our and other available data of the effect of the aspect ratio in <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> in an enclosure. ...|$|R
40|$|Equiaxed grain {{solidification}} in inoculated melts is modelled on a macroscopic scale. The grain initiation {{is based}} on grain refiners present in the alloy melt as in most industrial castings. The Avrami analytical approach is used to model equiaxed growth. The model considers <b>natural</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>convection</b> and grain transportation by the resultant fluid flow. Flow characteristics during solidification are incorporated into the model by considering the equiaxed grains in undercooled liquid initially as slurry and later as a porous medium when it becomes coherent. Solidification of Al– 7 wt. %Si is simulated for different conditions. Evolution of cooling-curve characteristics are compared with a previous model and found to be in close agreement. The model simulation results suggest that nucleation can continue even after the recalescense. The limitation of grain refinement by recalescense and the potential influence of solutal effects are discussed. Simulated equiaxed grain size distribution and temperature evolution in the presence and absence of convention are compared and contrasted...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{anisotropy}} of <b>thermal</b> conductivity and <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> on solidification {{have been studied}} numerically. A fixed grid enthalpy-based formulation was developed to model convection and anisotropic conduction during solidification of pure materials and alloys in a rectangular cavity. The time dependent governing equations, describing the conservation of mass, momentum, energy and concentration were solved using a vorticity-stream function formulation. A finite difference-finite volume method was employed, incorporating an improved discretization method and a modified Samarskii-Andreyev ADI scheme with internal iterations. The interface was tracked {{with the use of}} an interfacial energy equation. A monotonic second-order upwind scheme (MSOU) was used for convective fluxes with central differences for the diffusion terms of concentration. Comparisons between the present calculations, analytical solutions, existing experimental results and other numerical methods are very good. The improved discretisation method is shown to have an excellent performance as it can solve the discontinuity of temperature, velocity, vorticity and stream function across the solid-liquid interface. Effects of anisotropic conduction on the temperature distribution through a gallium crystal are examined. The results show that anisotropy distorts the isotherms, especially at the adiabatic boundaries, and also decreases the overall heat transfer at the isothermal walls. Effects of aspect ratio, Stefan number, liquid superheat and boundary conditions and anisotropy during solidification are investigated. A study of solidification from either the side wall or the top wall of a cavity containing pure gallium show that <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> has a significant effect on rate of solidification and the shape of the solid-liquid interface. The results, covering a range of values of Rayleigh number, aspect ratio and anisotropy characteristics, show how anisotropy affects the growth morphology and the flow structure. The effects of liquid aspect ratio on oscillatory convective flow during solidification are studied and compared with those for pure <b>natural</b> <b>convection.</b> Solidification from the side wall of a cavity containing a gallium- 0. 5 % wt indium alloy was considered. The results show that anisotropy distorts the interface shape, and hence the interface shape has an effect on solute redistribution and flow patterns. The code was also used for <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> driven melting problems of pure gallium where the interface shape is more irregular than in solidification problems. A correlation of the melting rate is given in terms of non-dimensional time, Rayleigh number, Stefan number and aspect ratio...|$|R
