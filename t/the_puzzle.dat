5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. <b>The</b> <b>puzzle</b> requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> laid out.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in <b>the</b> <b>puzzle.</b> Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve <b>the</b> <b>puzzle.</b> Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve <b>the</b> <b>puzzle.</b> The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the bonus}} round begins, the winning {{contestant}} chooses {{one of three}} categories {{for his or her}} puzzle (prior to season 35, <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> and category were predetermined). After doing so, the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize. He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed. The contestant provides three more consonants (four if he/she is holding the Wild Card) and one more vowel, then has 10 seconds to solve <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> after his or her other letters (if any) are revealed. The contestant may make as many guesses as necessary, so long as the contestant begins the correct answer before time expires. Whether or not the contestant solves <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> the host opens the envelope {{at the end of the}} round to reveal the prize at stake. Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts (with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000), a vehicle (or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams), and a top prize of $100,000.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>puzzles</b> in <b>the</b> {{game and}} its {{gameplay}} were well received. Kelly generally praised <b>the</b> <b>puzzles,</b> {{particularly those that}} played into the setting, but criticised some that involved [...] "traditional point-and-click puzzle absurdity". Johnson called <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> [...] "decently challenging" [...] and [...] "always meaningful", similarly praising them. Walker complimented <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> as [...] "often exemplary", but criticised a lack of direction in <b>the</b> game's early <b>puzzles.</b> Walker heavily criticised the final level for its puzzles, saying it lost the game's general [...] "joyful sense of coherence". Calling <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> [...] "organic", Khan particularly praised some of the game's [...] "verbal negotiations".

5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic <b>the</b> <b>puzzle,</b> or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E

5000|$|The tournament {{consists}} of five rounds, each featuring a puzzle that all competitors solve. There are three rounds {{in the morning}} and two in <b>the</b> early afternoon. <b>Puzzles</b> vary in size and difficulty from round to round. <b>The</b> <b>puzzles</b> are commissioned by the tournament directors from the top constructors in crosswords, with <b>the</b> fourth <b>puzzle</b> <b>the</b> hardest of <b>the</b> set. <b>The</b> <b>puzzles</b> vary in size, shape, and difficulty, although traditionally <b>the</b> first <b>puzzle</b> is a relatively easy 15x15 grid. <b>The</b> <b>puzzles</b> are always themed, and frequently themed in off-center, wacky ways not commonly seen in newspaper-published crosswords. For example, puzzles have included a [...] "Name That Tune" [...] gimmick; a post-solve Twister game; a <b>puzzle</b> that instructs <b>the</b> solver to eat a Chips Ahoy cookie upon completion; a <b>puzzle</b> that required <b>the</b> entire room of solvers to make noises from their chairs, and thus perform an impromptu rendition of John Cage's [...] "Four Minutes, Thirty-Three Seconds".

5|$|In his memoirs, Ismay {{recalled}} {{that he never}} solved <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> of how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people. A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface.

5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The Wild Card {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in <b>the</b> <b>puzzle.</b> The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card, which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it does take away the Wild Card, individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.|$|E

Goergen found some puzzles to be cleverly done, but said that some were esoteric. Ponce and Petit liked that <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> never became [...] "pixel hunts", and how everything is visible as long as the player looks carefully; because of this and the lack of red herrings, time limits and dead ends, Ponce found it to be better than other escape-the-room games. He applauded the large amount of content, saying that even someone only buying the game for <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> would be satisfied. Schilling and Thomas appreciated <b>the</b> <b>puzzles,</b> but found some solutions and hints to be too obvious or explanatory. Kemps found <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> excellently done and challenging, but disliked how difficult it was to reach the true ending. Kemps and Schreier appreciated how <b>the</b> <b>puzzles</b> felt logical, while they, along with Thomas and Arendt, criticized how the player has to re-do puzzle sequences upon subsequent playthroughs. Goergen, Schreier, Thomas and Arendt all appreciated the fast-forward function, as it made repeated playthroughs more bearable, but Thomas felt that it didn't go far enough in speeding up the process.|$|R

5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete <b>the</b> <b>puzzle.</b> At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves <b>the</b> <b>puzzle</b> or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E
