5|$|Walter Golic (Paul McGann) is {{a mentally}} {{unstable}} murderer and arsonist who is imprisoned on Fury 161. He sees the Alien killing Boggs and Rains and is later {{found in the}} cafeteria eating cereal, his face covered in blood.

When the Alien kills Clemens, he watches the creature admiringly.|$|E
5|$|At Payback, the Shield {{ended their}} feud with Evolution by {{defeating}} {{them in a}} six-man No Holds Barred elimination match. On the next Raw on June 2, Batista quit WWE in the storyline as Triple H, in wanting to continue the feud with the Shield, refused to grant Batista a one-on-one match for the WWE World Heavyweight title. Later that night, Seth Rollins <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Shield teammates and allied himself with Triple H's Authority, eventually winning the Money in the Bank briefcase. The remaining members of the Shield, Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, went their separate ways {{by the end of}} June. Cesaro ended his association with Paul Heyman in July on the night of Brock Lesnar's return. By that time, Cesaro had failed to win title matches for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, the Intercontinental Championship and the United States Championship.|$|E
5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} usually solitary, though aggregations of 2050 {{individuals}} have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations {{of several hundred}} zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors {{between male and female}} sharks, and in both cases the biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.|$|E

5|$|In 118 BC, King Micipsa of Numidia (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was {{succeeded by}} two {{legitimate}} sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and an illegitimate son, Jugurtha. Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated {{a division of}} the country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis, Gaius Marius, a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 BC over the objections of the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display. The populares party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself with Marius.|$|E
5|$|Several storylines {{formed the}} {{background}} for the opening match, which saw the fan favorite team of The Bad Guys (Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, Davey Boy Smith and The Headshrinkers) square off against the villainous team of The Teamsters (Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart and Jim Neidhart). Razor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since September 1993 when Ramon won the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels, the former champion, had been stripped of the belt. WWF President Jack Tunney scheduled a battle royal, in which Ramon and Rick Martel were the final participants remaining. They faced each other on Monday Night Raw, and Ramon won the match and was awarded the title. Michaels claimed {{that he was the}} rightful holder of the belt and refused to acknowledge Ramon as the champion. Diesel was serving as Michaels' bodyguard but soon became an active wrestler and carried on Michaels' feud with Ramon. In {{the months leading up to}} Survivor Series, Ramon had also developed a feud with Jeff Jarrett, and the two faced each other several times with the Intercontinental Championship on the line. Ramon's friend, the 1-2-3 Kid, took Ramon's side in these feuds, and the two formed an occasional tag team. The Headshrinkers had also been feuding with Michaels and Diesel since dropping the WWF Tag Team Championship to them on August 28. The Headshrinkers had several rematches but were unable to regain the belts. Finally, Davey Boy Smith was involved in a feud with his real-life brother-in-law Owen Hart and Hart's other brother-in-law, Jim Neidhart. Owen Hart had <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> brother Bret at the 1994 Royal Rumble, after which Smith got involved on Bret's side and Neidhart took Owen's side.|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{instead of}} the {{scheduled}} pro domo, the Assembly registered his resignation. Founding the independent newspaper Dreptatea, Fleva <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> former colleagues in power. In early 1896, he attacked Sturdza for his external policy, creating a scandal about the selective sponsoring of Aromanian schools throughout the Balkans. In his anti-Sturdza campaign, Fleva approached the country's breakaway socialist clubs. Some socialists did join his faction, but others condemned him for not supporting the immediate adoption of universal suffrage.|$|E

25|$|Eventually a {{fight was}} {{arranged}} between Welsh and Ritchie {{to be fought}} in Vancouver on 4 September 1913, but when Welsh <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> ankle in training the date was forced back to the 20th. Worse was to follow when the evening before the fight Ritchie left Vancouver, later citing unhappiness over the filming rights of the fight. Around the same time, a gold belt awarded to Welsh after he won the Commonwealth encounter with Mehegan, was stolen while on display at a tea room near his training quarters. The belt was recovered when an Australian, named Henry Beckett, was caught trying to smuggle {{it out of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|The Shield members briefly reunited {{once again}} (this time {{with all three}} men as fan favorites) at Survivor Series on November 20 during its {{traditional}} 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match, with Rollins and Reigns on Team Raw and Ambrose on Team SmackDown, when all three members executed their signature triple powerbomb on Ambrose's rival AJ Styles after Ambrose <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> team to attack Styles. In December 2016, The Shield appeared together again at Tribute to the Troops during a backstage segment with The Club (AJ Styles, Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows) and The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods). In April 2017, Ambrose moved to the Raw brand {{as a result of}} the Superstar Shake-up, with Rollins and Reigns also staying on Raw.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year Cibernético wrestled at both Triplemanía IV-B and Triplemanía V-B. At V-A he faced and defeated former ally Pierroth, Jr. in a singles match after Cibernético had <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> partner {{earlier in the}} year. Two days later he participated in the main event of Triplemania V-B as he teamed with Perro Aguayo, Octagón and El Canek to defeat Jake Roberts, Gorgeous George III, El Cobarde, Jr. and Fuerza Guerrera. A week later, on June 22, 1997 Cibernético defeated Máscara Sagrada to win the Mexican National Heavyweight Championship during an AAA show in Mexico City. Over the summer of 1997 Cibernético reignited his feud with El Canek, drawing on their past from the UWA. At the inaugural Verano de Escandalo El Canek defeated Cibernético in a Steel Cage Match.|$|E

25|$|On 22 April, Napoleon took most of {{his troops}} to the north to fight Archduke Charles in the Battle of Eckmühl. The emperor {{appointed}} Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières to lead a task force consisting of Marulaz's division, Karl Philipp von Wrede's Bavarian division, and Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor's French infantry division. The force was instructed to pursue Hiller's command. Late on 23 April, Hiller <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> pursuers. Marulaz, leading the 3rd and 19th Chasseurs and an infantry battalion, collided with the Austrians at Erharting village, just north of Mühldorf. The outnumbered French quickly pulled back to Neumarkt-Sankt Veit. Hiller attacked Bessières on 24 April in the Battle of Neumarkt-Sankt Veit. During the action, Marulaz was unable {{to hold back the}} Austrian center column. After the defeat, Bessières pulled back to Vilsbiburg.|$|E
25|$|Other matches {{announced}} for {{the event}} include an eight-man tag team match, where AAA representatives La Parka and Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) face Parka's rival, La Sociedad member Octagón and El Consejo members El Texano Jr., Toscano and Semental. The rivalry between Parka and Octagón had started at Rey de Reyes, where Octagón <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> longtime partner and kicked him out of La Sociedad. Another match announced for Triplemanía XX saw four lower-card rivalries grouped into one eight-person tag team match. In the match, the técnico team included female wrestler Faby Apache, male wrestler Fénix, Mini-Estrella Octagóncito and exotico Pimpinela Escarlata, while the rudo team included male wrestler Dark Dragon, Mini-Estrella Mini Charly Manson, female wrestler Sexy Star and exotico Yuriko.|$|E
25|$|At the 1991 Royal Rumble, Luke set {{a rather}} unfortunate record as he lasted {{a total of}} 4 seconds. Using the {{trademark}} arm-swing entrance, he climbed into the ring, walked across in a straight path, and was thrown over the top rope by Earthquake. In a televised 6 man tag-team match, the Bushwhackers teamed with Tugboat against Earthquake and the Nasty Boys; Tugboat <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> partners {{after a few minutes}} of action and joined Earthquake in laying the two New Zealanders out cold. After the heel turn Tugboat changed his name to Typhoon and together they became known as “The Natural Disasters”. The Bushwhackers demanded a chance to get even with the big team but were easily defeated at the 1991 SummerSlam PPV. After destroying the Bushwhackers, the Disasters targeted André the Giant who was at ringside on crutches due to an injury. The assault was stopped by the Legion of Doom who ran off the Natural Disasters.|$|E

25|$|Sting and The Giant won the WCW World Tag Team Championship at Slamboree in May when Hall <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{teammate}} Nash. Sting and The Giant also split, and {{the team}} was forced to vacate the title 18 days later. Sting then defeated The Giant at The Great American Bash in June {{to take control of}} the Tag Team titles and chose Nash as his partner. Throughout the summer, Sting and fellow nWo Wolfpac members Nash, Luger, and Konnan feuded with Hogan and nWo Hollywood. Sting also got involved in a feud with Bret Hart over their similar finishing holds, the Sharpshooter and the Scorpion Deathlock. Hart cost Sting and Nash the Tag titles by interfering in their match with Hall and The Giant on the July 20 Nitro. Sting and Hart squared off at Halloween Havoc, where Hart, the United States Champion, attacked Sting with a baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for several months.|$|E
25|$|Darius is a {{character}} in the Highlander novel Shadow of Obsession (1998) by Rebecca Neason. The story {{is set in the}} present (January 1996), when Darius is already dead. MacLeod returns to Seacouver from Sudan, where for nearly three months he has been helping Darius' protégé, Victor Paulus and his lover, Immortal Cynthia VanDervane. Then the story goes on from Cynthia's point of view, when she recalls how she had loved Darius in 409. When Alaric I was king of the Visigoths, she was his sister, then called Callestina, Darius his general and Grayson, Darius' second-in-command. While they prepared to invade Rome, Cynthia became Darius' lover and stayed so until the following year when the two armies sacked Rome, at which point Darius made clear he never loved her. Then Darius and Grayson left Rome to head north and reached Paris. There Darius fought Emrys, the oldest immortal at the time, and beheaded him. The power of love in Emrys' Quickening changed Darius completely and he decided to be a peacemaker. Grayson could not understand this and <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> teacher. He left Darius and joined Cynthia so that they could destroy Darius' work. Back in the present, MacLeod is unsuccessful at preventing Cynthia from killing Paulus, and he fights and beheads her.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning on Wednesday, January 23, 1991, at {{approximately}} 1:20a.m., Lunsford spotted a suspicious vehicle travelling along U.S. Highway 59, a white 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with Maine license plates. Lunsford pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road and <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> dashboard camera to record the traffic stop. He then got out of his cruiser and approached the vehicle. Inside the vehicle were three men, Baldemar Sambrano Villarreal, his younger half brother, Reynaldo Sambrano Villarreal, and their accomplice, Jesus Cortez Zambrano. Lunsford questioned the driver, Reynaldo Villarreal, and asked whether he had any ID on him, to which Villarreal replied no. He claimed that he had a driver's license but did not have it on him. He also said that he was helping his brother, Baldemar, drive the car. Unbeknownst to Lunsford, the three men had loaded the car with 31 pounds of marijuana, and were driving from Houston, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois, where they planned to sell it all. At 1:27a.m., Lunsford asked to look in the trunk of the vehicle and the men reluctantly agreed. Lunsford and Reynaldo opened the trunk and Lunsford could immediately smell the scent of marijuana.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2006, Chris Hero, a representative from Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), invaded ROH and targeted Danielson; the two exchanged words over the Internet before having a match together, with nearly the entire roster of both companies embarking on an interpromotional feud. Danielson became personally invested in this feud, and invaded CZW himself, which led to him having physical altercations {{with a number of}} CZW wrestlers. Hero intensified the rivalry, leading to the two wrestling at ROH's Hell Freezes Over event, where Danielson successfully defended the ROH World Championship. He soon filled the vacant slot on ROH's five-man team which participated in one of CZW's more popular attractions, a steel cage match called the Cage of Death, a ten-man tag team match in which a man from each team starts in the cage, and a random wrestler enters periodically thereafter. During the match, he <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> team by assaulting his rival Samoa Joe, before leaving the match and effectively abandoning his involvement in the animosity between the two promotions. As the interpromotional hostility with CZW heightened, Danielson also defended against challengers from the rival company, who had signed an open contract for any CZW wrestler willing to challenge for the ROH World Championship. Former champion Samoa Joe also challenged Danielson at Fight of the Century on August 5, but their match ended in a 60-minute draw.|$|E
25|$|During the 13th century CE, {{the region}} {{experienced}} Mongol invasions, affected {{areas such as}} Vietnamese coast, inland Burma and Java. In 1258, 1285 and 1287, the Mongols try to invade Đại Việt and Champa. The invasions were unsuccesful, yet both Dai Viet and Champa agreed to become tributary states to Yuan dynasty to avoid further conflicts. The Mongols also invaded Pagan Kingdom in Burma from 1277 to 1287, resulted in fragmentation of the Kingdom and rise of smaller Shan States ruled by local chieftains nominally submitted to Yuan dynasty. However in 1297, a new local power emerged. Myinsaing Kingdom became the real ruler of Central Burma and challenged the Mongol rule. This resulted in the second Mongol invasion of Burma in 1300, which was repulsed by Myinsaing. The Mongols would later in 1303 withdrawn from Burma. In 1292, The Mongols sent envoys to Singhasari Kingdom in Java to ask for submission to Mongol rule. Singhasari rejected the proposal and injured the envoys, enraged the Mongols and made them sent a large invasion fleet to Java. Unbeknownst to them, Singhasari collapsed in 1293 due to a revolt by Kadiri, one of its vassals. When the Mongols arrived in Java, a local prince named Raden Wijaya offered his service to assist the Mongols in punishing Kadiri. After Kadiri was defeated, Wijaya <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Mongol allies, ambushed their invasion fleet and forced them to immediately leave Java.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event of the evening, Dr. Wagner Jr., {{accompanied}} by his brother Silver King and son El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr., faced Máscara Año 2000 Jr., accompanied by his father Máscara Año 2000, in a Mask vs. Mask match. Máscara Año 2000 interfered in the match on several occasions, and when, {{towards the end of}} the match, he interfered once again, Silver King grabbed a steel chair and looked to attack him, but instead <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> brother. As the fans in attendance started to fill the ring with trash, El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr. entered and attacked his uncle and Máscara Año 2000, but was then taken out by Máscara Año 2000 Jr. The El Consejo member was now in full control of the match, but when he was unable to finish Wagner Jr., Silver King and Máscara Año 2000 once again returned to the ring. However, so did El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr., who dove onto the two men with a flying kick, taking them out of the equation. He then gave a glass bottle to his father, who broke it over Máscara Año 2000 Jr.'s head and then dropped him with his finishing maneuver, the Wagner Driver, for the win. Following the match, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. was unmasked by his daughter, while he revealed that he was Ángel Reyes, originally from Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco. The twentieth Triplemanía ended with Wagner Jr. celebrating in the ring.|$|E
