25|$|A contact {{microphone}} picks up vibrations {{directly from a}} solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones {{have been used to}} pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A <b>throat</b> <b>microphone</b> is a variant of the {{contact microphone}} that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.|$|E
25|$|With the U.S. Army's {{approval}} of the Shure T-17 microphone for use during World War II, Shure began producing what would be several specialized microphones for U.S. military use during that war. Shure's adoption of the Military Standard Specification, and product redesigns intended to conserve raw materials essential to the war effort, positioned the company to fulfill the military's needs for specialized microphones. The T-17 Battle Announce Microphone was {{the most widely used}} microphone in the U.S. Army and Air Force during World War II, and featured a plastic case that conserved aluminum and lighter and more reliable {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and climates.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a pilot study using <b>throat</b> <b>microphones</b> for recording respiratory sounds. We demonstrate that inhalation noises are louder before longer stretches of speech than before shorter utterances (< 1 s) and in silent breathing. We thus replicate the results from our earlier study which used close-talking head-mounted microphones, without the associated data loss due to cross-talk. We also show that inhalations are louder within than before a speaking turn. Hence, the study provides another piece of evidence in favour of communicative functions of respiratory noises serving as potential turn-taking (for instance, turn-holding) cues.  Swedish Research Council grant 2014 - 1072 Andning i samtal (Breathing in conversation...|$|R

50|$|Another early voice effect {{using the}} same {{principle}} of the throat as a filter was the Sonovox, invented by Gilbert Wright in 1939.

The Sonovox was marketed and promoted by the Wright-Sonovox company, an affiliate of the Free & Peters advertising agency.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1939, Rey used {{a carbon}} <b>throat</b> <b>microphone</b> to {{modulate}} his electric guitar sound.

50|$|A <b>throat</b> <b>{{microphone}},</b> also laryngophone, {{is a type}} {{of contact}} microphone that absorbs vibrations directly from the wearer's throat by way of single or dual sensors worn against the neck. The sensors, called transducers, can pick up speech even in extremely noisy or windy environments such as on a motorcycle, or in a nightclub. Other types of microphones do not function well under these conditions because of high levels of background noise. Advanced laryngophones are able to pick up whispers, and therefore perform well in environments where communicating with others at a distance in silence is required, such as during covert military operations. Throat microphones are also very useful when helmets or respiratory protection is required. Many full-face SCBA, CABA, SAR respirator, PAPR or re-breather masks do not have a provision for a microphone inside the mask. The <b>throat</b> <b>microphone</b> can be used safely, as it is positioned outside the mask's face seal and as such does not compromise the respiratory protection provided by the mask, nor does it violate mask approvals and certification.|$|E
2500|$|A noise-canceling {{microphone}} is {{a highly}} directional design intended for noisy environments. [...] One such use is in aircraft cockpits where they are normally installed as boom microphones on headsets. Another use is in live event support on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with live performances. Many noise-canceling microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source {{and the second is}} positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm's signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by ports open to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as Garth Brooks and Janet Jackson. A few noise-canceling <b>microphones</b> are <b>throat</b> <b>microphones.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Guderian {{believed}} that among those things needed for success was for commanders of mobile forces {{to be able}} {{to communicate with each other}} and their sub-units. Guderian insisted in 1933 that German tanks be equipped with radios and intercoms (<b>throat</b> <b>microphones)</b> to enable each tank commander to communicate with his crew and with other tanks in his platoon and company. [...] In each individual German tank, the tank crew worked as a team, and the tank commander could communicate with each crew member. Moreover, German tanks worked collectively as teams, providing mutual protection and increased effective firepower. [...] Said Hermann Balck: [...] "The decisive breakthrough into modern military thinking came with Guderian, and it came not only in armor, but in communication." [...] Of Guderian's contributions, Balck considered some of the most important to be the five man tank crew, with a dedicated radio operator in the hull of the tank, and the organization of divisional signals troops to allow the commander to direct the division from any unit. This allowed forward control of the division, which was critical to mobile warfare. The German victories from 1939 through 1941 were not due to superior equipment, but to superior tactics in the use of that equipment, and superior command and control which allowed the German panzer forces to operate at a much faster pace.|$|R
2500|$|The Soviets {{stripped}} down their P-40s significantly for combat, {{in many cases}} removing the wing guns altogether in P-40B/C types, for example. Soviet Air Force reports state that they liked the range and fuel capacity of the P-40, which were superior {{to most of the}} Soviet fighters, though they still preferred the P-39. Soviet pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov recalled: [...] "The cockpit was vast and high. At first it felt unpleasant to sit waist-high in glass, as the edge of the fuselage was almost at waist level. But the bullet-proof glass and armored seat were strong and visibility was good. The radio was also good. It was powerful, reliable, but only on HF (high frequency). The American radios did not have hand <b>microphones</b> but <b>throat</b> <b>microphones.</b> These were good throat mikes: small, light and comfortable." [...] The biggest complaint of some Soviet airmen was its poor climb rate and problems with maintenance, especially with burning out the engines. [...] VVS pilots usually flew the P-40 at War Emergency Power settings while in combat, bringing the acceleration and speed performance closer to that of their German rivals, but could burn out engines in a matter of weeks. They also had difficulty with the more demanding requirements for fuel quality and oil purity of the Allison engines. A fair number of burnt out P-40s were re-engined with Soviet Klimov engines but these performed relatively poorly and were relegated to rear area use.|$|R
50|$|The Modifying Phonation Intervals (MPI) Stuttering Treatment Program is very {{effective}} in training adults who stutter to achieve generalized fluent and natural sounding speech by learning to speak with a reduced number of short intervals of phonation.

40|$|Speech {{intelligibility}} can {{be severely}} degraded by {{high levels of}} acoustic noise. Researchers have developed {{a variety of techniques}} to minimize the impact of noise, ranging from adaptive noise cancellation to <b>throat</b> <b>microphones.</b> Increasingly, researchers are experimenting with the measurement and analysis of bioelectric signals associated with speech in an effort to further minimize— or even completely eliminate—the degrading effects of acoustic noise. Such techniques, either on their own or fused with other modalities, hold promise for improving human communication and human-computer interaction. The bioelectric technique used in this research is electromyography, the study of muscle function through its electrical properties. Electrical activity associated with speech can be detected by non-invasive surface sensors mounted in the region of the face and neck. Sensing of this type is not directly interfered with by acoustic noise (although indirect effects, akin to the Lombard effect, require further study). First responders are an example of a class of users that stand to benefit from reliable communication in acoustically harsh environments. For example, sirens, engines, and saws all add noise to a typical firefighting scene, as does the breathing apparatus a firefighter wears. This work was motivated in part by a desire to see whether EMG-based speech recognition could alleviate these effects (and is part of a broader effort at NASA investigating the physiology, signal processing, and applications of EMG-based speech recognition). In the portion of the research reported here, EMG data were collected from a male subject under laboratory conditions. Data samples were used to train a neural network classifier and to test the generalizability of the network. The trained network was then inserted into a real-time communication and control system while the subject was exposed to approximately 80 dB acoustic noise. Isolated phrases recognized from the EMG signal can be communicated to a cellular phone or used to control a robotic platform (see Figure 1) ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the mid-1990s}} progressed, the terms [...] "organic" [...] and [...] "imitative" [...] {{began to be}} used to {{describe}} contrasting a cappella vocal percussion styles, with Thacher as the most prominent progenitor of the [...] "organic" [...] approach, combining blatantly literal replication of drums with sounds that didn't seek to duplicate, but rather fill the role of a drum or percussive instrument. Thacher was also the first vocal percussionist to employ a <b>throat</b> <b>microphone</b> (aka [...] "throat mic") using electronic guitar pickups adhered to the larynx area of the throat (see piezoelectric sensor).
