5|$|However, {{the project}} was subject to {{significant}} delays due to cost overruns and contract re-negotiations. This was partly due to difficulties combining refurbished Nimrod MR2 fuselages, which had not been built <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> standard, with newly built wings. The numbers of aircraft to be procured fell from 21 to nine over a course of years, while costs continued to climb.|$|E
5|$|Non{{benzodiazepine}}s also bind to the benzodiazepine {{binding site}} on the GABAA receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> receptor site.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the ideal}} ages for {{marriage}} were thirty {{for a man}} and twenty for a woman, it was common for a male to marry at age sixteen and a female at age fourteen. To encourage families to marry off their daughters, a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried {{women between the ages}} of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where one could not marry a person who had the same surname, even if both partners could not be traced back <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor (however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons). Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had their daughters marry kings and even the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{work began}} {{during the middle}} of {{production}} on the Persona 2 duology. Featuring staff from the Megami Tensei franchise including artist Kazuma Kaneko and composer Shoji Meguro, development took approximately two years. It was the first game developed by Atlus to feature full voice acting, and one of the company's earliest fully 3D titles. The PS2 remake changed a number of gameplay elements, introduced further cutscenes, adjusted the music, and added the third-person perspective in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> trend in Japan of first-person games causing motion sickness. The game sold well in Japan, and was met with mixed to positive reviews worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the many}} ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, {{practices}} and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, {{there are a number}} of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana (solidarity), vintana (destiny), tody (karma), and hasina, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the GR1B/T2B upgrade, the RAF {{launched}} a plan to upgrade its Jaguar fleet <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> standard, incorporating improvements introduced to some aircraft during the Gulf War, together with adding the ability to use TIALD and new reconnaissance pods. The upgrade came in two parts; the interim GR3 (Jaguar 96) upgrade added a new HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation. It was delivered in two standards, for recce and TIALD. The further upgraded Jaguar GR3A (also known as Jaguar 97) introduced fleet-wide compatibility with TIALD and the new EO GP1 (JRP) digital reconnaissance pod, a helmet mounted sight, improved cockpit displays, a datalink, and improved Night vision goggles compatibility. All GR3As were subsequently re-engined with the new Adour 106 turbofan.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Mongolian {{belongs to}} the Mongolic languages.

Such data might account for the historical development of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities.

5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the five member nations, which could eventually lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> East African shilling.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{changes were}} made both during and shortly after the war. Owing to {{obsolete}} navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, a recent technology at the time. Prior to 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina known as Operation Deliberate Force, a dozen Jaguars were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively. Shortly afterwards, the RAF upgraded its Jaguar fleet <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> standard, incorporating TIALD {{and the ability to}} use new reconnaissance pods.

40|$|AbstractThe max-flow min-cut theorem is used <b>to</b> give <b>a</b> {{necessary}} and sufficient condition {{for one or}} two finite families of finite non-negative vectors <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> (<b>common)</b> vector transversal. The duality theorem of linear programming is then used to prove the polymatroid intersection theorem for any finite number of polymatroids, which in turn is used <b>to</b> give <b>a</b> {{necessary and}} sufficient condition for any finite number of finite families of finite sets <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> <b>common</b> vector transversal.

This provides a weak generalization of the well-known conditions of Hall and of Ford and Fulkerson for one and two families of sets, respectively, <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> (<b>common)</b> transversal. It also provides a stronger necessary condition than was previously known for three or more families of sets <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> <b>common</b> transversal...|$|R

Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing driveshaft. However, the V-22 is generally not capable of hovering on one engine. If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The V-22's autorotation characteristics are poor partly because the rotors have low inertia.|$|E

The task of converting the existing airframes was transferred in-house to BAE Systems Woodford.

5|$|Variety and realism were focuses for the tracks: they {{featured}} visuals such as forests, Neon Cities, and Canyons, {{complete with}} obstacles. The team travelled {{to photograph the}} textures. The tracks were constructed in Softimage 3D and converted to PlayStation format mesh data using a custom tool. In response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> criticism of the original Destruction Derby, the tracks were designed to be larger and less narrow. The team were inspired by Daytonas revolving windmills, and large jumps were implemented to add drama to the tracks. The most realistic aspect of the race tracks was the pit stop, although Edmondson stated that he limited players to one stop because the team {{did not want to}} detract from the action and because a penalty system would have added a lot of extra work. Cars nearing destruction were designed to behave in a realistic and unpredicatable fashion through effects such as losing the bonnet (hood) and catching on fire.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1705 the Russian Field Marshal Boris Sheremetyev set up {{a meeting}} with the Saxon general Otto Arnold von Paykull in order to agree <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> course of action in the ensuing campaign. The basis for the {{strategy}} was a plan developed by Johann Patkul as early as 1703, which envisioned a joint strike which would neutralize the Swedish army. von Paykull, inspired by Patkul's blueprint, advocated {{it as a way to}} lure Charles and the main Swedish army out of Greater Poland eastward towards Brest-Litovsk. This was to be accomplished by having the combined forces of the main Russian army under Ogilvy and von Paykull's troops stationed at Brest, which would force Charles to meet them in battle. At the same time the main Saxon army would attack Charles from the rear by sweeping through Poland out of Saxony, ultimately catching the Swedish army exposed. The plan seemed rather daring to Patkul and he suggested that the allies should first crush Lewenhaupt's army, before Ogilvy's troops approached Charles. Otherwise Ogilvy's rear would be threatened. A compromise was made between the two strategies and it was decided that Sheremetyev should engage Lewenhaupt at the same time as Ogilvy marched towards the strongly fortified city of Grodno. The belief was that there, behind fortifications, Oglivy would be able to withstand Charles long enough for the main Saxon army to arrive from Kraków. Meanwhile, von Paykull would attack with his combined Saxon–Polish force towards Warsaw in order to interrupt the coronation of Stanisław I.|$|E
5|$|The four tenders {{resulting}} from the study were submitted during October and November 1986. Although the IKL/HDW design was rated highest during the initial inspection, the evaluation team found that the German proposal was less attractive than previously thought. Although IKL/HDW claimed that their boat could meet the RAN's performance requirements, the evaluators concluded from the information provided that doing so would require the deactivation of all non-essential and some essential systems. Conversely, Kockums' proposal conceded {{that they did not}} meet the requirements, although evaluators found that the figures failed by only narrow margins, and believed that these were conservative. The evaluation team recalculated the capability statistics for both submarines <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> baseline, portraying the predicted Australian operating conditions, which generally saw Kockums' figures revised upwards, and those from IKL/HDW downwards. This resulted in growing support for the Type471 bid, and outcries from the IKL and HDW groups, who questioned the validity of the recalculations and if the Australian evaluators had the experience to do this correctly.|$|E
