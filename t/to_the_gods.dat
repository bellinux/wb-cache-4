5|$|François Rabelais immortalized Arcadelt in the {{introduction}} to Book IV of Gargantua and Pantagruel, where he includes the musician between Clément Janequin and Claudin de Sermisy as part of a choir singing a ribald song, in which Priapus boasts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> on Mount Olympus of his method of using a mallet to deflower a new bride.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt {{made it impossible for}} him to do so in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E

5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{a team of}} archeologists {{found three}} mummies of {{children}} {{on the top of}} Llullaillaco. At the time of their death they were six, seven, and fifteen years old. They were ostensibly human sacrifices offered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> of the Inka pantheon on mountaintops. In 2003 they were at the Catholic University of Salta, but starting from 2007 they {{can be found at the}} Museum of High Altitude Archaeology of Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Lalabhaksa (saliva as food): As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, a Brahmin, a Ksahtriya or a Vaishya husband, who forces {{his wife}} to drink his semen out of lust and to enforce his control, is thrown in a river of semen, which he is forced to drink. The Vishnu Purana disagrees stating that one who eats before {{offering}} food <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> the ancestors or guests is brought to this hell.|$|E
5|$|Many temples {{were now}} built entirely of stone, and their general plan became fixed, with the sanctuary, halls, courtyards, and pylon {{gateways}} oriented {{along the path}} used for festival processions. New Kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs a great distance from their mortuary temples. Without pyramids to build around, mortuary temples began using the same plan as those dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods.</b>|$|E
5|$|Physical {{objects are}} conceptually {{imported}} {{into the situation}} as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> of Homer... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.|$|E

50|$|Recent epigraphic {{studies suggest}} that they spoke a ‘Q-Celtic’ {{language}} akin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neighbouring Gallaeci Lucenses and Braccarenses (see Gallaecia). Although the Celtic language was lost during the Low Middle Ages it still endures in many names of villages and geographical features, mostly associated <b>to</b> Celtic deities: <b>the</b> parish of Taranes and the villages of Tereñes, Táranu, Tarañu and Torañu related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Taranis, <b>the</b> parish of Lugones related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Lugh or <b>the</b> parish of Beleño related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>god</b> Belenus, just <b>to</b> name a few.|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} religious rite for Heathens is called blót, which constitutes a ritual in which offerings are provided <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods.</b> Blót typically takes place outdoors, and usually {{consists of an}} offering of mead, which is contained within a bowl. The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid, as the priest uses a sprig or branch of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants. This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised. Finally, the bowl of mead is poured onto a fire, or onto the earth, as a final libation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods.</b> Sometimes, a communal meal is held afterward; in some groups this is incorporated {{as part of the}} ritual itself. In other instances, the blót is simpler and less ritualized; in this case, it can involve a practitioner setting some food aside, sometimes without words, for either gods or wights. Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis, although for others it is a more occasional performance. Aside from honoring deities, communal blóts also serve as a form of group bonding.|$|E
5|$|The myth {{details the}} incestuous {{relationship}} between Myrrha and her father, Cinyras. Myrrha {{falls in love}} with her father and tricks him into sexual intercourse. After discovering her identity, Cinyras draws his sword and pursues Myrrha. She flees across Arabia and, after nine months, turns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> for help. They take pity on her and transform her into a myrrh tree. While in plant form, Myrrha gives birth to Adonis. According to legend, the aromatic exudings of the myrrh tree are Myrrha's tears.|$|E
5|$|When Philip {{returned}} to Pella, {{he fell in}} love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice, the niece of his general Attalus. The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian. During the wedding banquet, a drunken Attalus publicly prayed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> that the union would produce a legitimate heir.|$|E

5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely linked {{in the system}} of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil registers. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by the gods.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the year, the first Senate meeting always took place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Other venues could include the Temple of Fides or the Temple of Concord, or, if the meeting was outside of the formal boundary of the city, at the Temple of Apollo or (if a war meeting) at the Temple of Bellona. In addition, the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> was made, and a search for divine omens (the auspices) was taken. The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods. The Senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan (also {{known as}} Chinggis Khan) lost his {{battle against the}} Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking {{protection}} in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and then put it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods.</b>|$|E

5|$|However much it was believed, the king's divine {{status was}} the {{rationale}} {{for his role as}} Egypt's representative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods,</b> as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{the band}} re-recorded {{the best of}} their early material, and {{released}} it as a compilation titled Days of Purgatory. Released in 1998, Something Wicked This Way Comes reached number19 on the German Media Control Charts. They followed up with the live album Alive in Athens(1999). In 2001, the band released their sixth full-length Horror Show—which reached the top 30 on the Austrian Ö3 Top 40 and German charts—and later that year, the five-disc box set Dark Genesis, which contained remastered versions of their first three studio albums, the demo Enter the Realm, and a studio album only of cover versions, titled Tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gods.</b> The latter disc was released separately in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt Darius built many {{temples and}} {{restored}} {{those that had}} previously been destroyed. Even though Darius was a Zoroastrian, he built temples dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gods</b> of the Ancient Egyptian religion. Several temples found were dedicated to Ptah and Nekhbet. Darius also created several roads and routes in Egypt. The monuments that Darius built were often inscribed in the official languages of the Persian Empire, Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian and Egyptian hieroglyphs. To construct these monuments Darius employed a large number of workers and artisans of diverse nationalities. Several of these workers were deportees who had been employed specifically for these projects. These deportees enhanced the empire's economy and improved inter-cultural relations. At the time of Darius's death construction projects were still under way. Xerxes completed these works and in some cases expanded his father's projects by erecting new buildings of his own.|$|E
