5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was believed to}} have formed from a low-pressure area, possibly on {{the tail end of}} a cold front on October 14. The storm moved westward; however, it began <b>to</b> <b>curve</b> west-southwestward on October 15, as it reached its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest on October 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida on October 17 as a tropical depression. No damage is known to have been caused by the {{tropical storm}}.|$|E
5|$|Although {{work had}} begun on the Millfields station, {{including}} {{the completion of}} the station hotel (now the Unicorn pub), the population of Chesham were unhappy at the station being built such a distance from the town. With the extension to meet the LNWR abandoned the railway no longer needed <b>to</b> <b>curve</b> away from the town, and a public subscription raised Â£2,000 fund a 71-chain (1,562-yd; 1,428m) extension to a site near the town centre. Construction of the branch to Chesham began in late 1887.|$|E

5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how <b>to</b> <b>curve.</b> What this means is addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve {{as a source for}} gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to the curvature of spacetime.|$|E

5|$|The tenth {{storm of}} the season formed on October 15 as a {{tropical}} storm east of the Bahamas and north of Hispaniola. The tropical storm moved northwest, but changed direction and began <b>to</b> <b>curve</b> northeastward on October 17. As the storm moved eastward, it slowly strengthened; the storm attained its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on October 18. The tropical storm headed directly eastward on October 19, and dissipated in the open Atlantic on October 20.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold-core low}} which {{affected}} the latter stages of Josephine {{developed at the}} surface and became a subtropical storm on October 6, about 875mi (1,408.1km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The subtropical storm moved southwest and slowly curved westward, nearly intensifying into a hurricane. On October 11, the subtropical storm finally acquired tropical characteristics. Simultaneously, the now-tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane, and was re-classified as Hurricane Lili. After becoming a hurricane, Lili headed rapidly west-southwestward, and did not intensify past maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h). After passing 140mi (230km) south of Bermuda later that day, Lili began <b>to</b> <b>curve</b> slowly northward, thereby avoiding landfall in the United States. While about 200mi (321.9km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, Lili weakened back to tropical storm intensity. Weakening to a tropical storm, Lili curved northeastward and accelerated toward Atlantic Canada. However, Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm on October 14, just offshore of Nova Scotia. The post-tropical cyclone made landfall on Newfoundland soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{tropical storm}} status, the system {{took on a}} slower and more westerly path across the Bay of Bengal. Gradually strengthening, the system attained typhoon intensity (or modern-day Severe Cyclonic Storm-equivalent) at 00:00UTC on November26. Shortly after reaching this strength, the cyclone began <b>to</b> <b>curve</b> northward, rounding the western periphery of a subtropical ridge centered over Indochina. Due to the ridge's broad size, the tropical cyclone was steered generally due north rather than northeast. Gradual intensification continued as the storm progressed closer to the coasts of Bangladesh and East India. At around 12:00UTC on November29, the tropical cyclone made landfall near the border between Bangladesh and West Bengal {{at the mouth of}} the Hooghly River. At the time, the JTWC analyzed the storm to have had maximum sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph); this was the cyclone's peak intensity. After landfall, the storm slowly weakened over Bangladesh and was last noted as a cyclonic storm-equivalent with sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph) on November30.|$|E

For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|As {{the system}} {{continued}} to move west on October 9, it strengthened into a hurricane, {{and while it}} began <b>to</b> <b>curve</b> toward the west-northwest, further strengthening occurred, as it intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane made landfall in Nicaragua on October 10 as a Category 3 hurricane. The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled west-northwestward on October 11, later passing over the Gulf of Honduras. It later struck Belize on October 13 as a strong Category 1 hurricane on October 13, tracking north-northwestward.|$|E
5|$|Convection {{began to}} {{increase}} on July 6, {{supported on the}} basis that many showers were observed {{to the north of the}} depression. An anticycloneâa large mass of air rotating clockwiseâintensified within the depression's vicinity, resulting in a tighter pressure gradient and increasing winds to the north of the center of the depression. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cindy early on July 7, and a reconnaissance flight into the storm late during the afternoon observed maximum sustained winds of 60â65mph (95â100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 997mbar (hPa; 29.44inHg). Cindy began <b>to</b> <b>curve</b> westward late on July 7 as it reached peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg), and drifted due west early on July 8 as a result of a maturing surface high to its north. Steady intensification continued throughout the day, and the storm attained hurricane status during the morning of July 8.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} is a metric {{theory of}} gravitation. At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe {{the relation between}} the geometry of a four-dimensional, pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energyâmomentum contained in that spacetime. Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energyâmomentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how <b>to</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, the {{hurricane}} weakened to {{a tropical storm}} again on October 14 as it moved overland, and began <b>to</b> <b>curve</b> north-northwest, restrengthening to a major hurricane by October 17 while it was west-southwest of Cuba.

The hurricane continued traveling north-northwest; however, it was forced to re-curve south-southwest, {{as a result of a}} high-pressure area. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm overland, eventually becoming a tropical depression. The system meandered into the Gulf of Mexico, making a final landfall in Central America on October 23.|$|E

5|$|In Elmhurst, the {{destruction}} of {{almost all of the}} century-old buildings {{in the heart of the}} village were destroyed for the construction of the subway.

Many nineteenth century residences and the Wandowenock Fire Company buildings had to be torn down. To allow the subway line <b>to</b> <b>curve</b> into Queens Boulevard from Broadway, the northeast corner of the two streets was removed, in addition to some stores and an old Presbyterian chapel.

Commercial buildings and apartment houses replaced existing structures.|$|E
5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum.
