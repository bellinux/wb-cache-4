O objetivo era de estudar a din?mica do uso de solo onde h? vest?gios ou fragmentos de ocupa??es humanas amer?ndias pret?ritas. O caminho percorrido em busca de resultados incluiu a realiza??o de entrevistas abertas e caminhadas ao longo de 7, 5 km. Ap?s as etapas de campo, chegou-se aos padr?es de como ? realizado o uso do solo, {{conforme}} o calend?rio, cuja determina??o ? definida e organizada pelas subidas, pela cheia, pela descida e pela seca dos rios, dos lagos e dos igarap?s. Por isso, h? tr?s padr?es de din?mica do uso do solo. O primeiro em pr?ticas de agricultura familiar e em planta??es de diversas esp?cies que servem na dieta alimentar e na medicina popular. O segundo na utiliza??o em pasto para o gado, o qual fica por seis meses na ?rea de terra?os, ou seja, na ?rea de terra firme, na ?poca das cheias dos rios; no per?odo da seca, o gado ? transportado para a ?rea de v?rzea. O terceiro ? utilizado em ?rea de lazer, na constru??o naval e nas edifica??es residenciais e servi?os sociais. Assim, 40 % est?o em uso na produ??o de alimentos; 36 %, em ?rea de pasto; e 14 %, nas outras atividades de servi?os na comunidade. A introdu??o do gado pelas fam?lias na ?rea da comunidade ocorreu por volta dos anos 60 do s?culo passado, e essa cria??o funciona como uma poupan?a, pois, se existe a necessidade de recursos, a fam?lia recorre a ele. E, na regi?o, h? uma linha no tempo-espa?o de t?cnicas de produ??es de cer?micas a qual permite considerar que, no passado, a ?rea seria um doscentros fornecedores de modelos ou da tradi??o de ceramistas. This {{work was}} carried out in the community falls into the water in Manaquiri AM. The aim was to study the dynamics of land use where there are traces of human occupation or fragments Amerindian preterit. The path in search results was the implementation of open interviews and hiking along a 7. 5 km. After the phases of the field reached the standards of how it is done using the soil as the calendar, whose determination is defined and organized by the rise, full, descent and siltation of rivers, lakes and streams. Therefore, there are three patterns of land use dynamics. The first is in practices of family farms and plantations of several species that are used in diet and in folk medicine. The second is the use of pasture for livestock. The cattle stays for six months in the area of terraces or in the area of land during the flood season the rivers; in the dry season, it is transported to the wetland. The third is used in the leisure area, shipbuilding and in residential buildings and social services. Thus, 40 % are used in food production, 36 % in the pasture area and 14 % in other service activities in the community. The introduction of livestock by households in the community area occurred around the 60 ?s of the last century and that process works as savings, because, if {{there is a need for}} resources to family, <b>this</b> <b>resorts</b> <b>to</b> the animals. And, in the region, there is a line in space-time of techniques for production of ceramics which permits to consider that the area would be one of the centers of the suppliers for model or tradition of potter...|$|E
40|$|A presente pesquisa teve como objetivo analisar, à luz da psicologia histórico-cultural e da pedagogia histórico-crítica, o desenvolvimento da atenção do pré-escolar e as suas relações com a organização do ensino. Trata-se de um aprofundamento teórico-conceitual a respeito dos processos psíquicos a partir dos quais se desenvolve a atenção humana e sobre como se dá a interferência da educação escolar nesses processos. Para tanto, partimos de uma investigação empírica, de modo que a obtenção dos dados se deu por meio de observação e registro, sob a forma de filmagens e diário de campo, das atividades desenvolvidas por duas {{professor}}as que trabalharam com a mesma turma de alunos ao longo de um semestre cada uma. Para sistematizar os dados, transcrevemos o conteúdo total das filmagens e atribuímos o nome fictício de Rosa à professora cujas atividades foram observadas no segundo semestre de 2013, momento em que os alunos estavam com quatro anos de idade; e o nome fictício de Célia à professora cuja atuação foi observada no primeiro semestre de 2014, período em que os alunos tinham cinco anos completos. Para a análise, tomando como fundamento metodológico o materialismo-dialético e sua expressão na tríade conteúdo-forma-destinatário, que instrumentaliza a análise de processos pedagógicos, baseamo-nos em três categorias centrais: natureza da atividade, qualidade da mediação do professor e tempo de concentração e dispersão da turma durante a realização das atividades dirigidas pelo professor. De modo geral, a análise constata que o tempo de concentração da turma de alunos aos quatro anos de idade, durante as atividades dirigidas pela professora Rosa, foi superior ao tempo de concentração da mesma turma com cinco anos completos quando observados durante as atividades dirigidas pela professora Célia. Nessa direção, corroboramos a seguinte hipótese: a organização do ensino pelo professor – uma vez garantida a qualidade da mediação que se estabelece entre ele, conhecimento e aluno – pode promover a complexificação do processo de desenvolvimento da atenção. Tal constatação permite-nos reafirmar a necessidade de que a educação escolar se fundamente no ensino sistematizado e dirigido pelo professor, desde que ele recorra a instrumentos físicos e simbólicos de mediação que levem em consideração as características típicas da faixa etária dos alunos no desenvolvimento das bases para o domínio atencional desde a mais tenra idade. The {{present research}} had as objective to analyze, {{in light of}} historical-cultural psychology and historical-critical pedagogy, {{the development of the}} pre-scholar’s attention and its relations with teaching organization. It is a theoretical-conceptual deepening concerning psychical processes whereof the human attention proceeds and about how school education intervention happens in these processes, in view of an empirical investigation in which the data acquisition occurred through observation and record, in the form of filming and field diary of the activities that were developed by two teachers who worked with the same students class throughout a semester each one. In order to systematize the data, we transcribed the filming total content and we assigned the fictitious name of Rosa for the teacher whose activities were observed in the second semester of 2013, when the students were four years old; and the fictitious name of Célia for the teacher whose performance was observed in the first semester of 2014, the period which the students were full five years. For the analysis, taking as methodological basis the dialectical-materialism and its expression in the triad content-form-addressee which instrumentalizes the analysis of pedagogical processes, we have based in three central categories: activity nature, quality of the teacher’s mediation and time of class concentration and dispersion during the achievement of the activities directed by the teacher. Generally speaking, the analysis reveals that the time of concentration of four-year-old students’ class during the activities directed by teacher Rosa was superior to the time of concentration of the same class with full five years, when observed during the activities achievement directed by teacher Célia. In this direction, we corroborate our assumption that the teaching organization by the teacher, once assured the quality of the mediation that is established between him/her, knowledge and student, can promote the complexity of the attention development process. Such observation leads us to reaffirm the necessity that School Education is based on the teaching systematized and directed by the teacher, on the condition that <b>this</b> <b>resorts</b> <b>to</b> physical and symbolical tools of mediation that take into account the typical characteristics of students’ age group for the bases development to the attentional mastery from a very early age...|$|E
