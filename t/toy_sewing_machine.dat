The {{industrial}} <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> {{frame is}} one of the most important components of the <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> system, so studying its dynamic characteristics is particularly important. In this paper, based on the 3 D model, the theory modal analysis of the industrial <b>sewing</b> <b>machine</b> is conducted with ABAQUS software and the modal experiment analysis is carried out through LMS(Lab Impact Testing system). The experimental results are in good consistency, which shows that the finite element model built in the paper is reasonable.
