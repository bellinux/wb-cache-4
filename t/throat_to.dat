5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E
25|$|The ingenious {{fight against}} {{starvation}} is {{a recurring theme}} throughout the documentary. In one scene, near-starving chicks are shown taking sustenance out of their father's throat sacs, 11th-hour nourishment {{in the form of}} a milky, protein-rich substance secreted from a sac in the father's <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> feed their chicks in the event that circumstances require.|$|E
25|$|Many {{animals that}} live on {{or in the}} sea consume flotsam by mistake, as it often looks similar to their natural prey. Plastic debris, when bulky or tangled, is {{difficult}} to pass, and may become permanently lodged in the digestive tracts of these animals. Especially when evolutionary adaptions {{make it impossible for}} the likes of turtles to reject plastic bags, which resemble jellyfish when immersed in water, as they have a system in their <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> stop slippery foods from otherwise escaping. Thereby blocking the passage of food and causing death through starvation or infection.|$|E

25|$|The matter {{then went}} before Prime Minister Lionel Jospin; extraditions, {{after having been}} {{approved}} by courts, must be ordered by the executive. The French Green Party stated that Einhorn should not be extradited until the issues concerning his case were fully settled. Jospin rejected the claims and issued an extradition decree. Einhorn then litigated against the decree before the Conseil d'État, which ruled against him; again, the Council declined to review the constitutionality of foreign law. He then attempted to slit his <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> avoid imprisonment for the murder and eventually litigated his case before the European Court of Human Rights, which also ruled against him.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Jewish thought has {{expressed}} {{the view that}} all meat must come from animals which have been slaughtered according to Jewish law. These strict guidelines require the animal be killed by a single cut across the <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> a precise depth, severing both carotid arteries, both jugular veins, both vagus nerves, the trachea and the esophagus, no higher than the epiglottis and no lower than where cilia begin inside the trachea, causing the animal to bleed to death. Orthodox Jews argue that this ensures the animal dies instantly without unnecessary suffering, but many animal rights activists view the process as cruel, arguing that the animal may not lose consciousness immediately, and activists have called {{for it to be}} banned.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days after}} the {{disappearance}} of Beineman, her nude body was discovered face-down in a wooded gully alongside the Huron River parkway. A medical examination revealed Beineman had been extensively beaten about the face and body, with some lacerations inflicted being so severe sections of skin had been removed, exposing subcutaneous tissues. She had received extensive skull and brain injuries which had been inflicted with a blunt instrument, {{had been forced to}} ingest a caustic substance, and her neck, shoulders, nipples and breasts had been burned with the same caustic agent.

25|$|McKeag {{was found}} dead by family members at his home at Florence Court off the Crumlin Road on 24 September 2000. With his face heavily bruised and a {{crossbow}} bolt embedded into the wall nearby, it was initially assumed {{that he had been}} killed; however a post-mortem found that his death was caused by a lethal combination of painkillers and cocaine. Some of his supporters continued to blame Adair, due to the love triangle which emerged between him and McKeag when Tracey Coulter started sleeping with Adair too. It was claimed that Adair's men had entered the house, attacked McKeag, who had fired the crossbow at them, and then forced quantities of cocaine down his <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> kill him. There was no evidence to support these claims.|$|E
25|$|Hokutoumi was {{primarily}} a oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques that got his opponents {{out of the ring}} as quickly as possible. He had a powerful tachi-ai, or initial charge, and his speciality was nodowa, a single-handed push to the <b>throat.</b> <b>To</b> do this he would lock up his opponent's right arm with his left (a technique known as ottsuke) and thrust with his right. His most common winning kimarite by far were oshi-dashi and yori-kiri, which together accounted for around 60 percent of his wins at sekitori level. When fighting on the mawashi he preferred a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip. He {{said in an interview with}} Channel 4 television that the technique he most enjoyed was tsuri-dashi or lift out, although he was only credited with this kimarite once in official tournament competition (against Terao in November 1989).|$|E

500|$|Varanus salvadorii has mammal-like aerobic abilities; this is {{accomplished}} {{by means of a}} positive pressure gular pump in the animal’s <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> assist lung ventilation. [...] The majority of lizards cannot run and breathe at the same time due to Carrier's constraint, but monitor lizards are exceptions to this rule. [...] The development of this ventilatory pump is analogous to the evolution of the diaphragm in mammals, which ventilates the lung independently of locomotion; scientists place V. salvadorii as the species with the highest endurance in this regard. This would suggest the lizard is at an evolutionary midpoint, relying on both forms of breathing.|$|E
500|$|Batman finally {{reaches a}} secret room {{high in the}} towers of the asylum. Inside, he discovers Cavendish dressed in a bridal gown and {{threatening}} Adams with a razor. It is revealed that he orchestrated the riots. When questioned by Batman, Cavendish has him read a passage from the diary of the asylum's founder, Amadeus Arkham. In flashbacks, it is revealed that Arkham's mentally ill mother, Elizabeth, suffered delusions of being tormented by a supernatural entity. After believing to have seen the creature himself (a bat), Arkham cut his mother's <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> end her suffering.

[...] The actress recalled {{that she was}} [...] "in awe" [...] of Price during the production and described the filming of their final scene together as surprisingly physical: [...] "Our major confrontation where he strangles me was done in one take…He really went at me and I had the bruises on my <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> prove it. [...] Afterward, he was so concerned he had hurt me—a perfect gentleman—a truly kind figure {{in spite of his}} image." [...] While watching the daily rushes of the movie, Corman became convinced that Steele's [...] "thick working class English accent" [...] was not blending well with the other cast members, so after the filming was completed he had all of her dialogue dubbed by a different actress.|$|E

500|$|A 2016 {{study found}} that adult spinosaurs could {{displace}} their mandibular rami (halves of the lower jaw) sideways when the jaw was depressed, which allowed the pharynx (opening that leads from the <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> the stomach) to be widened. This jaw-articulation {{is similar to that}} seen in pterosaurs and living pelicans, and would likewise have allowed spinosaurids to swallow large prey such as fish and other animals. Another 2016 {{study found that}} the jaws of spinosaurids were convergent with those of pike conger eels; these fish also have sideways compressed jaws (whereas the jaws of crocodilians are compressed from top to bottom), an elongated snout with a [...] "terminal rosette" [...] that bears enlarged teeth, and a notch behind the rosette with smaller teeth. This type of jaws were likely evolved for grabbing prey in aquatic environments with low light, and may have helped in prey detection.|$|E

500|$|Cheetahs {{are active}} mainly during the day, with hunting their major activity. Adult males are sociable despite their territoriality, forming groups called [...] "coalitions". Females are not territorial; {{they may be}} solitary or live with their {{offspring}} in home ranges. Carnivores, cheetah mainly prey upon antelopes and gazelles. They will stalk their prey to within , charge towards it and kill it by tripping it during the chase and biting its <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> suffocate it to death. The cheetah's body is specialised for speed; it is the fastest land animal. The speed of a hunting cheetah averages [...] during a sprint; the chase is interspersed with a few short bursts of speed, when the animal can attain , although this is disputed by more recent measurements. Cheetahs are induced ovulators, breeding throughout the year. Gestation is nearly three months long, resulting in a litter of typically three to five cubs (the number can vary from one to eight). Weaning occurs at six months; siblings tend to stay together for some time. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other mammals, especially in the Serengeti region. Cheetahs inhabit a variety of habitatsdry forests, scrub forests and savannahs.|$|E

500|$|Cheetahs {{kill their}} prey by {{tripping}} {{it during the}} chase; the cheetah can use its strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance. To kill medium- to large-sized prey, the cheetah bites the prey's <b>throat</b> <b>to</b> suffocate it to death. A bite {{on the back of}} the neck or the snout is enough to kill smaller prey. The prey is then taken to a shaded place; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for nearly five to 55 minutes. Groups of cheetah devour the kill peacefully, though minor growling may be observed. Cheetahs not involved in hunting will immediately start eating. Cheetah can consume large quantities of food. In a study at the Etosha National Park (Namibia), the cheetah consumed as much as [...] within two hours and stayed close to the remains for 11hours. Cheetah move their head from side to side so that the sharp carnassial teeth effectively tear the flesh, which can then be swallowed without chewing. They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating.|$|E
