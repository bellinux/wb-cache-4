5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E

In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and {{he argued that the}} non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from <b>this</b> <b>phenomenon.</b>|$|E

We investigate <b>this</b> <b>phenomena</b> in the spin-bath environment, constructing an entanglement sharing inequality bounding the entanglement between a central spin and the environment in terms of the pairwise entanglement between individual bath spins. The relation of this result to decoherence will be illustrated using a simple, exactly solvable decoherence model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results of virtual analysis of the stability of mining roof supports loaded by the roof rocks. The hydraulic roof support generally accounts for over 50 % of the total value of a coal mining and excavating system. Many reports show that in some conditions roof supports behave differently than foreseen. To explain <b>this</b> <b>phenomena</b> the investigations basing on the virtual model were done [1, 2]. <b>This</b> <b>phenomena</b> is very dangerous for miners because this behaviour of a mining roof support may cause dangerous accidents in coal mines. In the investigation process some questions have been asked. Firstly what type of a mining support is more liable to this behaviour. Secondly what work conditions are the most dangerous. To analyse <b>this</b> <b>phenomena</b> it was used models of two types of a mining support. One with two props and one with four ones. Results show that that the problem of plunged of roof parts of a support in the coal bed is consider with the construction of the support. The most dangerous is the roof support with two props. The consequences of this results are the recommendations to use rather supports with four props then two...|$|R

5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
