40|$|Abstract — Selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) {{and alcohol}} non-preferring (NP) lines of rats were {{administered}} saline subcutaneously, and doses of 0. 5 and 2. 0 mg/kg of two antimuscarinic agents scopolamine (centrally acting) and methscopolamine (peripherally acting), twice daily respectively {{for a period}} of one day. Compared to saline, both doses of scopolamine and methscopolamine induced a significant reduction in ethanol consumption in the P line of rats, and both antimuscarinic agents significantly increased water intake. Thus, ethanol preference was dramatically reduced in these rats. In contrast, scopolamine had relatively little effect on either ethanol or water intake in the NP line of rats, while methscopolamine <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>suppress</b> both ethanol and water intake. These findings suggest that peripheral muscarinic mechanisms may be involved in ethanol preference in P rats...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCationization is {{essential}} to the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis of a variety of synthetic polymers. This work studied polystyrene cationization in MALDI using the salts of eight different metals. It was found that only the salts of silver, copper, and palladium produced good metal–polystyrene cation signals. More interestingly, it was observed that MALDI could also produce metal-rich cluster cations and that the presence of polystyrenes <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>suppress</b> formation of the metal-rich cluster cations. Based on these results and others, we propose that polystyrene cationization may proceed through gas-phase metal attachment reactions under the conditions used.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the interface of dialogical self-theory and institutional context {{with reference to}} the schooling of ethnic minorities. It proposes a more nuanced approach to identifying cultural resources within institutions that contribute to dialogical movements and positioning, thereby advancing the application of dialogical self-theory within institutionalized spaces. Drawing on sociocultural concepts of identity construction, the discussion outlines how I-positions are tethered to social practices, relationships, power, and relations within institutions. These cultural resources are highlighted because they foreground how dialogical tensions occur and transcend opposing voices within an institution itself. In providing a textual analysis of Edward Said’s encounter with a school rule that <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>suppress</b> his Arab identity, the integrated dialogical self-theory and sociocultural approach can highlight the contours of dialogical frictions as a result of negotiation with power across an institution to arrive at a desired I-position.

40|$|Abstract. A {{continuum}} {{model of}} electrocortical activity was applied separately at centimetric and macrocolumnar scales, permitting analysis {{of interaction between}} scales. State equations included effects of retrograde action potential propagation in dendritic trees, and kinetics of AMPA, GABA and NMDA receptors. Parameter values were provided from independent physiological and anatomical estimates. Realistic field potentials and pulse rates were obtained, including resonances in the alpha/theta and gamma ranges, 1 / background activity, and autonomous gamma activity. Zero-lag synchrony and travelling waves occurred as complementary aspects of cortical transmission, and lead/lag relations between excitatory and inhibitory cell populations varied systematically around transition to autonomous gamma oscillation. f 2 Properties of the simulations can account for generation and control of gamma activity. All factors acting on excitatory/inhibitory balance controlled the onset and offset of gamma oscillation. Autonomous gamma was initiated by focal excitation of excitatory cells, and suppressed by laterally spreading trans-cortical excitation, which acted on both excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. Consequently, although spatially extensive non-specific reticular activation <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>suppress</b> autonomous gamma, spatial variation of reticular activation could preferentially select fields of synchrony...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} tasks of the visual cortex is to integrate input {{from different parts of}} the retina, parsing an image into contours and surfaces, and then assembling these features into coherent representations of objects. To examine the role of the primary visual cortex in the integration of visual information, we measured the response properties of neurons under different stimulus conditions. Surprisingly, we found that even the most conventional measures of receptive field (RF) size were not fixed, but could vary depending on stimulus contrast and foreground–background relationships. On average, the length of the excitatory RF was 4 -fold greater for a low-contrast stimulus than for a stimulus at high contrast. Embedding a high-contrast stimulus in a textured background <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>suppress</b> neuronal responses and produced an enlargement in RF size similar to that observed by decreasing the contrast of an isolated stimulus.
