Methods: 1) Selection of the relevant domains by a rheumatologists' panel; 2) Search for published evidence in each domain; 3) Elaboration of the clinical <b>tool</b> <b>guide</b> with a 3 -level gradation of evidence (evidence-based medicine EBM, official recommendations and expert's opinion). The experts were 11 academic rheumatologists with a large experience in prescribing abatacept and in managing rheumatoid arthritis. They were all members of the CRI (Club Rhumatismes et Inflammation), a section of the French Rheumatology Society dedicated to the inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Each fact sheet was reviewed by two other experts; 4) Regular updating based on medical literature and post-marketing surveillance data. Results: Four domains were considered relevant: abatacept contraindication s, management of side effects or associated diseases appearing during abatacept treatment, management of "practical situations" such as surgery or pregnancy, physician and patient information. After the literature analysis and discussion during an experts' meeting, a consensus was reached on: - a pre-treatment checklist aimed at searching abatacept contra indications; - a what-to-do document when facing side effects or associated diseases (autoimmune pathology, bacterial or viral infections, cardiovascular diseases, intolerance to abatacept, solid or haematological malignancy) or "practical situations" (surgery, pregnancy, vaccination, travel, drug-drug interactions); - an example of standard information letter to be addressed to the attending physician (rheumatologist and general practitioner); - an example of standard information letter to be addressed to the patient. Conclusion: Based on both an EBM approach and an expert's opinion approach, this abatacept clinical <b>tool</b> <b>guide</b> should provide assistance to all physicians attending patients treated with abatacept. For a better implementation in clinical practice, this <b>tool</b> <b>guide</b> will be available online at www. cri-net. com and regularly updated...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our design <b>tool</b> <b>GUIDE,</b> {{which allows the}} user to explore a design in UML interactively by playing a game. The game {{incorporates}} both the design model and a specication {{of what it means}} for the design to be correct. The central idea of this approach is that the designer can increment the game during a play and gradually add more detail to it. Specication and design are rened by repeated plays of the game. The designer stops playing when design and specication are detailed enough for his purpose and match each other. The interactive game approach helps to cope with incompleteness and informal denition of UML models, which make strictly formal verication techniques difcult. The designer may resolve these problems when they arise during a play or let the GUIDE tool determine how the play should proceed. We discuss the potential impact of GUIDE and tools like it on software development. Key words: Interactive software design, UML, formal games...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to robot-assisted spine and trauma surgery in which a miniature robot is directly mounted on the patient’s bony structure near the surgical site. The robot is designed to operate in a semiactive mode to precisely position and orient a drill or a needle in various surgical procedures. Since the robot forms a single rigid body with the anatomy, {{there is no need for}} immobilization or motion tracking, which greatly enhances and simplifies the robot’s registration to the target anatomy. To demonstrate this concept, we developed the MiniAture Robot for Surgical procedures (MARS), a cylindrical 5 7 cmQ, 200 -g, six-degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator. We are currently developing two clinical applications to demonstrate the concept: 1) surgical tools guiding for spinal pedicle screws placement; and 2) drill guiding for distal locking screws in intramedullary nailing. In both cases, a <b>tool</b> <b>guide</b> attached to the robot is positioned at a planned location with a few intraoperative fluoroscopic X-ray images.

40|$|Brain biopsy of {{intracranial}} lesions {{is often}} {{necessary in order}} to determine specific therapy. Complexity and vulnerability of the brain, however, require high accuracy during needle placement. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the precision of the new MRI-based patient-individual stereotactic brain biopsy device in the dog. 10 canine cadavers with 20 target points were used to investigate the accuracy. First specific bone anchors and MRI-markers were fixed on dog cadaver heads. Afterwards CT and MRI examinations of the heads were performed. Based on MR-images, patient-individual frames to reach defined target points were constructed and printed with 3 D-printer. Two target points were marked in each brain MRI: left caudate nucleus and right piriform lobe. Also trajectories for biopsy needle were plotted on MR-images. The needle was to enter the brain in a gyrus and not to penetrate the ventricles. The frames were fixed on the bone anchors with specific screws. Minimal-invasive access to the brain was created with help of the <b>tool</b> <b>guide.</b> The biopsy needle was placed along pre-planned trajectories. Afterwards CT examinations of the heads with biopsy needles placed in each target point were performed. Needle placement error was determined after fusion of MRI and CT examinations. Error was defined in mm as deviation between achieved and anticipated target points. The deviation of 20 target points revealed mean needle placement error of 0. 58 mm (SD 0. 34). Therefore, MRI-based patient-individual stereotactic brain biopsy device reaches higher accuracy than most other described brain biopsy systems...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} <b>tool</b> (<b>guide</b> wire and catheter) {{guidance}} in interventional radiology, {{a new approach}} is to project 3 D X-ray Angiography (3 DXA) information in real time onto a fluoroscopy image (" 3 D Augmented Fluoroscopy "- 3 D AF). Recovering the acquisition geometry is a crucial step for such augmented reality application. As 3 DXA and fluoroscopy images are acquired on the same vascular C-arm, a machine-based 3 D- 2 D registration is possible. The feasibility of such an approach was proved and demonstrated in [1]. As a result, a complete Augmented Reality (AR) system, which enables to superimpose the 3 DXA onto real time fluoroscopy images {{is going to be}} developed and installed in one of the vascular room of our institution. The system promises to help the radiologist to guide the tool to the pathology to be treated without the need to inject contrast medium. The X-ray dose, injected volume of contrast agent, procedure time and patient discomfort are expected to be reduced. This paper extends our previous work [1] in two ways. First, the study to assess the precision of the machine-based registration is completed, including various C-arm orientations and different focal lengths. A mean 2 D error of 1 mm was observed. Secondly, a preliminary clinical evaluation of the AR system is reported and clinical evaluation grid is proposed as a ground to an objective and perceptual evaluation of such an AR application implying many observers and patient cases.

40|$|Due to {{increase}} in the number of electric and electronic equipment along with the fast controlling power electronic devices, which has affected the main power quality events(PQ). These are namely short-circuits, notching, voltage sag and swell, harmonics and transient due to load switching. Whenever these disturbances occur, these last for few cycles and simple observation of waveforms in the bus-bar will not help to recognise the problem in there and henceforth will not be able to identify and sort out the problem. If such events occur for few more cycles/minute it may result to overvoltage and under-voltage, or long time power interruption or any other problem. Hence, an approach is developed for the detection and location of time and finally classifies the different power quality events including both the transients and steady state signals. By using one of the signal processing we can decompose namely wavelet decomposition by using “DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM (DWT) ”. In a sampling frequency, we can samples those signals and any change on the smoothness is detected at finer resolution levels of decomposition. By the decomposition process we get the power coefficients or wavelet packets which are necessary performance indices of the signal. We are in generally using the a) THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and b) Energy of the signal to classify them in the PQ event analysis. The main purpose of the paper also focuses on using the MATLAB WAVELET <b>TOOL</b> <b>GUIDE,</b> for the study of De-noising and other purpose.

40|$|Realizar avaliação formativa e escolher um instrumento que permita praticá-la são atos desafiadores, uma vez que, esse modo avaliativo tem como foco o processo de ensino-aprendizagem, deve ser realizado durante um período letivo e não pode ser dissociado da prática pedagógica e dos objetivos previamente traçados. Assim, esta pesquisa tem como objetivo geral propor o portfólio como um possível instrumento de avaliação formativa na aprendizagem de língua inglesa para crianças (LIC). Dois questionamentos conduziram esta pesquisa: 1) ?Em que medida o portfólio pode contribuir para a avaliação formativa da aprendizagem de língua inglesa para crianças, considerando-se as características desse instrumento??; e 2) ?De que modo o portfólio, como instrumento de avaliação, pode nortear o trabalho com crianças aprendizes de inglês como língua estrangeira??. O estudo foi fundamentado em Hernández (1998), Villas Boas (2006), Birgin e Baki (2007) e Oliveira e Elliot (2012), no que diz respeito ao portfólio, e em Hoffmann (2000), Luckesi (2002), McKay (2006), Haydt (2008), Corrêa (2009), Scaramucci (2009), Furtoso (2011) e Sardo e Bernardon (2015) sobre avaliação. A partir dos conceitos centrais sobre avaliação e portfólio, duas fichas de critérios foram elaboradas: a primeira com o propósito de auxiliar o docente na escolha das atividades que comporão o portfólio e a segunda para avaliar a aprendizagem de crianças por meio das atividades escolhidas. A primeira ficha foi pilotada em uma aula da disciplina de estágio supervisionado com alunos-professores do terceiro e quarto anos de Letras ? Inglês na Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL) em virtude de os integrantes do grupo terem escolhido estagiar no contexto de LIC. As análises revelaram que o portfólio pode contribuir com a avaliação, do tipo formativa, de LIC, por evidenciar o desempenho e o progresso, as facilidades e dificuldades das crianças, por permitir ao(à) professor(a) (re) pensar sua prática de ensino, retomar conteúdos, quando necessário, e relembrar os objetivos de ensino-aprendizagem-avaliação. Conducting a {{formative}} assessment and choosing {{a tool to}} practice it could be challenging once this type of evaluation focuses on the teaching-learning process, should be performed during a school period and cannot be dissociated from the teaching practice and objectives previously outlined. Thus, {{the objective of this}} research is to propose the portfolio as a possible {{formative assessment}} instrument in English language learning for children (ELLC). This research was based on two questions: 1) ?To what extent can the portfolio contribute to the formative assessment of English language learning for children considering the characteristics of the instrument? and 2) "How can the portfolio, as an assessment <b>tool,</b> <b>guide</b> the work with children who are leaning English as a foreign language?".
