[...] Hoeppel offered to enter the Democratic primary {{in exchange for a}} payment of several hundred dollars plus the promise of a civil service job once the Republican was elected. After consulting with his aides, Nixon turned him down. Subsequently, Hoeppel filed as a Prohibition Party candidate. Voorhis was privy to these events through an informant close to the former representative, and was convinced that Roy Day had arranged to pay Hoeppel's filing fee. [...] The congressman feared that Hoeppel would serve as a stalking horse for Nixon, sparing the Republican from any [...] "mudslinging".

Reuters Nick Vinocur noted a series of comic gore, resulting in [...] "a bizarre concoction...reminiscent of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive...Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, and [...] angst-laden love scenes {{that would not be}} out of place in a Scandinavian drama". Christopher Hawthorne, also from the Los Angeles Times, has compared it to the works of Walter Hill, John Carpenter, Nathanael West, J. G. Ballard, and Mike Davis. According to Refn, Drive is dedicated to filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky and includes shades of Jodorowsky's existentialism.|$|E

In an interview, a production assistant stated that [...] "we <b>try</b> <b>our</b> hardest to screen people," [...] and inauthentic-seeming guests have been kicked off stage. Marvin Kitman, television critic for the Newsday newspaper, felt that the fighting had been choreographed beforehand. Christopher Sterling of the George Washington University media department compared the program to professional wrestling; some producers later claimed the fights in the show were inspired by the fights and angles in the WWE. [...] Sixteen former guests of Jerry Springer, who were interviewed on various U.S. media outlets such as the entertainment news program Extra, Rolling Stone magazine, and The New York Post newspaper, claimed there was a [...] "fight quota" [...] for each episode and that they and other guests were encouraged to fight one another.

Rubby De La Rosa pitched a career-high seven innings, allowing just the one run on six hits, but it was not enough as the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation. The team finished the month ten games under [...]500 and fell into last place in the National League Western division.
