5|$|Khai's {{appeal was}} rebutted with {{an appeal to}} history, {{nationalist}} sentiment and a demand that <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> death and destruction lay with the colonial forces and their Vietnamese assistants.

5|$|The United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War later exonerated Burnside, {{and placed}} <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the Union defeat at the Crater on General Meade for {{requiring}} the specially trained USCT (United States Colored Troops) {{men to be}} withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the conflict on Hitler.|$|E

Myrtle, who {{possesses}} a fierce vitality, is desperate to find refuge from her complacent marriage, but unfortunately {{this leads to}} her tragic ending.

50|$|Much blame flew {{around about}} {{the reasons for the}} failure. <b>The</b> Government was <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> {{restrictive}} conditions of the licence; <b>the</b> management was <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> bad programme scheduling and failing to control escalating costs; shareholders were <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> having <b>the</b> short-term mentality of property developers. However, <b>the</b> Government <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> collapse on the unwillingness of the shareholders to inject more capital, after it had spent its entire HK$20 million within one year. Many TV series were brought by TVB and ATV and TVB seldom rebroadcast them.|$|R

5|$|The Battle of Albuera {{had little}} effect on the overall course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most of <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E
5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to attend the game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the riot on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have felt {{that if he did}} not attend he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E
5|$|However, much of <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> {{the decay}} and ruinous state of {{preservation}} of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but the political agendas of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt {{has been made to}} restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have been prevented. According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher, {{driving for}} Ferrari, {{had led the}} {{championship}} by a single point ahead of Villeneuve going into the race. During the race Villeneuve and Schumacher collided while battling for the lead and the resulting damage to Schumacher's car forced him to retire. <b>The</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the incident was later attributed to Schumacher by the sport's governing body, the FIA, and he was stripped of his second-place finish in the championship. Schumacher's tactics were widely criticised by the media, including publications based in his home country of Germany, and in Ferrari's home country of Italy.|$|E
5|$|National Airlines Flight 2511 was a {{domestic}} passenger flight from New York City, New York to Miami, Florida that exploded in midair on January 6, 1960. The National Airlines Douglas DC-6 was carrying five crew members and 29 passengers, {{all of whom}} perished. The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation concluded that the plane was brought down by a dynamite bomb. No criminal charges were ever filed, nor was <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the bombing ever determined, though a suicide bombing is suspected. The investigation remains open today.|$|E
50|$|The Mount Everest Committee {{was unable}} to {{distance}} itself from the film - it had supported its production and benefited financially. It therefore laid <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> elsewhere <b>for</b> <b>the</b> diplomatic catastrophe and for over fifty years the cover-up succeeded in public, the impression being given that Hazard's unauthorised detour was to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ban on expeditions.|$|R

5|$|On 18 March the PAVN {{had taken}} Phuoc An, {{eliminating}} {{any hope of}} reaching Buôn Ma Thuột. Darlac Province in its entirety then fell under North Vietnamese control. ARVN forces began to rapidly shift positions {{in an attempt to}} keep the North Vietnamese from quickly pushing eastward to the coastal lowlands. In the final analysis, <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the fall of the highlands lies with General Phú, who refused to act on sound intelligence and when he realized his error, {{it was too late to}} get reinforcements to the scene.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to a 5–11 {{record in}} 1995. Much of <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the Giants' poor {{performance}} {{was placed on}} Brown. He put up lackluster numbers {{for the second straight}} year. Though the Giants defense still played well, and young players like Michael Strahan and Jessie Armstead began to emerge,* Freeman, Mike. , The New York Times, October 30, 1995, accessed December 6, 2010. the Giants inspired tepid interest league-wide and sent no players to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year.|$|E
5|$|The police, who suspect {{an illegal}} abortion, find {{the remains of}} the baby in the garden furnace. Wayne quickly confesses to {{destroying}} the evidence. He asserts that his wife had aborted the child while in a trance-like state and attempts to convince her of this. Laura takes <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the abortion and goes to jail. While visiting Laura in her cell, Wayne attempts to steal her soul, but the EMT is able to save her life, much to Wayne's surprise. Meanwhile, Wayne has another wife, Betsy Monroe, who is also pregnant.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} Close was called {{up for his}} seventh Test in 1961, against Australia. This match, which at one point England {{appeared}} certain to win, turned to disaster, with Close bearing <b>the</b> main <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> England's defeat.|$|R

5|$|With the win, Schilling became {{only the}} fifth pitcher to ever win a World Series {{game with a}} team from both leagues, having {{previously}} done it with National League teams, the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993, and the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001. He later donated the bloody sock he wore during the game to the Baseball Hall of Fame museum. Much of <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the Cardinals' losses {{in the first two}} games was directed at the fact that Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals' best batters, had combined for one hit in 22at-bats.|$|E
5|$|Wright told Lee {{that it was}} {{relatively}} easy {{to get to the}} crest, but it was difficult to stay there. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.|$|E
5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E
