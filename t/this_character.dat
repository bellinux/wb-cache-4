5|$|I had to {{therefore}} {{come up with}} my {{own decisions}} about what this meant and what <b>this</b> <b>character</b> was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience. But I did have to reconcile all of that, and people seem to think it works.|$|E

5|$|Molecular phylogenetics {{have shown}} that C.cirrhata forms a {{monophyletic}} clade with the remaining two species of Collybia.

5|$|Rotheram {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a difficult officer to serve with, and he rapidly alienated his fellow officers and the sailors who served under him. Ultimately <b>this</b> <b>character</b> trait resulted in his removal from service and overlooking for promotion in 1808 after being court martialled for inappropriate behaviour towards junior officers. The rest of his life was spent requesting the Admiralty, often in an aggressive manner, for both further service and the rewards he felt were his due.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis can be {{distinguished}} from S.convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration pattern of the gastral tergites. Formerly, the two species were distinguished {{on the basis of}} the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in S.grandis and three in S.convallis), but a more recent study showed that <b>this</b> <b>character</b> was insufficient to distinguish the two species. However, they can {{be distinguished}} by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.|$|E

50|$|This {{complicated}} origin is {{the reason}} that some sources list Young Men #24 as <b>this</b> <b>character's</b> first appearance, when in fact this, and subsequent 1950s-published Captain America stories, was clearly created with the intention of depicting the original Captain America.|$|R

5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} was {{supposed}} to revolve around the duo {{trying to get the}} plant back, lest Princess Bubblegum turn into a man. In addition, the episode originally {{was supposed to}} feature a mysterious rabbit that guided Finn and Jake through the Underworld; <b>this</b> <b>character</b> was later cut. The episode was watched by 1.981 million people and received largely positive critical attention. Many critics applauded Ferrer's voice acting work, and Matt Fowler of IGN singled the episode out {{as an example of the}} comedic darkening of Adventure Time.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} developed in 1990. After creating films {{which focused on}} the lives of gangsters, director John Woo wanted to make a film that glorified the police instead. Woo admired Clint Eastwood's and Steve McQueen's characters from their films Dirty Harry and Bullitt respectively, and wanted to make his own Hong Kong-style Dirty Harry police detective film. While creating <b>this</b> <b>character,</b> Woo was inspired by a police officer who was a strong-willed and tough member of the police force, as well as being an avid drummer. This led to Woo having Tequila's character be a musician as well as a cop.|$|E
5|$|The {{surfaces}} {{should be}} broad and simple, {{defined by a}} bold and clear design, accentuated in the important places. The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared. By exaggerating the forms, in order to render them more clearly visible, or by enriching them with details, we would destroy {{the proportion of the}} work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such as one would give to a rapid sketch. Only it is necessary that <b>this</b> <b>character</b> should be the product of volition and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.|$|E
5000|$|Digimon, {{known as}} Lucemon {{and one of}} the franchise's Seven Great Demon Lords, is based upon Lucifer; <b>this</b> <b>character's</b> backstory is similar to Lucifer's fall from grace.

50|$|Homer becomes {{obsessed with}} a 1980s family sitcom called Thicker Than Waters and starts acting like the show's father.
