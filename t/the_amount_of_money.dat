5|$|Since {{the program}} started in 1982, only three formal studies over the {{nutritional}} {{impact of the}} benefits provided to each family have been publicly released, in 1985, 1993, and 1996, respectively. All studies were designed to analyze {{the impact of the}} program with respect to the previous food stamps program, focusing on changes in household nutrient availability, while the 1985 and 1993 studies also focused on changes in household food expenditures (<b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> households spent on acquiring food).|$|E
5|$|Despite the expedition's failure, Carrouges had {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} the campaign.

Despite being in poor health on his return from Scotland, Carrouges had business in Paris and in January 1386 he traveled there to collect his wages for the previous year's campaign, leaving his wife with her mother-in-law at the village of Capomesnil.|$|E
50|$|But {{the problem}} {{can also be}} {{resolved}} mathematically without assuming a maximum amount. Nalebuff (1989), Christensen and Utts (1992), Falk and Konold (1992), Blachman, Christensen and Utts (1996), Nickerson and Falk (2006), pointed out that if <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in <b>the</b> two envelopes have any proper probability distribution representing the player's prior beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in <b>the</b> two envelopes, then it is impossible that whatever <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> A=a in <b>the</b> first envelope might be, it would be equally likely, according to these prior beliefs, that the second contains a/2 or 2a. Thus step 6 of the argument, which leads to always switching, is a non-sequitur, also {{when there is no}} maximum to <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> in <b>the</b> envelopes.|$|R

5|$|During his studies, Wheeler had {{developed}} {{his love of}} archaeology, having joined an excavation of Viroconium Cornoviorum, a Romano-British settlement in Wroxeter, in 1913. Considering a profession in the discipline, he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the University of London and the Society of Antiquaries in memory of Augustus Wollaston Franks. The prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans doubled <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> that went with the studentship. Wheeler's proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded {{a trip to the}} Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into this subject was never published.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> Cox fraudulently {{obtained}} rangefrom $5 million, to {{more than}} $15 million, {{to more than}} $25 million. He {{is believed to have}} fraudulently mortgaged more than 100 properties. Cox is serving a 26-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), a low-security facility in Coleman, Florida. He was ordered to pay $5.97 million in restitution, and testify against his co-conspirators. As of 2010, the United States Attorney's office has not brought charges against any of his 13 Tampa-area cohorts, even though Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert A. Mosakowski informed a judge in 2005 that he planned to bring charges against up to 13 accomplices.|$|E
5|$|Lack {{of money}} has precluded major improvements, however, and timber {{companies}} have replanted {{much of the}} logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, {{partly due to the}} suppression of forest fires until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old-growth forest sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|The Phase 2 {{budget was}} {{originally}} $1.5 billion, {{which would be}} used to start construction of the tunnels; the MTA reduced <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> allocated in the budget, projecting that the agency {{would not be able to}} start construction by the end of the 5-year cycle in 2019. Although the MTA previously expressed concerns about funding the Capital Program, a spokesman stated that the reduction in funding was a result of uncertain timing and not money problems. The delay had upset politicians and residents of East Harlem, who objected to the 3-to-4-year delay.|$|E
5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E
5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it {{is considered to be}} something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E
5|$|In late April, Brown {{still held}} a 20 {{percentage}} point lead {{in public opinion}} polling. However, as Beshear began to slip in the polls, Wilkinson moved up. By Memorial Day weekend, he was polling second among the candidates. Brown largely ignored Wilkinson until {{a week before the}} election, when he began running ads questioning <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> Wilkinson claimed would be generated by a state lottery. Wilkinson won the primary, garnering 36 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Brown, 18 percent for Beshear, 12 percent for Stumbo, and 6 percent for Carroll. In total, Wilkinson spent a record $4 million during the primary campaign. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark opined that Wilkinson's lavish spending during the campaign prompted the legislature to adopt campaign finance reform measures.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 11 October 1943, during World War II, Japanese forces bomb the Indian city of Madras (now Chennai). The next morning, Rajan, a radio {{engineer}} and communications researcher, is found shot dead by his own hand gun in his house in Madras after his neighbour, Chinnaiah, having heard the gunshot, complains to the police. Purushothaman Naidu, a local police inspector, arrives at Rajan's house and starts investigating the death. Crime Investigation Department (C.I.D.) Officer Sivanandam joins Naidu {{to help with the}} investigation. Naidu suggests that the killer could be a thief who killed Rajan for the money found at the crime scene. However, Sivanandam is unconvinced by Naidu's theory because <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> at the scene matches the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room.

5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. <b>The</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E

The NFL and NFLPA proceeded to negotiate terms for a new collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement became effective after ratification by the players August 4, 2011. Under the agreement, which runs through 2021, revenue sharing, the most contentious issue during the lockout, was re-designed so that the players must receive at least 47% of all revenue in salary for the term of the agreement. Additionally, a limit was placed on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> given to rookies.
