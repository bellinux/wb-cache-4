5|$|The Pasha'a daughter, Murana, {{finds him}} hiding and orders her servant {{to assist in}} Jack's escape. Guards appear and {{announce}} that {{they are looking for}} the escaped prisoner, but they are turned away. Dressed up as a woman, Jack tries to have Murana flee with him. She says that one day she cannot marry him now, but she may come to his country one day. Jack trades a flower for his business card and departs. A year later, Jack and his mother have a visitor ushered and <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> confusion at the beautiful young woman. Jack does not recognize her until she covers her face with her veil and she announces her intention to be his bride.|$|E
5|$|On 9th Dhu al-Hijjah before noon, pilgrims {{arrive at}} Arafat, a barren and plain land some 20 {{kilometers}} east of Mecca, where <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> contemplative vigil: they offer supplications, repent on and atone for their past sins, and seek mercy of God, {{and listen to}} sermon from the Islamic scholars who deliver it from near Jabal al-Rahmah (The Mount of Mercy) from where Muhammad {{is said to have}} delivered his last sermon. Lasting from noon through sunset, this is known as 'standing before God' (wuquf), {{one of the most significant}} rites of Hajj. At Masjid al-Namirah, pilgrims offer noon and afternoon prayers together at noon time. A pilgrim's Hajj is considered invalid if they do not spend the afternoon on Arafat.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson, and consists of shots of the duo around London. At {{the beginning of the}} video, noises from the city can be heard, a camera passes Lowe on the street, and focuses on two vintage dolls in a shop window. Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city's different sub-cultures; the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe, who walk through an empty Wentworth Street in Petticoat Lane Market. <b>They</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> front of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind.|$|E

500|$|Middle Sister {{also known}} as [...] "Hope," [...] is a {{stratovolcano}} consisting primarily of basalt, {{but it also has}} erupted andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite. The smallest and least studied of the trio, it is the youngest of the three, having been primarily built by eruptions between 25,000 and 18,000 years ago, though its most recent lava flows date to 14,000years ago, making them slightly older than South Sister's. Thick and rich in dacite, the flows extended from the northern and southern sides. <b>They</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> contrast to older, andesitic lava remains that reach as far as [...] from the volcano's base.|$|E

They knock again, and this time assure the porter they are not Sophists, but only want to visit Protagoras. The porter lets them in, and it is at this point that Socrates recites the list of guests.|$|E

2500|$|The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are {{referred}} to as the Synoptic Gospels because they include many of the same stories, often in a similar sequence and in similar wording. <b>They</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> contrast to John, whose content is comparatively distinct. The term synoptic ( [...] ; [...] ) comes via Latin from the Greek , synopsis, i.e. [...] "(a) seeing all together, synopsis"; the sense of the word in English, the one specifically applied to these three gospels, of [...] "giving an account of the events from the same point of view or under the same general aspect" [...] is a modern one.|$|E
2500|$|However, before White {{arrived at}} Cape Town Penn Symons (who {{was known as}} a [...] "fire eater"), had on his own {{authority}} deployed one of his brigades seventy miles north of Ladysmith at a town called Dundee. The position of both Ladysmith and Dundee was precarious as <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> a triangle of Natal north of the Tugela River with the Orange Free State to the west and the Transvaal to the east. White wanted to recall the Dundee garrison to Ladysmith but because of political pressures from Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, the Governor of Natal, he agreed to leave them there. The Boers declared war on 11 October and began crossing the Natal borders the following day.|$|E
2500|$|Offa’s coinage {{represents}} one of the high-points of Anglo-Saxon art, and indeed they were probably the most artistically accomplished coins produced anywhere in Europe at that time: <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> sharp contrast with the aniconic coins of contemporary Frankia. Portraits were introduced at an early stage, and were executed {{in a number of different}} styles betraying a range of artistic influences drawing on contemporary and Roman sources. Reverse designs included intricate crosses of various types, but the range of Offa's die-cutters encompassed other reverse designs including intertwining serpents, eels and the wolf and twins. Uniquely in Anglo-Saxon England, coins were also struck at Canterbury in the name of the queen, Cynethryth, from dies produced by the same talented individual responsible for the best of Offa’s portrait dies. This practice could have been inspired by encounters with Roman coins in the names of empresses. It is also possible, though less likely, that the appearance of Irene on Byzantine coinage led Offa’s queen to place her image on coins as well. Certainly Cynethryth emerges from surviving evidence as a formidable individual, who regularly witnessed contemporary charters immediately after her husband, was responsible for the running of his household and survived him to become a powerful abbess.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{tactical}} considerations for {{political parties in}} the number of candidates <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> an election where full ballots are not required. Standing too few candidates may result in all of them being elected in the early stages, and votes being transferred to candidates of other parties. Standing too many candidates might result in first-preference votes being spread too thinly amongst them, and consequently several potential winners with broad second-preference appeal may be eliminated before others are elected and their second-preference votes distributed. This effect is amplified when voters do not stick tightly to their preferred party's candidates; however, if voters vote for all candidates from a particular party before any other candidates and before stopping expressing preferences, then too many candidates is not an issue. In Malta, where voters tend to stick tightly to party preferences, parties frequently stand more candidates than there are seats to be elected. Similarly, in Australian Senate elections, voters also tend to vote along party lines due to the relative ease of endorsing a party's declared preference order, even though the parties do not encourage voters to peruse that order, but urge them to take it on trust, as evidenced by their [...] distributed outside polling booths, rather than individually casting their own complete preference order. In the Republic of Ireland, the main political parties usually give careful consideration as to how many candidates to put forward in various Dáil (parliamentary) constituencies. Transfers are often not along party lines, but rather go towards more prominent local personalities. Election posters for the most prominent candidate of a political party usually list preferred 2nd (and possibly 3rd) preferences for that party.|$|E
