40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of free receptor (antigen/cytokine) levels rebounding to higher than the baseline level after one or more applications of an antibody drug using a target-mediated drug disposition model. Using geometry and dynamical systems analysis, we show that rebound will occur {{if and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug-receptor product is slower than <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug and of the receptor. We also analyse the magnitude of rebound through approximations and simulations and demonstrate that it increases if the drug dose increases or if the difference between <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug-receptor product and <b>the</b> minimum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug and of the receptor increases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

5|$|In 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{proposed}} <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> the Netcong Traffic Circle, {{located at}} the intersections of U.S. Route 46 and Route 183 {{just north of the}} interchange with Interstate 80. The project was to produce two outcomes: replacement of the New Jersey Transit bridge that Route 183 crosses, and <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> the Netcong Circle with a signalized intersection. The project had issues dealing with the vertical clearance of the overpass for U.S. Route 46 westbound. The removal of the circle would eliminate this bridge, and the land would go to use as the new signalized intersection, with pedestrian and bicycle fittings. The entire project cost about $13.3 million (2009 USD) of state and local funds to construct. The Netcong Circle was replaced with a temporary junction in January 2013; the permanent intersection configuration opened in August of that year. The new bridge over the New Jersey Transit line opened in March 2013.|$|E

40|$|Successive <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> {{candidates}} {{is often}} a route to making manipulation intractable to compute. We prove that eliminating candidates does not necessarily increase the computational complexity of manipulation. However, for many voting rules used in practice, the computational complexity increases. For example, it is already known that it is NP-hard to compute how a single voter can manipulate the result of single transferable voting (<b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> version <b>of</b> plurality voting). We show here that it is NP-hard to compute how a single voter can manipulate <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> version <b>of</b> veto voting, of the closely related Coombs' rule, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> versions <b>of</b> a general class of scoring rules.
