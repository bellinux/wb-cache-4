5000|$|The G-27's twin [...] Shvetsov M-11 five {{cylinder}} radial engines were {{mounted at}} the outer {{ends of the}} centre section, with their cylinders projecting for cooling and driving <b>twin</b> <b>blade</b> propellers. The main legs of the tailwheel undercarriage were under the engines. On the first flight the legs were fixed and enclosed with trouser fairings but during development the fairings were removed and later retractable legs were introduced. Skis could be substituted for the wheels for winter use. The G-27 had a fixed tailwheel positioned ahead of the empennage.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 Wilkinson Sword {{introduced}} the 'bonded blade' razor, {{which consisted of}} a single blade housed in a plastic cartridge. Gillette followed in 1971 with its Trac II cartridge razor that utilised two blades. Gillette built on this <b>twin</b> <b>blade</b> design for a time, introducing new razors with added features such as a pivoting head, lubricating strip, and spring-mounted blades until their 1998 launch of the triple-bladed Mach3 razor. Schick launched a four-blade Quattro razor later the same year, and in 2006 Gillette launched the five-blade Fusion. Since then, razors with six and seven blades have been introduced.|$|E

5000|$|A {{grapefruit}} knife is {{a special}} type of knife designed specifically for cutting grapefruit. Grapefruit knives are small with a curved serrated blade, designed to hug the curves of the grapefruit. This is used to separate {{the outer edge of}} the segments from the rim of the fruit. The term [...] "grapefruit knife" [...] can refer to a type of knife with short, serrated <b>twin</b> <b>blades</b> about 2mm apart, used to separate the sides of each section from the dividing membrane. Some grapefruit knives incorporate both types, a double-sided curved blade on one side and the parallel <b>twin</b> <b>blades</b> on the other. Another type includes an angled tip and double sided serrated blade. When both types are used, the result is an intact-looking fruit with sections which lift out easily - especially if a [...] "grapefruit spoon" [...] is used.|$|R

He sees Tsukasa as the strongest link to the Key of the Twilight, and starts working with BT in the quest for it.|$|E
50|$|The Kiss 209M is {{a single}} rotor, {{conventionally}} laid out helicopter seating two side by side. The design targets were low cost and easy maintenance combined with a comfortable cabin and good performance. The centre section and the high set tail boom are tube steel structures, clad in carbon fibre. The cabin shell is also carbon fibre and bolts to the central frame. The 120 kW (160 hp) Solar T62 turboshaft engine is supported above the cabin roof and tail line, partly exposed, driving <b>twin</b> <b>blade</b> main and tail rotors. The latter is accompanied at the extreme tail by a fin/underfin pair, both swept and slender. A narrow pair of tailplanes is located forward of the tail rotor on the boom, though the prototype initially flew with a T-tail. The Kiss can have either a skid or retractable wheel undercarriage.|$|E

50|$|Krotov culture, {{along with}} Elunin, Loginov and similar {{cultures}} constituted {{one component of}} the Seima-Turbino Phenomenon. The tribes of the Krotov circle cultures were located in the Altai area steppes, forest-steppes and foothills; they were metallurgists and pastoral animal breeders. They developed entirely new designs of socketed weapons, and art images that included horses, oxen, sheep, camels, and more. The other component was located {{in the area of}} the Sayan highlands, where lived populations of the southern zone of East Siberian taiga hunters and fishermen. They belonged to the Glazkov, Shiver, and other cultures around the Baikal and Angara River basin, who mastered bronze casting and the manufacture of flint, jade and bone implements, and produced <b>twin</b> <b>blade</b> knives, scraper knives, and saws; their imagery had snakes, elk, bear, and more. The organic fusion of the Altai and Sayan components into a single culture is thought to have occurred in the steppe foothills between the Ob and Irtysh rivers.|$|E

50|$|Sophie and Josh Newman - 15-year-old twins - are in Paris {{with the}} alchemyst, Nicholas Flamel, and his friend, Scathach. They now face Niccolò Machiavelli and his colleague, but also rival, John Dee, who both {{work for the}} Dark Elders. Machiavelli is {{plotting}} to capture the twins and Flamel with the missing pages of the Codex - or Book of Abraham the Mage - before Dee can arrive in France from San Francisco. The twins seek out a friend and student to Nicholas, Comte de Saint-Germain, who teaches Sophie to use the elemental magic of Fire. Saint-Germain's wife, Joan of Arc, helps Sophie to learn to control her aura and {{to sort out the}} Witch of Endor's memories from her own. Josh is given the legendary stone sword Clarent, <b>twin</b> <b>blade</b> of Excalibur, by Nicholas. Clarent is an ancient Fire Elemental sword. Josh, Joan, and Scathach encounter three Disir, more commonly referred to as Valkyries. The Disir are ancient enemies of Scathach and bring along the soul-devouring Nidhogg, a ferocious monster once trapped in the roots of Yggdrasil - the world tree. The monster was freed after Dee destroyed Yggdrasil and attacks Scathach but fails to slay her. Instead, it captures Scathach in its claws, but flees with Scathach when the ancient sword Clarent, wielded by Josh, wounds it. Meanwhile, Nicholas' wife, Perenelle Flamel, who had been captured, is taken to Alcatraz as a prisoner.|$|E

40|$|A HPT- 32 {{aircraft}} {{was involved in}} an accident during an engine idling exercise. The {{aircraft was}} powered by a <b>twin</b> <b>blade</b> propeller engine. The blades had bent backwards. One of the blades had fractured at a location one third from the tip. The blade pitch angle was at the fine pitch stop. The rearward bending of the blades and the fine pitch of the blade angle indicate propeller rotation {{at the time of}} impact, with low or no power. It was learnt that the engine had problems of cutting off at idling speed on several occasions in the past. As the sortie involved an engine idling exercise, it could well be possible that it had cut off...|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} composites is {{used for}} <b>twin</b> <b>blade</b> propeller because of its high strength, low temperature applications. Fiber has to be oriented in the loading direction while designing the composite propeller blade. The blade geometry and design are more complex involving many controlling parameters. In the present work a methodology to design a composite propeller to analyze its strength and deformation using ANSYS software. The weight of the composite blade is reduced compared to wooden blade by adopting the shell model. The present work is to carryout the static analysis of composite propeller which is a combination CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics) and epoxy resin materials. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the composite blade over wooden stress analysis is performed on both the blades. To define the orientation and number of layers in the composite blade ANSYS classic software is used. From the results, the stresses of composite propeller obtained in static analysis are within the allowable stress limit. The deflection of the composite blade is less compared to the wooden blade...|$|E
5000|$|There was {{a choice}} of 30" [...] or 36" [...] cutting widths, both having <b>twin</b> <b>blades.</b> 'V' {{channelling}} in the deck ensured that grass cut by one blade was not thrown {{in the path of}} the other blade. Grass was ejected not from the side, as was common with other tractors, but from the rear. This meant that the non-collecting models could be hitched to a towed sweeper to collect grass cuttings, leaves and other debris.|$|R

50|$|Mulching mowersSpecial {{mulching}} blades {{are available}} for rotary mowers. The blade is designed to keep the clippings circulating underneath the mower until the clippings are chopped quite small. Other designs have <b>twin</b> <b>blades</b> to mulch the clippings to small pieces. This function has the advantages of forgoing the additional work collecting and disposing grass clippings while reducing lawn waste {{in such a way}} that also creates convenient compost for the lawn, forgoing the expense and adverse environmental effect of fertilizer.|$|R

When Koinzell reveals who he really is, he tries to save himself by offering the Black Wing Army to use in his revenge, only for Koinzell to kill him for using and further staining his fallen comrades names. His last words were a sad questioning of why it took Koinzell so long to return, as they wouldn't {{have had to do}} what they did if he had been there.|$|R
50|$|Ziba's {{designers}} {{determined that}} the traditional T-shape of a squeegee was not the most efficient for a wiping motion in a confined area such as a shower stall. After researching the way window washers and filling-station attendants would put their hands close to the blade and rarely use the handle, Ziba designed a plastic squeegee without a traditional handle; instead, it had a tubular rubber grip running parallel to curved <b>twin</b> <b>blades,</b> which moves across glass or mirrors with a wiping motion to reduce strain to the hand and wrist. The dual blades leave a surface cleaner than a single blade squeegee.|$|R
5000|$|The {{seemingly}} most-skilled of {{the clan}} warriors are the four Elite Foot Ninja. These Foot Clan members serve as the Shredder's elite guard, as well as field commanders on highly important missions. Each carries a different weapon: a trident, a spear, an axe, and a <b>twin</b> <b>bladed</b> sword (aside from their different weapons there's {{no way to tell}} them apart). They've all proven extremely deadly fighters, having easily defeated and nearly killed Leonardo when they first appeared. When the other Turtles met them, they complimented the Elites on their very round head attire (similar to a coolie hat), with Raphael going so far as saying [...] "Nice hats!" ...|$|R

50|$|Long swords {{during the}} Korean Three Kingdoms period were used {{primarily}} by cavalry and commanders (who were also usually mounted), not infantry. At this time land warfare consisted mostly of spearmen and bowmen on foot, mounted archers on horseback using two-handed bows, and mounted swordsmen with <b>twin</b> <b>blades.</b> Swords {{were not a}} primary weapon for all combat but were instead used mostly for shock attacks, defensive strokes, and for close-in fighting. Blades were heavy as they were made mostly of bronze and later iron, and pommels were often knobbed and used as balances or for very close-in work. Short swords {{may have been used}} in follow-up attacks, as short sword carriers were armoured completely.|$|R
50|$|Motonari is the daimyo of Chūgoku. He {{is known}} for {{possessing}} a great tactical mind, but thinks very little of his subordinates and sees them as disposable pawns. He, like Mitsuhide, can hit his allies with his weapon. He wields a ringblade, which he can separate to become <b>twin</b> <b>blades.</b> He has a habit of watching the sunset. He is depicted as the rival of Motochika. In the second season, he forms an alliance with Hideyoshi. He destroys the Fugaku, Motochika's fortress, and rebuilds and renames it the Nichirin. However, Yukimura manages to destroy the Nichirin with his full power, seemingly killing Motonari in the process. However, Motonari survives and appears in Sengoku Basara: The Last Party.|$|R
