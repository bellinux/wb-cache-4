40|$|The {{influenza}} surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is {{a potential}} target for antiviral drugs because of its key roles {{in the initial stages}} of infection: receptor binding and the fusion of virus and cell membranes. The structure of HA in complex with a known inhibitor of membrane fusion and virus infectivity, tert-butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>TBHQ),</b> shows that the inhibitor binds in a hydrophobic pocket formed at an interface between HA monomers. Occupation of this site by TBHQ stabilizes the neutral pH structure through intersubunit and intrasubunit interactions that presumably inhibit the conformational rearrangements required for membrane fusion. The nature of the binding site suggests routes for the chemical modification of TBHQ that could lead to the development of more potent inhibitors of membrane fusion and potential anti-influenza drugs...|$|R

The improvement factor in ambient atmosphere is almost 2, whereas under inert atmosphere structures with an aspect ratio of 0. 46 have been created, which corresponds to an improvement factor of almost 10. The aspect ratio could be improved because of the controlled acrylate polymerization upon addition of a RAFT agent. The fact that the photo-embossing system is independent of the atmosphere is of particular interest for applications where the presence of atmospheric oxygen is unavoidable.

40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} {{glutathione peroxidase}} (GI-GPx, GPx 2) is a selenoprotein that was suggested {{to act as}} barrier against hydroperoxide absorption but has also been implicated in the control of inflammation and malignant growth. In CaCo- 2 cells, GI-GPx was induced by t-butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>tBHQ)</b> and sulforaphane (SFN), i. e., “antioxidants” known to activate the “antioxidant response element” (ARE) via electrophilic thiol modification of Keap 1 in the Nrf 2 /Keap 1 system. The functional significance of a putative ARE in the GI-GPx promoter was validated by transcriptional activation of reporter gene constructs upon exposure to electrophiles (tBHQ, SFN, and curcumin) or overexpression of Nrf 2 and by reversal of these effects by mutation of the ARE in the promoter and by overexpressed Keap 1. Binding of Nrf 2 to the ARE sequence in authentic gpx 2 was corroborated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Thus, the presumed natural antioxidants sulforaphane and curcumin may exert their anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects not only by induction of phase 2 enzymes {{but also by the}} up-regulation of the selenoprotein GI-GPx...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{outbreak}} of H 7 N 9 influenza in China is of high concern to public health. H 7 hemagglutinin (HA) plays {{a critical role}} in influenza entry and thus HA presents an attractive target for antivirals. Previous studies have suggested that the small molecule tert-butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>TBHQ)</b> inhibits the entry of influenza H 3 HA by binding to the stem loop of HA and stabilizing the neutral pH conformation of HA, thereby disrupting the membrane fusion step. Based on amino acid sequence, structure and immunogenicity, H 7 is a related Group 2 HA. In this work we show, using a pseudovirus entry assay, that TBHQ inhibits H 7 HA-mediated entry, as well as H 3 HA-mediated entry, with an IC 50 ~ 6 µM. Using NMR, we show that TBHQ binds to the H 7 stem loop region. STD NMR experiments indicate that the aromatic ring of TBHQ makes extensive contact with the H 7 HA surface. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that TBHQ inhibits influenza entry by stabilizing the H 7 HA neutral pH conformation. Together, this work suggests that the stem loop region of H 7 HA is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention and that TBHQ, which is a widely used food preservative, is a promising lead compound...|$|R

Previously, we obtained KLF 2 -induced gene expression profiles in ECs, containing several Nrf 2 target genes. Our {{aim was to}} investigate the role of KLF 2 in shear stress-mediated activation of Nrf 2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Methods and Results-Expression of Nrf 2 and its targets NAD(P) H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO 1) and heme oxygenase (HO- 1) was elevated by shear and KLF 2. KLF 2 knockdown showed that shear-induced expression of NQO 1 but not Nrf 2 was dependent on KLF 2. KLF 2 overexpression in absence of flow resulted in more efficient activation of Nrf 2 by tert-butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>tBHQ)</b> through enhanced nuclear localization, and promoted expression of a large panel of Nrf 2 -dependent genes resulting in superior protection against oxidative stress. Comparison of shear-, KLF 2 -, and Nrf 2 -induced transcriptomes showed that the majority of shear-modulated gene sets is influenced by KLF 2 or Nrf 2. Conclusions-We report that KLF 2 substantially enhances antioxidant activity of Nrf 2 by increasing its nuclear localization and activation.

The effects of the varying amounts of TBHQ on the oxidation stability of palm oil have been investigated. The antioxidant incorporated palm oil system and control oil were subjected to heating at 180 ± 5 °C continuously {{for a period of}} 4 h per day for 4 days consecutively. The parameters used to assess the thermal degradation and oxidation properties of the palm oil include ultrasonic velocity, viscosity and density. Adiabatic compressibility, intermolecular free length, relaxation time, and acoustic impedance have been calculated from experimental data. The effect of thermal ageing on the physical properties of the oil was confirmed by chemical analysis, which included free fatty acid, total polar compounds, and estimation of fatty acids profile by gas chromatography (GC). The chemical changes were studied by FT-IR bands. The results obtained from ultrasonic studies have shown improvement in oxidative stability and retardation in thermal degradation of the antioxidant-loaded oil in comparison with the base oil. Hence, the ultrasonic velocity and acoustical parameters used for assessment of stability of frying oil and palm oil with TBHQ can be recommended for repeated frying without adverse effects on the physical properties...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Tert-butyl benzoquinone (TBBQ) is the {{oxidation}} product of tert-butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>TBHQ),</b> an antimicrobial food additive with > 40 years of safe use. TBBQ displays potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in vitro. Here, {{we report on}} studies to further explore the action of TBBQ on staphylococcal biofilms, and provide a preliminary preclinical assessment of its potential {{for use as a}} topical treatment for staphylococcal infections involving a biofilm component. Methods: The antibacterial properties of TBBQ were assessed against staphylococci growing in planktonic culture and as biofilms in the Calgary Biofilm Device. Established assays were employed to measure the effects of TBBQ on biofilm structure and bacterial membranes, and to assess resistance potential. A living skin equivalent was used to evaluate the effects of TBBQ on human skin. Results: TBBQ eradicated biofilms of S. aureus and other staphylococcal species at concentrations ≤ 64 mg/L. In contrast to other redox-active agents exhibiting activity against biofilms, TBBQ did not cause substantial destructuring of the biofilm matrix; instead, the antibiofilm activity of the compound was attributed to its ability to kill slow- and non-growing cells via membrane perturbation. TBBQ acted synergistically with gentamicin, did not damage a living skin equivalent following topical application, and exhibited low resistance potential. Conclusions: The ability of TBBQ to eradicate biofilms appears to result from its ability to kill bacteria regardless of growth state. Preliminary evaluation suggests that TBBQ represents a promising candidate for development as a topical antistaphylococcal biofilm agent...|$|R
40|$|Past {{efforts to}} employ a structure-based {{approach}} to design an inhibitor of the fusion-inducing conformational change in the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) yielded a family of small benzoquinones and hydroquinones. The most potent of these, tert-butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>TBHQ),</b> inhibits both the conformational change in HA from strain X: 31 influenza virus and viral infectivity in tissue culture cells with 50 % inhibitory concentrations in the micromolar range (D. L. Bodian, R. B. Yamasaki, R. L. Buswell, J. F. Stearns, J. M. White, and I. D. Kuntz, Biochemistry 32 : 2967 - 2978, 1993). A new structure-based inhibitor design search was begun which involved (i) the recently refined crystal structure (2. 1 -A resolution) of the HA ectodomain, (ii) {{new insights into the}} conformational change, and (iii) improvements in the molecular docking program, DOCK. As a result, we identified new inhibitors of HA-mediated membrane fusion. Like TBHQ, most of these molecules inhibit the conformational change. One of the new compounds, however, facilitates rather than inhibits the HA conformational change. Nonetheless, the facilitator, diiodofluorescein, inhibits HA-mediated membrane fusion and, irreversibly, infectivity. We further characterized the effects of inhibitors from both searches on the conformational change and membrane fusion activity of HA as well as on viral infectivity. We also isolated and characterized several mutants resistant to each class of inhibitor. The implications of our results for HA-mediated membrane fusion, anti-influenza virus therapy, and structure-based inhibitor design are discussed...|$|R

Two non-edible seed oils were used; Azadirachta indica and Hevea brasiliensis were used to produce biodiesel and first rapid oxidative stability of the biodiesel were assessed then their properties with and without additives compared thereof over a range of one year storage period. The results of stability of the biodiesels for rapid induction and long term period with and without additives revealed that physico-chemical properties of the biodiesel produced from Azadirachta indica and Hevea brasiliensis seeds oil changed with the time.

The three microorganisms showed a high proportion of sublethally injured cells (up to 99. 99 % of the surviving population) after HHP. In E. coli and L. monocytogenes, the extent of inactivation and sublethal injury depended on the pH and the composition of the treatment medium, whereas in S. cerevisiae, inactivation and sublethal injury were independent of medium pH or composition under the conditions tested. TBHQ alone was not lethal to E. coli or L. monocytogenes but acted synergistically with HHP and 24 -h refrigeration, resulting in a viability decrease of > 5 log 10 cycles of both organisms. The antimicrobial effect of citral depended on the microorganism and the treatment medium pH. Acting alone for 24 h under refrigeration, 1, 000 ppm of citral caused a reduction of 5 log 10 cycles of E. coli at pH 7. 0 and almost 3 log 10 cycles of L. monocytogenes at pH 4. 0. The combination of citral and HHP also showed a synergistic effect.

Electron microscopy {{has demonstrated that}} ectopic Nrf 1 in COS- 1 cells {{is located in the}} ER and the nuclear envelope (NE). Subcellular fractionation, together with a membrane proteinase protection assay, revealed that Nrf 1 is an integral membrane protein with both luminal and cytoplasmic domains. The N-terminal 65 residues of Nrf 1 direct its integration into the ER and NE membranes and tether it to a Triton X- 100 -resistant membrane microdomain that is associated with lipid rafts. The activity of Nrf 1 was increased by the electrophile tert-butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>tBHQ)</b> probably through an N-terminal domain-dependent process. We found that the NST (Asn/Ser/Thr-rich) domain, along with AD 1 (acidic domain 1), contributes positively to the transactivation activity of full-length Nrf 1. Further, the NST domain contains seven putative −Asn−X−Ser/Thr− glycosylation sites and when glycation was prevented by substituting all of the seven Asn to either Gln (Nrf 11 - 7 ×N/Q) or Asp (Nrf 11 - 7 ×N/D), the former multiple point mutant possessed less activity than the wild-type factor whereas the latter mutant exhibited substantially greater activity. Lastly, the ER stressors tunicamycin, thapsigargin and brefeldin A were found to inhibit basal Nrf 1 activity by ~ 25 %, and almost completely prevented induction of Nrf 1 -mediated transactivation by tBHQ. Collectively, these results suggest that the activity of Nrf 1 critically depends on its topology within the ER, and that this is modulated by redox stressors, as well as its glycosylation status...|$|R

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) or inhibition of phosphatase type 1 / 2 A (PP 1 / 2 A) activity with calyculin A caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cytosolic Ca 2 + elevation in thapsigargin (Tg) -treated platelets and decreased Ca 2 + influx into platelets {{at a time when}} Ca 2 + channels had already been opened by pretreatment of cells with Tg. In addition, both activation of PKC and inhibition of PP 1 / 2 A activity caused a dose-dependent inhibition of bivalent cation (Mn 2 +) influx (acting as a surrogate for Ca 2 + influx) in Tg-treated platelets. Inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase activity caused a small decrease in [Ca 2 +]i elevation in Tg-treated platelets, but had no effect on the ability of PMA or calyculin A to inhibit Tg-induced [Ca 2 +]i elevation Unexpectedly, PMA inhibited Tg-induced [Ca 2 +]i elevation in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, and in agreement calyculin A decreased [Ca 2 +]i elevation almost to basal levels. The results from this study were confirmed with another Ca(2 +) -ATPase inhibitor, namely 2, 5 -di(tert-butyl) <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>tBHQ).</b> These findings therefore suggest that modification of phosphorylation of target protein(s) on serine/threonine amino acid residues plays a role in the regulation of both Ca 2 + influx and in the filling state of the intracellular Ca 2 + pool in platelets treated with Tg...|$|R

Scott SmithThe {{popularity}} of convenience foods and consumer awareness have indirectly increased {{the demand for}} novel and naturally occurring compounds that can delay oxidative deterioration and maintain nutritional quality of foods. Natural antioxidants from certain herbs and spices such as rosmarinic acid from rosemary, thymol from oregano, eugenol from clove, curcumin from turmeric are rich in polyphenolic compounds that provide long term oxidative stability as well as offer additional health benefits. High antioxidative capacity of herbs and spices phenolics could potentially substitute synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate (PG), octyl gallate, and tert-butylated <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>TBHQ)</b> in the food system. Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are thermally unstable and decompose at higher temperatures. However, widely used cooking methods such as baking, frying, boiling, and roasting use high thermal temperature that can chemically degrade herbs and spices and diminish their antioxidative capacity, {{but they have been}} little studied. In this context, this review deals with the need of natural antioxidants, spices and herbs as natural antioxidants, their origin, chemical composition, pharmacological, and antioxidant properties. Moreover, the impact of temperature on total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of various herbs and spices such as cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, mace, oregano, rosemary, sage, and turmeric is highlighted. Different antioxidant assays are also studied and this approach revealed that there is a clear correlation between total phenolic content (TPC) and TAC of herbs and spices and specific phenolic compounds are responsible for the antioxidative capacity of particular herb and spice. These findings identified the optimum cooking temperature-time combination which results in the highest retention of antioxidative capacity and assures higher quality of food for the maintenance of human health...|$|R

Materials and Methods In this experimental study, 28 male Wistar rats which were randomly divided into four groups: diazinon group (10 mg/kg, once a day), TBHQ group (0. 028 g/kg of diet, once a day), diazinon + TBHQ group (diazinon, 10 mg/kg, once a day + TBHQ, 0. 028 g/kg of diet, once a day) and control group (corn oil, as vehicle of diazinon and TBHQ). The animals were treated with diazinon, TBHQ or corn oil orally using a stomach tube for 7 weeks. Results At the end of 7 th week, total thiol groups, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in brain and heart tissues were investigated. A significant increase in MDA levels (P = 0. 01) in heart tissue was evident in diazinon group, when compared to control group. Rats of the TBHQ and diazinon + TBHQ groups presented a significant increase in thiol groups (P = 0. 01), when compared to control and diazinon groups. In addition, TBHQ administration significantly increased the FRAP level of brain tissue in TBHQ and TBHQ + diazinon groups, when compared with control and diazinon groups, respectively (P = 0. 001). Conclusions The {{results of the present study}} showed that TBHQ treatment could improve antioxidant status in brain and heart tissues of rats with chronic toxicity of diazinon.

Although underlying mechanisms of adverse birth outcomes are poorly understood, critical roles of impaired trophoblast invasion and placental dysfunction characterized with dysregulated inflammatory pathways have been implicated. The present study examined the hypothesis that brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) - 47, one of the most prevalent PBDE congeners, stimulates reactive oxygen-mediated activation of inflammatory pathways in a human first trimester extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cell line, HTR- 8 /SVneo, and that the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 (Nrf 2) plays a protective role against BDE- 47 -induced inflammatory pathways. Our results provide evidence of altered mitochondrial membrane potential, enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhanced production of the pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8, and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) stimulated by BDE- 47 in HTR- 8 /SVneo cells. The inhibition of stimulated release of IL- 6 and PGE 2 by antioxidant treatments implicates the involvement of ROS in the regulation of BDE- 47 -stimulated inflammatory pathways in HTR- 8 /SVneo cells. In addition, treatment with BDE- 47 activated Nrf 2 -mediated oxidative stress responses as indicated by increased Nrf 2 transactivation, differential expression of redox-sensitive genes, and augmented glutathione (GSH) production. Pretreatment with the Nrf 2 inducers tert-butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>tBHQ)</b> or sulforaphane suppressed BDE- 47 -stimulated IL- 6 production and nuclear factor kappa B transactivation in HTR- 8 /SVneo cells, with stimulated Nrf 2 transactivation, intracellular GSH production, and mRNA expression of antioxidant genes compared with non-pretreated controls. The latter findings suggest that Nrf 2 may play a protective role against BDE- 47 -stimulated inflammatory responses. In conclusion, BDE- 47, a predominant flame retardant chemical found in human tissues, activates proinflammatory responses in human first trimester EVTs. The present study provides the first experimental data to support a mechanism by which PBDE exposure could contribute to increased risk for adverse birth outcomes. This study demonstrates that a common toxicological effect, oxidative stress, activates inflammatory pathways associated with impaired trophoblast function and placental dysfunction. Furthermore, this research contributes new information for potential interventions to reduce adverse obstetrical outcomes originating from abnormal placental function, with attendant possible economic, societal and public health benefits...|$|R
40|$|Whole {{grain and}} bran samples of two Malawian sorghums, Phatafuli, (a brown-coloured {{condensed}} tannin variety) and Shabalala, (a white-coloured condensed tannin-free variety) were analysed for their content of total phenols, condensed tannins and antioxidant activities. The effect of oxidizing conditions during extraction, and the storage stability of a freeze-dried crude phenolic extract (CPE) from the condensed tannin sorghum bran as influenced by packaging, storage temperature {{and length of}} storage, in relation to its content of total phenols, condensed tannins and antioxidant activity was also investigated. Antioxidant activity of the CPE, in comparison with tertiary butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>TBHQ),</b> was then evaluated in sunflower oil at concentrations of 1000, 1500 and 2000 ppm in the absence or presence of ferric ions at 2. 2 and 4. 4 ppm in the dark at 65 oC. Progression of oxidation was monitored by measurement of peroxide values (PV) and anisidine values (AV) during a 14 -day storage period. Phatafuli contained higher content of total phenols and antioxidant activity than Shabalala both in the whole grain and the bran, {{probably due to the}} presence of condensed tannins in Phatafuli sorghum, which were not detected in Shabalala sorghum. For both sorghum varieties, the bran contained higher levels of total phenols and antioxidant activity than the whole grain, confirming that phenolic compounds in sorghum are largely concentrated in the bran. Antioxidant activities of the sorghum varieties correlated highly with their total phenol and condensed tannin contents, suggesting that the phenolic compounds were largely responsible for the antioxidant activities of the sorghum grains. Bubbling of oxygen into the liquid crude phenolic extract did not have any significant effect on the parameters tested. Similarly, vacuum-packed samples did not differ significantly in the parameters tested from the samples that were not vacuum-packed. CPE samples stored at – 20 oC had significantly higher levels of total phenols, condensed tannins and antioxidant activity than those stored at 25 oC during some days of storage. Storage time was however the major factor influencing the levels of total phenols, condensed tannins and antioxidant activity of the CPE from Phatafuli sorghum during storage, which suggested that CPE from condensed tannin sorghum bran might need to be used shortly after extraction to ensure optimum antioxidant activity. There was an insignificant correlation between the antioxidant activities of the CPE and their phenolic contents during storage, which could have been due to the formation of new compounds with a lower antioxidant capacity. The CPE inhibited oxidation of sunflower oil as shown by lower peroxide values and anisidine values compared to control samples. The CPE was however less effective in reducing peroxide values compared to TBHQ, but was similar to TBHQ in reducing anisidine values. In the presence of ferric ions, the CPE appeared to be less effective in reducing peroxide values compared to TBHQ, but appeared to be more effective than TBHQ in reducing anisidine values. The results showed that the tannin sorghum bran CPE appeared to act as both lipid radical scavengers and metal chelators. The CPE however imparted colour to the sunflower oil, which could limit its application as a natural antioxidant in edible oils.

40|$|Seed {{coats of}} cream-coloured Bechuana white and purple-coloured Agriblue cowpea {{varieties}} and the freeze-dried forms of their acetone extracts (CPE) were analysed for total phenol content using the Folin-Ciocalteu and Ferric Ammonium Citrate methods. The seed coats and CPE of both cowpea varieties were analysed for antioxidant activity using the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) assay. HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) {{was done to}} determine the free phenolic acid composition of the CPE. The effect of the seed coats and CPE on the peroxide value (PV) of sunflower oil was determined during storage at 65 oC over a 16 -day period. The seed coats and CPE {{were added to the}} sunflower oil at concentrations of 1800 ppm and 900 ppm and their effect compared to that of the synthetic antioxidant tertiary butyl <b>hydroquinone</b> (<b>TBHQ)</b> added to the oil at 200 ppm. Seed coats and CPE fromBechuana white cowpeas contained higher levels of total phenols than the corresponding samples of Agriblue. This differed from the generally observed trend that cowpeas with darker-coloured seed coat generally contain higher levels of total phenols than light-coloured cowpeas. More cowpea varieties need to be tested to confirm this observation. The ABTS•+ radical scavenging activity of the seed coats and CPE of Bechuana white cowpeas were higher than those of Agriblue. According to the HPLC chromatograms, both cowpea varieties had similar types of phenolic acids namely, the cinnamic acid derivatives p-coumaric, ferulic and sinapic acids and the benzoic acid derivatives p</i<-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3, 4 dihydroxybenzoic, syringic, gallic and vanillic acid. These were present in higher amounts in Bechuana white than Agriblue. Phenolic acids derived from cinnamic acid tend to have higher antioxidant activity than benzoic acid derivatives. The higher antioxidant activity of Bechuana white seed coat acetone extracts and CPE was attributed to the presence of phenolic acids, especially the cinnamic acid derivatives in higher amounts in Bechuana white than Agriblue. CPE and seed coats of both cowpea varieties reduced the formation of hydroperoxides in sunflower oil as shown by their lower peroxide values compared to oil without added antioxidant during storage. This antioxidant effect of the additives was attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds. The ability of the CPE and seed coats of both cowpea varieties to reduce formation of hydroperoxides in sunflower oil was dependent on their concentration in the oil. However, the seed coat and CPE of both cowpea varieties were not as effective as TBHQ in reducing the formation of hydroperoxides in the oil. Bechuana white CPE and seed coats were more effective than Agriblue in reducing the formation of hydroperoxides. This was because Bechuana white had higher levels of total phenols and higher radical scavenging activity than Agriblue. For both cowpea varieties, the seed coats were less efficient in retarding the formation of hydroperoxides than the CPE. This was because the extracted phenolic compounds in the CPE were in a freer form to diffuse in the oil to exert antioxidant effects compared to the unextracted seed coat. Dissertation (MInst.
