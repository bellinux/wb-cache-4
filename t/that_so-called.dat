5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth <b>that</b> <b>so-called</b> murder-holes– {{openings}} in {{the ceiling of the}} gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E

The lawsuit filed against Target Corporation alleges the retailer misled consumers by marking the packaging on its up & up® brand wipes as flushable and safe for sewer and septic systems. The lawsuit also alleges <b>that</b> <b>so-called</b> flushable wipes are a public health hazard because they are alleged to clog pumps at municipal waste-treatment facilities.|$|E
500|$|It is {{traditionally}} believed <b>that</b> <b>so-called</b> [...] "deep" [...] infections—such as osteomyelitis or infective endocarditis—should {{be treated with}} bactericidal antibiotics, not bacteriostatic ones. Nevertheless, preclinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of linezolid for these infections, and the drug has been used successfully to treat them in clinical practice. Linezolid {{appears to be a}} reasonable therapeutic option for infective endocarditis caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, despite a lack of high-quality evidence to support this use. Results in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis have varied, with some cases treated successfully and others not responding to therapy. Low- to medium-quality evidence is also mounting for its use in bone and joint infections, including chronic osteomyelitis, although adverse effects are a significant concern when long-term use is necessary.|$|E
500|$|Bach's Nekrolog, the 1754 {{obituary}} {{written by}} Johann Friedrich Agricola and the composer's son Carl Philipp Emanuel, mentions that the composer wrote several Magnificats. Apart from the extant copies of BWV 243/243a, of the German Magnificat BWV 10 {{and of the}} chorale harmonisation BWV 324, a Magnificat for soprano solo was considered lost in the 19th century. The score of <b>that</b> <b>so-called</b> [...] "little" [...] Magnificat (...) was rediscovered in the 20th century, and listed as BWV Anh. 21; however, its authenticity was doubted. In 1982 Melchior Hoffmann was identified as the composer of this German Magnificat Meine Seel erhebt den Herren. A similar cantata on a German paraphrase of the Magnificat, Meine Seele rühmt und preist, BWV 189 for tenor solo and composed for Visitation, has also been attributed to Hoffmann.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a debate}} over what should {{constitute}} an acceptable scientific and engineering foundation for proceeding with radioactive waste disposal strategies. There {{are those who have}} argued, on the basis of complex geochemical simulation models, that relinquishing control over radioactive materials to geohydrologic processes at repository closure is an acceptable risk. They maintain <b>that</b> <b>so-called</b> [...] "natural analogues" [...] inhibit subterranean movement of radionuclides, making disposal of radioactive wastes in stable geologic formations unnecessary. However, existing models of these processes are empirically underdetermined: due to the subterranean nature of such processes in solid geologic formations, the accuracy of computer simulation models has not been verified by empirical observation, certainly not over periods of time equivalent to the lethal half-lives of high-level radioactive waste. On the other hand, some insist deep geologic repositories in stable geologic formations are necessary. National management plans of various countries display a variety of approaches to resolving this debate.|$|E
500|$|In The Daily Telegraph Christopher Howse {{concentrated}} on the moral arguments in the book, and agreed with Hitchens that [...] "to determine {{what is right and}} what is wrong without God, is difficult". [...] Also in The Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore wrote that the book [...] "tries to do two things at once. One is to bash up modern militant atheism with all the author's polemical skill. The other is to give an autobiographical account of how, in our time, an intelligent man's faith may recover". In a positive review in Standpoint magazine, Michael Nazir Ali wrote, [...] "One of the abiding canards nailed by Peter Hitchens is that religion causes conflict. He does this by showing <b>that</b> <b>so-called</b> [...] "religious" [...] wars had many other elements to them, such as greed for territory, political ambition and nationalism. His repeated references to Soviet brutality reveal that secular ideologies have caused more suffering in recent times than any conflict associated with religion." [...] In a more critical review in the New Statesman Sholto Byrnes wrote, [...] "Hitchens makes his case forcefully, passionately and intelligently", but [...] "makes too much connection between the ill deeds of atheists and their atheism". Byrnes also reviewed the book in The Independent, where he questioned the validity of a number of Hitchens's conclusions, including that [...] "atheists 'actively wish for disorder and meaninglessness'". In a sympathetic review in The Guardian, Rupert Shortt wrote, [...] "Hitchens does not seek to mount a comprehensive defence of Christianity. He is wise to avoid deeper philosophical and theological waters, because his strengths lie elsewhere. His more manageable aim is to expose what he holds to be three major fallacies underlying God Is Not Great: that conflict fought in the name of religion is really always about faith; that [...] "it is ultimately possible to know with confidence what is right and what is wrong without acknowledging the existence of God"; and that [...] "atheist states are not actually atheist". In The Spectator, Quentin Letts reviewed the book very positively, describing it as [...] "a magnificent, sustained cry against the aggressive secularism taking control of our weakened culture".|$|E

2500|$|Predicate dualism {{is a view}} {{espoused by}} nonreductive physicalists such as Donald Davidson and Jerry Fodor, who {{maintain}} that while {{there is only one}} ontological category of substances and properties of substances (usually physical), the predicates that we use to describe mental events cannot be redescribed in terms of (or reduced to) physical predicates of natural languages. If we characterize predicate monism as the view subscribed to by eliminative materialists, who maintain that such intentional predicates as believe, desire, think, feel, etc., will eventually be eliminated from both the language of science and from ordinary language because the entities to which they refer do not exist, then predicate dualism is most easily defined as the negation of this position.

2500|$|In 1987, SCS and Seckel helped sponsor an amicus brief {{before the}} U.S. Supreme Court {{in the case}} Edwards v.
