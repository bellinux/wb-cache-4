5000|$|The power {{radiated}} (or received) by an electrically short {{vertical antenna}} like the T {{is proportional to}} the square of the [...] "effective height" [...] of the antenna, [...] so the antenna should be made as high as possible. Without the horizontal wire, the RF current distribution in the vertical wire would decrease linearly to zero at the top (see drawing a above), giving an effective height of half the physical height of the antenna. With an ideal [...] "infinite capacitance" [...] <b>top</b> <b>load</b> wire, the current in the vertical would be constant along its length, giving an effective height equal to the physical height, therefore increasing the power radiated fourfold. So the power radiated (or received) by a T antenna is up to four times that of a vertical monopole of the same height.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the length}} of the wire {{segments}} are shorter than a quarter wavelength (λ/4) of the radio waves, as is typical for use below 1 MHz, the antenna functions as a vertical electrically short monopole antenna with capacitive top-loading. [...] Because the two horizontal arms of the [...] "T" [...] have equal but oppositely-directed currents in them, which causes the radio waves from them to cancel far from the antenna, and because of similar cancelling ground currents, the horizontal wire radiates little radio power. [...] Instead it serves to add capacitance {{to the top of the}} antenna. [...] This increases the currents in the upper portion of the vertical wire (see drawing at right), increasing the radiation resistance and thus its efficiency, allowing it to radiate more power, or in a receiving antenna be more sensitive to incoming radio signals. The <b>top</b> <b>load</b> wire can increase radiated power by 2 to 4 times (3 to 6 dB) for a given base current. However, the antenna is still typically not as efficient as a full-height λ/4 vertical monopole, [...] and has a higher Q and thus a narrower bandwidth. T antennas are typically used at low frequencies where it is not practical to build a quarter-wave vertical antenna because of its height, and the vertical radiating wire is often very electrically short, only a small fraction of a wavelength long, 0.1λ or less. Since the radiation resistance and efficiency increases with height, the antenna should be suspended as high as possible. The antenna has a base impedance with a capacitive component that must be tuned out with an added inductor.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{analytical}} {{computational model}} {{was developed to}} predict <b>Top</b> <b>Load</b> and Side Load performance of oval containers. The performance of oval and other non round containers {{is dependent on the}} thickness distribution achieved during blow molding. Simulating blow molding and performance of containers using Virtual PrototypingTM Software and feeding the input for Finite Element Analysis provides an accurate mechanism to predict container performance. A 2402. generic oval container with aspect ratio of 1. 58 was simulated for empty and filled <b>top</b> <b>load</b> performance. A critical part of blow molding oval containers is the ability to achieve a more uniform thickness profile along the circumference of the container at any given height. This is achieved by using preferential heating where the infra-red heating ovens have special slotted reflector plates that allow the preform to be heated differently 90 " apart. For the 2402. oval container with a high aspect ratio it was observed that the use of preferential heating is necessary to achieve uniform thickness distribution in the range of 0. 3 mm- 0. 4 mm. A non preferentially heated preform resulted in container thickness being 0. 4 - 0. 6 mm in a concentrated region adjoining the minor axis. The preferentially heated performs resulted in containers having better empty and filled <b>Top</b> <b>load.</b> The side grip load was the only performance characteristic that was higher for the non preferentially heated containers but that works only in a small region and the non uniformity of thickness makes the container not aesthetically pleasing and would not be acceptable in a production process due to inconsistency in material distribution...|$|E

Therefore, on the basis of Euler’s Method and the flexural buckling failure mode of the consequent slabbed rock slope, the calculation method of the CBH of the vertical slabbed rock slope under the self-weight is firstly proposed, and then it is extended to that of the consequent slabbed rock slope. The effect of slope dip angle, friction angle, and cohesion between the neighboring rock slabs and rock elastic modulus on the slope CBH is discussed. Secondly, the calculation method of the CBH of the consequent slabbed rock slope under its self-weight and <b>top</b> <b>loading</b> is proposed according to the superposition principle. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} hypothesis that the rock mechanical behavior obeys the statistical damage model, the effect of the rock mechanical parameters n and ε 0 on the slope CBH is studied. The results show that the rock strength has much effect on the slope CBH.
