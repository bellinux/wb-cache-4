5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E

George Fegan in the 1960s reported treating over 13,000 patients with sclerotherapy, significantly advancing the technique by focussing on fibrosis of the vein rather than thrombosis, concentrating on controlling significant points of reflux, and emphasizing the importance of compression of the treated leg.

The sclerosant drugs (sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulfate or polidocanol) are mixed with air or a physiological gas (carbon dioxide) in a syringe or by using mechanical pumps. This increases the surface area of the drug. The foam sclerosant drug is more efficacious than the liquid one in causing sclerosis (thickening of the vessel wall and sealing off the blood flow), for it does not mix with the blood in the vessel and in fact displaces it, thus avoiding dilution of the drug and causing maximal sclerosant action.

50|$|Males {{perform the}} task of inseminating queens. They perch in areas where young queens might pass, {{awaiting}} mating opportunities. They scent mark their perches using a glandular secretion containing <b>tetradecyl</b> acetate and butyric acid. This is likely a signal to other males rather than to females. Males of this species also help to incubate pupae, a task done only by workers in most bee species.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other ants, {{they are}} seen singly or in small groups and their colonies consist of very small numbers of individuals. They are also unusual amongst ants in that the queen-worker {{difference}} is very limited and some workers can mate and lay fertilized eggs just like the queen. These workers are termed gamergates. New colonies are founded independently by single queens, and on aging they are replaced by several gamergates. The gamergates copulate with males from their own colonies and, being inbred, {{are related to the}} original founding queen. Colonies are very small, and they never undergo fission to form new colonies. The workers limit the number of reproductives in the colony by policing new workers that try to lay eggs when an active queen or established gamergates are present. Workers use alarm pheromones which include 4-methyl-3-heptanone, 4-methyl-3-heptanol and isopentyl isopentanoate. H. saltator, like many species of ant, produces 4-methyl-3-heptanone from mandibular glands. Dufour's gland secretions have been found to include a complex mixture of linear hydrocarbons from C15 to C25, with (Z)-9-tricosene being the main constituent, along with other minor constituents like <b>tetradecyl</b> propionate and traces of <b>tetradecyl</b> acetate and dodecyl acetate. Both the secretions from the postpharyngeal glands and the cuticular wax include methyl esters of common fatty acids.|$|E

50|$|Sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulfate (STS) is a {{commonly}} used synonym for 7-ethyl-2-methyl-4-undecanyl sulfate sodium salt which is anionic surfactant {{that is the}} active component of the sclerosant drug Sotradecol. It is commonly used {{in the treatment of}} varicose and spider veins of the leg, during the procedure of sclerotherapy. Being a detergent, its action is on the lipid molecules in the cells of the vein wall, causing inflammatory destruction of the internal lining of the vein and thrombus formation eventually leading to sclerosis of the vein. It is used in concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 3% for this purpose.In the UK, Ireland, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, it is sold under the trade-name Fibro-Vein in concentrations of 0.2%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 3%.|$|E
50|$|While {{one study}} which {{utilized}} mice models indicated that acrosin {{is not a}} necessary component of zona pellucida penetration, other studies in humans have shown an association between low acrosomal proteinase activity and infertility. Other research groups have demonstrated a significant correlation between acrosin activity and sperm motility. In rabbit models, an intravaginal contraceptive device that secreted <b>tetradecyl</b> sodium sulfate, a known inhibitor of acrosin and hyaluronidases, had a complete contraceptive effect. Although its exact mechanism of action is not entirely clear, acrosin could thus serve as a novel target for contraceptive agents. Acrosin may represent as a uniquely druggable target due to its location and high cellular specificity. Thus, developing inhibitors of acrosin could {{provide the basis for}} safe, reversible male contraceptives, or female contraceptives through the use of intravaginal contraceptive devices.|$|E
5000|$|A {{commonly}} performed non-surgical {{treatment for}} varicose and [...] "spider" [...] leg veins is sclerotherapy, in which medicine (sclerosant) is {{injected into the}} veins to make them shrink. The medicines that are commonly used as sclerosants are polidocanol (POL branded Asclera in the United States, Aethoxysklerol in Australia), sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate (STS), Sclerodex (Canada), Hypertonic Saline, Glycerin and Chromated Glycerin. STS (branded Fibrovein in Australia) liquids can be mixed at varying concentrations of sclerosant and varying sclerosant/gas proportions, with air or CO2 or O2 to create foams. Foams may allow more veins to be treated per session with comparable efficacy. Their use in contrast to liquid sclerosant is still somewhat controversial. Sclerotherapy {{has been used in}} the treatment of varicose veins for over 150 years. Sclerotherapy is often used for telangiectasias (spider veins) and varicose veins that persist or recur after vein stripping. Sclerotherapy can also be performed using foamed sclerosants under ultrasound guidance to treat larger varicose veins, including the great saphenous and small saphenous veins.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of intralesional bleomycin and sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate in treatment of haemangiomas and lymphangiomas. Patients and Methods: Between July 2007 and May 2009, 120 patients, sixty each of peripheral haemangiomas and lymphangiomas, were administered intralesional injection of bleomycin in a dose of 0. 5 - 1 U/kg in children {{less than one year}} of age and 1 to 15 units in children more than one year of age and 1 to 3 ml of 2 % sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate, {{depending on the size of}} the lesion at intervals of 14 days. Patients more than 20 years of age and those with diffuse or visceral lesions were excluded from the study. Results: Complete resolution occurred in 16 patients (53 %) of haemangiomas and 14 patients (47 %) of lymphangiomas treated with bleomycin, while the results were 12 patients (40 %) and 10 patients (33 %), respectively, in sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate group. The satisfactory resolution (resolution more than 50 %) occurred in eight patients (27 %) of haemangiomas and lymphangiomas groups treated with bleomycin, while the results were six patients (20 %) and eight patients (27 %), respectively, in sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate group. Poor response rate was observed in six patients (20 %) of haemangiomas and eight patients (27 %) of lymphangiomas of bleomycin group and 12 patients (40 %) of haemangiomas and lymphangiomas in sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate group. No pulmonary fibrosis or other serious side effects were found. Conclusions: Intralesional bleomycin and sodium <b>tetradecyl</b> sulphate are effective sclerosants in peripheral haemangiomas and lymphangiomas, but bleomycin was found to be more efficacious...|$|E
