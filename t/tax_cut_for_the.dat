50|$|The {{third party}} candidates' tax plans were not studied by {{mainstream}} media outlets and the Tax Policy Center. Chuck Baldwin supports replacing {{the income tax}} with a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods. Bob Barr supports replacing the income tax with a consumption tax (the FairTax). The details of his exact plan are not known but consumption taxes tend to be regressive unless accompanied by a negative income tax for the poor to offset necessary expenditures.

His infrastructure platform called for ensuring that Maryland can [...] "support water, sewer, transportation and education" [...] while preserving [...] "open spaces... rural heritage (and) affordable housing". On education, he supports increased funding and claims that the No Child Left Behind Act has been a failure due to underfunding {{and a lack of}} flexibility. He was an advocate of gun ownership restrictions and sought to reduce gun violence by closing the gun show loophole, providing universal health care, including mental health care, and promoting the registration of weapons and a law enforcement focus on violent criminals and anti-gang initiatives. He supported energy independence, believing it can be achieved in 10 years; his proposals included [...] "re-engineering federal buildings to reduce government energy consumption", raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, increasing funding for mass transit, requiring disclosure of home energy costs and offering tax [...] "incentives for energy conservation and (the) use of mass transit." [...] He opposed partially privatizing Social Security. He also advocated federal legislation to change bankruptcy protection so that individuals' retirement is [...] "safe and secure". He supported universal health care and environmental protection, which he claimed was rolled back by the George W. Bush Administration. Specifically, on the environment, he supported the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act and opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; he believed that the Healthy Forests Initiative and the Clear Skies Act {{have a negative impact on}} the environment. Though his website does not cover the issue, Duck has been described as opposed to gay marriage yet in favor of civil unions. His website also does not cover immigration, but he said he was opposed to securing the border and supported greater enforcement immigration-related employment law.|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{a long run}} forecasting model for Thailand, building a dynamic interindustry model that incorporates detailed sectoral inter-relationships in a consistent manner and that describe how the economy will evolve over a long time period. Policy options can be simulated with the model. An optimization technique allowing policymakers to set an optimal path for tax rates to affect inflation and unemployment is demonstrated. The Thai Dynamic Interindustry model (TIDY) is constructed from the 'bottom up' and relies {{on a series of}} 26 -sector input-output tables of Thailand describing all productive activity. Because the model uses a comprehensive and internally consistent representation of all sector interactions, the model provides a tool for studying policy effects at the sectoral level. A special feature of TIDY is its use of loss functions to improve estimates of two critical macro variables: saving rate and prices. The loss function minimizing estimation errors on two variables, unemployment and inflation, yields estimates of the saving rate that are consistent with underlying economic theory and are an improvement over standard least squares estimates. Forecasts of the Thai economy are presented for the period through 2020. The results demonstrate that the long run prospects for the economy, as reflected in growth in real consumption, price stability, and full employment, are quite good if stable policies for fiscal policy are followed and exchange rates remain stable. The economy is, however, not immune to major financial shocks such as occurred in the late 1990 's. The model also demonstrates the effects of alternative fiscal policies, by simulating outcomes when the time path of personal direct taxes are set to minimize the deviations of two critical macro variables inflation and unemployment rates from desired levels of 3. 0 percent. A quadratic objective function, capturing substitution effects between inflation and unemployment, is specified. A time path for the inflation-averse policymaker of increasing tax rates yields slower real growth but relative price stability and a stable trade balance. The alternative of a continuous <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> unemployment-adverse policymaker increases real consumption and inflation, and leads to a widening trade imbalance. These forecasts demonstrate the key role of international trade and capital markets to Thailand's long run future...|$|E
