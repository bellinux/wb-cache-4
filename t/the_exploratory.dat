40|$|What {{computer-based}} {{learning environment}} will {{students of all}} ages be immersed in 5, 10, or 20 years from now? And, how can we best prepare for learning and teaching in that environment? Part of the answer to these questions will lie in a deep understanding of Web-based (or whatever succeeds it) interactive learning that engages {{a broad range of}} human capabilities. <b>The</b> <b>Exploratories</b> project, an interactive Web-based educational research project at Brown University, uses the introductory undergraduate computer graphics course as a testbed to address these questions. An exploratory is a computer-based combination of an exploratorium and a laboratory that embeds in a hypermedia environment a multifaceted interactive microworld that models objects, phenomena, and concepts. The ultimate goal of <b>the</b> <b>Exploratories</b> project is to understand the patterns, in Alexander's [3] sense, that underlie effective Web-based interactive education and to transmit that understanding through an interactive, Web-based Design Strategy Handbook that is itself an example of what it teaches...|$|R

25|$|As well as testing {{conditions}} {{during and after}} the monsoon, the expedition was to test likely climbers for 1936 and follow up <b>the</b> <b>exploratory</b> work of the 1921 reconnaissance. Explicitly there was to be no summit attempt and supplementary oxygen {{was not going to be}} used. Tilman initially regretted having to abandon the Nanda Devi summit attempt but Shipton persuaded him by the lightweight exploratory nature of what was being planned. Charles Warren and Edmund Wigram, both Cambridge medics, Edwin Kempson a Cambridge mathematician, and Dan Bryant, an ice climber from New Zealand agreed to take part. Shipton considered this complement quite ample but he found he had a surveyor, Michael Spender added to the team. Spender had made himself extremely unpopular on earlier expeditions due to his conceit and there were rumours that his inclusion was due to mischief making. All the same, Shipton and Spender became close friends.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the First World War Walke became concerned about the large numbers of unemployed Cornish miners who were unable to find work. With Gerard Collier he organised prayer meetings for out-of-work miners at the Friends' Meeting House in Redruth. The majority of the miners were also Methodists; after the prayer meeting they discussed the prospects of reviving the mining industry. From these meetings a plan to rebuild the industry on a Christian basis was put forward by Walke, Collier and a number of others who saw an opportunity to strengthen the place of religion in society. The support of the various Christian denominations in Cornwall was obtained and a disused mine at Scorrier which had closed fifty years earlier was acquired. Sufficient capital was accumulated to finance exploratory work at the mine which would enable a decision on its viability to be made and fifty miners joined the Communion of the Ring in Cornwall at a service of dedication conducted by the Bishop of Truro and ministers of other denominations. Three months later the engineer reported favourably on <b>the</b> <b>exploratory</b> work and it was hoped to raise enough capital to continue from a group in London who had made their decision to invest conditional on the support of the project by the Bishop of Truro and two others in Cornwall. However the third of these declined his support because he knew of a forthcoming government plan for road-making intended to relieve unemployment. At this point the project had to be abandoned.|$|E
