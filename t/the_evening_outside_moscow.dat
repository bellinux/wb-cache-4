Chickerel had directed a maid-servant known as Jane to receive his humbler daughter and make her comfortable; and that friendly person, who spoke {{as if she had}} known Picotee five-and-twenty years, took her to the housekeeper's room, where the visitor deposited her jacket and hat, and rested awhile.|$|R

2500|$|The Talmudic view {{coincides with}} that of the Mishnah {{requiring}} <b>the</b> giving <b>even</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Land of Israel. [...] The basis of this view is due to the Mitzvah not being an obligation of the land but an obligation of the body. The Talmud delves further than the Mishnah in terms of citing instances of penalties being levied against both individual transgressors and entire communities for failure to give these gifts (Talmud Hullin p.132b).|$|R

The {{suspended load}} is the middle layer that consists of the smaller sediment that's suspended. The wash load is uppermost layer which consist of the smallest sediment that can be seen with the naked eye; however, the wash load gets easily mixed with suspended load during transportation due to the very similar process. The wash load never touches <b>the</b> bed <b>even</b> <b>outside</b> of a current.|$|R
5000|$|Jacobs posits {{cities as}} {{fundamentally}} different from towns and suburbs principally because they are full of strangers.

[...] A central challenge of the city, therefore, is to make its inhabitants feel safe, secure, and socially integrated {{in the midst of an}} overwhelming volume of rotating strangers. The healthy sidewalk is a critical mechanism for achieving these ends, given its role in preventing crime and facilitating contact with others.|$|R
