5|$|Matt's brigade {{began moving}} to Tasa at 4:30 PM on October 15, before turning eastwards on Akavish. Heavy {{congestion}} {{on the roads}} made the brigade's progress very slow. A little after midnight, the brigade left Akavish and moved westward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yard,</b> an area 700 meters long and 150 meters wide surrounded by protective sand walls. The site had been made long before the war.|$|E
5|$|HMS Ledbury was {{an escort}} {{destroyer}} of the Hunt class Type II. The Royal Navy ordered Ledburys construction {{two days after}} the outbreak of the Second World War and J. I. Thornycroft Ltd laid down her keel at their Southampton yard on 24 January 1940. Air raid damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> delayed her construction and she did not launch until 27 September 1941. Her initial assignment was to perform escort duties between Scapa Flow and Iceland. She remained in this theatre for {{the first part of the}} war, during which time she served with the ill-fated Arctic convoy PQ 17 in June 1942, from which twenty-four ships were lost.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{security}} system at a scrap metal yard, {{which had been}} repeatedly burglarized, went off. The yard's owner {{was at the time}} on a hunt close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and drove directly to it. A group of burglars jumped into their car and attempted to drive away. The owner used his shotgun and attempted to shoot the car's tires, hitting and wounding two of its occupants. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for intentional infliction of bodily harm, a sentence that was confirmed on appeal. The owner received full presidential pardon.|$|E
60|$|Three {{or four of}} us ran up {{the rigging}} like monkeys, {{and in a few}} minutes the sails were lashed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R
60|$|The canvas was {{instantly}} permitted to fall, {{and it was}} no sooner stretched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards,</b> than force was applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> halyards, and the sails were hoisted.|$|R
50|$|Ratlines (sometimes ratlins) - Groups of side {{stays on}} a square rigged ship that have {{horizontal}} lines placed for feet, enabling crew to rapidly ascend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R
5|$|Several 18th-century {{buildings}} {{still stand}} in Sisimiut, {{among them the}} 1725 Gammelhuset ("Old House") and the 1775 Bethel-kirken ("Bethel Church") or Blå Kirke ("Blue Church"), the oldest surviving church in Greenland. The buildings were moved from the former site of the settlement at Ukiivik (Holsteinsborg) together {{with the rest of}} the settlement. The new church on the rocky pedestal was built in 1926, further extended in 1984. The entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> with the old church and other protected historical buildings is decorated with a unique gate made of whale jawbone. In 1801, a smallpox epidemic decimated the population of Sisimiut and other coastal settlements, although the population growth quickly resumed due to plentiful marine life on the coast.|$|E
5|$|In August, she steamed to New York for repairs, {{arriving}} at Base 10 on 19 August and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter. She completed repairs on 26 September and got underway for Port Jefferson that same day. During the mid-watch on 27 September, she ran hard aground on Block Island. Captain Victor Blue and his navigator, confused about shore lights and {{more concerned about}} the minefield at the opening of Long Island Sound, made the turn at the wrong time and ran the ship aground on the island from the bow all the way aft beyond midships. For three days, her crew lightened ship to no avail. On 30 September, tugs came to her assistance, and she finally backed clear. Hull damage dictated a return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and extensive repairs precluded her departure with Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9) for the British Isles in November. The secondary battery was reduced to eighteen 5-inch guns in October 1917. Captain Blue, a protege of Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, was never court-martialed and remained in command of Texas. The Navy Department held his navigator entirely responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Sharon {{planned for}} Raviv's brigade to {{attack from the}} east, {{diverting}} Egyptian attention away from Deversoir. Erez was tasked with transporting a pre-constructed roller bridge to the crossing area at Deversoir, while one of his tank battalions would {{be attached to the}} paratroopers. Colonel Reshef was given the most critical tasks of all. Accordingly, his brigade was heavily reinforced to incorporate four armored and three mechanized infantry battalions, in addition to the division's reconnaissance battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Yaov Brom. His brigade would conduct a turning maneuver at 6:00 AM on October 15 south of Akavish Road, move through the sand dunes to reach Fort Lakekan, before heading north to occupy Fort Matzmed. Reshef's brigade would then split up to clear the Akavish and Titur Roads and seize the Chinese Farm, while occupying the crossing area and awaiting Matt's brigade. Matt's paratrooper brigade, containing an additional tank company and the armored battalion, would move south-west via Akavish to reach Fort Matzmed. From there, it would continue on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yard</b> and cross the canal at 11:00 PM, using rubber dinghies and rafts for the tanks.|$|E
50|$|In November 2011, Brooklyn Navy Yard Center at BLDG 92, {{a museum}} {{dedicated}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard's</b> history and future, opened. A program of <b>the</b> Brooklyn Navy <b>Yard</b> Development Corporation, <b>the</b> center offers exhibits, public tours, educational programs, archival resources, and workforce development services.|$|R
50|$|Catharpin is a {{nautical}} term, {{which is}} often pronounced cat-harping. It describes one of the short ropes or iron clamps used <b>to</b> brace in <b>the</b> shrouds toward the masts so as to give a freer sweep <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|CMRR {{also had}} a yard in Kingston, {{referred}} to as [...] "Cornell Street Yard." [...] In 2009, a new siding was constructed <b>to</b> expand <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> facilities <b>to</b> allow for <b>the</b> storage and restoration of passenger cars for expanded tourist train operations. The CMRR was forced <b>to</b> vacate <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> by <b>the</b> County on May 1, 2016.|$|R
25|$|The Naval Act of 1938 brought {{increased}} shipbuilding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> as it mandated a 20% {{increase in}} {{the strength of the}} nation's Navy. This brought an expansion of business <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> with 17,000 employees working in December 1941 and 32,000 in 1943, including 1,200 women. Payroll reached $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) around this time, and contracts amounted to around $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars).|$|E

50|$|In June 1965, {{the company}} {{was taken over by}} Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Greenock. In 1979 the {{decision}} was taken <b>to</b> close <b>the</b> shipbuilding <b>yard.</b> <b>The</b> last vessel <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> was <b>the</b> Laggan built for Forth Tugs Limited of Grangemouth.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the man drew {{up with a}} jerk {{at the top of}} a dark lane. Over the low {{roofs and}} jagged chimney stacks of the houses rose the black masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R
50|$|On September 5, 1951, <b>the</b> Harbour <b>Yard</b> opened <b>to</b> replace {{capacity}} at the Eglinton Carhouse {{that was}} lost due <b>to</b> subway construction. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> was {{located on the}} south side of the railway viaduct between Bay and York streets. Streetcars went south on Bay Street from Front Street <b>to</b> access <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{dry dock}} was {{extended}} from 106.7 metres to 108.9 metres. In 1916 the company {{bought a house}} next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> area, {{at the other side}} of Munkkisaarenkatu, for a residence of its workers.|$|E
25|$|Woodstock {{was paid}} off 27 January 1945 from the Royal Canadian Navy as a warship {{and was sent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> for {{conversion}} as a loop-layer. On 17 May 1945 she was recommissioned as a weather ship and served as such until her final paying off 16 March 1946.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} {{also included}} {{the building of}} two signal boxes, one {{at each end of}} the station. It was possible to hear the bells in these boxes ringing from a point mid-way along the main platforms. Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> became possible from the Down and Up through lines and the main Up (north) platform.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> hauling parrel, [...] whose {{function}} is <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> junk sail <b>yard</b> close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mast. It runs from <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> around <b>the</b> mast, {{and then down}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deck. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> hauling parrel will control the lateral movement of the higher battens along the mast.|$|R
50|$|Cattle {{from the}} station were often taken {{overland}} to Meekatharra then trucked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> at Midland junction. 13 bogies (about 600 head) of cattle were sent in 1929, 180 in 193280 in 1938, another 600 cattle were dispatched in 1939 and another 700 in 1949.|$|R
5000|$|The {{magnificent}} city of Gateway {{grows in}} the hills above <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> while <b>the</b> Victory slowly takes shape. Much {{of the population of}} <b>the</b> Caroline moves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> and its society is formally divided into two classes. The Technos supervise construction and are aware of the motivational [...] "myth of the ship" [...] plan while the People believe that <b>the</b> voyage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planet Home is the actual goal.|$|R
25|$|A gate {{is to be}} erected at the {{entrance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yard</b> between Wadsworth House and Boylston Hall. It is to be erected {{by members of the}} Porcellian Club in memory of Joseph McKean 1794, S.T.D., LL.D. Boylston Professor of Rhetoric, Oratory and Elocution, and also the founder of the Porcellian Club.|$|E
25|$|Clewlines {{raise the}} clews (bottom corners) of a square sail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> above, {{either to the}} outer ends of a yard or, more commonly, to near {{the middle of the}} yard, near (but not quite at) the mast. As the clewlines were hauled in, the sheets would be slacked off. This process would be {{reversed}} when setting sail.|$|E
25|$|Wolsey was {{decommissioned}} in {{the summer}} of 1945 and transferred to the reserve; by October 1945 she was no longer on the Royal Navys active list. She was placed on the disposal list in 1946 and sold on 4 March 1947 to BISCO for scrapping. She later was towed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> of T. Young and Company at Sunderland to be broken up.|$|E
50|$|The station {{serves the}} Ruby Junction Maintenance and Operations Facility, often {{the point where}} MAX {{operators}} switch shifts, or trains returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> terminate, according <b>to</b> their rollsigns.

Despite the pleas, neither the tanks nor the Victualling Yard were listed in 2006. Listing was limited to the {{entrance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> The Rosia Water Tanks were demolished in August 2006 despite strong opposition. The government's actions were the subject of local and international criticism.|$|E
