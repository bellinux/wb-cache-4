40|$|Peer reviewedFor 200 {{years the}} spirituality of the {{coloured}} people of Suurbraak was formed through an identity of marginalisation – a marginalisation that impacted {{on their lives}} on the political, economic and social levels. In this article, the present and historical forms of this spirituality are traced and described in terms of Dirkie Smit’s paradigm for a Reformed spirituality. Although the spirituality of the people of Suurbraak was found to be both creative and Reformed, it was also found that this spirituality lacks a liberating side and has contributed to the marginalisation of the identity of the people. A new liberation paradigm in line with Gustavo Gutiérrez’s paradigm of a liberation spirituality is suggested to help coloured people to eradicate their own marginalisation. The presupposition to this article is that the total participation of coloured people as Africans in South Africa can only take place when they themselves <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>intiative</b> in re-identifying themselves in the effort to achieve de-marginalisation...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{business}} surely {{represents the}} new development perspective for world-wide trade. Together {{with the idea}} of ebusiness, and the exigency to exchange business messages between trading partners, the concept of business-to-business (B 2 B) integration arouse. B 2 B integration is becoming necessary to allow partners to communicate and exchange business documents, like catalogues, purchase orders, reports and invoices, overcoming architectural, applicative, and semantic differences, according to the business processes implemented by each enterprise. Business relationships can be very heterogeneous, and consequently there are variousways to integrate enterprises with each other. Moreover nowadays not only large enterprises, but also the small- and medium- enterprises are moving towards ebusiness: more than two-thirds of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) use the Internet as a business tool. One of the business areas which is actively facing the interoperability problem is that related with the supply chain management. In order to really allow the SMEs to improve their business and to fully exploit ICT technologies in their business transactions, there are three main players that must be considered and joined: the new emerging ICT technologies, the scenario and the requirements of the enterprises and the world of standards and standardisation bodies. This thesis presents the definition and the development of an interoperability framework (and <b>the</b> bounded standardisation <b>intiatives)</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>the</b> Textile/Clothing sectorwith a shared set of business documents and protocols for electronic transactions. Considering also some limitations, the thesis proposes a ontology-based approach to improve the functionalities of the developed framework and, exploiting the technologies of the semantic web, to improve the standardisation life-cycle, intended as the development, dissemination and adoption of B 2 B protocols for specific business domain. The use of ontologies allows the semantic modellisation of knowledge domains, upon which it is possible to develop a set of components for a better management of B 2 B protocols, and to ease their comprehension and adoption for the target users...|$|R

40|$|Higher oil prices, {{climate changes}} and {{problems}} with poor local air quality {{is leading to}} an intensified debate on alternative fuels. Hydrogen is one of them. In Sweden the history of hydrogen can be traced several decades back, but the different activities have uptil now never been surveyed and documented. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe and raise awareness of activities and actors in the field of hydrogen and fuel cells in Sweden between 1960 and 2005, focusing on hydrogen as an alternative fuel for vehicles. Through historical studies of how new technologies have been perceived, considered, developed and introduced, new knowledge about the dynamics of that kind of processes can be created. A look back in time can help us notice that what is happening today, in many ways are steps in a process that started many decades ago. Hence, the lessons learnt from successful and failed projects can be transfered to the actors of current or future hydrogen projects or activities. During the study, planned and completed activities have been identified and described, e. g. technology survey, research, development work, demonstrations and building of contact networks, together with involved actors and individuals. The investigation was based on litterature studies and interviews with more than 25 persons that have been working in the field during the period. The result of the study shows that the hydrogen history in Sweden is long and that there have been many activities during the years, even if the level of interest has varied. There was an interest in hydrogen vehicles already in the 60 ´s when ASEA carried out a fuel cell R&D programme and was one of the leading companies in the world. The competence from ASEA was later transfered to the Royal Institute of Technology, which has been one of the key players in the history. The Swedish Govenment started to support hydrogen avtivities in 1975 when the first energy research programme started, as a result of the oil crisis. The main activities then were technology surveys, international collaboration and research projects. There has been research on both production and storage technologies, as well as the use of hydrogen in either vehicles with combustion engines or fuel cells. The first hydrogen fueled car was demonstrated in 1985 in Härnösand, on the initiative of a local entrepreneur. This was followed by initiatives in several other cities to demonstrate bus fleets for public transportation. The Govenment supported some pre-studies, but none of the projects were realized. Durung the 70 ´s and 80 ´s the focus was on hydrogen powered combustion engines. The interest in fuel cell vehicles started to increase at the end of the 90 ´s, as it did in many other countries. At that time some large fuel cell programmes were initiated, based on the Swedish competence that had been built up during many years of research. As a result two fuel cell companies were founded. The increased interest at this time also resulted in that demonstrations were planned in several cities, e. g. Sundsvall, Malmö, Göteborg, Visby, Stockholm and Karlstad. Two of the projects have been realized. The first was located to Malmö where the first Swedish hydrogen refueling station was inaugurated in 2003 and a hythane bus fleet has been demonstrated since then. The second was the CUTE-project in Stockholm where the first fuel cell busses were demonstated during 2003 - 2005. Some reflections can be made on the Swedish hydrogen history. (1) There have been activities in the field during at least 45 years. (2) Most of the activities can be caracteriezed as technology studies or research, while there have not been so many demonstrations. (3) In most cases <b>the</b> first <b>intiative</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate vehicles have come from small local actors, while the majority of projects that have been realized have been strongly supported by large actors. (4) Several times there have been very high expectations from the project participants on the potential of hydrogen as an economically competitive fuel. These projects would probably have had a better chance of succeeding if smaller fleets had been investigated. (5) The amount of actors in the field has been limited and the most of them know each other. Therefore it might have been hard for new actors to enter the network. (6) The Swedish Government has on several occations defined hydrogen as a fuel interesting only in a longer timeframe. That may have contributed to a situation where it have been difficult for the authorities and companies to make priorities and long term commitments...|$|R

She claims that in the Italian context it has been necessary to highlight discriminatory language practices against women and promote non-stereotypical and non-sexist language uses. She also maintains that more time is necessary to translate a non-heteronormative framework into linguistic practices, although some progress has been made.

40|$|Aim: This paper analyses, in {{what way}} psychiatrists {{considered}} housing and work as criteria of social integration of mentally ill people and what models of care were suggested in Germany throughout the 20 th century. Method: Publications in 29 German professional and scientific psychiatric journals through the complete period from 1900 to 2000 and monographs were searched for papers on the above issues. Results: Until {{the second half of}} the century, integrative initiatives related to housing and work generated in asylums without the aim of a full social integration of the patients. In the activistic concept of NS-psychiatry, work became an obligation for patients and a criterion for selection that decided on life and death. Not until the late 1950 s, there again was an orientation towards integration in psychiatric care in both German states. Whilst already in 1963 the â 8 ̆ 09 ̆eRodewisch Thesesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d outlined recommendations for the rehabilitation of the mentally ill already in the GDR (East Germany), a similar mark of reform ideas was published in the â 8 ̆ 09 ̆eenqueteâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d in the FRG (West Germany) in 1975. In <b>the</b> GDR <b>intiatives</b> were limited <b>to</b> a small number of locations. In the FRG and the re-unified Germany various forms of sheltered housing and work were established - also with significant regional variation. However, a clear discussion of underlying aims and implications for the structure of mental health care was not found in the psychiatric literature. Conclusions: In the 20 th century a tradition of psychiatric ideas related to housing and work did not develop in Germany. Particularly, there were only sporadic contributions from university psychiatry. Work was more frequently explicit subject of discussions than housing. Both areas were - slowly and in discontinuity - established as criteria of integration of people with mental illnesses, which was increasingly accepted as an aim of mental health care...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe International Celestial Reference Frame's current realization, the ICRF- 2 (Ma et al, 2009), has the {{potential}} to be improved in several ways. In order to achieve this potential in time for comparisons with ESA's optical Gaia mission, the IAU has formed the ICRF- 3 working group with the goal of producing the next generation ICRF by its 2018 General Assembly. With Gaia aiming for sub- 100 μas precision for quasars in its frame, our goal for the ICRF- 3 is to achieve sub- 100 μas precision in the radio for as many sources at as many observing bands as possible. This talk will review <b>the</b> <b>intiatives</b> underway which collectively form our roadmap for achieving these goals. VCS-II: Noting that ~ 2 / 3 of the ICRF- 2 's 3414 sources have been observed in only 1 or 2 sessions (mostly the VLBA Calibrator Survey (VCS)) which produced median precisions of 620 / 1120 μas in RAcosDec/ Dec, respectively, we have instigated a collaboration to re-observe the VCS sources using modern systems which are 5 times more sensitive than the original VCS system. This will allow the VCS sources to have precision more nearly comparable to the other ICRF sources. High Frequency radio: Noting that comparison of radio frame to the Gaia optical frame will require an accurate undersanding of frequency dependent changes in source morphology (source structure) and frequency dependent opacity effects (core shift), we are encouraging the construction of 100 μas precision radio frames at multple radio frequencies such as X/Ka (8. 4 / 32 Ghz), K-band (~ 24 GHz) and Q-band (43 GHz). Southern coverage: Noting that all current radio frames have poorer spatial covereage and precision in the southern hemisphere, we are encouraging increased astrometric observations from the southern hemisphere. Observations using stations from Australia, South Africa, and Argentina are currently being organized. Frame consistency: Noting that Celestial Reference Frames are often used in combination with other frames such as the planetary emphemeris, the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP), and the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) which are of keen interest to geodesists and planetary scientists, a key ICRF- 3 goal is to maintain and improve consistency with these other frames. This component of the work will study various combination techniques such as multi-technique data combinations for EOPs and TRFs, combined radio frames, and various modelling improvements such as galactic abberration...|$|R
