5|$|In mid-1806, Cabell learned <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{father was}} sick. Not long after, however, he {{received}} word <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father was improving {{and expected to}} meet him in Virginia {{en route to the}} capital. Although a rendezvous location had not been set, he assumed it would be in Lynchburg, where the Breckinridges had relatives. In October, he traveled to his uncle Lewis Breckinridge's home to wait for his father, but he never came. Disappointed, he returned to Princeton for the beginning of the new term, unaware <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father's recovery had been short-lived. Later he learned <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father had attempted to leave Cabell's Dale on October 22 but collapsed off his horse and returned to his sick bed; he died December 14, 1806.|$|E

5|$|Rosenberg left a will {{in which}} he {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> body be cremated using quicklime.

6000|$|... "He's all right," [...] said Wyatt, {{answering}} for himself. [...] "He's got a {{habit of}} talking to one {{as if he were}} a prince of the blood dropping a gracious word to one of the three Small-Heads at the Hippodrome, but <b>that's</b> <b>his</b> misfortune. We all have our troubles. <b>That's</b> <b>his.</b> Let's go in here. It's too far to sweat to Cook's." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Look here, Leyton," [...] said Rushbrook, {{suddenly}} and abruptly facing him; [...] "Jack Somers has brains, knowledge of society, tact, accomplishments, and good looks: <b>that's</b> <b>HIS</b> capital {{as much as}} mine is money. I employ him: <b>that's</b> <b>his</b> advertisement, recommendation, and credit. Now, {{on the strength of}} this, as you say, Miss Nevil is willing to invest in him; I don't see what more can be done." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Lor, no!' The Sidneys don't marry. They keep. <b>That's</b> <b>his</b> fourth since--to my knowledge. He was a takin' {{man from}} the first.' ...|$|R
5|$|After {{four years}} in Wakaw, Diefenbaker so {{dominated}} the local legal practice <b>that</b> <b>his</b> competitor left town. On May 1, 1924, Diefenbaker moved to Prince Albert, leaving a law partner {{in charge of the}} Wakaw office.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> planned Shakespeare ceiling (in {{imitation}} of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E
5|$|After the stage, Boucher {{was thrown}} out of the race by his team. He had {{recently}} been told <b>that</b> <b>his</b> contract would not be renewed and had disobeyed team orders not to go in the day's breakaway.|$|E

5|$|Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana {{selected}} Rakotomavo {{to succeed}} him and assigned the child to be the guardian of his sacred zebu herd. Members of the powerful Tsimahafotsy clan of Ambohimanga declared <b>that</b> <b>his</b> throne name would be Andriambelomasina.|$|E
5|$|As word {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing the fact <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{eight years as}} governor may be nullified by its distance in time and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> visibility in the Senate was low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may {{be more inclined to}} line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E

5|$|Barbette (birth name {{cited as}} Vander Clyde and Vander Clyde Broadway) {{was born on}} December 19, 1899, (although it is {{sometimes}} cited as 1904) in Texas.

His Draft Registration Card, dated 7 September 1918, states <b>that</b> <b>his</b> birthday was 19 December 1898.|$|E
5|$|Barr {{reflected}} on the campaign {{in an interview with}} Reason shortly after the election. He explained <b>that</b> <b>his</b> campaign's inability to gain access to donor lists hindered the campaign's fundraising capacity. In April 2009, he commented <b>that</b> <b>his</b> exclusion from the presidential debates prevented his campaign from gaining significant traction. Barr has stated that he will not run for public office in the future.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi's {{exposure}} to motorsport started at around 3 {{years of age}} through karting and was facilitated by the fact <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father owned a kart track. Since age 17, Bianchi was professionally managed by Nicolas Todt.|$|E

5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect <b>that</b> <b>his</b> life was going to change forever and <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Burton next argued <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{prosecution}} {{violated the}} Double Jeopardy Clause. Specifically, Burton argued <b>that</b> <b>his</b> acquittal {{on the third}} count in the first trial barred his conviction on the third and seventh counts in the second trial. The Court rejected this argument. The Court held that the earlier and later counts did not describe the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{interest}} of others needn't trouble it much!" [...] Miriam declared. [...] "If Mr. Dormer has broken off {{his marriage to}} such an awfully fine woman--for she's that, your swell of a sister--it isn't for a ranting wretch like me. He's kind to me because <b>that's</b> <b>his</b> nature and he notices me because <b>that's</b> <b>his</b> business; but he's away up in the clouds--a thousand miles over my head. He has got something 'on,' as they say; he's in love with an idea. I think it's a shocking bad one, but <b>that's</b> <b>his</b> own affair. He's quite exalté; living on nectar and ambrosia--what he has to spare for us poor crawling things on earth {{is only a few}} dry crumbs. I didn't even ask him to come to rehearsal. Besides, he thinks you're in love with me and that it wouldn't be honourable to cut in. He's capable of that--isn't it charming?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he has; but he didn't mean to. That alley is a lonesome little pocket {{that runs}} {{along one side}} of the New Gadsby. <b>That's</b> <b>his</b> hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. He's taken. He's {{in one of}} {{the strong}} cells in Newgate. He defended himself as well as he could, but was {{overpowered}} by numbers. <b>That's</b> <b>his</b> message.' ...|$|R
