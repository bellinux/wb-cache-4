[...] The episode also maintains a common Homicide trait of combining tragedy, like the devastated response by Adena Watson's family to her murder, with scenes of dark comedy, like Jessie Doohen's claim that she endured a miserable 60-year marriage because, [...] "We made a promise we wouldn't get a divorce until all the children were dead." ...|$|E
