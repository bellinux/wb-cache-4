5|$|The current {{trend of}} {{enhancing}} {{security at the}} cost of passenger and baggage handling efficiency at international airports is expected <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> the future.

5|$|At 21:50 the British {{artillery}} opened fire, and the Germans {{responded with}} their own artillery and mortars which forced most of the British to take cover, for the next fifteen minutes, until a lull in the German fire allowed them <b>to</b> <b>continue.</b> <b>In</b> the lead 'C' Company had crossed the start line at 22:00, however all its officers and the company sergeant major (CSM) became casualties and a senior non-commissioned officer took command of the company.

5|$|By around 1981 in the UK, {{the future}} for Concorde looked bleak. The British {{government}} had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen <b>to</b> <b>continue.</b> <b>In</b> 1983, BA's managing director, Sir John King, convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned British Airways for £16.5million plus the first year's profits. British Airways was subsequently privatized in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's {{record as}} CEO {{was subject to}} some dispute among Wall Street analysts. A 1998 merger between Halliburton and Dresser Industries {{attracted}} the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton's lack of accounting transparency. Although Cheney is not named as an individual defendant in the suit, Halliburton shareholders are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging that the corporation artificially inflated its stock price during this period. In June 2011, the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed the case <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> litigation. Cheney was named in a December 2010 corruption complaint filed by the Nigerian government against Halliburton, which the company settled for $250 million.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
5|$|Continued work {{displayed}} {{a number of}} minor problems, and {{the decision was made}} to introduce a redesigned unit with significant improvements in packaging, insulation, and other practical changes. This would become the AI Mk. V, which began to arrive from Pye in late February and immediately demonstrated a host of problems. By this time the microwave units were being designed, and the Mk. V was almost cancelled. A contract for over 1,000 units was allowed <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> case of delays in the new units. By May the issues with the Pye design were ironed out, and the FIU's testing revealed it to be superior to the Mk. IV, especially in terms of maintenance. An RAE report agreed.|$|E

Techniques in analyzing the data used descriptive analysis, the first and second hypothesis used partial correlation and the third hypothesis used regression that was started by normality, linearity, and intercorrelation testing. This study shows that: (1) there was positive and significant correlation between parents’ social status with willing <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> their study <b>in</b> university level; (2) there was positif and significant correlation between learning achievement of automotive subject with willing <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> their study <b>in</b> university level; and (3) there was positive and significant correlation between parents’ social status and learning achievement of automotive subject with willing <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> their study <b>in</b> university level...|$|R
5|$|German {{forces in}} Stalingrad {{soon began to}} run out of supplies, some {{soldiers}} were forced to live on horse meat. By the end of 1942, the distance between the German 6th Army and forces outside of the encirclement was over , and most of the German formations in the area were extremely weak. Hitler's insistence in holding Stalingrad to the last risked the existence of the 6th Army. The end of the German offensive also allowed the Red Army <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> its efforts to cut off German forces in the Caucasus, which would begin in the middle of January. On the other hand, the encirclement of the 6th Army and the operations to destroy it tied down a considerable number of Soviet troops, which affected Soviet operations on other sectors.|$|E

5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E
