Bolt and his teammates won the 4 × 100 metres relay in 37.58 seconds – a Commonwealth Games record. This was the foremost competition of the year for Bolt, given no Olympics or World Championships in 2014.|$|E

He spontaneously stole <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> is completely unrelated to every other crime that happened. He indeed stole <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> now tries {{to find a way}} to make it work. Fandorin takes a look at the paper Yan signed earlier and finds out it is a contract of disposal for <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b> This was necessary, as <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> is only told to work when in hands of its rightful owner. Fandorin supposes Slyunkov should give it a try. Slyunkov turns it white side towards him and does the ritual. Nothing happens, much to Slyunkov's despair. Fandorin tells Faddey to get <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> back to where it belongs and Masa helps him go out. Alone with Faddey Slyunkov tries slapping himself with the white side of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> is surprised to see it work: as he pulls the helmet off, his hair turns black, he became younger and healthier. Faddey refuses to do the same. Relieved, Slyunkov gives Faddey <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> runs away, ecstatic.|$|R
5|$|At first distraught at leaving Montreal, Dutton quickly {{adapted to}} playing in New York.

He was not able to turn the Americans' fortunes on the ice around, however, as the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in his first five seasons with the team.|$|E

Galatasaray fans attempted to provoke the Arsenal fans in the bars, and the two sides began chanting at each other until bottles were thrown from both sides around 16:00.

5|$|After {{the audio}} launch, the {{positive}} {{reception of the}} song Chinni Chinni Aasalu prompted the makers to release a video featuring {{the making of the}} song. Shot in the backdrop of a village, the song featured Nagarjuna dressed as a farmer while Shriya Saran was dressed as an innocent villager. On the other hand, the video showcased the recording of the song by Shreya Ghoshal. The video too received positive response. A still featuring Chaitanya and Samantha in an intimate sequence from the flashback was re-tweeted many times by <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> Telugu film websites. A short teaser, 31 seconds long, was unveiled on 13 May 2014, in which Samantha was seen speaking about Nageshwar continuously at a doctors' check up and the montage of the film's male leads being played side by side.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{was popular}} with <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> media {{and made the}} NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league. He was {{frequently}} involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he spat on a young girl while attempting to spit at a heckler, and as in 1993 when he declared that sports figures {{should not be considered}} role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness {{to become one of the}} NBA's most dominant rebounders. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, lack of {{popularity}} with <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> a fall out with Lorenzo Sanz resulted in Capello being sacked, and Vicente del Bosque eventually taking over in November of that year. The squad was also largely {{different from the}} previous squad: the budding young talent of Raúl, Iker Casillas, Fernando Morientes and Guti being supported {{with the arrival of}} Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado, and Iván Helguera and the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro and Roberto Carlos. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the European Cup/Champions League for the eight time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl. This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.|$|E
50|$|As {{bypass ratio}} increases, the mean radius ratio of <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> {{low-pressure}} turbine (LPT) increases. Consequently, if <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> is to rotate at its optimum blade speed the LPT blading will spin slowly, so additional LPT stages will be required, to extract sufficient energy to drive <b>the</b> <b>fan.</b> Introducing a (planetary) reduction gearbox, with a suitable gear ratio, between the LP shaft <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> enables both <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> LP turbine {{to operate at}} their optimum speeds. Typical of this configuration are the long-established Honeywell TFE731, the Honeywell ALF 502/507, and the recent Pratt & Whitney PW1000G.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> JT15D <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> blows about 70% of the {{air into}} the bypass duct, {{producing}} most of the overall thrust. On JT15D-4 models and above {{there is a small}} [...] "booster" [...] axial stage just behind <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> which is running at the same speed as <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> directing <b>the</b> remaining 30% {{of the air}}flow into the engine core. This air is further compressed by the centrifugal stage, and burned in a reverse-flow annular combustor. The hot gases flow through a [...] "high-pressure" [...] turbine that drives the centrifugal stage, and then two more turbines driving <b>the</b> <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> booster.|$|R
50|$|After the {{extermination}} of the Luan clan by Duke Ding's great-grandfather Duke Ping, {{the state of}} Jin had been dominated by the six powerful clans - Fan, Han, Zhao, Wei, Zhonghang, and Zhi.

Seven years later, in 490 BC the combined Jin forces decisively defeated <b>the</b> <b>Fan</b> <b>and</b> Zhonghang clans, whose leaders <b>Fan</b> Jishe <b>and</b> Zhonghang Yin fled to the State of Qi. From then on Jin would be dominated by the remaining four clans, three of which would partition Jin into the new states of Han, Zhao, and Wei during the reign of Duke Ding's son Duke Chu of Jin.|$|R
5|$|Soon afterward, however, McCarthy leaves Homer {{for another}} client. Without McCarthy {{to keep him}} in shape, Homer starts eating again and gains all the weight back. Homer can no longer fit into his costume or even his trailer, and the movie begins to go over budget. The studio {{executives}} and Comic Book Guy worry that the film will not be successful. The final version of the movie features scenes with the fat Homer and the physically fit Homer merged, upsetting and confusing the audience. After the premiere of the film, McCarthy returns and offers to get Homer into shape again, which Homer accepts. The studio executives offer to let Comic Book Guy direct the sequel, on the condition that Comic Book Guy lie to <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> say he liked the film. Though pleased by the offer, Comic Book Guy rejects it and openly criticizes the movie online, and thus it becomes a box office failure and Everyman is never adapted again.|$|E
5|$|Tanahashi next tried a Rainmaker, which Okada {{countered with}} one of his own and scored a nearfall. Although Okada {{attempted}} the Rainmaker three more times, Tanahashi countered with a bridging straitjacket German suplex, a bridging dragon suplex, a series of dragon-screw legwhips, and three High Fly Flows. The first was a crossbody while Okada was on the ropes; the second a frog splash to a seated Okada, and the third another frog splash, after which Tanahashi scored a pinfall on Okada to retain the title at 30 minutes and 57 seconds. Okada wept as he left the ring, and Tanahashi shouted that his opponent had {{a long way to go}} before becoming the New Japan ace. Tanahashi closed the show, thanking <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> performing his air guitar routine.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} delayed {{numerous}} times before its actual release. Work {{on the game}} was extended because the development staff wanted to perfect the game due to high expectations from <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> because the team only consisted of about 35 people. Before its release, it was ranked as the most wanted game in Japan and Square, knowing about Dragon Quest VII's release, moved Final Fantasy IX {{to come out on}} a later date. Horii stated in an interview that the team focused more on puzzle solving than the game's story. Being the first game in the series to include 3D graphics, the team was also initially reluctant to include CG movies and cinematics due to letters written to Enix by fans fearing that doing so would change the overall feeling of the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{title of}} the film, Thiruvilaiyadal, is {{justified}} {{in the beginning of}} the film as a voiceover. It begins with salutation to <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>and</b> it quotes the literary epic of Shiva, Thiruvilaiyadal. The narrator briefs that whatever Shiva does, it is to test the patiece of his disciples and the god plays games which invokes more devotion in the minds of his worshippers. Hence the title symbolically means the games played by Shiva. By opening in media res, the film follows a nonlinear narrative. According to Hari Narayan of The Hindu, Thiruvilaiyadal valorises the deeds of a god (Shiva) by narrating some miracles performed by him.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to <b>the</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>and</b> it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2016, Totti {{publicly}} criticised returning manager – and Rudi García's replacement – Luciano Spalletti in {{the media}} for his lack of playing time since his return from injury. He was subsequently dropped for Roma's 5–0 win over Palermo, with the decision causing an uproar among <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> {{in the media}}, while rumours once again began to circulate that Totti would be leaving the club once his contract had expired {{at the end of}} the season, as a result of his limited appearances and clashes with Spalletti. On 8 March, Totti came on as a substitute for Stephan El Shaarawy in the return leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League against Real Madrid, and was given a standing ovation by the fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid; Roma lost the match 2–0, however, and were eliminated from the competition following a 4–0 aggregate loss. On 20 April, he came off the bench in the 86th minute, one goal down to Torino at home to rescue the team with a brace; one in the 87th minute and a penalty in the 89th minute to win the match 3–2. With his 69th goal in Serie A from the penalty spot, he overtook Roberto Baggio as the outright top scorer of penalties in Serie A history. Totti's double also made him the oldest player in Serie A history to score two goals in a single league match, at the age of 39 years, 6 months and 23 days, breaking Silvio Piola's previous record of 39 years, 4 months and 2 days, which he had managed with Novara on 1 February 1953, after scoring a brace against his former team Lazio.|$|E
5000|$|The processor's {{heatsink}} is permanently attached, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> removable <b>fan</b> module {{is powered}} via spring-like metal prongs that connect to {{a trio of}} conductors {{on the surface of}} the chip.
