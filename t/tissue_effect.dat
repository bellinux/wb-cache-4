40|$|Even 32 {{years after}} its first {{introduction}} shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) remains a matter of discussion and controversy. Since the first SWL in 1980, millions of treatments have been performed worldwide. To this day SWL remains the least invasive of all stone treatments and is considered the treatment modality of first choice {{for the majority of}} urinary stones. Despite the massive scale on which SWL is performed {{in a wide range of}} indications, complication rate has always remained very low and usually limited to minor side effects and complications. The introduction of affordable multifunctional lithotripters has made SWL available to more and more departments of urology worldwide.

Urologists need proper skill and experience; however, to adequately administer shockwaves in order to improve outcome. This aspect is too often minimized and neglected.

Such solutions are however hypotonic so that excessive absorption {{can cause a}} number of complications including hyponatremia, a variable degree of hypo-osmolality, and certain solution-specific problems that are described below. Isotonic electrolyte-containing solutions cannot be used with monopolar energy because this leads to activation of ions that disperse the electric current and reduce the power density.

40|$|The 2 basic {{principles}} of laser therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), based on the final <b>tissue</b> <b>effect,</b> are laser vaporization and laser coagulation. In laser vaporization techniques, higher-density laser thermal energy is used; effects range from complete tissue vaporization to incision, resection, or enucleation of the obstructing prostatic tissue.

The urethral preservation and lack of tissue evaporation/resection with ILC make this treatment different from conventional transurethral free-beam laser prostatectomy.

40|$|Abstract. Cryotherapy is a {{treatment}} modality {{that uses a}} technique to selectively freeze tissue and thereby cause controlled tissue destruction. The procedure involves placement of multiple small diameter probes through the perineum into the prostate tissue at selected spatial intervals. Transrectal ultrasound is used to properly position the cylindrical probes before activation of the liquid Argon cooling element, which lowers the tissue temperature below- 40 degrees Centigrade. <b>Tissue</b> <b>effect</b> is monitored by transrectal ultrasound changes as well as thermocouples placed in the tissue. The computer-based cryotherapy simulation system mimics the major surgical steps involved in the procedure.

40|$|Although {{arterial}} bifurcations {{are frequent}} sites for obstructive atherosclerotic lesions, the optimal approach to these lesions remains unresolved. Benchtop models of arterial bifurcations were analyzed for flow disturbances known to correlate with vascular disease. These models possess an adaptable geometry capable of simulating {{the course of}} arterial disease {{and the effects of}} arterial interventions. Chronic in vivo studies evaluated the effect of flow disturbances on the pattern of neointimal hyperplasia. Acute in vivo studies helped propose a mechanism that bridges the early mechanical stimulus and the late <b>tissue</b> <b>effect.</b> Side-branch (SB) dilation adversely affected flow patterns in the main branch (MB) and, as a result, the long-term MB patency of stents implanted in pig arteries. Critical to this effect is chronic MB remodeling that seems to compensate for an occluded SB. Acute leukocyte recruitment was directly influenced by the changes in flow patterns, suggesting a link between flow disturbance {{on the one hand and}} leukocyte recruitment and intimal hyperplasia on the other. It is often impossible to simultaneously maximize the total cross-sectional area of both branches and to minimize flow disturbance in the MB. The apparent trade-off between these two clinically desirable goals may explain many of the common failure modes of bifurcation stenting...|$|E

40|$|A {{generalized}} equation for cell survival or <b>tissue</b> <b>effects</b> after fractionated low dose-rate irradiations, {{when there}} is incomplete repair between fractions and significant repair during fractions, is derived {{in terms of the}} h- and g-functions of the 'incomplete-repair' (IR) model. This model was developed originally from the concept of 'dose equivalent of incomplete repair', assuming that the repair of radiation damage is an exponential function of time and that the cell survival curve can be described adequately by the linear quadratic (LQ) formalism. The generalized incomplete-repair equation is shown to be equivalent to an expression derived by Dale et al.

The model is critically dependent on alpha/beta, repair half-time, treatment time and interfraction interval, and should therefore be regarded primarily as a tool for the analysis of fractionation and dose-rate effects in carefully designed radiobiological experiments, although it should also be useful in exploring, in a general way, the feasibility of clinical treatment protocols using fractionated low dose-rate treatments...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{cancer patient}} {{survival}} and local tumor control from hadron radiotherapy warrant {{a discussion of}} potential secondary late effects from the radiation.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Obesity {{and type}} 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) significantly {{increase the risk of}} developing an arthritic condition. METHODS:We performed a review of literature on the pathophysiological mechanisms that underpin the relationships between obesity, T 2 D and osteoarthritis (OA). RESULTS:The pathophysiology of the link between obesity and OA is related to both the direct effect of excess mechanical loads being placed on the cartilage and to an adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>effect.</b> Adipocytes produce and release adipokines (e. g. leptin). They are also the seat of a local inflammatory reaction when the adipose tissue is ectopic (visceral vs. subcutaneous adipose tissue), and then systemic effects that add even more to a micro-inflammatory mechanism. In diabetics, insulin resistance can add to these mechanisms, which can damage cartilage, bone and synovial tissue. These all act together to reduce mobility in obese subjects and contribute to a vicious cycle centered on OA, especially when the obesity is predominantly abdominal and/or associated with T 2 D. DISCUSSION:Prevention of obesity-related OA must be the focus in high-risk subjects, such as those who are obese with metabolic syndrome>"metabolically healthy" obese, have T 2 D, and normal weight subjects with abdominal obesity (defined as waist circumference> 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women).

In this study we document the spatial, taxonomic, temporal and tissue-specific delta(13) C variability in 10 tree species of a temperate European forest. The Swiss Canopy Crane provided access to the three dimensional space within 55 trees 30 - 35 m high representing the genera Acer, Carpinus, Fagus, Prunus, Quercus, Tilia, Abies, Larix, Picea and Pinus. The results from six broad-leaved and four conifer species (seven deciduous, three evergreen) documented that the species effect was not significant in contrast to tissue-specific and spatial differences in the canopy. Year-to-year differences were not large but still significant. Our analysis confirmed {{a significant difference between}} delta(13) C of foliage collected in the upper and lower canopy, but revealed no systematic differences with respect to azimuthal directions in tree crowns of the broad-leaved trees, as opposed to the conifers, which show clear differences between the sun-exposed and the shaded side.

We report a pilot trial of vascular targeted photodynamic therapy to evaluate the effect on porcine renal tissue. Materials and Methods: Pigs underwent continuous infusion of WST- 09 (Negma-Lerads, Toussous le Noble, France) and concurrent illumination with interstitial laser at a wavelength of 763 nm to the lower pole of the kidney. Drug doses were 0. 5 to 1. 0 mg/kg and light doses were 100 to 200 J. Nuclear renography was performed on postoperative day 5. On postoperative day 7 arteriography, pyelography, computerized tomography of the abdomen and necropsy were performed. Results: Four of 7 animals completed therapy and all evaluations. Three animals died, including 1 of surgical complications and 2 of an anaphylactoid reaction to the Cremophor ® solvent in the compound. All kidneys in surviving animals functioned on nuclear renography. Renal function remained unchanged. No lesions or urine leakage was visible on imaging. On necropsy lesion size was 5 � 4 � 3 to 7 � 7 � 14 mm depending on the drug/light dose.

40|$|Little is {{understood}} about the complex process of synovial joint formation in early limb development. It {{has been shown}} that versican is highly expressed in the extracellular matrix of these joints (Snow et al., 2005; Shepard et al., 2007) and the knockdown of versican leads to malformation of the interzone, tissues that form the articular cartilage and synovial cavity (Nagchowdhuri et al., 2012). It is also thought that these effects impact gene expression in cells that are involved in the developing joint. Versican is chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. It has four functional-modules: the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal domain, and GAG-[alpha], and GAG-[beta] chondroitin sulfate attachment regions. The N-terminal domain is also known as the G 1 domain and the C-terminal domain is also known as the G 3 domain (Kimata et al., 1986 and Zimmerman et al., 1989). In previous studies versican protein expression has been reduced and the G 1 domain has been over-expressed to observe how these changes in the developing joint <b>tissue</b> <b>effect</b> gene expression.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Histotripsy is a noninvasive, pulsed {{ultrasound}} {{technology that}} produces mechanically homogenized tissue within targeted volumes. Previous work has demonstrated prostatic tissue debulking in a canine model. The {{aim was to}} establish safety thresholds by evaluating histologic changes of urinary sphincter, neurovascular bundle (NVB), and rectum after targeted histotripsy treatment of these critical structures. Materials and Methods: Rectum, urinary sphincter, and NVB in five anesthetized canines were targeted for histotripsy treatment (50 total points). Locations received 1 k, 10 k, or 100 k acoustic pulses (4 microsecond, 1 -MHz) at a repetition frequency of 500 -Hz. Canine subjects were euthanized immediately (2), survived 3 days (1), or 2 weeks (3) after treatment. Prostates, periprostatic tissue, and rectum were harvested and processed for histology. Results: The sphincter was structurally intact with minimal muscle fiber disruption even after 100 k pulses (n= 10). Undamaged nerves, arteries, and veins of the NVB were seen despite mechanical homogenization of surrounding loose connective tissue (n= 19). The rectum, however, exhibited dose-dependent damage (n= 20). 1 k pulses yielded mild submucosal hemorrhage. 10 k pulses resulted in moderate collagen disruption and focal mucosal homogenization. 100 k pulses produced damage to the mucosa and muscularis propria with extensive hemorrhage and collagen disruption. One canine treated with 100 k pulses needed early euthanasia (day 3) because of complications from a urine leak. Conclusions: Histotripsy histologic <b>tissue</b> <b>effect</b> varied based on targeted structure with substantial structural preservation of NVB and sphincter. Rectal subclinical damage was apparent after 1 k pulses and increased in extent and severity with escalating doses.

40|$|Ang II plays a {{key role}} in {{cardiovascular}} regulation and participates in vascular pathobiology, including inflammation and remodeling. Whether these <b>tissue</b> <b>effects</b> are mediated by direct Ang II actions or indirectly as a result of its influence on hemodynamics is being debated. In vitro data have shown that Ang II induces vascular cellular transcriptional activation and gene expression, but the mechanisms explaining its long-term <b>tissue</b> <b>effects</b> in vivo are relatively unknown. Do the multiple in vivo vascular activities elicited by Ang II (such as inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular cell hypertrophy/proliferation) occur via independent pathways, or do common transcription mechanisms mediate these multiple effects?
