The dispute was eventually settled after police and officials from both Perth and the local area intervened and facilitated discussions between the opposing parties.

25|$|To {{land the}} cannon onto Tybee Island, {{artillery}} pieces were taken off transports, set on rafts at high tide, and pitched into the surf near shore. At low tide, manpower alone would drag the guns up the beach. <b>Two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> <b>fifty</b> men {{were required to}} move a 13-inch mortar along on a sling cart. Later Union amphibious operations would employ contraband labor {{for much of this}} work. Along the two-and-a-half mile front, their engineers had to construct almost a mile of corduroy road made of bundles of brushwood to keep the guns from sinking into the swamp. While offloading proceeded day and night according to the tides, Confederate bombardment from Fort Pulaski gunners required all Federal movement into the island limited to night time. After a month of work, 36 mortars, heavy guns and rifled cannon were in position.|$|E
25|$|Following the Rape of Belgium Caine edited King Albert‘s Book {{in support}} of the exiled King Albert of Belgium. It was Caine's idea and was {{published}} at Christmas 1914 by The Daily Telegraph.

In previous years Caine had edited several of these volumes already, the most recent for Queen Alexandra's charities in 1905 and 1908.

25|$|In the 19th century, silver Spanish dollar coins {{were common}} {{throughout}} Southeast Asia, the China coast, and Japan. These coins {{had been introduced}} through Manila {{over a period of}} <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>and</b> <b>fifty</b> years, arriving on ships from Acapulco in Mexico. These ships were known as the Manila galleons. Until the 19th century, these silver dollar coins were actual Spanish dollars minted in the new world, mostly at Mexico City. But from the 1840s, they were increasingly replaced by silver dollars of the new Latin American republics. In the later half of the 19th century, some local coins in the region were made in the resemblance of the Mexican peso. The first of these local silver coins was the Hong Kong silver dollar coin that was minted in Hong Kong between the years 1866 and 1869. The Chinese were slow to accept unfamiliar coinage and preferred the familiar Mexican dollars, and so the Hong Kong government ceased minting these coins and sold the mint machinery to Japan.|$|E
