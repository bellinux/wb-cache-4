40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2008. This study investigates {{relational}} <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> {{events and}} their outcomes reported to occur {{by students in}} college teacher-student relationships. Six hundred and forty college students {{were asked if they}} could identify a <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> event with a college teacher. Students who were able to recall a <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> event (n = 394) completed open- and closed-ended survey questions pertaining to their perception of the <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> event, outcomes of the event, and their learning and motivation. Analysis of participants' responses yielded six meta-level categories of <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> events: instrumental, personal, rhetorical, ridicule/discipline, locational, and other person. Analysis of participants' responses also yielded 11 categories of outcomes of relational <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> events. Findings revealed that 80 % of the reported events were perceived as positive, and 20 % were judged to be negative. The findings also reveal that students who reported personal and locational <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> events were more likely than not to report a change in their willingness to approach the teacher or seek help. Further, students who reported personal, locational, instrumental, and other person <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> events were more likely than not to report a change in perceptions of the relationship with the teacher. Finally, the results indicate that relational <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> events appear to affect students' cognitive learning, affective learning, and motivation. In particular, students who reported instrumental, personal, and locational <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> events also reported increased cognitive learning, affective learning, and student motivation. Further, students who reported ridicule/discipline <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> events reported decreased cognitive learning, affective learning, and student motivation...|$|R

5|$|Joan of Arc {{puts the}} player {{in command of}} the battered, bloodied and demoralised French during the Hundred Years War against England. At the {{beginning}} of the campaign, nearly every major and decisive battle fought by the French has always led to defeat to the English. In France's darkest hour though, a seventeen-year-old girl—Joan of Arc intends to save France by the command of God. She intends to drive the English from France forever. Her presence at the Siege of Orleans earns her the nickname 'The Maid of Orleans', and she earns the confidence of the uncrowned Dauphin Charles VII by being given command of the entire French Army, although the Dauphin's advisors begin to plot against Joan of Arc. At several <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> in the Hundred Years' War, namely the Loire Campaign where the entire English and Burgundian forces were cleared out, hope for a free France begin to inspire more men to join the fight under Joan of Arc.|$|E

According to a study by Zhang and Yang, China has reached the Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> by 2010, and cheap labor in the country has rapidly declined and real agricultural wages have substantially increased. However, other journals such as the China Economic Review claim that the Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> was not yet passed in China and that this was comparable to the Japanese historical experience in regard to how the Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> affected the economy. Despite its large population, in the early 2010s China has faced labor shortages and real wages have nearly doubled since 2003, such rapidly rising wages in regard to unskilled work is a key indicator that a country has reached the Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point.</b> A 2013 working paper by the International Monetary Fund predicts the Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> in China to “emerge between 2020 and 2025.” Piazza argues that a fast-growing economy that reaches the Lewis <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> can experience financial turmoil and a persistent downshift in growth prospects.|$|R

5|$|Both sides {{sought the}} decisive engagement, {{for which they}} had amassed, {{according}} to some estimates, between 70 and 90 percent of all galleys in existence in the Mediterranean at the time. The fleets were roughly balanced: the Ottoman fleet was larger with 300 ships to the 200 Christian ones, but the Christian ships were sturdier; both fleets carried some 30,000 troops, and while the Christians had twice as many cannons, the Ottomans compensated by a large and skilled corps of archers. On 7 October, the two fleets engaged in a battle off Lepanto, {{which resulted in a}} crushing victory for the Christian fleet, while the Ottoman fleet was effectively destroyed, losing some 25,000–35,000 men in addition to some 12,000 Christian galley slaves who were freed. In popular perception, the battle itself became {{known as one of the}} decisive <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> in the long Ottoman-Christian struggle, as it ended the Ottoman naval hegemony established after the Battle of Preveza in 1538. Its immediate results however were minimal: the harsh winter that followed precluded any offensive actions on behalf of the Holy League, while the Ottomans used the respite to hurriedly rebuild their naval strength. At the same time, Venice suffered losses in Dalmatia, where the Ottomans attacked Venetian possessions: the island of Hvar was raided by the Ottoman fleet, with the Turkish forces burning down the towns of Hvar, Stari Grad and Vrboska.|$|E
5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are {{whether or not the}} Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, and whether or not the battle was one of the <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate the Negev. Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not the Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E
