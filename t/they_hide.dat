In their aquatic habitats, <b>they</b> <b>hide</b> under vegetation, and on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E

Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human.|$|E

5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} and bred by zoos, {{but they are not}} a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, <b>they</b> <b>hide</b> from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet {{there is at least one}} example of a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E

Oscar panics and silences the phone, and Angela immediately realizes why.|$|E
5|$|Budapest Tales {{was even}} less {{successful}} than 25 Fireman Street {{at the box}} office and festivals. According to author David Paul, this may explain why Szabó shifted gears even more dramatically in his next film, Confidence (1980), in which historical events are represented straightforwardly, and are filtered through neither memory nor allegory. The film focuses on the relationship between a man and woman who are forced to share a room as <b>they</b> <b>hide</b> from the Arrow Cross {{toward the end of the}} Second World War. It garnered a Best Director award for Szabó at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards.|$|E

After the creature dies, the three return outside the church and Vincent describes the night sky as he envisions it.|$|E

25|$|Ground weta are {{classified}} in the genus Hemiandrus. About 40 species of ground weta occur in New Zealand, and several very similar ones are found in Australia.

Most of the Hemiandrus have not been described. <b>They</b> <b>hide</b> in burrows in the ground during the day, and those that live in open ground (e.g., H. focalis) conceal their exit holes with a specially made perforated door.

Corvids also move their food around between hiding places to avoid thievery, but only if they have previously been thieves themselves (that is, they remember previous relevant social contexts, use their own experience of having been a thief to predict the behavior of a pilferer, and can determine the safest course to protect their caches from being pilfered). Studies to assess similar cognitive abilities in apes have been inconclusive.|$|E
