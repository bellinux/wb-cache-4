5|$|Recumbent bicycles. Long-wheelbase recumbents {{require a}} good rear brake as the CG is near <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel)</b> the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> Mass over <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to lift the}} front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E
50|$|The system {{electronically}} controlled a rear rack {{that was}} behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> At low speeds (up to 35 km/h), <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> move in <b>the</b> opposite {{direction from the}} front wheels, aiding parking and U-turns by lowering the turning circle. Above these speeds, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> move in <b>the</b> same direction as the front, meaning control during high-speed maneuvers such as lane changes or cornering was improved. Either way, the turning angle of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> was slight at just 5°, a measurement Mazda determined to be optimally effective and natural to human sensitivity.|$|R
2500|$|... 3) Three-channel, three-sensor ABS: This scheme, {{commonly}} found on pickup trucks with four-wheel ABS, has a speed sensor and a valve {{for each of}} the front wheels, with one valve and one sensor for both <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> speed sensor for <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> is located in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> axle. This system provides individual control of the front wheels, so they can both achieve maximum braking force. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> however, are monitored together; they both have to start to lock up before the ABS will activate on <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> With this system, it is possible that one of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> will lock during a stop, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is easy to identify, as there are no individual speed sensors for <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Earlier HICAS {{versions}} used hydraulics {{to steer}} <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> hydraulic system was {{powered by the}} power steering pump and used speed sensors {{to determine how much}} and in which direction to steer <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{prevented}} from precessing {{as the front}} wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean {{as though it were}} not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
5000|$|As {{described}} earlier, SH-AWD {{can vary}} torque {{side to side}} through <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> This ability to drive one of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> with more power (remember the row boat analogy) is accomplished through overdriving <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> {{with respect to the}} front wheels. The Acura RL is designed with a third planetary gear set and clutch pack that are packaged into a so-called [...] "Acceleration Device", which is bolted in front of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> differential unit. [...] The Acceleration Device allows torque to be passed to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> at a near one to one ratio, but in cornering situations, the Acceleration Device variably increases the torque passed to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> up to 5%, depending on the cornering situation.|$|R
50|$|For {{driving in}} {{particularly}} challenging conditions, such as snow, the driver can select “4WD Lock” mode. In Lock mode, the system still apportions {{front and rear}} torque automatically, but enables greater power transfer to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> In dry conditions, 4WD Lock mode places priority on performance. More torque is directed to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> than in 4WD Auto mode to provide greater power off the line, better control when accelerating on snowy or loose surfaces, and enhanced stability at high speeds. <b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> torque transfer is increased by 50 percent over the amounts in 4WD Auto mode - meaning up to 60 percent of available torque is sent to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> under full-throttle acceleration on dry pavement. When in 4WD Lock mode, torque at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> is reduced by a smaller degree through corners than with 4WD Auto mode.|$|R
50|$|The wheels were {{independently}} sprung, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> being {{attached to}} a swing axle and supported by springs with hydraulic shock absorbers. All four wheels were connected to the foot brake via a hydraulic system, while the hand brake was a mechanical one operating on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> pods {{introduced}} to IndyCar in 2012 {{intended to prevent}} cars from becoming airborne when hitting another in the rear proved to be ineffective as there were major crashes resulting from such contact during the 2013 race in Houston involving Dario Franchitti and the 2017 Indianapolis 500 involving Scott Dixon. In addition the pods were often ripped from cars from light contact, placing hazardous debris on the track. As a result the rear pods were eliminated for 2018.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel,</b> is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E
5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip is greater than <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite {{the direction of the}} curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E
50|$|A Dana-Spicer 5-speed model 6453 {{synchromesh}} {{manual transmission}} {{had a very}} low 1st, direct 4th, and overdrive 5th. A Rockwell-Standard 2-speed transfer case also engaged the front axle automatically if <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> turned faster than the front, as when <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> spun, in any gear and any range.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an active}} four-wheel {{steering}} system, all four wheels {{turn at the}} same time when the driver steers. In most active four-wheel steering systems, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> are steered by a computer and actuators. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> generally cannot turn as far as the front wheels. There can be controls to switch off <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> steer and options to steer only <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> independently of <b>the</b> front wheels. At low speed (e.g. parking) <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> turn opposite to the front wheels, reducing the turning radius, sometimes critical for large trucks, tractors, vehicles with trailers and passenger cars with a large wheelbase, while at higher speeds both front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> turn alike (electronically controlled), so that the vehicle may change position with less yaw and improved build-up of the lateral acceleration, enhancing straight-line stability. The [...] "snaking effect" [...] experienced during motorway drives while towing a travel trailer is thus largely nullified.|$|R
2500|$|SH-AWD ("Super Handling" [...] All Wheel Drive) is a multi-vectoring all {{wheel drive}} system {{designed}} more for performance than for simply providing traction in adverse circumstances. While cruising, the system sends 90% of the power to the front wheels and 10% to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> Acceleration puts more torque on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>The</b> car can put up to 70% of the total available power to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to assist with rapid acceleration, and of that 70%, 100% can be pushed to either {{the left or right}} wheel in order to assist the vehicle through a corner.|$|R
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel,</b> greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
25|$|The next {{development}} of the bicycle, the penny-farthings, were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling. During its development from 1870 to 1878, there were various designs for brakes, most of them operating on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> However, as <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> became smaller and smaller, {{with more of the}} rider's weight over the front wheel, braking on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> became less effective. The front brake, introduced by John Kean in 1873, had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1937 {{this was}} the only {{permitted}} form of gear changing on the Tour de France. Competitors could have 2 sprockets on each side of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel,</b> but still had to stop to manually move the chain from one sprocket to the other and adjust the position of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> so as to maintain the correct chain tension.|$|E
50|$|Although SLS front brakes {{once used}} to be {{standard}} on early cars such as the Bedford CA, SLS brakes are now found only on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> of cars. <b>The</b> car's handbrake typically operates only <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> and when <b>the</b> vehicle is stationary on a slope prior to a hill start, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> SLS brakes are essential in arresting any rearward motion.|$|R
50|$|The brakes, with vacuum servo assistance, were on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> only.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{transmission}} was a three-speed manual system, {{driving through}} <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
25|$|Rear furrow wheel– It is <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> of the plough, {{which runs}} in the furrow.|$|E
25|$|Hypoid {{gears and}} a shaft turns <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel,</b> with the shaft housing forming {{the left side}} swingarm.|$|E
25|$|Second: The {{clutch pedal}} is {{unlatched}} and the clutch engaged. The brake pedal is pushed forward {{as far as}} possible setting brakes on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... {{the main}} hand brake acted on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> with drum brakes ...|$|R
50|$|The Phantom VIII is {{the first}} Rolls-Royce to be fitted with four-wheel steering. The system turns <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> in <b>the</b> {{opposite}} direction to the front wheels at speeds lower than 60 km/h to improve maneuverability. At speeds above this threshold <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> turn in <b>the</b> same direction as the front wheels to increase high-speed stability.|$|R
5000|$|The Quad had {{four-wheel drive}} and four-wheel brakes, {{as well as}} an {{innovative}} four-wheel steering system. This novel approach to steering allowed <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to track <b>the</b> front wheels around turns, such that <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> didn't have to dig new [...] "ruts" [...] on muddy curves (most roads of the day were unpaved and often badly rutted).|$|R
25|$|It is {{also common}} {{to use a}} larger {{diameter}} rotor on the front wheel and a smaller rotor on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> since the front wheel does the most braking (up to 90% of the total).|$|E
25|$|Wet {{multiplate clutch}} and {{five-speed}} constant mesh transmission. The gearbox is {{virtually the same}} as that fitted to Suzuki's GT750 water-cooled triple. RE5 final drive is by 630 chain via a 14-tooth drive sprocket and 43-tooth unit at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{such short}} wheelbase, {{motorcycles}} can generate enough torque at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and enough stopping {{force at the}} front wheel, to lift the opposite wheel off the road. These actions, if performed on purpose, are known as wheelies and stoppies (or endos) respectively.|$|E
5000|$|In late 1991, Audi {{unveiled}} the second Duo generation - likewise {{based on the}} Audi 100 Avant quattro. Once again this featured an electric motor, a [...] three-phase machine, driving <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> This time, however, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> were additionally powered via the Torsen differential from the main engine compartment, which housed a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine.|$|R
50|$|The driver {{can use a}} drive-mode dial on {{the center}} console to select “FWD” for best fuel economy; with “4WD Auto” mode selected, the system uses a {{rear-mounted}} electronically controlled transfer clutch to automatically and seamlessly route more power to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> depending on driving and road surface conditions. The driver can freely change the drive mode at any time. When “4WD Auto” mode is selected, the Outlander's 4WD system always sends some power to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> automatically increasing <b>the</b> amount under full throttle acceleration. The coupling transfers up to forty percent of available torque to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> under full-throttle acceleration, and this is reduced to twenty five percent over 40 miles per hour. At steady cruising speeds, up to fifteen percent of available torque is sent to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> At low speeds through tight corners, coupling torque is reduced, providing a smoother feel through the corner.|$|R
50|$|Only <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> had brakes until 1924, when four-wheel brakes were introduced.|$|R
