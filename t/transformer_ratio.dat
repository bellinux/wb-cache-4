40|$|The <b>transformer</b> <b>ratio,</b> {{characterizing the}} ratio of maximum {{accelerating}} field behind the drive bunch to the maximum decelerating field inside the drive bunch, {{is one of the}} key parameters for characterizing the performance of collinear wakefield accelerators. In this paper the use of electron drive bunches possessing a particular temporal profile (the double-triangular bunch) is shown to significantly increase the <b>transformer</b> <b>ratio</b> beyond 2, the limit for a symmetric bunch. The double-triangular bunch is generated using the emittance exchange technique [P. Emma et al., Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 9, 100702 (2006) ]PRABFM 1098 - 440210. 1103 /PhysRevSTAB. 9. 100702.

Versions of the structure could be used for acceleration of beams of electrons, positrons, muons, protons, or heavier ions; with either electron or proton drive beams. The structure embodies cavities that are excited in several harmonically related eigenmodes, such that rf fields reach their peak values only during small portions of each basic rf period. This feature could help raise breakdown and pulse heating thresholds. The two-beam accelerator structure comprises chains of these cavities. In this configuration, no transfer elements are needed to couple rf energy from the drive beam to the accelerated beam, since both beams traverse the same cavities. Purposeful cavity detuning is used to provide much smaller deceleration for a high-current drive beam, than acceleration for a low-current accelerated beam, i. e., to provide a high <b>transformer</b> <b>ratio.</b> A self-consistent theory is presented to calculate idealized acceleration gradient, <b>transformer</b> <b>ratio,</b> and efficiency for energy transfer from the drive beam to the accelerated beam, for either parallel or antiparallel motion of the beams.

Means for dramatically shortening the structure fill time are also described.

This rectangular 'mode-locked' resonator consists of three channels lined with low-loss dielectric slabs: the central wider channel is the drive bunch channel, whereas two adjacent narrow channels are used to accelerate electron and/or positron bunches; this provides a favorable <b>transformer</b> <b>ratio.</b> At the moment when, after reflecting from the resonator exit, the wakefield returns to the resonator entrance, the next bunch is injected into the resonator entrance. The length of the resonator is also chosen to be a multiple of half the desired wakefield wavelength. The rectangular geometry permits superposition of harmonics of wakefields in the resonator. The short length of the device and its planar configuration should allow management of beam breakup, and a lengthy drive bunch train can be dynamically stabilized by using a series of DWR units rotated about the z-axis in 90 ^∘ increments.
