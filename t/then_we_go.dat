500|$|New Media {{consultants}} and scientists Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman aided {{in the production}} of the episode. They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they [...] "come to us with questions: Is this possible? Where can we go with this? <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show." [...] For [...] "The Road Not Taken", he and Chiappetta were asked to again [...] "find a new and gruesome way to blow people up," [...] this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis. Chiappetta explained, [...] "They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up. So this is where we sort of leaned back into our mythology." ...|$|E
500|$|Houllier {{argued that}} his team paid Arsenal [...] "too much respect" [...] in the match and blamed his full-backs Xavier and Traoré for not {{providing}} width, adding: [...] "We need to have more flow in our game, more safety in our passing construction". Gerrard was unrepentant for tackling Vieira and stated {{he was trying to}} [...] "stamp [...] authority" [...] on the match. [...] He accepted defeat and was optimistic Liverpool had the means to win the Premier League: [...] "We'd rather they beat us in this game and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on to pick up the title. That's what we're really looking at. Even though they got the better of us yesterday, it doesn't mean they'll do better than us over the whole season." [...] Diouf insisted he should have earned a penalty in the second half, given he felt there was [...] "definite contact" [...] from a challenge in the penalty box: [...] "It was a penalty, definitely, but the referee is the master on the pitch and he didn't give it. I know the Arsenal players think I dived, but I didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2016, Marvel {{announced}} a new ongoing series titled The Unworthy Thor by Aaron and Coipel. The series follows the original Thor, who now refers to himself as Odinson, {{as he tries to}} find his purpose after relinquishing his name and title to Foster. Aaron stated that the series finds Odinson in a dark place explaining, [...] "He failed for a reason we still don't quite understand. He dropped the hammer and hasn't been able to pick it up since. So <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to a pretty dark place. A darker, more desperate, more driven version." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{trying to}} make it as big as possible... my band gets {{involved}} in some of the choreography. It's amazing that everybody sort of gets involved. We're all such teammates with each other when we're on that stage and we just all have such fun together. [...] And <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> into sort of a juke joint feel where we kind of you know, slash that with going to church [...] And then we open it up to a circus element (scene), so there's a – so there's quite a journey that goes on, on stage for my audience and as a performer. [...] But it all does have a tie together, so it all kind of makes sense. [...] You really just got to come see the show, all right. It's so much fun to put on and we have a blast with it".|$|E
2500|$|... {{this movie}} is about visuals. It's about excitement, it's about thrills. Don't worry about the script... I {{remember}} mentioning it to six or seven people that the script was trashy and I always got the same answer... The script doesn't matter. This movie is about visuals... <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to the first edit, the first cut of the movie in the screening room and it's [...] Iovine and me and Joel Silver... And about 20 minutes into the movie Jimmy turns {{to me and he}} goes... {{this movie is}} really shitty isn't it? It's really bad. I said, yeah, it's a really bad script. Why didn't anyone notice that the script was bad? It stinks. I can't even watch it... Joel's on the other side going, what am I gonna do next? There's gotta be a next project, and they're sitting there and there's so many lessons I learned during that movie. It went $14 million over budget, I think and I kept saying to Joel, how are they allowing this? 'Cause they kept screaming at us, it's over the budget. I said, how, and they, you've gotta understand, they built all, Walter Hill didn't want to go to Chicago. The story took place in Chicago, so they built Chicago in LA.|$|E

2500|$|Richie {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with This Morning that Kat and Alfie would be involved in an ongoing storyline, which he said is [...] "going to be the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps." [...] At the end of 2010, Kat and Ronnie both give birth on the same day, but Ronnie's baby, James, dies and while Kat is in hospital and her baby, Tommy, is unattended, Ronnie swaps the infants. The storyline received over 6,000 complaints, making it the second most complained about EastEnders storyline. It was then decided to end the storyline earlier than originally planned. It was reported by the Daily Star Sunday that Ronnie experiences a change of heart after visiting relatives in hospital and seeing the midwife who delivered her son. An EastEnders spokesperson said, [...] "We do not comment on future storylines but we have always said Ronnie will {{do the right thing and}} Tommy will be reunited with Kat." [...] Wallace revealed that she doesn't regret her involvement of the baby-swap storyline, saying that she was [...] "just doing her job". Wallace told Bang Showbiz:"I stand by it. We're actors at the end of the day, we do our job and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> home. It's drama, that's it." [...] She also praised Womack's acting and vowed to move on to [...] "bigger and better things" [...] after she departed. She added: [...] " [...] a fantastic actress who played a brilliant role in a fantastic storyline so I wish her all the best." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And I am {{not afraid}} of it. Things will come about as God wills it, and what He wills must in the end be the best. If we live, then we have this memory in common.
