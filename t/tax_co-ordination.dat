40|$|Il coordinamento tra sistemi impositivi è una questione originaria e tipica del diritto comunitario. La tesi ne esplora le conseguenze sotto più aspetti. Income tax systems' {{co-ordination}} is {{a relatively}} recent issue in the globalizing economy. In fact, a tendence to <b>tax</b> <b>co-ordination</b> begins, essentially, with the EU Law. Since 2006, European Institutions feel the urgence to solve problem of double imposition and non imposition phenomena left unsolved by the member states themselves, or by means of Double Taxation Conventions (DTCs). The <b>tax</b> <b>co-ordination</b> envisages means to do so. The theme is firstly envisaged by the unilateral and bilateral perspective, underlining the deficiencies of sovereignity methods in fronting the economies' integration problems. The theme is then pointed out by the perspective of EU Law. At a first level, by considering tax systems co-ordination methods envisaged by the Directives in matter of group-taxation. Then, monitoring the outgoing of co-ordination considered by three EU Communications dated 19 December 2006 (respectively targeted to the general problem of <b>tax</b> <b>co-ordination,</b> to the co-ordination between member states upon exit taxation, to the co-ordination upon consideraton of intra-EU losses). The issue is also considered by {{the point of view}} of the European Court of Justice. In this perspective, it's relevant to estabilish whether the ECJ has the power to compel the member states to structure each other their income tax systems, based on the application of the EU freedoms, with a view – in particular – to exit taxation policies, to intra-EU losses: a theme strictly linked to the view that is optioned out for the interpretation of EU non-discrimination clause (an overall approach facing the opposite per-country approach). ...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this master thesis is the German tax system {{which is a}} {{relatively}} complicated entity. The aim of this thesis is to provide the updated and practical information useful for the Czech exporters and for their business activities in Germany. The thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter describes the main export features from the Czech Republic to Germany. Next chapter analyses the different legal forms of companies that {{can be set up}} in Germany. The third chapter presents the process of the <b>tax</b> harmonisation and <b>co-ordination</b> within the EU. Next two chapters create the practial part of the master thesis. Particular types of both direct and indirect taxes are object of the fourth chapter. Finally, the last chapter applies the theoretical knowledge gained from the previous parts of the thesis in form of examples and situations from the tax practice and real business life of the entrepreneurs who export their goods and services to Germany...|$|R

40|$|In this {{normative}} {{study of}} fiscal competition mechanism, we allow for various schemes of taxation, various mobility of tax-base, non-identical regions, and nonbenevolent governments. We examine the fundamental trade-o® between “negative externalities” {{of the competition}} and benefits from its budget discipline. Some indicators of regional “rivalry” and “non-benevolence” are constructed for diagnosing marginal “over-taxing” in any region. It enables also “in-large” comparison of fiscal regimes. Under some restrictions on the country’s heterogeneity in tax rates, marginal “over-taxing” at competition signifies that switching to certain sort of <b>tax</b> <b>co-ordination</b> would deteriorate welfare. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{gains from}} international <b>tax</b> <b>co-ordination.</b> Focussing on capital income taxes in a two country model, the main {{result is that}} gains from co-ordination, or from tax harmonisation, are by far smaller than is normally assumed if the countries tax capital income according to the residence principle. In particular, we show that equilibria under this tax regime are constrained Pareto-optimal {{so that there are}} never gains for both countries. With residence taxation, tax rate harmonisation accompanied by inter-governmental transfers only redistribute income from the low tax country to the high tax country. This pictures changes, however, when the capital exporting country applies the source principle instead of the residence principle. ...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission {{proposed}} to provide multinational companies with a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) for their EU wide activities. The main {{goal of this}} proposal is the removal of existing tax obstacles to cross-border economic activity which are mainly caused by the coexistence of 27 national tax systems. This paper reviews the European Commission’s proposals and the underlying rationale. It addresses {{some of the key}} issues that arise when considering the design of the CCCTB. Among the issues under investigation are the definition of the consolidated group, the scope and technique of consolidation, the territorial scope of the consolidated tax base, the treatment of companies joining and leaving the CCCTB, and related issues.

40|$|This paper reexamines {{the main}} {{findings}} of Cardarelli et al. [Cardarelli, R., Taugourdeau, E., Vidal, J. -P., 2002. A repeated interactions model of tax competition, Journal of Public Economic Theory 4, 19 - 38], and Catenaro and Vidal [Catenaro, M., Vidal, J. -P., 2006. Implicit <b>tax</b> <b>co-ordination</b> under repeated policy interactions, Recherches Economiques de Louvain 72, 1 - 17], who show that regional asymmetries undermine the implicit collusion of tax coordination in a repeated game model of capital tax competition. In particular, this paper investigates how increased regional differences {{in per capita}} capital endowments and/or production technologies affect the willingness of each region to cooperate in achieving tax coordination. It is shown that there may exist cases where as regional asymmetries in net capital exporting positions increase, regions {{are more likely to}} cooperate on capital taxes and thereby achieve tax coordination.

40|$|The {{advanced}} level of integration among EU member states, the single currency {{about to be}} introduced, global business activities and liberalization of the capital market are the prime movers in attempts to improve <b>tax</b> <b>co-ordination</b> within the EU. Efforts to reform taxes at national level, while highly advisable in cases such as the excessive tax burden on labor, are increasingly self-defeating because of their negative competitive impact. Empirical observations find that mobile tax bases, especially company locations and financial capital, are increasingly good at removing themselves from national taxation. This {{may result in a}} growing tax burden to be borne by less mobile tax bases, especially payrolls. Such a development is unfavorable if not outright detrimental to employment and equity of taxation. The EU Commission has made a renewed effort to deal with this major problem, achieving its first success by adopting its Code of Conduct on Business Taxation. But the Code will need to be put in practice to see whether EU member states are seriously endeavouring to escape the prisoner's dilemma and potential tax competition.

40|$|Taxation {{is high in}} EU countries. Tax-to-GDP ratios {{stand at}} around 40 % {{compared}} with 25 % in Japan and the US. This high level of taxation provides the funding of the European social model characterised by {{a high level of}} public expenditure and transfers. Apart from governing powers (armed forces, police, justice), the State provides free services to households (education, health); finances public infrastructures, research, culture; pays significant social transfers (family policy, minimum income) and social insurance (pensions, unemployment). Ageing populations imply higher pensions and health spending; technical progress leads to higher education and research spending; rising social exclusion implies higher assistance benefits. People ask for more public infrastructure and higher security spending. Military spending as well as aid to developing countries seem to be required if countries wish {{to play a major role}} internationally. All these elements make the rising trend in public spending difficult to resist. Besides, European countries think that public spending should be on a contributory basis. It makes sense to have people on highest incomes or wealth pay more for collective spending, as they benefit most from the way the social system is organised. Taxes must reduce income inequalities. It is hence crucial for European countries to remain entitled to collect tax revenues, according to democratically agreed rules. Section 2 discusses how the European social model is at risk in a global world; it discusses several strategies for European taxation: competition, unification, coordination. Section 3 provides a descriptive analysis of tax structures and trends in Europe. Section 4 deals with income tax coordination. Section 5 addresses social contributions coordination. Section 6 deals with corporate taxation. Section 7 concludes with a strategy for <b>tax</b> <b>co-ordination.</b> ...|$|E
