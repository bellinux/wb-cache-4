The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching {{from the mouth of the}} Dee to the mouth of the Wye. Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>which</b> country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy.

He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E

Brazil's representatives were once again drawn into Group 3, together with Olimpia and Cerro Porteño, whom Atlético faced {{for a second time}} in a group stage of the Libertadores. The two encounters between the Brazilian clubs ended 22, and both won two and drew two matches against the Paraguayans, meaning Atlético and Flamengo were tied on points.

5|$|In 1720 {{the first}} Act of Parliament to {{authorise}} {{improvements to the}} river was obtained by three gentlemen of Cheshire.

Rates for tolls were set, which were to be reduced by 20 per cent once the cost of construction had been met, and profits were then {{to be used to}} maintain bridges and highways within Cheshire. Each year the Justices of the Peace were to meet <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>which</b> structures should benefit from this source of revenue. The Act included powers to improve the Witton Brook from the Weaver to Witton Bridge. Following a plea by the owner of brine workings near Middlewich, who felt they would be disadvantaged by the new navigation, a separate Act was obtained on 7 June 1721 to authorise improvements to the River Dane, but did not result in any work being undertaken.|$|E

In March 1844 — following a dispute with a federal bureaucrat — Smith organized the secret Council of Fifty. Smith said the Council had authority <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>which</b> national or state laws Mormons should obey.
