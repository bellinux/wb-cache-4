40|$|Complementary {{medicine}} (CM), {{defined as}} health care which lies {{for the most part}} outside the mainstream of conventional medicine, is gaining popularity in Britain and elsewhere. In the UK the most prevalent therapies are manipulation (used by 36 % of the population), herbalism (24 %) homoeopathy (16 %) and acupuncture (16 %). Due to the heterogeneity of CM, it is often problematic to generalize. The debate about the usefulness of CM is often regrettably emotional, and thus unproductive.

50|$|In {{developmental}} psychology, developmental {{systems theory}} (DST) is an overarching theoretical perspective on biological development, heredity, and evolution. It emphasizes the shared contributions of genes, environment, and epigenetic factors on developmental processes. DST, unlike conventional scientific theories, {{is not directly}} used to help make predictions for testing experimental results; instead, {{it is seen as}} a collection of philosophical, psychological, and scientific models of development and evolution. As a whole, these models argue the inadequacy of modern evolutionary views on the roles of genes and natural selection as the principle explanation of living structures.

40|$|The need to {{be aware}} of children’s {{existing}} ideas is expressed by Ausubel (1968, p. iv) in his well known adage: “The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows; ascertain this and teach him accordingly”. Many of the views and conceptions held by learners differ from those commonly accepted by scientists. These views are often designated <b>as</b> <b>misconceptions</b> <b>of</b> alternative conceptions. While in recent years there has been a growing interest in identifying <b>misconceptions,</b> the bulk <b>of</b> the studies reported are related to physics, leaving many topics in chemistry largely ignored. IN the present study, two such concepts from the area of chemistry, namely molecules and atoms, were investigated. [...] Three groups of ten students from grade 12 (16 - 17 year olds) constituted the total sample of 30 students. Subjects were grouped as Academic-Science, Academic-Non-Science, and Non-Academic Non-Science according to their participation in science and their overall average. A semi-structured interview guide was developed and used to elicit subjects’ conceptions relation to the fundamental characteristics of molecules and atoms. Questions were asked relating to the structure, composition, size, shape, weight, bonding, and energy of molecules using a waters molecule as the example. A second group of questions focused on the structure, shape, size, weight, and animism of atoms. In each case, subjects’ misconceptions were identified and then examined to see how the misconceptions differed among the three groups. [...] All interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. The interview data served as the starting point for the establishment of conceptual inventories for individuals, the construction of tables summarizing the common misconceptions, and descriptive summaries of the findings for each content area. [...] The data suggest that students hold a wide range <b>of</b> <b>misconceptions</b> relating to the fundamental characteristics of molecules and atoms, and that many <b>of</b> the <b>misconceptions</b> identified parallel historical ideas of science. Other outcomes of the study include the observation that many <b>of</b> the <b>misconceptions</b> are common to all three groups, that the students from the Academic Science group exhibited the broadest range <b>of</b> <b>misconceptions,</b> but on average exhibited a lesser number <b>of</b> <b>misconceptions.</b> Overall, the Academic Science students had a better understanding of the concepts involved than did the Academic Non-Science and Non-Academic Non-Science students. [...] Misconceptions were identified for each of the sub-types relating to molecules and atoms. Specific misconceptions relating to molecules included: Water molecules contain components other than oxygen and hydrogen; water molecules are large enough to be seen with the naked eye; water molecules have different sizes and shapes; water molecules are large enough to be physically weighed; and that temperature is the factor which affects molecular shape. Specific misconceptions relating to atoms included the belief that atoms are solid spheres with all of their components inside, that all atoms weigh the same, and that they are alive...|$|R

40|$|M. A. The role of volunteerism in South Africa {{and more}} {{particularly}} in the welfare system tends to be underestimated. Possible reasons are {{that the value of}} volunteers is lost due to bad management and utilisation, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>misconceptions</b> <b>of</b> what “volunteerism” is and who the “volunteer” is. Another reason is that the relationship between social workers and volunteers is based on preconceived ideas and distrust. Greater awareness and broadening of the concepts “volunteerism” and “volunteer” are needed to describe the nature of volunteerism. Welfare organisations are also forced by cutbacks in state subsidies as well as having a broader client system (communities) to find more creative ways to deal with these challenges. The transformation process regarding social work that came into being in 1994 led to the implementation of a national welfare policy in 1997. This shifted the focus to social development. On ground level the focus shifted to an integrated community development approach and intervention strategies that focus on prevention, empowerment and development to a level of self-help. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the nature of volunteerism within the context of the new dispensation, since 1994 and develop guidelines for the establishment of a formal volunteer programme. A qualitative approach, using an inductive strategy, was followed to achieve the aim of the study. Since 1994 the scope of literature regarding the nature of volunteer work within the context of the new dispensation in South Africa, as well as the development of a national volunteer policy and a formal volunteer programme for the welfare system seems to be non-existing. The study focuses on the social work practice as departure point in exploring the research theme. A focus group discussion, in-depth interviews and semi-structured interviews were conducted with social workers and management of welfare organisations on the West Rand and in Pretoria and also with two experts in the field of volunteerism, from Cape Town and Nelspruit. Results focused on the nature of volunteer work as part of the welfare organisations’ community development programmes and projects. Through the interviews and the focus group discussion, intensive explorations of the respondent’s own reality regarding the subject in the social work practice was possible. The data was gathered by means of transcribed audiotapes. The researcher and a co-coder both did colour coding and through the use of a schedule, categories were created. Patterns appeared from which central themes were extracted as the result of the study. The results were compared to a relevant literature control.
