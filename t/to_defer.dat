5|$|Her {{determination}} sometimes caused clashes {{of wills}} with Charles. In most matters of patronage, Mary had <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> to Charles, {{which is why}} his relations in this area were not much better with Mary than with their aunt Margaret. He often criticized her decisions, which negatively affected their otherwise affectionate relationship.|$|E
5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope for permission <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> serial publication by three months. As Trollope had {{agreed not to}} allow another of his novels to run serially {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E
5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans. Borrowers were then allowed <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> paying interest on the loan {{until the end of}} the period, when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due. These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|E

5|$|A $30,000 supersedeas bond {{was issued}} in August 1965 as the United Bond Insurance Company {{continued}} to dispute {{the payment of}} Kinne's original $25,000 bond. The supersedeas bond allowed the company <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> payment of the $25,000 bond until a ruling on the matter was handed down by the Missouri Supreme Court, but when that court upheld the bond's forfeiture, the $25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965. The United Bond Insurance Company later filed suit against Kinne's family to recover {{the cost of the}} bail, lawyer's fees, and searching for Kinne after her escape.|$|E
5|$|A secret {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} M. W. Kellogg for engineering studies in July 1941. This included the design and construction of a ten-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December 1942, the Manhattan District contracted Kellogg to design, build and operate a full-scale production plant. Unusually, the contract did not require any guarantees from Kellogg that it could actually accomplish this task. Because {{the scope of the}} project was not well defined, Kellogg and the Manhattan District agreed <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> any financial details to a later, cost-plus contract, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million.|$|E

5|$|The Eleventh Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union {{delivered}} a disappointing result: {{a change in}} growth from 5 to 4%. During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, they had tried to meet the target of 6.1% growth, but failed. Brezhnev was able <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> economic collapse by trading with Western Europe and the Arab World. The Soviet Union still out-produced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era. Another dramatic result of Brezhnev's rule was that certain Eastern Bloc countries became more economically advanced than the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The Kenyan government's attempt <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> {{the cases}} at the ICC by {{appealing}} {{to members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, represented by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. The Kenyan government's application to Pre-Trial Chamber II that the two cases were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's stance, and a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural address}} was a {{detailed}} {{statement of the}} Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing paper currency (Henry Clay's American system); <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's spoils system of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{deferred}} tax which is an important accounting area because it affects the amount of disposable profit. The theoretical part describes the income tax and explains the difference between current and deferred tax. It specifies the accounting legislation of the Czech Republic and International Financial Reporting Standards which relate <b>to</b> <b>deferred</b> tax. It analyzes the center and meaning of deferred tax, describes titles that lead to its creation. It explains the process of calculation, accounting and reporting of deferred tax. The practical part deals with titles leading <b>to</b> <b>deferred</b> tax, calculation, accounting and reporting of deferred tax in the given company. It refers to the effect on profit and profitability of the given company {{which is part of the}} analysis of deferred tax of the last three accounting periods...|$|R

Dantley {{was unhappy}} relegating the {{leadership}} {{role on the}} Pistons to Isiah Thomas, while Aguirre had clashed with his coaches and teammates in Dallas. Aguirre was more amenable <b>to</b> <b>deferring</b> <b>to</b> Thomas, and accepted his role in Chuck Daly's system. His ability to shoot the three, post up, run the floor, and pass {{was instrumental in the}} growth of the team.|$|R
5|$|Tisch was {{technically}} the team's co-chief {{executive at}} first, however given {{his lack of}} football knowledge he chose <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> to Wellington Mara on football decisions in his initial seasons with the club. Although he later took {{a more active role}} in making decisions related to the football side of the team, in general, Tisch concentrated on the financial aspects, while Mara focused on the on-field product.

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1538, {{shortly before}} the Catholic Duke Georg of Saxony died, a {{religious}} colloquy was convened in Leipzig to discuss potential reforms within the Duchy. The Electorate of Saxony sent Melanchthon, and Philip of Hesse sent Bucer. The Duchy itself was represented by Georg Witzel, a former Lutheran who had reconverted to Catholicism. In discussions from 2 to 7 January 1539, Bucer and Witzel agreed <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> controversial points of doctrine, but Melanchthon withdrew, feeling that doctrinal unity was a prerequisite of a reform plan. Bucer and Witzel agreed on fifteen articles covering various issues of church life. Bucer, however, made no doctrinal concessions: he remained silent on critical matters such as the mass and the papacy. His ecumenical approach provoked harsh criticism from other reformers.|$|E
5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E

5|$|Ginsburg {{was in the}} {{minority}} for Gonzales v. Carhart, , a 5–4 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with the veracity of the findings. Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue. She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.|$|E
5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} that he would have <b>to</b> <b>defer</b> part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E

He became a schoolteacher, teaching first at Tragowell in the Swan Hill district, and then at Fine View State School in the Horsham district. In 1911 he entered Trinity College at the University of Melbourne. After failing an exam in deductive logic, he decided to quit the state school system, and in 1912 took up a position at The Armidale School in the New England district of New South Wales. In 1914 he moved to the prestigious Melbourne Grammar School.|$|E

Porto Alegre was incapable of submitting his forces to foreign direction and was unwilling to comply with orders issued by the allied commander. Nor was the situation among the allied forces improved once Porto Alegre and Tamandaré found common ground in their distaste for the Brazilian commander of the 1st Corps, Field Marshal Polidoro Quintanilha Jordão (later the Viscount of Santa Teresa).
