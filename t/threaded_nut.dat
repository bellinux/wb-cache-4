5000|$|In {{mechanical}} design, the prototypical [...] "male" [...] {{component is}} a threaded bolt, but an alignment post, a mounting boss, or a sheet metal tab connector {{can also be}} considered as male. Correspondingly, a <b>threaded</b> <b>nut,</b> an alignment hole, a mounting recess, or sheet metal slot connector is considered to be female.|$|E
50|$|Threaded Coupling {{interconnect}} mating designs use a <b>threaded</b> <b>nut</b> on the plug, and {{a corresponding}} set of threads on the receptacle,to mate {{the pair of}} components. The coupling nut is usually equipped with flats or knurling for easy assembly. Different thread types, profiles andgeometries provide different functionality. Buttress Threads, for example, are often specified on plastic connectors due to their enhanced tensile strength.The MIL-C-38999 connector incorporates a triple-start threaded coupling mechanism for greater vibration protection and faster mating and unmating.|$|E
50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical planetary roller screw are the screw shaft, nut and planetary roller. The screw, a shaft with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the screw and encapsulated by a <b>threaded</b> <b>nut.</b> The thread of the screw is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction transmission elements between screw and nut. The rollers typically have a single-start thread with convex flanks that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with screw and nut. The rollers typically orbit the screw as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as planetary, or satellite, rollers. As with a lead screw or ball screw, rotation of the nut results in screw travel, and rotation of the screw results in nut travel.|$|E
50|$|Spark plugs are {{specified}} by size, either <b>thread</b> or <b>nut</b> (often {{referred to as}} Euro), sealing type (taper or crush washer), and spark gap. Common <b>thread</b> (<b>nut)</b> sizes in Europe are 10 mm (16 mm), 14 mm (21 mm; sometimes, 16 mm), and 18 mm (24 mm, sometimes, 21 mm). In the United States, common <b>thread</b> (<b>nut)</b> sizes are 10mm (16mm), 12mm (14mm, 16mm or 17.5mm), 14mm (16mm, 20.63mm) and 18mm (20.63mm).|$|R

5000|$|Drain rods are {{plumbing}} equipment used {{to attempt to}} unblock drains and sewers. The set normally consists of several stiff, but flexible, rods, each approximately one meter long, which may be screwed together end-to-end. The material is often polypropylene heavy gauge tubing. Jointing of the plastic to metal is done in hydraulic presses and these joints are the achilles heel of this rod type. Often, when subjected to force, the joint breaks. Better quality ends have securing pins through the differing materials. More expensive rods are high tensile steel. End connections are often brass or steel, the better steel type having cadmium plating for corrosion resistance. Two types of threaded end can be purchased. Cheaper ones simply screw together, male to female but have the disadvantage of needing one-way rotation in use to prevent unscrewing. Better quality rods have their ends formed into a square peg, mating in a matching square hole in the adjacent rod. A captive <b>threaded</b> <b>nut</b> then screw locks both lengths together making a firm joint. A spanner tightens the joint firmly.|$|E

In the open condition a screw threaded member (8) can be moved inside the nut (1) without turning. In figure 1, the sliding nut halves (1 A, 1 B) are closed by the action of a cam (6) on half 1 B. In figure 7, the pivoted nut halves (1 A, 1 B) are closed by engaging the end (15) of a lever (14) in a recess in the half 1 B. Further possible improvements include a detachable handle (7) and a means for locking the nut (1) and the cam (6) in the closed position...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aerospace}} field spacecraft components are {{held together by}} separation systems until a specific time when they must be separated or deployed. Customarily a threaded joining bolt engages one of the components to be joined, and a <b>threaded</b> <b>nut</b> is placed on that bolt against the other component {{so they can be}} drawn together by a releasable locking assembly. The releasable locking assembly herein includes a plunger having one end coupled to one end of a plunger bolt. The other end is flanged to abut and compress a coil spring when the plunger is advanced toward the interface plane between the two components. When the plunger is so advanced toward the interface plane, the end of the plunger bolt can be connected to the joining bolt. Thus during retraction the joining bolt is drawn {{to one side of the}} interface plane by the force of the expanding spring...|$|E

50|$|An interfering <b>thread</b> <b>nut</b> {{is a type}} of locknut {{that has}} an {{undersized}} root diameter. This creates an interference between the nut and the fastener, plastically deforming the threads on the fastener. Due to this deformation they are usually only used on permanent or semi-permanent installations.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} of this nut is the tapered <b>thread</b> <b>nut.</b> It utilizes a [...] thread {{to achieve the}} interference. The nut goes on easily, because the thread diameter starts at a standard size; as the <b>nut</b> is further <b>threaded</b> on it begins to lock, much like a distorted thread locknut.|$|R
50|$|A basin wrench, {{sometimes}} called a sink wrench, is a plumbing tool {{that is used}} in confined spaces to turn fasteners that would be difficult or impossible to reach with a plumber wrench or other types of wrenches. For example, the <b>threaded</b> <b>nuts</b> used to secure faucets to sinks are often located in deeply recessed places {{that can only be}} accessed with a basin wrench.|$|R

50|$|Most {{trailers}} have {{a separate}} axle for each wheel, like those used on a bicycle. These separate axles usually mount directly on the frame using either <b>threaded</b> <b>nuts,</b> a quick-release mechanism, or some press fit arrangement. The use of separate axles for two-wheel trailers allows the load carrying area to be between the wheels with its base below the axles, so as to keep the centre of gravity relatively low.|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{are that}} most {{are not very}} efficient. Due to the low efficiency they cannot be used in continuous power transmission applications. They also have {{a high degree of}} friction on the threads, which can wear the threads out quickly.

40|$|The {{construction}} of furniture corner joints is often {{carried out by}} assembling double <b>thread</b> (“Trio”) <b>nuts</b> and metal corners. Such connections are particularly suitable for disassemble bal structures and these connections are also used for savings in transport when all the structural elements are transported in boxes and furniture is prepared for in site assembly. The assembly process consists of fastening the binding metal corners to wooden elements with the metric thread screws. To achieve the optimal quality of these joints, the production process must {{comply with the requirements}} of various products including the loading applications and strength of individual wood species. This paper examines the fundamental factors affecting the quality of such joints. Special attention was paid to the process of screwing and loading capacity of double <b>thread</b> <b>nuts</b> in three different types of wood. Optimization of the technological process was set as the ultimate goal aimed at achieving a high level of product quality. Tests have been conducted on fi r, beech and oak wood to determine optimal bore diameters and nut screwing parameters relative to the screwing resistance, extraction force and the time interval required for nut screwing...|$|R

5000|$|A nut {{is a type}} of {{fastener}} with a <b>threaded</b> hole. <b>Nuts</b> {{are almost}} always used in conjunction with a mating bolt to fasten multiple parts together. The two partners are kept together by a combination of their threads' friction (with slight elastic deformation), a slight stretching of the bolt, and compression of the parts to be held together.|$|R
50|$|A D-sub {{contains}} {{two or more}} parallel rows of pins or sockets usually surrounded by a D-shaped metal shield that provides mechanical support, ensures correct orientation, and may screen against electromagnetic interference. The part containing pin contacts is called the male connector or plug, while that containing socket contacts is called the female connector or socket. The socket's shield fits tightly inside the plug's shield. Panel mounted connectors usually have <b>threaded</b> <b>nuts</b> that accept screws on the cable end connector cover that are used for locking the connectors together and offering mechanical strain relief. Occasionally the nuts may be found on a cable end connector if {{it is expected to}} connect to another cable end (see the male DE-9 pictured). When screened cables are used, the shields are connected to the overall screens of the cables. This creates an electrically continuous screen covering the whole cable and connector system.|$|R

50|$|January 31, 2000: Flight 261, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, {{plunged into}} the Pacific Ocean near Point Mugu, California while {{preparing}} to attempt an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport en route from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and Seattle, killing all 88 people on board. In its final report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined {{the cause of the}} accident to be failure of acme <b>nut</b> <b>threads,</b> which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the horizontal stabilizer's trim system. The failure of the acme <b>nut</b> <b>threads</b> happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) approval of those intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme <b>nut</b> <b>threads</b> on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident. This incident, along with an earlier ValuJet Flight 592 crash, led to closer FAA oversight of airline maintenance operations. The accident was also the subject of episode 5, season 1, of the documentary series, Mayday.|$|R
50|$|In normal use, a nut-and-bolt joint holds {{together}} because the bolt {{is under a}} constant tensile stress called the preload. The preload pulls the <b>nut</b> <b>threads</b> against the bolt <b>threads,</b> and the <b>nut</b> face against the bearing surface, with a constant force, so that the nut cannot rotate without overcoming the friction between these surfaces. If the joint is subjected to vibration, however, the preload increases and decreases with each cycle of movement. If the minimum preload during the vibration cycle {{is not enough to}} hold the nut firmly in contact with the bolt and the bearing surface, then the nut is likely to become loose.|$|R
50|$|The {{sprinkler}} head pivots on a bearing {{on top of}} its <b>threaded</b> attachment <b>nut.</b> The head is driven in a circular motion {{by the force of}} the outgoing water, and at least one arm extends from the head. The sprinkler arm is repeatedly pushed back into the water stream by a spring. The arm's striking the water stream scatters the stream and re-orients the flow slightly, enabling a uniform watering area around the sprinkler.|$|R
5000|$|An Impact Sprinkler (sometimes {{called an}} [...] impulse sprinkler) {{is a type}} of {{irrigation}} sprinkler in which the sprinkler head, driven in a circular motion by the force of the outgoing water, pivots on a bearing on top of its <b>threaded</b> attachment <b>nut.</b> Invented in 1933 by Orton Englehardt, it quickly found widespread use. Though it has in many situations been replaced by gear-driven [...] "rotor heads", many varieties of impact sprinkler remain in use.|$|R
