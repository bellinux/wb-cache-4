500|$|As Lee {{continued}} his offensive at Gaines's Mill to the east, McClellan played a passive role, taking no initiative {{and waiting for}} events to unfold. He kept two thirds of his army out of action, fooled again by Magruder's theatrical diversionary tactics. That night, he decided to withdraw his army to a safer base, well below Richmond, on {{a portion of the}} James River that was under control of the Union Navy. In doing so, he may have unwittingly saved his army. Lee had assumed that the Union army would withdraw to the east toward its existing supply base and McClellan's move to the south delayed Lee's response for at least 24 hours. But McClellan was also tacitly acknowledging that he would {{no longer be able to}} invest Richmond, the object of his campaign; the heavy siege artillery required would be almost impossible to transport without the railroad connections available from his original supply base on the York River. In a telegram to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, reporting on these events, McClellan blamed the Lincoln administration for his reversals. [...] "If I save this army now, I tell you plainly I owe no thanks <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>or</b> to any other persons in Washington. You have done your best to sacrifice this army." [...] Fortunately for McClellan, Lincoln never saw that inflammatory statement (at least at that time) because it was censored by the War Department telegrapher.|$|E

Performed [...] "as a prayer for deliverance from [...] pain and suffering," [...] lyrically, [...] "God Help the Outcasts," [...] a song about faith, explores themes such as discrimination. Additionally, “God Help the Outcasts” [...] "touches on a basic idea behind most faiths." [...] Asking [...] "was Jesus [...] not an outcast, too, as [...] sees firsthand how her people, are persecuted for their differences," [...] the first verse of the song reads, [...] "I don't know if You can hear me/Or if You're even there/I don't know if You would listen/To a gypsy's prayer." [...] Teen Ink observed, [...] "This part is about how it seems like God doesn't listen <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>or</b> help you, {{no matter how much}} you pray or talk to him." [...] Finally, asking people to be kind and unselfish, Esmeralda sings, [...] "Please help my people, the poor and downtrodden/I thought we all were the children of God.” In The Gospel According to Disney, author Mark I. Pinsky drew similarities between [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] and the Christian hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," [...] as both songs explore [...] "the love of God that knows no bounds." [...] Midler's shorter rendition, considered a reprise of Mollenhauer's original, features modified lyrics, replacing [...] "to a gypsy's prayer" [...] with [...] "to a humble prayer." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{night of}} June 27, McClellan ordered his entire army to {{withdraw}} to a secure base at Harrison's Landing on the James River. His actions have puzzled military historians ever since. The Union army {{was in a}} good position, having withstood strong Confederate attacks while only deploying one of its five corps in battle. Porter had performed well against heavy odds. Furthermore, McClellan was aware that the War Department had created a new Army of Virginia and ordered it {{to be sent to}} the Peninsula to reinforce him. But Lee had unnerved him, and he surrendered the initiative. He sent a telegram to the Secretary of War that included the statement: [...] "If I save this Army now I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>or</b> any other persons in Washingtonyou have done your best to sacrifice this Army." [...] (The military telegraph department chose to omit this sentence from the copy given to the Secretary.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Other accusations centred {{around the}} fact that Booth {{appointed}} his own children to posts for which others were better qualified, leading to claims that The Salvation Army was a Booth family-business. For example, he appointed his daughter Emma Booth as the Principal of the Officers' Training Home, The Salvation Army's first training school for women {{when she was just}} 19. Others believed that Booth was creating a dynasty, as was suggested by {{the fact that}} he insisted that his sons-in-law added 'Booth' to their own names (see Frederick Booth-Tucker and Arthur Booth-Clibborn). This was further borne out when Booth appointed his son, Bramwell Booth, as his successor as General in his will. However, William Booth had once said to his children that [...] "The Salvation Army does not belong <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>or</b> to me, it belongs to the world" [...] and was very wary of the leadership of the Army becoming a dynasty.|$|E
