So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they have every right <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, Common Sense Media {{released}} {{a white paper}} compiled from existing research on body image perceptions in kids and teens.

500|$|Few male {{respondents}} {{had engaged in}} childhood sex play, {{and it did not}} seem to be important in the development of homosexuality. Homosexual men were less likely to report having enjoyed boys' activities such as football and to see themselves as having been very masculine while growing up, but more likely to report having enjoyed stereotypical girls' activities. Three variables (dislike of typical boys' activities, enjoying typical girls' activities, and feelings of masculinity or femininity) were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity", which proved to be the most important developmental variable. It appeared to make male respondents less likely to feel attraction to the opposite sex during childhood, but more likely to feel sexually different from other boys, experience homosexual arousal and activities, and become homosexual as adults. Homosexual men were more likely to recall having felt different from other boys their age, or to say that they felt different because they did not like sport, or because they were not interested in girls or were sexually interested in other boys. They were also more likely to report feeling different because they had stereotypical feminine traits or interests. Feeling different during childhood appeared to be irrelevant, but feeling different for gender reasons during adolescence had [...] "modest total effects". Boys who felt sexually different were more likely to become homosexual as adults, whether they began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> during childhood or adolescence. While homosexual men were more likely to have been labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, this apparently played no significant role in the development of sexual orientation.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{sad thing}} for Hilda to find this moral enigma propounded to her conscience; and <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that,</b> {{whichever}} <b>way</b> she might settle it, {{there would be a}} cry of wrong on the other side. Still, the idea stubbornly came back, that the tie between Miriam and herself had been real, the affection true, and that therefore the implied compact was not to be shaken off.|$|R

2500|$|Upon arriving, {{they find}} their door is open, {{suggesting}} a burglar {{is inside the}} house. Bart fetches Homer a makeshift weapon made from a cinder block tied to a chain that he calls [...] "The Defender". Homer swings it around to threaten the burglar, but when the family smells apple pie, they discover it is actually Homer's mother, Mona Simpson. Mona says that her days of activism are over, and that she is staying for good. When she asks if Homer will forgive her, a shaken Homer angrily replies that he will not, {{because of all the}} times she left him as a child. Homer explains that he feels hurt and abandoned when Mona is not around, and does not want <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> again. Later that night, Mona tries to explain to Homer she has changed her ways, but, again Homer does not listen. Afterwards, Homer realizes he should have listened to his mother, and makes her a card as an apology: when he goes downstairs to apologize, he sees her {{sitting in front of the}} fire, and asks if she is asleep. When he then notices and questions that she is [...] "sleeping with her eyes open", her head slumps down and Homer realizes that she has died.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{corporate}} {{interest in the}} film surrounding its theme of promoting understanding between different groups, and its inclusion of violence and threats of greater conflict along with the romance of Pocahontas and John Smith, Schwartz became heavily involved in the storytelling. Bannerman estimated that he spent a week {{with one of the}} screenwriters and helped work out the overall themes of tolerance and cooperation. In June 1992, Schwartz researched Jamestown, Virginia where he absorbed the atmosphere and bought tapes of Native American music and English sea shanties and other music from the early seventeenth century that helped inspire numbers in the film. Schwartz modeled his lyrical writing for people of other ethnicities on that of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick. [...] "Colors of the Wind" [...] was the first song to be written for the film. Gabriel, Goldberg, and Pentecost insisted that the song help define the film's [...] "heart and soul". Schwartz began [...] "Colors" [...] with a few draft ideas for lyrics taking inspiration from Chief Seattle's letter to the United States Congress. Then, Menken wrote the melody with Schwartz listening at the piano and making suggestions. Schwartz would add lyrics before a session together where they were refined. [...] "Just Around the Riverbend", also composed by Menken and Schwartz, was devised by Schwartz's wife Carole, with the idea that Pocahontas would have a recurring dream that suggested something coming her way, paving the way for her [...] "I want" [...] song. The song almost did not make it into the completed film when Disney executives doubted whether her song would have the kind of impact they wanted at that point. However, Schwartz stated he and Menken [...] "believed in it very strongly. Indeed, at one point we wrote a different song for that spot, but Alan and I were never as happy with the second song and ultimately everybody at Disney came <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> too." ...|$|E

50|$|By 1982, the {{takeover}} was complete and American General began approaching {{companies such as}} MCA, Marriott Corporation and Anheuser-Busch about a possible sale of the remainder of WSM, Inc. While many of the companies showed interest {{in one of the}} assets, such as the theme park alone or the radio station, none was willing to buy the entire complex. American General began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> sell WSM, Inc. would be to split it up into separate entities.|$|R

No one ever loved me before--no man, I mean, in that way. And it is sweet to be loved--that way. You know what I mean, mother dear. It is sweet to feel that you are really and truly a woman." [...] She {{buried her face in}} her mother's lap, sobbing. [...] "You think I am dreadful, I know, but I am honest, and I tell you just how I feel." ...|$|E
5000|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder. Codependents of narcissists {{are sometimes}} called co-narcissists. Narcissists, with {{their ability to}} get others to [...] "buy into their vision" [...] and help them make it a reality, seek and attract partners who will put others' needs before their own. Codependents can provide the narcissist with an obedient and attentive audience — the perfect backdrop for a self-absorbed narcissist. Among the reciprocally interlocking interactions of the pair are the narcissist's overpowering need <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> important and special and the co-dependent person's strong need <b>to</b> help others <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R

60|$|The truth was, {{that the}} ill-success of my {{inquiries}} had in no sense daunted me. I had pursued {{them as a}} matter of duty, and I had expected nothing from them. In the state of my mind at that time, it was almost a relief to me to know that the struggle was now narrowed to a trial of strength between myself and Sir Percival Glyde. The vindictive motive had mingled itself all along with my other and better motives, and I confess it was a satisfaction <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the surest <b>way,</b> the only way left, of serving Laura's cause, was to fasten my hold firmly on the villain who had married her.|$|R
60|$|You complimented Mr. Rogers on his energy, his foresightedness, complimented him {{in various}} ways, {{and he has}} {{deserved}} those compliments, although I say it myself; and I enjoy them all. There is one side of Mr. Rogers {{that has not been}} mentioned. If you will leave that to me I will touch upon that. There was a note in an editorial in one of the Norfolk papers this morning that touched upon that very thing, that hidden side of Mr. Rogers, where it spoke of Helen Keller and her affection for Mr. Rogers, to whom she dedicated her life book. And she has a right <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> because, without the public knowing anything about it, he rescued, if I may use that term, that marvellous girl, that wonderful Southern girl, that girl who was stone deaf, blind, and dumb from scarlet-fever when she was a baby eighteen months old; and who now is as well and thoroughly educated as any woman on this planet at twenty-nine years of age. She is the most marvellous person of her sex that has existed on this earth since Joan of Arc.|$|E

I {{made up my mind}} I wouldn't ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> myself, though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and {{in less than two years}} he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn't see it. Pap told me. But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.|$|E

A deep flush overspread his face; {{she could see her}} sharpness had at last penetrated. This immediately had a value--classic, romantic, redeeming, what did she know? for her; [...] "the strong man in pain" [...] was one of the categories of the human appeal, little charm as he might exert in the given case. [...] "Why do you make me say such things to you?" [...] she cried in a trembling voice. [...] "I only want to be gentle--to be thoroughly kind. It's not delightful to me to feel people care for me and yet to have to try and reason them out of it. I think others also ought to be considerate; we have each to judge for ourselves. I know you're considerate, {{as much as you can}} be; you've good reasons for what you do. But I really don't want to marry, or to talk about it at all now. I shall probably never do it--no, never. I've a perfect right <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and it's no kindness to a woman to press her so hard, to urge her against her will. If I give you pain I can only say I'm very sorry. It's not my fault; I can't marry you simply to please you. I won't say that I shall always remain your friend, because when women say that, in these situations, it passes, I believe, for a sort of mockery. But try me some day." ...|$|E
5000|$|Girl in a Coma’s unique musical style, that {{combines}} {{the essence of}} many rock genres, is generated from the large and eclectic group of musical influences including, Nirvana, girl groups such as Bratmobile and Bikini Kill, the Ramones, and the Smiths, whose song “Girlfriend in a Coma” is attributed to {{the inspiration for the}} band's name. [...] At the top of the list, band members Phanie and Nina Diaz describe their grandfather as their first prominent musical influence. [...] His passion for music, singing, and guitar playing witnessed at a young age by Phanie and Nina Diaz, has had a profound influence on the band’s music as well as the title of their second album, Trio B.C., titled after their grandfather’s Tejano band from the 1950s.

5000|$|After {{attending}} {{art school}} and {{working as a}} parking valet and other odd jobs for nightclubs, Mooney went to New York City in 1940 to enter the fledging comic-book field. Following his first assignment, the new feature [...] "The Moth" [...] in Fox Publications' Mystery Men Comics #9-12 (April-July 1940), Mooney worked for the comic-book packager Eisner & Iger, one of the studios that would supply outsourced comics to publishers testing {{the waters of the}} new medium.

60|$|First, in {{her growing}} resentment, {{she had an}} impulse {{to go to her}} new friend, the hunter Wade, and confide in him not only her longing to learn about Wilson, but also other matters that were growing daily more burdensome. How strange for her <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> in some <b>way</b> Jack Belllounds had come between her and the old man she loved and called father! Columbine had not divined that until lately. She felt it now in the fact that she no longer sought the rancher as she used to, and he had {{apparently}} avoided her. But then, Columbine reflected, she might be entirely wrong, for when Belllounds did meet her at meal-times, or anywhere, he seemed just as affectionate as of old. Still he was not the same man. A chill, an atmosphere of shadow, had pervaded the once wholesome ranch. And so, feeling not yet well enough acquainted with Wade to confide so intimately in him, she stifled her impulses and resolved to make some effort herself to find out what she wanted to know.|$|R
6000|$|MARTHA--I know; but, after all, {{your work}} is yours, not mine. I have been only a helper, a good comrade, too, I hope, but--somehow--outside of it all. Do you {{remember}} {{two years ago when}} we were camped in Yunnan, among the aboriginal tribes? It was one night there when we were lying out in our sleeping-bags up in the mountains along the Tibetan frontier. I couldn't sleep. Suddenly I felt oh, so tired--utterly alone--out of harmony with you--with the earth under me. I became horribly despondent--like an outcast who suddenly realizes the whole world is alien. And all the wandering about the world, and all the romance and excitement I'd enjoyed in it, appeared an aimless, futile business, chasing around in a circle in an effort to avoid touching reality. Forgive me, Curt. I meant myself, not you, of course. Oh, it was horrible, I tell you, <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I tried to laugh at myself, to fight it off, but it stayed and grew worse. It seemed as if I were the only creature alive--who was not alive. And all at once the picture came of a tribeswoman who stood looking at us in a little mountain village as we rode by. She was nursing her child. Her eyes were so curiously sure of herself. She was horribly ugly, poor woman, and yet--as the picture came back to me--I appeared to myself the ugly one while she was beautiful. And I thought of our children who had died--and such a longing for another child came to me that I began sobbing. You were asleep. You didn't hear. [She pauses--then proceeds slowly.] And when we came back here--to have a home at last, I was so happy because I saw my chance of fulfillment--before it was too late. [In a gentle, pleading voice.] Now can you understand, dear? [She puts her hand on his arm.] ...|$|E
