40|$|<b>Territorial</b> <b>approaches</b> are a more {{prominent}} part of Cohesion {{policy in the}} 2014 - 20 period. Under the evolving urban dimension in European Structural and Investment Funds, the new regulations stipulate a ring-fenced budget of five percent of expenditure for Integrated Sustainable Urban Development (ISUD). New tools to implement <b>territorial</b> <b>approaches</b> have been introduced, including Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI) and Community-led Local Development (CLLD). These tools can be applied in urban areas but also in other territories. The manner in which <b>territorial</b> <b>approaches</b> are programmed, funded, thematically focussed and implemented differs greatly across IQ-Net countries/regions: •ISUD. In countries/regions where ISUD is implemented through a Priority axis, spending allocations range from close to five percent to almost 20 percent. Some programmes are solely focusing on large metropolitan centres, while others are also concentrating on smaller regional centres. Thematically, ISUD tends to focus on environmental protection and social inclusion. The governance arrangements require a significant level of delegation to the local level, but not all countries use Intermediate Bodies to achieve this. •ITIs. These are used to implement ISUD but can also target other forms of territorial development. In some countries/regions, ITIs {{are expected to be}} a major delivery instrument. Geographically, ITIs tend to focus on urban areas but can also target sub-regional areas, interregional areas or regions with specific territorial features. ITIs are programmed to cover innovation and competitiveness, low carbon economy and renewables and social cohesion themes. Selecting ITIs either happens through pre-selection (based on indicators or a political process) or competitive selection. Local bodies will be significantly involved in the implementation of the strategies, taking on responsibilities concerning the development of strategies, animation and project generation, selection or pre-selection of project activities. •CLLD. Funding allocations for CLLD will vary significantly across Member States and regions. Some use CLLD in a large range of geographical areas, including urban and peri-urban areas. Most Member States will implement CLLD across multiple OPs, contributing to a range of thematic goals. Most CLLD management approaches retain programme Managing Authorities (MAs) in a management role. CLLD can also be used on a cross-border basis. The approach for 2014 - 20 is an extension of existing methods and fits within emerging domestic policy frameworks. Many authorities at Member State level recognise the value of, and show enthusiasm for, integrated <b>territorial</b> <b>approaches</b> and some consider them innovative and inspiring. Potential benefits include increased efficiency and more local power/influence in decision-making. However, MAs have the difficult task of having to establish structures and implementation mechanisms that satisfy local actors’ expectations but also adhere to regulatory requirements. Other challenges include local capacity issues in relation to implementing <b>territorial</b> <b>approaches</b> and questions concerning how thematic concentration and results-orientation align with ring-fenced <b>territorial</b> <b>approaches.</b> Finally, due to the variety of ways in which <b>territorial</b> <b>approaches</b> can be implemented, the provision of guidance has been challenging. A workgroup, Territorial Cohesion and Urban Matters (TCUM), has been established to support implementation of the territorial and urban aspects of the regulations governing the European Structural and Investment Funds. In relation to ITIs, the drafting of scenarios should provide clarification and be a source of inspiration...|$|R

40|$|Across various contexts, {{parties and}} courts have pressed for {{territorial}} rules in cases implicating technology and national security. This Essay suggests that presumptively <b>territorial</b> <b>approaches</b> {{to these questions}} are misguided. Territorial rules do not track the division of authority or capacity among the branches, nor are they effective proxies for the important interests of regulators or regulatees. On is-sues of technology and national security, territorial rules seem particularly ill suited: territorial rules aspire to certainty, but technology {{makes it harder to}} define “territoriality” in a consistent and predictable way; technology weakens territoriali-ty as a proxy for policy goals because data often move in ways disconnected with the interests of users and lawmakers; and technology makes it easier for public or private actors to circumvent territorial rules (often without detection), thus interfer-ing with the existing allocation of policymaking authority. This Essay explores the-se themes with respect to the Stored Communications Act, electronic surveillance law, and court-access doctrines in criminal and civil litigation. The conclusion is that <b>territorial</b> <b>approaches</b> in such cases may have been wrong when first adopted or may have succumbed to desuetude in the intervening years...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen the rural areas of {{developing}} and emerging countries undergo significant structural changes. They {{are the source of}} several pertinent international concerns, including extreme poverty and hunger, and rising spatial and interpersonal disparities, challenges that national governments and the international community have made limited headway in alleviating to date. By analysing the range of rural development approaches implemented in recent decades, we develop a picture in which <b>territorial</b> <b>approaches</b> have become more mainstream. Since {{the turn of the century}} in particular they have gradually supplanted more traditional place-neutral approaches, which, we argue, have served to increase rural-urban disparities and exasperate the incidence of poverty in rural areas.
