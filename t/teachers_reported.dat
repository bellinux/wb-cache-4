25|$|A reanalysis of the AAUW data {{found that}} {{victims of sexual}} {{harassment}} by <b>teachers</b> <b>reported</b> experiencing adverse health effects because of the abuse. 28% {{said that they had}} trouble sleeping and lost their appetite, 51% reported feeling embarrassed, and 37% indicated that they felt less sure of themselves or less confident {{as a result of the}} sexual harassment. Furthermore, 36% of the students said that they were afraid or scared and 29% reported feeling confused about their identity. In addition to negatively affecting health outcomes, teacher sexual abuse influenced the victims' academic performance. The affected students avoided the teacher (43%), they did not want to go to school (36%), avoided talking in class (34%), had trouble paying attention (31%), cut classes (29%), or found it hard to study (29%).|$|E
25|$|Beginning in fall 2002, smaller {{high schools}} were {{established}} within the JFK campus, co-existing with Kennedy High School. Marble Hill High School was opened in September 2002. The Bronx School of Law and Finance and Bronx Theatre High School were opened in September 2003. The Bronx School for Law & Finance was opened in September 2004. The enrollment of John F. Kennedy High School began shrinking in 2004 as the small schools grew, with a target cap of 2,500 students. Results from the 2010-11 NYC School Survey were abysmally low. Over half {{of students who}} took the survey reported that their peers did not respect teachers or other students; over 70 percent of <b>teachers</b> <b>reported</b> the same; meanwhile the school became increasingly plagued by crime and poor academic results. In late-2010, the Department of Education decided to shut John F. Kennedy by eliminating one grade per year until it graduated its last class in 2014. Crucial to the decision to close the school was the DOE’s assertion that the school was under performing, earning an overall D on its 2009-10 progress report, with a F grade for student performance. According to the DOE, four-year graduation rate at Kennedy High School was 46%, {{as opposed to a}} 63% average for the city. JFK High School graduated its final class in June 2014.|$|E

Matched samples {{of children with}} (n = 127) and without (n = 125) AD/HD were utilized to test the internal, convergent, concurrent, and incremental validity of ratings completed by examiners on the Hillside Behavior Rating Scale (HBRS).

HBRS ratings also were significantly associated with other measures of functioning, and provided a significant increment in the prediction of impairment over parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>report</b> alone. These findings suggest that behavioral ratings during testing provide a unique source of clinical information that may be useful as a supplement to parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>reports.</b> Numerous previous studies have examined {{the reliability and validity of}} parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>report...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{whether there are differences}} in the social gradient of parent-reported and teacher-reported child psychological well-being. Design: Secondary data analysis comparing ratings of child psychological well-being (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ) in the UK Millennium Cohort Study at 7  years by socioeconomic circumstances (SEC). A number of measures of SEC were tested; results are reported for maternal education. From a sample of 13   168 singletons who participated at the age of 7  years, complete data were available for 8207 children. Results: There was a social gradient in SDQ scores reported by parents and teachers, with ‘borderline/abnormal’ scores more prevalent in children with lower-educated mothers. However, the gradient was more marked in parent <b>report</b> compared with <b>teacher</b> <b>report,</b> and discrepancies between parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>reports</b> were greatest for children from higher SECs. Conclusions: The social gradient in child psychological well-being, although present, was weaker in <b>teacher</b> <b>report</b> compared with parent report.

40|$|Purpose: Problematic {{behavior}} is widely reported {{in children with}} sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Daytime behaviour {{is an important component}} in the evaluation of clinical history in SDB; however, there is a reliance on parental report alone, and it is unclear whether <b>reports</b> by <b>teachers</b> will aid diagnosis. Methods: We assessed sleep and behavior reported by both parents and teachers in 19 children with SDB and 27 nonsnoring controls. All children were screened for prior diagnoses of other medical and/or behavior and learning disorders and underwent polysomnography and both parental and teacher assessment of behavior. Results: Both parents and <b>teachers</b> <b>report</b> greater problematic behavior in SDB children, predominantly of an internalizing nature. Despite this consistency and moderate correlation between informants, the agreement between parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>reports</b> of individual child behavior was poor when assessed using Bland–Altman plots. Conclusions: Clinicians should be mindful that the behavioural history of a child being evaluated for SDB may vary depending on whether parent or <b>teacher</b> <b>report</b> is being discussed as this may influence clinical decision making.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relations among victimization and psychological, social, behavioral, and academic functioning while considering how these constructs are conceptualized and measured. Victimization {{was treated as a}} multidimensional variable that can be distinguished in terms of form (relational vs. overt), informant (self vs. <b>teacher</b> vs. peer <b>report),</b> and its overlap with aggression. Participants were 99 ethnically diverse second and third graders from the mid-Atlantic region. The observed relations between victimization and functioning were impacted by issues of informant, form, and aggression. When examining different measures of the same construct, correlations were more often statistically significant for same-informant pairs of measures compared to cross-informant pairs. Correlations between peer and <b>teacher</b> <b>reports</b> were stronger than correlations between self- and other-reports. Self-other agreement was higher for aggression than for victimization, suggesting that victimization is more individualistically experienced than aggression. Peer and <b>teacher</b> <b>reports</b> of victimization were not significantly related to self-reported functioning and vice versa. <b>Teacher</b> and peer <b>reports</b> did not add to self-reports of victimization in predicting self-reported functioning. Peer and <b>teacher</b> <b>reports</b> of victimization uniquely predicted peer and <b>teacher</b> <b>reports</b> of functioning, but self-reported victimization did not make an additive contribution. These results provide evidence of a self-other dichotomy in the assessment of victimization. Overt and relational victimization emerged as distinct constructs in exploratory factor analyses. However, they were significantly correlated, and self-reports of relational victimization did not uniquely predict functioning after accounting for overt victimization. There were not significant gender differences in the two types of victimization. Aggression and victimization were significantly correlated. Peer-reported victimization was related to teacher-reported externalizing and school problems, but was not a significant predictor after accounting for aggression. This finding suggests that failing to account for the overlap between aggression and victimization might obscure the complexity of the relationship between victimization and functioning. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed...|$|R
50|$|IC {{has been}} {{measured}} {{using a variety}} of methods. Namely, researchers typically use behavioural methods, in which children are asked to complete short tasks that require the use of IC. Researchers also use reports in the forms of surveys from parents and teachers. Typically, behavioural methods and <b>teacher</b> <b>reports</b> have the closest relationship to children’s academic outcomes. Both of these methods can reveal important information when investigating the relationship between IC and academic performance as they lend information from different contexts, with behavioural methods providing information about the child’s objective abilities, and <b>teacher</b> <b>reports</b> providing information about the subjective classroom experience. Together these methods provide a more complete understanding of the relationship.|$|R
