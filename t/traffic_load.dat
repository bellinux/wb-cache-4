25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show some variety in the average daily <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> numbers as the route travels north. The <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> averages start at their high point on the route, {{with an average of}} 16,530 {{vehicles}} using the short stretch between SR140 and the start of the Birmingham Highway portion. Those numbers then steadily decrease as SR372 heads north, going from 9,390 initially down to just over 3,000 as Cherokee County approaches. The average load stays between 3,000 and 3,500 south of SR20, climbs to 5,500 north of SR20, and goes up once more to around 6,200 north of SR369. The area south of, and into, Ball Ground sees an average vehicle load of between 7,000 and 7,500, cresting once more at 8,680 heading north out of downtown towards I-575/SR5/SR515. However, the short stretch that feeds directly into the aforementioned state route only carries 3,900 vehicles per day, illustrating that the feeder route into SR5 south of Ball Ground sees heavier traffic than this northern spur.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Considering {{energy as}} a crucial resource, several duty cycle based MAC have already been {{proposed}} for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to gain higher energy efficiency during long idle period of the sensors, and are optimized for light <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> Contrastively, considering the bandwidth constraint of WSNs, and to optimize the heavy <b>traffic</b> <b>loads,</b> another research trend is continuing in devising rate and congestion control at the MAC layer. To provide an integrated solution of both these distinct research trends at the MAC layer, in this paper, we present a Load-independent Energy-efficient and Rate-control Integrated Asynchronous Duty Cycle MAC (LER-MAC) for WSNs. Performance of LER-MAC has been evaluated using ns- 2 which demonstrates that, LER-MAC conserves energy considerably during light <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> Moreover, it procures higher throughput and lower latency avoiding packet drops through maximum utilization of the channel during heavy <b>traffic</b> <b>loads.</b> I...|$|R

For this purpose an Interregio service (Karlsruhe–Stuttgart–Nuremberg–Erfurt–Leipzig) would run at two-hour intervals and an Intercity/ICE service (Munich–Erfurt–Berlin) would run hourly over the new line; the old line (Großheringen–Saalfeld railway and Franconian Forest Railway) would be operated as an Interregio service. The Interregio trains of the new line would run via Coburg and Ilmenau and the IC/ICE services would run between Bamberg and Erfurt (although some services would stop during the day in Coburg). The IR journey would take 25minutes from Ilmenau to Bamberg and about 20 minutes to Erfurt.|$|E
25|$|Freehold Circle {{was located}} near the western {{boundary}} of Freehold Borough near the Freehold Raceway. The circle carried traffic between US 9, Business Route 33 and Manalapan Avenue (CR 24); it was eliminated in the 1980s due to the increased <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> caused by a boom in commercial and residential development. Most notable of the commercial development is the Freehold Raceway Mall, in Freehold Township {{just south of the}} old circle on US 9, whose development in the late 1980s was a major impetus to redesign the circle. The former circle now features several jughandles, and most Manalapan Avenue traffic must use a connector road to Business Route 33 to reach the main intersection, but it is still known by locals as Freehold Circle. In the early 1940s, the Freehold Circle was the planned terminus of highway that would funnel traffic from South Amboy to the Jersey Shore by way of Matawan and Marlboro Township.|$|E
25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show a variety of daily averages across SR20. The <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> on the highway starts at its lowest daily average load as the route starts into Floyd County, where numbers hover around 5,400 {{vehicles}} per day. These averages increase rapidly as the highway approaches Rome, going from around 12,000 vehicles to a peak of 38,000 vehicles in downtown Rome. As SR20 becomes concurrent with US27/SR1, the numbers decrease {{to an average of}} 32,000, and then decrease more rapidly to around 15,000 as SR20 heads east out of Rome. The vehicle load stays in that area all the way through Floyd County and into Bartow County, as the highway is the main west-to-east thoroughfare between Rome and Cartersville. In Cartersville, where the highway is concurrent with US41, the vehicle count reaches a zenith of just over 41,000, but then drops off sharply as the highway heads into rural Cherokee County, dipping just below 10,000 before increasing again to near 24,000 vehicles per day as it approaches I-575/SR5. On the portion of the highway that is concurrent with I-575/SR5, the highway sees its maximum vehicle load of just over 54,000 vehicles, again dropping rapidly east of I-575/SR5, going from around 24,000 down to 11,000, and further down to around 10,000 as the Forsyth County line is reached.|$|E

However, the design considerations and analytical solutions for buried water mains assume that the soil is either dry or fully saturated. In unsaturated soils, such assumption often leads to incorrect estimation of induced deformation/stress on buried water pipes by external loads such as from <b>traffic</b> <b>loading.</b> These different anticipated loads are generated because the water meniscus between soil particles creates an additional normal force due to suction, which in turn makes the soil stiffer and stronger.

40|$|Mechanistic {{analysis}} of jointed concrete pavements {{has traditionally been}} performed by analyzing the pavements under either <b>traffic</b> <b>loading</b> or combined environmental and <b>traffic</b> <b>loading.</b> The environmental loading analysis is often limited to a linear temperature differential through the slab and the <b>traffic</b> <b>loading</b> is often reduced to a single or dual wheel load positioned at a free slab edge.

However, some field data has indicated that this is often not the failure mode in rigid pavements as corner cracking and longitudinal cracking can also occur. A fatigue analysis using stresses predicted for the edge loading case under a positive temperature gradient will therefore give misleading results.
