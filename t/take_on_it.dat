Also he envisioned the IWW forming their own political party that would bring together the feuding socialist {{groups such as the}} Socialist Labor Party of America and the Socialist Party of America. Likewise, he envisaged independent Ireland as a socialist republic. His connection and views on Revolutionary Unionism and Syndicalism have raised debate on if his image for a workers republic would be one of State or Grassroots socialism. During his lifetime he was a supporter of syndicalism and was most strongly influenced by the Marxist school of De Leonism (though he had his own <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>it),</b> dying a year before the emergence of the Russian Revolution and Leninism.|$|E

500|$|As a whole, {{the record}} is a {{contemporary}} pop piece, incorporating elements from Streisand's signature musical style. The Way We Were begins with [...] "Being at War with Each Other", a cover of the Carole King song from her 1973 studio album, Fantasy, although King wrote the track specifically for Streisand. Produced by LiPuma, she sings about various topics, ranging from socialization and relationships. She also claims that all humans stem from [...] "one father" [...] and [...] "one mother" [...] and how differing opinions only [...] "complicate our lives". [...] "Something So Right" [...] is also a cover and originally the B-side track to Paul Simon's 1973 single [...] "Take Me to the Mardi Gras". It focuses heavily on the songwriting rather than the production, although the composition was the second included to be produced by LiPuma. [...] "The Best Thing You've Ever Done" [...] was originally written in 1970 by Charnin who maintained interest in creating a composition for Streisand. Additionally, Wally Gold handled the production for the track, the first of six on the album. Lead single [...] "The Way We Were" [...] is the album's fourth track. In particular, its lyrics detail the personal life of Katie Morosky, the character Streisand portrays in the previously mentioned film, and her troubling relationship with boyfriend Hubbell Gardiner. Track five, [...] "All in Love Is Fair", is a Stevie Wonder cover but is fronted by Streisand's own personal <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> She sings about a failing relationship {{through the use of}} clichés and obvious messages regarding love.|$|E
