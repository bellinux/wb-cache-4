2500|$|A {{molecule}} {{of dietary}} fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may {{be classified as}} saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats {{have all of the}} carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with <b>trans-isomer</b> bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation. [...] There are nine kilocalories in each gram of fat. Fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid, catalpic acid, eleostearic acid and punicic acid, in addition to providing energy, represent potent immune modulatory molecules.|$|E

In the US, it is also administered for prophylactic chemoprevention in women identified as high risk for breast cancer. Tamoxifen is a pure antiestrogenic <b>trans-isomer</b> and has differential actions at estrogen target tissues throughout the body. Tamoxifen is selectively antiestrogenic in the breast but estrogen-like in bones and endometrial cancer.

5000|$|... trans-Cyclooctene is the {{smallest}} cycloalkene in which the <b>trans-isomer</b> is stable at room temperature. This is because trans-cycloalkenes have a longer bridging distance between the two allylic carbons than their respective cis-cycloalkenes. Eight carbons is the minimum ring size required to join them when they are trans without causing severe structural strain. The smaller rings of trans-Cycloheptene and trans-cyclohexene can exist, {{but they are very}} unstable at room temperature. trans-Cyclooctene exists in a helical conformation with the carbon chain lying above the double bond on one side and below it on the other, leading to chirality (as depicted to the right). This type of chirality is defined as planar chirality. There are two enantiomeric forms, atropisomers resulting from restricted rotation about a single bond.|$|E
5000|$|Bromination of trans-stilbene {{produces}} predominantly meso-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane (sometimes called meso-stilbene dibromide), in {{line with}} a mechanism involving a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate of a typical electrophilic bromine addition reaction; cis-stilbene yields a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers of 1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane in a non-polar solvent such as carbon tetrachloride, but the extent of production of the meso compound increases with solvent polarity, with a yield of 90% in nitromethane. [...] The formation of small quantities of the two enantiomers of stilbene dibromide from the <b>trans-isomer</b> suggests that the bromonium ion intermediate exists in chemical equilibrium with a carbocation intermediate PhCHBr - C+(H)Ph with a vacant p orbital vulnerable to nucleophilic attack from either face. The addition of bromide or tribromide salts restores much of the stereospecificity even in solvents with a dielectric constant above 35.|$|E
5000|$|With cycloheptene, the {{cis-isomer}} {{is always}} assumed but the <b>trans-isomer</b> does also exist. One procedure for the organic synthesis of trans-cycloheptene is by singlet photosensitization of cis-cycloheptene with methyl benzoate and ultraviolet light at −35 °C. The double bond in the trans isomer is very strained. The directly attached atoms {{on a simple}} alkene are all coplanar. In trans-cycloheptene, however, {{the size of the}} ring makes it impossible for the alkene and its two attached carbons to have this geometry because the remaining three carbons could not reach far enough to close the ring (see also Bredt's rule). There would have to be unusually large angles (angle strain), unusually long bond-lengths, or the atoms of the alkane-like loop would collide with the alkene part (steric strain). Part of the strain is relieved by pyramidalization of each alkene carbon and their rotation relative to each other. The pyramidalization angle is estimated at 37° (compared to an angle of 0° for an atom with normal trigonal-planar geometry) and the p-orbital misalignment is 30.1°. [...] Because the barrier for rotation of the double bond in ethylene is approximately 65 kcal/mol (270 kJ/mol) and can only be lowered by the estimated strain energy of 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol) present in the <b>trans-isomer,</b> trans-cycloheptene should be a stable molecule just as its homologue trans-cyclooctene. In fact, it is not: unless the temperature is kept very low, rapid isomerization to the cis-isomer takes place. The trans-cycloheptene isomerization mechanism is not simple alkene-bond rotation, but rather an alternative lower energy pathway. Based on the experimentally observed second order reaction kinetics for isomerization, two trans-cycloheptene molecules in the proposed pathway first form a diradical dimer. The two heptane radical rings then untwist to an unstrained conformation, and finally the dimer fragments back into two cis-cycloheptene molecules. Note that the photoisomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid with bromine is also bimolecular.|$|E

50|$|Research {{into both}} the {{azobenzene}} and norbonadiene-quadricyclane systems was {{abandoned in the}} 1980s as unpractical due to problems with degradation, instability, low energy density, and cost. With recent advances in computing power though, there has been renewed interest in finding materials for solar thermal fuels. In 2011, researchers at MIT used time-dependent density functional theory, which models systems at an atomic level, to design a system composed of azobenzene molecules bonded to carbon nanotube (CNT) templates. The CNT substrates will allow customizable interactions between neighboring molecules which greatly helps in fine tuning {{the properties of the}} fuel, for example an increase in the amount of energy stored. Through experimental procedures, researchers were able to get the first proof of principle that the hybrid nanostructure works as a functional thermal fuel. Azobenzenes have the advantage of absorbing wavelengths that are very abundant in sunlight, when this happens the molecule transforms from a <b>trans-isomer</b> to a cis-isomer which has a higher energy state of about 0.6 eV. To bring the molecule back down to its original state, i.e. release the energy it had collected, there are a few options. The first is to apply heat but that is associated with a cost which, relative to the amount of heat that will be produced from the release, is not cost efficient. The second, more effective option is to use a catalyst that lowers the thermal barrier and allows the heat to be released, almost like a switch. The transition back from cis to trans can also be triggered by blue visible light.|$|E
5000|$|For most sp2-hybridized organohalides, {{a concerted}} three-center {{oxidative}} {{addition to this}} 14-electron Pd(0) complex is proposed. This process gives the cis-tetravalent 16-electron Pd(II) species. It has been suggested the presence of anionic ligands, such as OAc, accelerate this step by the formation of Pd(OAc)(PR3)n−, making the palladium species more nucleophillic.In some cases, especially when an sp3-hybridized organohalide is used, an SN2 type mechanism tends to prevail, yet this is not as commonly seen in the literature.However, despite normally forming a cis-intermediate after a concerted oxidative addition, this product is in rapid equilibrium with its <b>trans-isomer,</b> which is thermodynamically more stable. This cis-trans isomerism is a complicated process which involves at least four concurrent mechanisms, {{two of which are}} autocatalyzed and two which are assisted by solvent association to the metal.There are multiple reasons why isomerization is favored here. First, a bulky ligand set is usually used in these processes, such as phosphines, and it is highly unfavorable for them to adopt a cis orientation relative to each other, resulting in isomerization to the more favorable trans product. [...] An alternative explanation for this phenomenon, dubbed antisymbiosis or transphobia, is by invocation of the sdn model. [...] Under this theory, palladium is a hypervalent species. Hence R1 and the trans ligand, being trans to each other, will compete with one palladium orbital for bonding. This 4-electron 3-center bond is weakest when two strong donating groups are present, which heavily compete for the palladium orbital. Relative to any ligand normally used, the C-donor R1 ligand has a much higher trans effect. This trans influence is a measure of how competitive ligands trans to each other will compete for palladium's orbital. The usual ligand set, phophines, and C-donors (R1) are both soft ligands, meaning that they will form strong bonds to palladium, and heavily compete with each other for bonding. [...] Since halides or pseudohalides are significantly more electronegative, their bonding with palladium will be highly polarized, with most of the electron density on the X group, making them low trans effect ligands. Hence, it will be highly favorable for R1 to be trans to X, since the R1 group will be able to form a stronger bond to the palladium.|$|E

This caused the diffraction efficiency to decrease to 0.0055  % {{as can be seen}} in Fig.  4 b. This decrease is due to some trans- to cis-isomerization that leads to a reduction in the <b>trans-isomer</b> absorption coefficient and hence the refractive index at 655  nm. We estimate the resultant Δn from Eq. 1 to be Δn[*]=[*] 0.0012 where we find that it has reduced by 0.0002. The 532 -nm laser was blocked after 455  s, and the diffraction efficiency increased back to 0.0078  % by thermal relaxation from the cis to the <b>trans-isomer.</b> Thus, the diffraction efficiency was reduced by ~ 30  % by illumination at 532  nm. This shows that the trans-cis isomerization process can be used to modulate the diffraction efficiency. Higher 532 -nm intensities or lower switching wavelengths are required to further decrease the diffraction efficiency.|$|E
