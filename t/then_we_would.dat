500|$|The BBC {{recognised}} {{the success}} of the serial, particularly {{in the context of the}} impending arrival of commercial television to the UK. Controller of Programmes Cecil McGivern wrote in a memo that: [...] "Had competitive television been in existence <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have killed it every Saturday night while [...] lasted. We are going to need many more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes." [...] Like all of Kneale's television work for the BBC in the 1950s, The Quatermass Experiment was transmitted live. Only the first two episodes were telerecorded and survive in the BBC's archives.|$|E
500|$|On 22 September 1955 the ITV {{network was}} {{launched}} in the UK, bringing commercial television to Britain {{for the first time}} and ending the BBC's broadcasting monopoly in the country. The new network's creation had been established by the Television Act 1954, and the BBC had known in advance that they would need programmes to combat the new rival for television audiences. Referring to the 1953 science-fiction serial The Quatermass Experiment in a memo written in 1954, BBC Television's Controller of Programmes, Cecil McGivern, noted that: [...] "Had competitive television been in existence <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have killed it every Saturday night while [...] lasted.

We are going to need many more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes." [...] Following Kneale's death in 2006, film historian Robert Simpson said that the serial had been [...] "event television, emptying the streets and pubs for the six weeks of its duration." [...] When the digital television channel BBC Four remade the serial in 2005, the channel's controller, Janice Hadlow, described the original as [...] "one the first 'must-watch' TV experiences that inspired the water cooler chat of its day".|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that some first season episodes were too neatly wrapped and solved, Jeff Pinkner commented {{towards the end}} of that season, [...] "We found that, absolutely, early on, we were falling into the trap of—the tease would be fantastic. And <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> too quickly answer it and [...] the tension. And we've tried to course-correct and have the tease promise" [...] questions that don't get answered right away. He further elaborated that the goal now is to [...] "have the energy of the show get bigger as [...] goes along... We're learning how to tell this version of a detective story. It's not really a police procedural. There are elements of that. But it's an incredible mish-mash of genres. I think we're getting better at finding our way through these stories." ...|$|E
500|$|Al Jean, showrunner since season thirteen, {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} criticism, with some arguing that the show has {{continued}} to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is [...] "on auto-pilot", [...] "too sentimental", and the episodes are [...] "just being cranked out." [...] Some critics believe that the show has [...] "entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny." [...] John Ortved, author of , characterized the Jean era as [...] "toothless", and criticized what he perceived as the show's increase in social and political commentary. Jean responded: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E

500|$|Fred Toye {{served as}} the episode director, his second after {{directing}} [...] "The Ghost Network" [...] six installments earlier. To create the opening scene of character Mark Young being [...] "attacked" [...] by butterflies, Toye shot it in multiple phases. Series co-creator Roberto Orci preferred the opening scene to involve a [...] "more subtle" [...] death, so Young was made to die from falling out a window, which was [...] "a real thing, something that's not imagined or whimsical". VFX coordinator Christopher Stollard stated that his crew [...] "relied entirely on actor performance," [...] with guest actor Ptolemy Slocum communicating often with the crew during filming. He shot his scenes in short bursts. Slocum summarized that he [...] "would experience the [...] cut and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> freeze, apply make-up , and then unfreeze and move on" [...] filming. On his first day, Slocum stated that he wore more than 75 individual prosthetics over his entire chest and arms.|$|E

Watching the two teams come together and fight alongside each other, it's one of the most fun parts, ... we just don’t believe in waiting. We really believe in accelerated storytelling." [...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas." [...] Greg Berlanti, creator {{and executive producer}} on both series, explained that [...] "crossovers are part of [...] DNA, ... and if we waited ..., <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> be depriving the audience of something we all wanted to see".|$|E
500|$|Captain America's shield, {{which serves}} as both a {{defensive}} tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG). Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that [...] "We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [...] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.... And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane, {{which is sort of}} a synthetic rubber... and we made an ultrasoft one we put on [...] back, so that if there were an accident, it wouldn't hurt him." [...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> add in a CG shield".|$|E

Winning just wasn't an option." [...] Lamine himself had earlier stated that the party should have carried the trial to the European Court of Human Rights, but Vlaams Blok senator Joris Van Hauthem had already stated in 2005, that; [...] "If we had gone to Strasbourg [...] based on procedural arguments, we {{might have had a}} case. But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, on the basis of substantive arguments. If Vlaams Belang were to put forth a claim against the verdict as well, at Strasbourg, the Court will bundle both cases. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> lose the case for sure. Lamine has thus given us the final blow." ...|$|E
500|$|Jean {{continued}} as showrunner after the movie. Critics {{have argued that}} the quality of the show has declined in Jean's tenure. Jacob Burch, an administrator of the website NoHomers.com, {{said in an interview that}} the show [...] "seems less cohesive, more about trying to get the jokes in there, instead of make a story and let the jokes come off of that" [...] and adds [...] "I just think there's only so much you can do [...]" [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club argues in an online debate over this issue that [...] "The Simpsons has come to rely too much on wacky Homer shtick and tired, meaningless guest stars" [...] and that the writers are [...] "content to amuse themselves with in-jokes, non sequiturs, and self-consciously silly plot twists." [...] Jean responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.'

500|$|Batman: Arkham Knight was {{released}} on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows on June 23, 2015. The game was originally scheduled to be released on October 14, 2014, which in turn was delayed to June 2, 2015. On the first delay, Rocksteady marketing game manager Guy Perkins stated, [...] "If we didn’t give the team more time to do it, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> be releasing something that we weren’t happy with. We {{want to make sure}} we’re absolutely nailing it 100%." [...] A quality assurance tester for the game added, [...] "Getting [...] to work on consoles was impossible for months. That’s part of why the game got delayed so many times, [...] totally unprepared for how hard it was on next-gen consoles." [...] In the UK, the Microsoft Windows version is only available as a digital release. Additionally, an OS X and Linux version of the game developed by Feral Interactive was scheduled for release in early 2016 after originally being scheduled to release in late 2015; it was cancelled in February 2016. Feral stated the original delay was to [...] "ensure good performance and wide-ranging support" [...] for the two platforms.|$|E

500|$|Chuck's {{father and}} co-pilot. Kazinsky stated Martini hated {{the fact that}} he was cast as Chuck's father, being only 13 years Kazinsky's senior. However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
500|$|The Hill Valley {{town square}} scenes were shot at Courthouse Square, {{located in the}} Universal Studios backlot (...) [...] Gale {{explained}} {{it would have been}} impossible to shoot on location [...] "because no city is going to let a film crew remodel their town to look like it's in the 1950s." [...] The filmmakers [...] "decided to shoot all the 50s stuff first, and make the town look real beautiful and wonderful. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> just totally trash it down and make it all bleak and ugly for the 1980s scenes." [...] The interiors for Doc Brown's house were shot at the Robert R. Blacker House, while exteriors took place at Gamble House. The exterior shots of the Twin Pines Mall, and later the Lone Pine Mall (from 1985) were shot at the Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry, California. The exterior shots and some interior scenes at Hill Valley High School were filmed at Whittier High School in Whittier, California. The Battle of the Bands tryout scene was filmed at the McCambridge Park Recreation Center in Burbank, and the [...] "Enchantment Under the Sea" [...] dance was filmed in the gymnasium at Hollywood United Methodist Church. The scenes outside of the Baines' house in 1955 were shot at Bushnell Avenue, South Pasadena, California.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season (1998). He once again became show runner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean called it [...] "a great job with a lot of responsibility," [...] and cited [...] "the fact that people love it so much" [...] as [...] "great." [...] He adds, however, that [...] "the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] Jean's return was initially welcomed, with MSNBC's Jon Bonné stating: [...] "Jean, who took the show's helm from executive producer Mike Scully in 2001, has guided the show away from its gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation...these are certainly brighter days for the show's long-time fans." [...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.'
