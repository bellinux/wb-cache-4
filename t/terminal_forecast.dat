40|$|Fog is a {{significant}} factor affecting the Air Traffic Control (ATC). Significant limitations of the airport capacity are due to fog that causes {{the reduction of the}} visibility (Runway Visual Range, RVR). Today METAR (Meteorological Aviation Report) and <b>forecasts</b> TAF (<b>Terminal</b> Aerodrome <b>Forecast)</b> are only available to estimate the visibility variations, but not to estimate the RVR.

50|$|The NWS {{supports}} the aviation community through {{the production of}} several forecast products. Each area's WFO has responsibility for the issuance of <b>Terminal</b> Aerodrome <b>Forecasts</b> (TAFs) for airports in their jurisdiction. TAFs are concise, coded 24-hour forecasts (30-hour forecasts for certain airports) for a specific airport, which are issued every six hours with amendments as needed. As opposed to a public weather forecast, a TAF only addresses weather elements critical to aviation; these include wind, visibility, cloud cover and wind shear.|$|R
50|$|The 21st Operational Weather Squadron {{provides}} highly accurate, {{timely and}} relevant environmental situational awareness to Air Force, Navy, and Army Commanders operating in US European Command {{in partnership with}} NATO.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of fog and low level stratus at airports causes {{a number of}} negative impacts ranging from delays, diversions, cancellations, extra fuel leading to reduced loading capacity and customer discomfort. Some of the impacts can be greatly minimized if the {{occurrence of}} fog and low level stratus are accurately, reliably and timely forecasted. The study aimed at investigating the utilization of METAR and satellite products, {{as well as their}} performance in issuance of <b>Terminal</b> Aerodrome <b>Forecast</b> at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The study is based on a case study of 20 th and 21 st August 2012, utilizing TAFs, Water Vapour imagery of satellite and METARs, High Resolution Visible, Infra-red channels. The fog and low level stratus were observed to form at around 0100 and 0500 UTC and dissipate at around 0500 UTC. The dissipation is mainly attributed to the incoming solar radiation. The satellite observations replicated the METARs issued. The study therefore recommends further utilization of satellite products and METAR reports in the issuance of <b>Terminal</b> Aerodrome <b>Forecasts</b> to help in minimizing the impacts associated with fog and low level stratus at the airport. However, the study calls for quantitative verification of the performance of the satellite products is however recommended to ascertain the accuracy of the products...|$|R
50|$|A trend type {{forecast}} (TTF) {{also known}} simply as a trend, is an aviation weather forecast written by a real person on location at a major airport or military base.

5000|$|A {{universal}} access transceiver is a data link intended {{to serve the}} majority of the general aviation community. The data link is approved in the Federal Aviation Administration's [...] "final rule" [...] for use in all airspace except class A (above 18,000 ft. MSL). UAT is intended to support not only ADS-B, but also flight information service - broadcast (FIS-B), traffic information service - broadcast (TIS-B), and, if required in the future, supplementary ranging and positioning capabilities. [...] Due to the set of standards required for this rule, it is seen as the most effective application for general aviation users. UAT will allow aircraft equipped with [...] "out" [...] broadcast capabilities to be seen by any other aircraft using ADS-B In technology as well as by FAA ground stations. Aircraft equipped with ADS-B In technology {{will be able to see}} detailed altitude and vector information from other ADS-B Out equipped aircraft as well as FIS-B and TIS-B broadcasts. The FIS-B broadcast will allow receiving aircraft to view weather and flight service information including AIRMETs, SIGMETs, METARs, SPECI, national NEXRAD, regional NEXRAD, D-NOTAMs, FDC-NOTAMs, PIREPs, special use airspace status, <b>terminal</b> area <b>forecasts,</b> amended <b>terminal</b> aerodrome <b>forecasts</b> (TAFs), winds and temperature aloft. [...] These broadcasts serve to provide early adopters of the technology with benefits as an incentive for more pilots to use the technology before 2020. Aircraft receiving traffic information through the TIS-B service will see other aircraft in a manner that is similar to how all aircraft will be seen after they have equipped by 2020. The availability of a non-subscription weather information service, FIS-B, provides general aviation users with a useful alternative to other monthly or annual fee-based services.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Weather {{forecasting}} is {{a critical}} application in meteorology {{and has been a}} standout amongst the most scientifically and technologically difficult issues extreme and broad. Climate determining is an capricious procedure that includes various particular fields of mastery. A fuzzy logic based methodology can be implemented with the Case based Reasoning (CBR) system. CBR and fuzzy set theory both have their own capabilities so that we combine both of them then we can get a strong solution to solve a problem. Case Based Reasoning is method of solving a new problem with the help of old solutions. According to fuzzy k-nn based prediction algorithm we can get the predictable parameters such as visibilities, cloud ceilings. This paper emphasis on the comparative study of case based reasoning and fuzzy logic.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solar power}} forecasting scheme, which uses spatial and temporal time series data along with a photovoltaic (PV) power conversion model. The PV conver- sion model uses the forecast of three different variables, namely, irradiance on the tilted plane, ambient temperature, and wind speed, in order to estimate the power produced by a PV plant at the grid connection <b>terminals.</b> The <b>forecast</b> values are obtained using a spatio-temporal method that uses the data recorded from a target meteorological station as well as data of its surrounding stations. The proposed forecasting method exploits the sparsity of correlations between time series data {{in a collection of}} sta- tions. The performance of both the PV conversion model and the spatio-temporal algorithm is evaluated using high-resolution real data recorded in various locations in Italy. Comparison with other benchmark methods illustrates that the proposed method significantly improves the solar power forecasts, particularly over short-term horizon...|$|R
40|$|The Future Air Traffic Growth and Schedule Model was {{developed}} as an {{implementation of the}} Fratar algorithm to project future traffic flow between airports in a system and of then scheduling the additional flights to reflect current passenger time-of-travel preferences. The methodology produces an unconstrained future schedule from a current (or baseline) schedule and the airport operations growth rates. As {{an example of the}} use of the model, future schedules are projected for 2010 and 2022 for all flights arriving at, departing from, or flying between all continental United States airports that had commercial scheduled service for May 17, 2002. Inter-continental US traffic and airports are included and the traffic is also grown with the Fratar methodology to account for their arrivals and departures to the continental US airports.

40|$|The two {{official}} {{sources for}} aviation weather reports both provide weather {{information to a}} pilot in a textual format. A number of systems have recently become available to help pilots with the visualization task by providing much of the data graphically. However, two types of aviation weather data are still not being presented graphically. These are airport-specific current weather reports (known as meteorological observations, or METARs) and forecast weather reports (known as <b>terminal</b> area <b>forecasts,</b> or TAFs). Our system, Aviation Weather Environment (AWE), presents intuitive graphical displays for both METARs and TAFs, as well as winds aloft forecasts. We start with a computer-generated textual aviation weather briefing. We map this briefing onto a cartographic grid specific to the pilot's area of interest. The pilot is able to obtain aviation-specific weather for the entire area or for his specific route. The route, altitude, true airspeed, and proposed departure time can each be modified in AWE. Integral visual display of these three elements of weather reports makes AWE a useful planning tool, {{as well as a}} weather briefing tool...|$|R
40|$|The forecasters at the National Weather Service in Melbourne, FL, (NWS MLB) {{identified}} {{a need to}} make more accurate lightning forecasts to help alleviate delays due to thunderstorms {{in the vicinity of}} several commercial airports in central Florida at which they are responsible for issuing <b>terminal</b> aerodrome <b>forecasts.</b> Such forecasts would also provide safer ground operations around terminals, and would be of value to Center Weather Service Units serving air traffic controllers in Florida. To improve the forecast, the AMU was tasked to develop an objective lightning probability forecast tool for the airports using data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). The resulting forecast tool is similar to that developed by the AMU to support space launch operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) for use by the 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) in previous tasks (Lambert and Wheeler 2005, Lambert 2007).
