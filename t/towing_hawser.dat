2500|$|On January 20, 1893, Ice Boat No. 3 {{arrived at}} the Delaware Breakwater with the Reading Railroad steamer Panther in tow, which had {{experienced}} continual westerly winds and snowstorms since departing Newburyport, Massachusetts ten days earlier.

The captain of Giovanni sued the City of Philadelphia for damages and won the ensuing court case, with the master of the ice boat found to have exercised [...] "gross carelessness" [...] for failing to see the Giovanni in time, and for his [...] "sudden veering" [...] manoeuvre which caused the hawser to catch on Standards [...] and snap.|$|E

Michigan was drawn up to Drake so that her bow was up against Drakes stern quarter on the leeward side. With the two wooden hulls grinding against each other, the crew of Michigan leaped to Drake when the waves brought the two decks level to one another. Just as the last of the Michigans crew were safely transferred to Drake, the wind carried Michigan into a sea trough causing her jib boom that jutted forward from her forepeak to rake across length of Drake.

50|$|The {{worsening}} {{weather was}} causing serious {{strain on the}} cruiser's hull and {{it was decided to}} continue the tow with Arethusa stern-first. The tow was slipped and re-connected with some difficulty; by this time Thornton had been on the bridge for three days. The bridge staff were also exhausted; off-duty seamen were pressed into moving the heavy <b>towing</b> <b>hawsers</b> into position. Once everything was in place, the tow towards Alexandria continued at three knots.|$|R
25|$|Preparation for the patrols {{began in}} November, {{with all the}} ship's equipment, {{including}} masts, sails, rigging, boats, tackle, steering gear, pumps etc. being carefully inspected and repaired or renewed where necessary.

The ship would additionally be fitted over the cutwater with an iron, V-shaped icebreaker 3/8 of an inch thick and extending 18inches {{above and below the}} waterline, secured by a number of heavy chains.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the many ferry trips each way per day, tugs with <b>hawser</b> <b>tows</b> and various types of naval and recreational craft all contribute to a considerable collision hazard, particularly at the sharp bend off Point Glover. Strong tidal conditions prevail in this vicinity, and deep-draft outbound vessels making the sharp turn may be unavoidably set well over to the eastern shore.|$|R
5000|$|After the war {{she moved}} to Falmouth and in 1949 was {{described}} as [...] "a battered and engineless old hulk which once took part in many dramatic sea rescues off Margate". She became a houseboat and made her final journey in 1957 when Willi Froelich, an ex Luftwaffe war prisoner, tried to sail his family home to Germany. They got into difficulty near Ostend and were taken under <b>tow,</b> but the <b>hawser</b> snapped. After drifting for a while, the surfboat broke her bow in rough seas and sank.|$|R
50|$|Chapman {{returned}} to escorting convoys, mainly between Milford Haven and Plymouth. On 1 February 1799, Chapman sailed from Milford with 25 vessels for Plymouth. The wind {{picked up and}} on 2 February, one of the convoy, the Helen and Mary, Thomas, master, lost her bowsprit, foremast, and main-top mast. She hoisted a reversed ensign as a signal {{as a sign of}} distress. Because of the severity of the winds, {{it was not until the}} next day that Chapman could get a hawser to Helen and Mary. Chapman started a <b>tow,</b> but the <b>hawser</b> broke. Eventually Chapman was able to get a hawser aboard again and tow Helen and Mary into Falmouth; Helen and Mary would have foundered without Chapmans assistance.|$|R

50|$|At 04:00 AM on {{the night}} of 14 December 2003 the ship was on a {{southbound}} course between Ålesund and Måløy when the main power supply failed and Midnatsol lost all engine power. The ship was approaching an underwater reef and the anchors were set out in an attempt to stop the drift, but the attempt failed. All 102 passengers were ordered to the lifeboats after an attempt to connect a <b>towing</b> <b>hawser</b> from another vessel also failed. The situation was very critical and Midnatsol sent a Mayday message. The ship was only 150 meters from shore when one of the anchors finally caught. Not long after, the crew managed to restart the main engines and the ship went on to Florø. The cause of the engine stoppage was an overgrown inlet to the engines coolant systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{yard was}} named Petrozavod in 1913. Since the {{beginning}} of 1915 the Admiralty yard used the premises for artillery ammunition production. The old and decayed cradles and large sheds were torn down in the same August. Following the October Revolution in 1917, the yard built non-self-propelled vessels. Hawser production began in 1931 {{and later in the}} same decade the yard started building naval trawlers for the Soviet Navy. During the Great Patriotic War in 1941-1945 the yard produced shells and modified trawlers for military purposes; additionally, 118 cutters and 14 barges were built for the Road of Life. <b>Towing</b> <b>hawser</b> production ended in 1973 and the plant was subsequently renewed; the production focused now on shipbuilding machinery. The factory became a part of RITM Scientific Production Association. In 1994 it was privatised and became an open joint-stock company, which went bankrupt in 2001.|$|E
50|$|With the Union Victory and {{occupation}} of the south, transport was administered by the US Army and Navy. The year 1864 brought an all-time low water mark on Upper Mississippi mark for all subsequent measurements. Stern wheelers proved more adaptable than side wheelers for barges.Immediately after the war, passenger steamboats become larger, faster and floating palaces began to appear; on the freight barges salt, hay, iron ore, and grain were carried. A few boats specialized in pushing huge log rafts downstream to lumber mills. By 1850, a system of moving barges and log rafts lashed alongside and ahead of the towboat was developed which allowed greater control than <b>towing</b> on a <b>hawser.</b> This type of service favored sternwheel propelled boats over sidewheelers and promoted other improvements as well. Towboats became a distinct type by 1860. Sand and gravel for construction was dredged up from river bottoms, and pumped aboard cargo barges. Simple hydraulic dredging rigs on small barges did the work. Towboats moved the dredge and sand barges around as needed.|$|R

5000|$|Clark {{describes}} {{a party of}} two hundred people greeting {{the arrival of the}} Witch of the Wave in Salem, Massachusetts.At about eleven o'clock, everything being ready, the Witch of the Wave, with colors flying and the Boston Cadet Band on board playing [...] "The Star Spangled Banner," [...] was towed out into the stream amid the shouts and cheers of a multitude of people, who thronged the wharves and shipyards along the river. After passing through the Narrows and rounding New Castle Point, the R. B. Forbes, which had been towing alongside, took her hawser out ahead and shaped a course for Cape Ann, which brought the wind well over the starboard quarter. The breeze had freshened, though the sea was still quite smooth, and this, with the clear, blue sky and bright sunshine, made a day altogether too fine to be spent on shore.Many of those on board were interested to see what effect some canvas would have on the new clipper, so Mr. Raynes said to Captain Bertram that he thought it might perhaps be a good plan to set some sail, [...] "just to assist the tow-boat a little." [...] Captain Bertram, with a twinkle in his eye, said he thought so, too, and gave orders to loose the topsails, jib, and foretopmast staysail. The Witch of the Wave had a crew of Portsmouth riggers ... and it did not take them long to put the topsails on her. As soon as the yards were braced, she began to dart through the water like a fish, and soon ranged up on the weather beam of the R. B. Forbes, the <b>hawser</b> <b>towing</b> between them with the bight skipping along among the blue waves in showers of sparkling spray. On board the R. B. Forbes the safety valve was lifting, with steam at thirty pounds pressure ... There was great joy on board the Witch of the Wave, with clapping of hands and waving of handkerchiefs, while the band struck up [...] "A Life on the Ocean Wave." [...] The log was hove, and she took nine and one half knots off the reel. The topsail yards were then lowered on the caps, and the reef tackles hauled out, yet with only this small canvas, the R. B. Forbes did not have much towing to do ...|$|R
