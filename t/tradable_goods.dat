A discourse-analytical perspective on the process of commodification and market creation is developed in order to assess how avoided deforestation is being made tradable. Going beyond existing approaches, such a perspective enables us to highlight the contestedness and contingency of the commodification and market creation process.

However, haggling for food items is strongly discouraged in Southeast Asia and is considered an insult, because food is seen as a common necessity that is not to be treated as a <b>tradable</b> <b>good.</b>|$|R

The paper presents an example where it necessary to simultaneously introduce heterogeneity in both dimensions (trade costs and productivity) to obtain correct results. If one considers heterogeneity in one dimension at a time and pieces together the results, one would conclude that a reduction in trade costs would make more <b>goods</b> <b>tradable</b> and more varieties of every <b>tradable</b> <b>good</b> traded.

Taking into account such features, as the new situation generated by the emergence of cognitive capitalism forces us to do, requires a major change in paradigm. In the new “bio-economic” paradigm, classical distinctions between production and reproduction, consumption and production, leisure and work tend to vanish, while labor increasingly appears as a common good.

If the home country imposes a 20% tariff on shoes, but no tariff on leather, shoes would sell for $180 in the home country, and the value added for the domestic shoe maker would increase by $30, from $50 to $80. The domestic shoe maker is afforded a 60% effective rate of protection per dollar of value added.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reduction}} in the current account deficit is achieved through a decrease in domestic aggregate demand for <b>tradable</b> <b>goods.</b> Since tradable and non-tradable goods are complements, this also reduces demand for non-tradable goods.

These firms get lower revenues, which reduce their ability to repay their loans. As a result, banks face a higher rate of non-performing loans from this sector.

In an integrated market, the price of a <b>tradable</b> <b>good</b> at any location is determined by the national market, not local demand. Based on this, the strength of dependence of local prices on local demand is used to detect and measure market segmentation. The costs of a staples basket across almost all Russian regions with a monthly frequency are used as the empirical material. The pattern found suggests that over the time span under consideration the degree of Russia's goods market integration was relatively stable, fluctuating around some level; no significant improvements or deteriorations were detected. ...|$|R
