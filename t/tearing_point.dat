5000|$|The {{gameplay}} in True Tears requires little player interaction as {{much time}} is spent on reading the text that appears on the lower portion of the screen, representing either dialogue between characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Before the beginning of every week in the game's storyline, the player is given the option to plan a schedule, and is allowed to pick and view any three days of the given week. Different events occur depending on the days that the player chooses. Every so often, the player will come to a [...] "decision point" [...] {{where he or she}} is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. Depending on which choice the player makes, the [...] "tear points" [...] of the heroine associated with {{the events of the day}} would either increase, decrease, or remains the same. [...] "Tear points" [...] act as a system notifying the player how well he or she is treating a certain character. If a character's <b>tear</b> <b>points</b> exceed the maximum amount of eight, her ending is rendered inaccessible during that specific playthrough. There are multiple plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience. To view all of the plot lines, the player will need to replay the game multiple times and make different schedules and choices during decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction.|$|R

50|$|The {{vitreous}} membrane is more firmly {{attached to the}} retina anteriorly, at a structure called the vitreous base. The membrane does not normally detach from the vitreous base, although it can be detached with extreme trauma. However, the vitreous base may have an irregular posterior edge. When the edge is irregular, {{the forces of the}} {{vitreous membrane}} peeling off the retina can become concentrated at small posterior extensions of the vitreous base. Similarly, in some people with retinal lesions such as lattice retinal degeneration or chorio-retinal scars, the vitreous membrane may be abnormally adherent to the retina. If enough traction occurs the retina may <b>tear</b> at these <b>points.</b> If there are only small <b>point</b> <b>tears,</b> these can allow glial cells to enter the vitreous humor and proliferate to create a thin epiretinal membrane that distorts vision. In more severe cases, vitreous fluid may seep under the tear, separating the retina {{from the back of the}} eye, creating a retinal detachment. Trauma can be any form from a blunt force trauma to the face such as a boxer's punch or even in some cases has been known to be from extremely vigorous coughing or blowing of the nose.|$|R

40|$|Supervised mapping methods project multi-dimensional labeled data onto a 2 -dimensional space {{attempting}} to preserve both data similarities and topology of classes. Supervised mappings {{are expected to}} help the user to understand the underlying original class structure and to classify new data visually. Several methods {{have been designed to}} achieve supervised mapping, but many of them modify original distances prior to the mapping so that original data similarities are corrupted and even overlapping classes tend to be separated onto the map ignoring their original topology. We propose ClassiMap, an alternative method for supervised mapping. Mappings come with distortions which can be split between <b>tears</b> (close <b>points</b> mapped far apart) and false neighborhoods (points far apart mapped as neighbors). Some mapping methods favor the former while others favor the latter. ClassiMap switches between such mapping methods so that tears tend to appear between classes and false neighborhood within classes, better preserving classes' topology. We also propose two new objective criteria instead of the usual subjective visual inspection to perform fair comparisons of supervised mapping methods. ClassiMap appears to be the best supervised mapping method according to these criteria in our experiments on synthetic and real datasets. Comment: 2 page...|$|R
