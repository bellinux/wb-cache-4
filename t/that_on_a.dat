5|$|Bonstelle {{was born}} to Helen and Joseph Bonesteel on her father's farm {{near the town of}} Greece, New York, the {{youngest}} of their eight children. Her exact date of birth is unknown, and she kept it a secret, but it was sometime in November 1869 – 1871. Originally named Bonesteel, later in life she changed it to Bonstelle after, according to legend, seeing it misspelled like <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> theater marquee.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{period the}} Serapeum in Alexandria was also {{said to have}} {{contained}} a solar alignment so <b>that,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> specific sunrise, a shaft of light would pass across the lips {{of the statue of}} Serapis thus symbolising the Sun saluting the god.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Baltic region of Livonia, people {{designated}} as werewolves went underground {{in the shape}} of dogs to fight against sorcerers who stole the shoots of the grain. If the werewolves failed to wrest the shoots, there would be famine. In Romania, strigoi were people born with a caul, which they donned upon reaching adulthood; this made them invisible. They then travelled in animal form to the meadow {{at the end of the}} world. There they fought each other all night, becoming reconciled in the morning. The reason for the fight is not specified. The Circassians told <b>that,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> certain night of the year, their sorcerers fought with the sorcerers of the Abkhaz people, trying to suck each other's blood.|$|E

5|$|Measurements of {{the effects}} of the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, <b>that,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.|$|E
5|$|On a Clear Night drew {{mixed reviews}} from critics both in Australia and abroad. More {{positive}} reviews compared Higgins to Sarah McLachlan and Alanis Morissette, and praised the album's maturity and assertiveness compared to The Sound of White. Less complimentary reviews said <b>that</b> <b>On</b> <b>a</b> Clear Night fails to lift Higgins above {{the level of}} her peers. Higgins was nominated for four awards at the 2007 ARIA Music Awards and won 'Best Female Artist'.|$|E
5|$|Only a small {{fraction}} of reparations were ever paid. In fact, the historian Stephen Schuker demonstrates in American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919–33, that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German outpayments so <b>that,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan.|$|E

5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E

On 2 March, Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament that the Singapore legal team has studied Malaysia’s application carefully, including the three documents relied on by Malaysia to support its application, and strongly believes that the documents relied on by Malaysia do not satisfy the criteria under Article 61. Singapore has until 14 June to submit to the ICJ its comprehensive and compelling rebuttal to Malaysia’s application.|$|E

The valves are mounted on a common shaft, which produces a tremolo or vibrato effect while spinning. The vibraphone also has a sustain pedal similar to <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> piano. With the pedal up, the bars are all damped and produce a shortened sound. With the pedal down, they sound for several seconds.|$|E

From August 30 to December 10, 1941, there were {{a large number of}} shootings, in which about 600 Jews, 100 Communists, and 100 Gypsies were killed. Anders and Dubrovskis estimate the total victims through August 15, 1941 as 153 plus or minus 68.
