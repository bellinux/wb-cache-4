30|$|Together, {{rice and}} foxtail millet formed a {{versatile}} and risk-resistant package that {{was able to}} adapt to the varying altitudes, water, and climatic conditions which characterize the landscape of Southwestern China. The mountainous foothills of Yunnan Province required extensive <b>terracing</b> <b>work</b> in order for rice paddy cultivation systems to become successful in this area. In the early stages of agricultural expansion into this area, a switch to foxtail millet may have facilitated movement into more challenging vertical topographies. Here, rice agriculture may have been initially limited to the narrow valley bottoms. In order to reach the levels of productivity achieved in flat lands such as the Yangtze delta or the Chengdu Plain, extensive landscaping and the creation of terraces would have been necessary. By substituting foxtail millet in the early times of expansion, a food source was assured in a challenging environment. Recent evidence from Central Thailand suggests that millet agriculture may have preceded the spread of rice agriculture into Southeast Asia (Weber et al. 2010). More systematic flotation and sampling of archaeological sites may show that {{the same is true for}} Southwest China.|$|E
40|$|Large of {{degraded}} forest {{areas in}} Indonesia namely 19. 5 million ha and its rate start from 1. 8 to 2. 84 million ha years- 1. Initially {{in the form}} of virgin forests, they were degraded become low potential forest, scrub, bush, grass land to critical land. The critical land is very dangerous for natural resources establishment because happened the high erosion and menacing flood. The solutions to minimize the environmental damage in the critical land are developing the soil conservation technique in the sites. This research was aimed to collect and analyze some soil conservation techniques and its implementation in the degraded land of forest regions. The research was conducted with literature and fields study in the PT. Gunung Meranti areas, Kapuas District, Central Kalimantan Province. Some soil conservation techniques that applied in the degraded land of forest regions are wet masonry, stone <b>terrace</b> <b>works,</b> gabion works,log retaining works,log grib works,bamboo and wicker terrace, soil bag <b>terrace</b> <b>works</b> and straw mat <b>terrace</b> <b>works.</b> To support the civil and vegetation soil conservation technique, commonly using the water channels as sod water channel works, stone water channel works, soil bag water channel works and catchment pipe culvert...|$|R

Normal Low picked out three star players: 'the supreme goalscorer' Graham Barnett, 'the find of the season' Ken Hancock and that 'model of consistency' Stan Steele. With five forwards hitting double figures, a profit being made and the gate receipts increasing, optimism was high in Burslem, especially with the Bycars End <b>terrace</b> <b>work</b> being completed leading to an overall capacity of 50,000.|$|R

A second phase had been planned to begin in 1988, but the release of the Taylor Report caused the plans to be redrawn and the proposed costs escalated to £25 million.

50|$|Gradually {{improvements}} {{were made}} to the ground. In 1926 a grandstand was acquired from Epsom Downs Racecourse, dismantled, moved and rebuilt on the ground to provide much needed seating. This survived until it was finally blown down by gales in March 1968. Slowly each side was converted from grass banking to <b>terracing</b> (this <b>work</b> finally being completed in 1991) and various offices, dressing rooms, coverings for terraces and a clubhouse and function room were added to the site. Floodlights were added in 1967 and a new grandstand was built in 1972 and extended in 1996. A great many of these structures were destroyed in an arson attack in 2000 which gutted the clubhouse, a new 'temporary' clubhouse has been in place since 2000.|$|R

25|$|The {{foundations}} {{represented the}} biggest technical challenge {{to be overcome}} by the Mughal builders. In order to support the considerable load resulting from the mausoleum, the sands of the riverbank needed to be stabilised. To this end, wells were sunk and then cased in timber and finally filled with rubble, iron and mortar— essentially acting as augured piles. After construction of the <b>terrace</b> was completed, <b>work</b> began simultaneously {{on the rest of}} the complex.

2500|$|Some in the {{scientific}} community are skeptical of Pepperberg's findings, pointing to Alex's communications as operant conditioning. Critics point to the case of Clever Hans, a horse who could apparently count, but who was actually understanding subtle cues from the questioner. [...] In another case, Nim Chimpsky, a chimpanzee was thought to be using language, but there is some debate over whether he simply imitated his teacher. Dr. Herbert <b>Terrace,</b> who <b>worked</b> with Nim Chimpsky, says he thinks Alex performed by rote rather than using language; he calls Alex's responses [...] "a complex discriminating performance", adding that in every situation, [...] "there is an external stimulus that guides his response." [...] However, supporters of Alex say that Alex was able to talk to and perform for anyone involved in the project as well as complete strangers who recorded findings, though such interactions do not involve the strict conditions required to exclude rote and operant responding.|$|R
