5|$|For the French, the Rhine Campaign of 1795 proved {{especially}} disastrous, {{although they}} had achieved some success in other theaters of war (see for example, War of <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> (1793–95)).|$|E
5|$|Basque, not an Indo-European language, {{survived in}} the region of <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees.</b> The people of southwestern Gaul and northeastern Hispania (roughly present-day Aquitaine and Navarre) were {{regarded}} by Julius Caesar as ethnically distinct from the Celts, and the Aquitanian language they spoke was Vasconic like Basque, judging from place names. The Aquitani adopted Latin under Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|Onneca {{was thus}} the {{paternal}} grandmother of Abd-ar-Rahman III, who {{inherited from her}} {{as well as from}} his mother Muzna hailing from <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> (probably a Basque) European facial features such as blue eyes and light reddish hair that he attempted to alter (notably through hair coloring) in order to look more typically Arab.|$|E
50|$|The war {{was fought}} in <b>the</b> eastern <b>Pyrenees,</b> <b>the</b> western <b>Pyrenees,</b> at <b>the</b> French port of Toulon, and at sea. In 1793, a Spanish army invaded Roussillon in <b>the</b> eastern <b>Pyrenees</b> and {{maintained}} itself on French soil through April 1794. The French army drove the Spanish back into Catalonia and inflicted a serious defeat {{on it in}} November 1794. After February 1795, the war in <b>the</b> eastern <b>Pyrenees</b> became a stalemate. In <b>the</b> western <b>Pyrenees,</b> <b>the</b> French began to win in 1794. By 1795, the French army controlled a portion of northeast Spain.|$|R

5|$|The armier {{were men}} from Ariège in <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> who {{could see and}} talk to the souls of the dead. The mesultane were women and girls in Georgia who plunged into a {{lethargy}} and travelled in spirit {{to the land of the}} dead, to communicate with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of {{mountains in the}} Tour de France had also been successful. After the {{introduction of}} the Vosges in the 1905 Tour de France, in 1906 the Massif Central were climbed, followed by <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> in 1910 and the Alps in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Crillon's {{service with}} Spain was further rewarded in 1783 {{with the title}} of Knight of the Golden Fleece. He was {{appointed}} captain-general of the kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia. He remained in Spain {{during the years of}} the French Revolutionary Wars, writing his memoirs (Memoires militaires de Louis de Berton des Balbes de Quiers), published in 1791.) He took no part in the War of <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> (1793–95) between Spain and revolutionary France, but {{played a significant role in}} agreeing the peace that terminated the conflict. He died in Madrid in June 1796.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{precipitation}} the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in <b>the</b> eastern <b>Pyrenees</b> because of <b>the</b> moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the Bay of Biscay. After dropping its moisture over the western and central <b>Pyrenees,</b> <b>the</b> air is left dry over <b>the</b> eastern <b>Pyrenees.</b> <b>The</b> winter average temperature is -2 °C (28.4 °F).|$|R

40|$|The fluvial {{network of}} <b>the</b> Southern <b>Pyrenees</b> {{is an example}} of {{transverse}} drainage systems in young (alpine) mountain belts and it features well preserved fluvial terrace records. Some of <b>the</b> major Southern <b>Pyrenees</b> tributary rivers have been studied previously and have some age controls on their fluvial terrace levels.

In this paper, we present new GIS data, field observations and exposure ages obtained from in situ produced terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides...|$|R
5|$|On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention {{declared}} war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, but these were countered by French victories at Tourcouring (1794), Dunkirk, and Haguenau. For the French, the Rhine Campaign of 1795 proved especially disastrous, although they had achieved some success in other theaters of war (see for example, War of <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> (1793–1795).|$|E
5|$|The Castillonnais is used {{mainly for}} {{pleasure}} riding, {{and it is}} well adapted to the mountainous terrain of <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees,</b> which makes is useful for equestrian tourism in the area. It {{can be used for}} driving, and is sometimes seen in dressage competitions. Some Castillonnais are used for logging and as pack horses for taking food and equipment to mountainous areas otherwise only accessible by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens is now {{considered}} a multi-purpose recreational horse that is also attached to the cultural identity of the Ariege region. They are used for leisure and competitive trail riding. They are consistently ranked in the French national competitive trail riding championships, and in 1998, a Mérens {{finished second in the}} European Championships. In 1998, Stéphane Bigot made a crossing of <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> on a Mérens. Many tourist facilities now offer guided trail rides through the mountains of Ariege on Mérens horses, with some centers having a stable consisting entirely of members of the breed.|$|E
50|$|One breed {{for which}} lack of dewclaws is {{considered}} a fault is <b>the</b> Great <b>Pyrenees.</b> Dewclaws in <b>the</b> Great <b>Pyrenees</b> {{are attached to the}} bony structure of the leg. Removal is detrimental to this breed and should not be performed.|$|R
50|$|Agrotis simplonia is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It {{is found}} in <b>the</b> Alps, <b>Pyrenees,</b> <b>the</b> Cantabrian Mountains and the Apennine Mountains on heights between 1,200 and 3,000 meters.|$|R
50|$|On the French side <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees's</b> slopes descend rather abruptly, thus on the {{northern}} side, the Pre-Pyrenees are confined to the Corbières Range, towards {{the eastern end of}} the mountain system. The Massif de Plantaurel further west deserves mention as well, although not as clearly a foothill.|$|R
5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very quickly in the lab and in <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E
5|$|Today, Mérens {{closest to}} the {{original}} type and lifestyle {{are found in the}} valleys of the high mountains of <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees,</b> near Andorra. The majority of Mérens breeding still takes place in Ariege, the traditional homeland of the breed. However, they can also be found in almost all regions of France, including the Alps, the Cévennes, the Centre, the Massif Central and the Île-de-France. Besides the annual breed show in Bouan, Mérens are also commonly seen at the Paris International Agricultural Show and other major horse shows.|$|E
5|$|VThe king of Spain (of the time) {{commissioned}} Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps as {{a friendly}} gesture towards Napoleon, {{hoping that the}} flattering gift would strengthen relationships between France and Spain, {{to the degree that}} Napoleon would not consider invading Spain and taking it over, after he became emperor. However, the king of Spain's attempt failed, and, soon after Napoleon crowned himself emperor, he crossed <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> and conquered Spain.|$|E

5|$|Delambre used a {{baseline}} of about 10km in length along a straight road, located close to Melun. In an operation taking six weeks, the baseline was accurately measured using four platinum rods, each of length two toise (about 3.9m). Thereafter he used, where possible, the triangulation points used by Cassini in his 1744 survey of France. Méchain's baseline, {{of a similar}} length, and also on a straight section of road was in the Perpignan area. Although Méchain's sector was half the length of Delambre, it included <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> and hitherto unsurveyed parts of Spain. After the two surveyors met, each computed the other's baseline in order to cross-check their results and they then recomputed the kilometre. Their result came out at 0.144lignes shorter than the provisional value, a difference of about 0.03%.|$|E
5|$|Ebner has {{additionally}} written narrative fiction (novels, short stories, short prose), {{essays and}} poems. His poetry {{is written in}} German and Catalan. Supported by a subsidy for literature from the Austrian government, he went to Andorra in 2007 to write an essay about the country in <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees.</b> He also translated the novel L'Absent written by the Catalan author Josep Navarro Santaeulàlia, into German. Ebner's cultural essays about Catalan culture, {{such as that of}} Barcelona and Andorra, have been published by the magazines Literatur und Kritik and Zitig. His first collection of short stories, Lose (Destinies), was published in 2007. Of its 45 stories, twenty-two had already been printed in newspapers, literary magazines or anthologies. In 2008, Ebner published two other books of narrative fiction, among them the short novel Hominide.|$|E
5|$|Julius Caesar {{mentions}} {{small black}} horses that resemble the Mérens in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War), when discussing {{the defeat of}} Crassus by the Sotiates and their cavalry. Historian Paul Prunet {{was the first to}} link the animals discussed by Caesar to the Mérens, although the relationship has not been definitely established. The location of the Sotiates is the subject of controversy, with some authors placing them in the district of Nerac and others near Foix. The Mérens may have been used as a pack animal by the Romans, who may have taken some of the animals with them when they left. The small black horse from <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> is described throughout antiquity.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the Brunswick Oels Jägers gave a good {{account of}} {{themselves}} during the war. The regiment — really a single battalion—arrived in Portugal in early 1811. The Duke of Wellington distributed one company to the 4th Division and two companies to the 5th Division as skirmishers, while the remaining nine companies {{served in the}} newly formed 7th Division. The Oels remained in this organization {{until the end of}} the war in April 1814. During this period, the Oels served in most of the major battles including Fuentes de Onoro, Salamanca, Vitoria, <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees,</b> Nivelle, the Nive, and Orthez.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October MacLachlan was {{promoted}} to flying officer, and undertook an attack mission. During {{the course of the}} flight his wingtip made contact with the ground but he was able to return to base. The squadron settled down into winter quarters until March when they were reassigned to the French border region with Spain. On 1 April he celebrated his 21st birthday and took the opportunity of driving from Perpignan across the frontier into <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees</b> to celebrate it. On 9 April the squadron was put on alert when the Germans invaded Denmark and Norway and the squadron were soon relocated to northern France at Mourmelon. On 10 May the Phoney War came to a close with the German invasion of Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, Spain was {{approached}} by the US ambassador with a request to use Spanish ports for evacuating the wounded, following landings in southern France. Originally the plan had been to request access {{for the purposes of}} staging the initial invasion. However, this was toned down in light of historical resistance to any foreign occupation of Spanish soil as well as the implausibility of invading France via <b>the</b> <b>Pyrenees.</b> On 5 June the British ambassador reinforced the request, and after some discussion the Spanish government agreed but only after an invasion had occurred, and {{under the supervision of the}} Red Cross. To emphasise the change in objective, the Allies followed this up with Operation Ferdinand which threatened an invasion in Italy.|$|E
