500|$|As a child, Rogen did {{not want}} to pursue any career other than comedy, stating [...] "As soon as I {{realized}} you could be funny as a job, that was <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>I</b> wanted". He got his start in show business at age 12 after enrolling in a comedy workshop taught by Mark Pooley. His early comedy routines involved jokes about his bar mitzvah, his grandparents, and his camp counsellors. During his teenage years he would perform stand-up comedy routines at places like bar mitzvahs and small parties, later shifting to bars. A mohel paid him to write jokes. At the age of13, he co-wrote a rough draft of Superbad with childhood friend Evan Goldberg, whom he had met at bar mitzvah classes. Based on their teenage experiences, Rogen and Goldberg spent the rest of their time in high school polishing the script. They initially worried that American Pie (1999) had beaten them to the idea for the movie, but they decided that the film [...] "managed to totally avoid all honest interaction between characters... which is what we're going for." ...|$|E
500|$|Ken Keeler, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein all {{defend the}} episode in its DVD commentary. Keeler asserts, [...] "I am very, {{very proud of}} <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>I</b> did on this episode. This is the best episode of {{television}} I feel I ever wrote." [...] He describes the episode as a commentary on [...] "people who like things {{just the way they}} are", and remarks, [...] "It never seems to have occurred to anyone that this episode is about the people who hate it." [...] However, Keeler says that some of the dialogue was changed from his original draft, making this point less obvious. Oakley and Weinstein explain that they wanted to push the boundaries of the series while working as show-runners, and advise viewers to treat [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as an [...] "experiment". They surmise that the negative reception was partly {{due to the fact that}} it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, [...] "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"). They also describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode as non-canonical, divorced from the larger series.|$|E

500|$|Zeta-Jones {{participated in}} school stage shows {{from a young}} age and gained local media {{attention}} when her rendition of a Shirley Bassey song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre. At the age of nine, she was selected to play one of the orphan girls in a West End production of the musical Annie, and in her early teens, she became a national tap-dancing champion. In 1981 she played the lead role of Annie in a Swansea production of the musical, which was staged at the Swansea Grand Theatre. Two years later, she played the lead role of Tallulah in a West End production of Bugsy Malone. When she was 15, Zeta-Jones {{dropped out of school}} without obtaining O-levels and decided to live in London to pursue a full-time acting career; she was also engaged to perform in a touring production of The Pajama Game. Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, [...] "I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. It might take me two tries, but I always got <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> <b>I</b> figured out what they wanted". She went on to attend the independent Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick, London, for a three-year course in musical theatre.|$|E
500|$|After {{losing his}} job at Bramall Lane, he was {{immediately}} offered a three-year contract at former club Port Vale. He signed the contract within days, saying {{it was time to}} [...] "finish <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>I</b> started". Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe. Days {{before the start of the}} season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion, and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope, also a free transfer signing. After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals – both scoring and conceding – Adams decided to give his players [...] "a kick up the backside" [...] by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers (on loan) and Robert Kozluk. He stepped down as a director on 5 November, the day of his 100th game in charge at Port Vale, after former director Stan Meigh withdrew the £50,000 sponsorship he had provided to keep Adams on the board of directors.|$|E

So, I’m more surprised than anyone that we’ve lasted this long.

2500|$|Jobs and Apple {{became more}} successful, and his {{relationship}} with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now {{a part of their}} relationship, [...] and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple [...] Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take [...] "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." [...] Both Holt and Jobs felt {{that it would be a}} good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan [...] "turned ugly" [...] at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: [...] "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that." [...] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could [...] "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> <b>I</b> don't get what the problem is." [...] Brennan however notes that she [...] "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it." ...|$|E
