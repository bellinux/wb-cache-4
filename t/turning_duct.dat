The experimental data were collected by Taylor, Whitelaw, and Yianneskis with a laser Doppler velocimeter system in a 90 deg <b>turning</b> <b>duct</b> of square cross-section. The agreement between the viscous and inviscid computations was generally very good for the streamwise primary velocity and the radial secondary velocity, except at the walls, where slip conditions were specified for the inviscid code. The agreement between both the computations and the experimental data was not as close, especially at the 60. 0 deg and 77. 5 deg angular positions within the duct. This disagreement was attributed to incomplete modeling of the vortex development near the suction surface...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Compressor {{transition}} ducts, {{also referred to}} as S-shaped ducts, are used to connect the low- or intermediate-pressure compressor (LPC) with the high-pressure compressor (HPC) in 2 - and 3 -spool turbofan engine configurations respectively. This paper focuses on studies on a concept which aims to shorten the compressor module by introducing aerodynamically lifting/turning struts in the compressor transition duct. This concept is labeled fully turning, as the struts in the duct assume the complete aerodynamic function of the last row of stators of the LPC. Through CFD analysis and low-speed experimental evaluation, this concept is further developed with promising results. It is shown that there is potential to reduce the length of the compressor module by 25 % of the duct length through elimination of the last stator row in the LPC, whilst providing comparable or improved aerodynamic performance compared to a conventional configuration.

40|$|Simulation {{technology}} {{can play an}} important role in rocket engine test facility design and development by assessing risks, providing analysis of dynamic pressure and thermal loads, identifying failure modes and predicting anomalous behavior of critical systems. Advanced numerical tools assume greater significance in supporting testing and design of high altitude testing facilities and plume induced testing environments of high thrust engines because of the greater inter-dependence and synergy in the functioning of the different sub-systems. This is especially true for facilities such as the proposed A- 3 facility at NASA SSC because of a challenging operating envelope linked to variable throttle conditions at relatively low chamber pressures. Facility designs in this case will require a complex network of diffuser ducts, steam ejector trains, fast operating valves, cooling water systems and flow diverters that need to be characterized for steady state performance. In this paper, we will demonstrate with the use of CFD analyses s advanced capability to evaluate supersonic diffuser and steam ejector performance in a sub-scale A- 3 facility at NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) where extensive testing was performed. Furthermore, the focus in this paper relates to modeling of critical sub-systems and components used in facilities such as the A- 3 facility. The work here will address deficiencies in empirical models and current CFD analyses that are used for design of supersonic diffusers/turning vanes/ejectors as well as analyses for confined plumes and venting processes. The primary areas that will be addressed are: (1) supersonic diffuser performance including analyses of thermal loads (2) accurate shock capturing in the diffuser duct; (3) effect of <b>turning</b> <b>duct</b> on the performance of the facility (4) prediction of mass flow rates and performance classification for steam ejectors (5) comparisons with test data from sub-scale diffuser testing and assessment of confidence levels in CFD based flowpath modeling of the facility. The analyses tools used here expand on the multi-element unstructured CFD which has been tailored and validated for impingement dynamics of dry plumes, complex valve/feed systems, and high pressure propellant delivery systems used in engine and component test stands at NASA SSC. The analyses performed in the evaluation of the sub-scale diffuser facility explored several important factors that influence modeling and understanding of facility operation such as (a) importance of modeling the facility with Real Gas approximation, (b) approximating the cluster of steam ejector nozzles as a single annular nozzle, (c) existence of mixed subsonic/supersonic flow downstream of the <b>turning</b> <b>duct,</b> and (d) inadequacy of two-equation turbulence models in predicting the correct pressurization in the <b>turning</b> <b>duct</b> and expansion of the second stage steam ejectors. The procedure used for modeling the facility was as follows: (i) The engine, test cell and first stage ejectors were simulated with an axisymmetric approximation (ii) the <b>turning</b> <b>duct,</b> second stage ejectors and the piping downstream of the second stage ejectors were analyzed with a three-dimensional simulation utilizing a half-plane symmetry approximation. The solution i. e. primitive variables such as pressure, velocity components, temperature and turbulence quantities were passed from the first computational domain and specified as a supersonic boundary condition for the second simulation. (iii) The third domain comprised of the exit diffuser and the region in the vicinity of the facility (primary included to get the correct shock structure at the exit of the facility and entrainment characteristics). The first set of simulations comprising the engine, test cell and first stage ejectors was carried out both as a turbulent real gas calculation as well as a turbulent perfect gas calculation. A comparison for the two cases (Real Turbulent and Perfect gas turbulent) of the Ma Number distribution and temperature distributions are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. The Mach Number distribution shows small yet distinct differences between the two cases such as locations of shocks/shock reflections and a slightly different impingement point on the wall of the diffuser from the expansion at the exit of the nozzle. Similarly the temperature distribution indicates different flow recirculation patterns in the test cell. Both cases capture all the essential flow phenomena such as the shock-boundary layer interaction, plume expansion, expansion of the first stage ejectors, mixing between the engine plume and the first stage ejector flow and pressurization due to the first stage ejectors. The final paper will discuss thermal loads on the walls of the diffuser and cooling mechanisms investigated...|$|E

The purpose of the present paper is to present the computational techniques used for the numerical integration of the flow and geometry equations proposed in Part 1.

30|$|First, the {{presence}} of a stable anatomic landmark, the parotid papilla, aids in locating the parotid duct, which is closely associated with the course of the facial nerve’s buccal branch. There have been numerous studies on anatomic markers associated with the paths of the facial nerves and their branches. The facial nerve divides into five branches within the parotid gland, and the buccal branch courses along the parotid duct between superficial and deep fascia in the masseter muscle region. Pogrel et al. reported that the distance between the parotid duct and the buccal branch of the facial nerve measured approximately 5.43 [*]±[*] 3.65  mm [1]. Son et al. reported that the distance was about 2.54 [*]±[*] 1.48  mm [4]. The parotid duct arises from the anterior aspect of the parotid gland and passes anteriorly in the masseter muscle region with a close proximity to the buccal branch of the facial nerve. At the anterior border of the masseter muscle, the <b>duct</b> <b>turns</b> medially through the buccal fat pad and buccinator muscle to its associated oral mucosa papillae [5, 6].

40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} computational program {{was conducted to}} examine the heat transfer distribution in a turbine rotor passage geometrically similiar to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) High Pressure Fuel Turbopump (HPFTP). Heat transfer was measured and computed for both the full-span suction and pressure surfaces of the rotor airfoil {{as well as for}} the hub endwall surface. The primary objective of the program was to provide a benchmark-quality data base for the assessment of rotor passage heat transfer computational procedures. The experimental portion of the study was conducted in a large-scale, ambient temperature, rotating turbine model. Heat transfer data were obtained using thermocouple and liquid-crystal techniques to measure temperature distributions on the thin, electrically-heated skin of the rotor passage model. Test data were obtained for various combinations of Reynolds number, rotor incidence angle and model surface roughness. The data are reported in the form of contour maps of Stanton number. These heat distribution maps revealed numerous local effects produced by the three-dimensional flows within the rotor passage. Of particular importance were regions of local enhancement produced on the airfoil suction surface by the main-passage and tip-leakage vortices and on the hub endwall by the leading-edge horseshoe vortex system. The computational portion consisted of the application of a well-posed parabolized Navier-Stokes analysis to the calculation of the three-dimensional viscous flow through ducts simulating the a gas turbine passage.

40|$|Simulation {{technology}} {{can play an}} important role in rocket engine test facility design and development by assessing risks, providing analysis of dynamic pressure and thermal loads, identifying failure modes and predicting anomalous behavior of critical systems. This is especially true for facilities such as the proposed A- 3 facility at NASA SSC because of a challenging operating envelope linked to variable throttle conditions at relatively low chamber pressures. Design Support of the feasibility of operating conditions and procedures is critical in such cases due to the possibility of startup/shutdown transients, moving shock structures, unsteady shock-boundary layer interactions and engine and diffuser unstart modes that can result in catastrophic failure. Analyses of such systems is difficult due to resolution requirements needed to accurately capture moving shock structures, shock-boundary layer interactions, two-phase flow regimes and engine unstart modes. In a companion paper, we will demonstrate with the use of CFD, steady analyses advanced capability to evaluate supersonic diffuser and steam ejector performance in the sub-scale A- 3 facility. In this paper we will address transient issues with the operation of the facility especially at startup and shutdown, and assess risks related to afterburning due to the interaction of a fuel rich plume with oxygen that is a by-product of the steam ejectors. The primary areas that will be addressed in this paper are: (1) analyses of unstart modes due to flow transients especially during startup/ignition, (2) engine safety during the shutdown process (3) interaction of steam ejectors with the primary plume i. e. flow transients as well as probability of afterburning. In this abstract we discuss unsteady analyses of the engine shutdown process. However, the final paper will include analyses of a staged startup, drawdown of the engine test cell pressure, and risk assessment of potential afterburning in the facility. Unsteady simulations have been carried out to study the engine shutdown process in the facility and understand the physics behind the interactions between the steam ejectors, the test cell and the supersonic diffuser. As a first approximation, to understand the dominant unsteady mechanisms in the engine test cell and the supersonic diffuser, the <b>turning</b> <b>duct</b> in the facility was removed. As the engine loses power a rarefaction wave travels downstream that disrupts the shock cell structure in the supersonic diffuser. Flow from the test cell is seen to expand into the supersonic diffuser section and re-pressurizes the area around the nozzle along with a upstream traveling compression wave that emanates from near the first stage ejectors. Flow from the first stage ejector expands to the center of the duct and a new shock train is formed between the first and second stage ejectors. Both stage ejectors keep the facility pressurized and prevent any large amplitude pressure fluctuations from affecting the engine nozzle. The resultant pressure loads the nozzle experiences in the shutdown process are small...|$|E
40|$|In a 2 -pass {{cooling system}} the {{pressure}} driven air flow dis-tribution is investigated experimentally using the non-intrusive PIV Technique. The generic model {{as part of}} a complex and sophisticated cooling system consists of two square-sectioned ducts with a length of 20 diameters and an inherent 180 degree bend. The system has been investigated basically with smooth walls (case 0) and, later on, with two different kinds of ribbed walls in both legs. Ribs are applied to enhance the cooling performance; they are placed on two opposite walls of both legs in a symmetric (case A) and an asymmetric manner (case B), respectively. The ribs are inclined with an angle of 45 degrees versus the duct axis (i. e. main flow direction). The applied rib lay-out is well-proved and optimized with respect to heat trans-fer improvement and the inherent pressure drop increase. The system rotates about an axis orthogonal to the centreline of the straight passes. The configuration was analyzed with the planar the two-component Particle Image Velocimetry (2 C PIV), which is capable of obtaining complete maps of the instantaneous as well as the averaged flow field even at high turbulence levels, which are typically present within <b>duct</b> <b>turns,</b> near ribs and, above all, during rotation. The presented investigations were conducted in stationary and rotating mode. Especially in the bend region separation phenomena and vortices with high local turbulence are apparent. The presence of ribs changes the fluid motion by generating additional vortices impinging the side walls. Flow visualization with injected oil smoke using the laser light sheet visualization technique was helpful to detect vortex structures and separations. Especially in the bend area separation regions and vortices with high local turbulence are apparent. The results shown in this paper demonstrate the effect of the 180 degree bend in combination with the two rib turbulator geometries for isothermal flow conditions excluding any buoy-ancy with and without rotation. Turbulent channel flow was investigated at a Reynolds number of 50, 000, derived with the hydraulic diameter of the pass, non-rotating and at a rotation number of 0. 02 which was chosen still moderate. Engine rele-vant rotation numbers are in order of. 1 or higher. A reconstruc-tion of model mountings will allow higher values for the next tests. Future work will expand to higher rotational speed and, also, will include buoyancy effects. This investigation shall help to clarify the complex flow phenomena due to the interaction of several vortices, present in two-pass cooling systems. The flow maps obtained with PIV are of good quality and high spatial resolution and therefore provide a test case for the development and validation of nu-merical simulation tools like the DLR flow solver TRACE which is not a topic of this paper...|$|R
