This led to the ratification of the Treaty of Windsor (1175) between Henry and Ruaidhrí. However, with both Diarmaid and Strongbow dead (in 1171 and 1176), Henry back in England and Ruaidhrí unable to curb his nominal vassals, within two years it was not worth the vellum it was inscribed upon. John de Courcy invaded and gained much of east Ulster in 1177, Raymond FitzGerald (also known as Raymond le Gros) had already captured Limerick and much of north Munster, while the other Norman families such as Prendergast, fitz Stephen, fitz Gerald, fitz Henry, de Ridelsford, de Cogan, and le Poer were actively carving out virtual kingdoms for themselves.|$|E

50|$|Historically, control {{programs}} have struggled <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> and proliferation of invasive bird populations in Australia. A new program in Canberra has reversed this trend regarding mynas.Since 2006 the Canberra Indian Myna Action Group (CIMAG) has implemented an effective control scheme, based upon large-scale trapping conducted by volunteers. As of June 2013 the Action Group has recorded over 45,000 myna captures in the Canberra region since 2006. This {{has reduced the}} myna's prevalence in the Canberra region from a ranking of third most prevalent bird species in 2006, to twentieth in 2012. This has correlated with anecdotal evidence of increased nesting activity and prevalence of native species in the Canberra region. Other volunteer organisations in Australia have begun to adopt the CIMAG model with similar success.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamics}} of bank lending to companies and private households in Bulgaria by applying a non-linear Markov switching error correction model (MS-ECM). The MS-ECM provides evidence for multiple structural breaks and improves the estimation results compared to a linear model. In particular we find {{a more or less}} pronounced, time-varying relation between bank lending and asset prices. We identify periods when corporate and household loans were driven to a greater extent by supply-side rather than long-run demand-side factors. We also find evidence for a regime switch due to the introduction of administrative measures <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> credit <b>expansion</b> in early 2005...|$|R
50|$|India {{is not a}} part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), citing {{concerns}} that it unfairly favours the established nuclear powers, and provides no provision for complete nuclear disarmament. Indian officials argued that India's refusal to sign the treaty stemmed from its fundamentally discriminatory character; the treaty places restrictions on the non-nuclear weapons states but does little <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> modernisation and <b>expansion</b> of <b>the</b> nuclear arsenals of the nuclear weapons states.|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} 1990 s {{much has been}} written about the return of foreign private capital to many of the larger Asian and Latin American countries. However, until 1992 there was little {{evidence}} that countries in sub-Saharan Africa were participating in this phenomenon. In this paper we use variance decompositions and impulse responses from vector autoregressions to shed light on the possible causes and consequences of capital inflows to four countries: Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. We use trend-cycle decompositions to provide evidence linking the appreciation of the real exchange rate to periods of heavy capital inflows. We show that domestic real interest rates have played an important role in explaining the recent behavior of the real exchange rate. In particular, we trace the rise in domestic nominal and real interest rates to policies designed to liberalize the domestic financial sector and attempts <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> monetary <b>expansion</b> associated with <b>the</b> capital inflows through sterilized intervention. ...|$|R

50|$|In 1947, Congress {{party activists}} {{established}} the Rashtriya Mazdoor Mill Sangh (RMMS), with a claimed membership of 32,000, {{to ensure a}} strong political base in the textile industry. The RMMS served as a lasting impediment to the free development of independent unionism in Bombay. Economic growth in India was relatively strong {{during much of the}} 1950s, and employment growth in Bombay was particularly good, as the city's manufacturing sector diversified. The Bombay textile industry until the 1950s was largely homogeneous, dominated by {{a relatively small number of}} large industrial mills. From the late 1950s, policies were introduced <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of mills and to encourage increased production from the handloom and powerloom sectors, because of their employment generating capacities. Bombay was one of the few industrial centres of India where strong unions grew up, particularly company or enterprise based unions, often in foreign owned firms. A key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, was George Fernandes. He was a central figure in the unionisation of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of shape information alone, without size, for recognizing stored 3 D models is considered. The geometric constraint filtering method of Grimson and Lozano-Pérez is used <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> potentially combinatorial <b>expansion</b> of <b>the</b> model search space. Results, typical of those from several models experimented with, are {{given for the}} task of recognizing a plug from uncertain surface normal data. They show that, at least for an 'interesting' view, shape data is highly effective, even when the sensed surface normals are uncertain in direction to, say, ± 10 °. The loss of size information does, however, result in a drop in search efficiency, but this appears relatively small: u factor of ≈ 5 for {{the example of a}} plug at the 10 ° error mark. © 1987...|$|R
40|$|Xiong Xiling (1869 - 1937) {{was a key}} {{person in}} China's modern {{transformation}} {{in the early twentieth}} century and had close relations with Japan. Before the 1911 Revolution, he visited Japan for several times for learning management in business and irrigation projects and experiences in promoting a constitutional government. His open-mindedness in political reform and his talents in financial management were highly evaluated by Naitō Konan (1866 - 1934), a leading Chinese history professor at Kyoto Imperial University. After the 1911 Revolution, he was the Finance Minister in the first cabinet under the Provisional President Sun Yat-sen and was entrusted by President Yuan Shi-kai to form a cabinet in late 1913. Along with the Justice Minister Liang Qi-chao and the Business Minister Zhang Jian, Xiong started a serial of reforms, especially those in the legal and business systems. They also tried to attract investments from the United States for developing oil fields in Shaanxi Province and for curing the flooding problem of the Huai River by a radical irrigation project. However, these Sino-American provisional agreement and contract were taken as the sign of Xiong's intention <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> Japanese business <b>expansion</b> by Naitō Konan as well as Yamaza Enjirō, the Japanese Minister in Peking, because of the rivalry between Japan and the United States since the Russo-Japanese War. But Xiong denied the charge by Yamaza and emphasized his omnidirectional foreign policy...|$|R

50|$|Once the Second Punic War {{had been}} resolved, and the Romans {{had begun to}} regather their strength, they looked to re-assert their {{influence}} in the Balkans, and <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of Philip. A pretext for war was provided by Philip's refusal to end his war with Attalid Pergamum and Rhodes, both Roman allies. The Romans, also allied with the Aetolian League of Greek city-states (which resented Philip's power), thus declared war on Macedon in 200 BC, starting the Second Macedonian War. This ended with a decisive Roman victory at the Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BC). Like most Roman peace treaties of the period, the resultant 'Peace of Flaminius' was designed utterly to crush {{the power of the}} defeated party; a massive indemnity was levied, Philip's fleet was surrendered to Rome, and Macedon was effectively returned to its ancient boundaries, losing influence over the city-states of southern Greece, and land in Thrace and Asia Minor. The result was the end of Macedon as a major power in the Mediterranean.|$|E
40|$|In the Cerrado, the {{expansion}} of soybean cultivation since the 1990 s has coincided with the strengthening of environmental regulations. We analyze how the two main environmental policies - Protected Areas and the Forest Code - have played out at the ground level in western Bahia state. These policies in Cerrado have not been designed <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of this agricultural frontier. These norms have, on the contrary, accommodated this expansion because the way environmental managers selectively choose environmental problems and publicize them through specific information systems depreciates traditional fire-dependent production systems. These 'politics of selection' are likely to increase competition for resources {{in the margins of}} soybean agriculture, which is where traditional populations have now become confined...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, Malaysia {{began to be}} {{inundated}} by foreign workers, {{all of whom were}} irregular migrants. A decade later their uncontrolled entry left several negative consequences especially to the internal and border security of the country. To overcome the problems, Malaysia introduced the foreign worker policy which became fully implemented in 1992. The policy has two objectives, firstly to regulate the inflow of foreign workers; and secondly, to stem the inflow of irregular migrant workers into the country. The implementation of the policy has led to a spectacular {{increase in the number of}} legally recruited migrant workers. However, it has not been able <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of irregular migrants; instead their number has risen in parallel with that of legally recruited ones. This report is an attempt to examine why this is so. It is based on a research carried out in 2011 among 404 irregular migrants as respondents, comprising 340 who were apprehended and housed at seven of the 17 holding depots run by the government and 64 others who are still at large...|$|E

40|$|New Zealand {{community}} {{aspirations to}} retain estuarine and lake ecosystems in optimal ecological and aesthetic condition, are now influencing how urbanisation and rural development in respective watersheds must be modified. The cases both demonstrate {{the pursuit of}} sustainable development using ecological capacity as a yardstick, and show how ecological knowledge influences planning. Cases include the following. Neighbouring watersheds of Long Bay and Okura demonstrate urban and lifestyle block developments respectively, designed to minimize stormwater and contaminant discharge to a marine reserve. ‘Low impact design ’ principles are applied to the Long Bay watershed. Biodiversity is protected and enhanced. Christchurch City Council’s Waterways and Wetlands Asset Management Strategy demonstrates Council aspirations to restore components of a major wetland ecosystem upon which the city was built. At Whaingaroa a rural and small town community have responded to sedimentation and enrichment of their harbour by withdrawing from pastoral use and reafforesting land that is riparian or very steep. The Lake Taupo community seek the means <b>to</b> <b>curb</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of dairy farming in anticipation of increased nitrogen losses to an oligotrophic lake that is nitrogen limited. The New Zealand Resource Management Act 1991 {{can be used to}} integrate management across the land-water interface.
