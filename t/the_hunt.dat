40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the {{compulsory}} connection of <b>the</b> rights to <b>hunt</b> with <b>the</b> ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> aim of this work is to divide and describe two kinds of hunting grounds according to the types of ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. There is also an economic analysis of revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting grounds. It further analyses the impact of diminishing of the minimum area of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds on <b>the</b> economy of <b>hunting.</b> It also tries {{to find out whether}} the diminishing would lead to hunting rights more interwoven with the ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> conducted research confirmed the existence of two types of hunting grounds that differ by the kind of ownership and also revenues and expenses regarding hunting rights in these hunting lands. It was further found out that the diminishing of the minimum area of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> grounds would increase the bindingness of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> rights with <b>the</b> ownership of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> lands. <b>The</b> economic impact of the diminishing of the minimum area of <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> ground couldn't be unequivocally determined...|$|R
