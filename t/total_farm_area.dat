40|$|The Sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Programme (SSA CP) was {{initiated}} {{with an overall}} objective of tackling poverty related issues among the rural farmers in sub-Saharan Africa through an innovation focussed approach referred to as Integrated Agricultural Research for development (IAR 4 D). This paper employs some baseline data of the Sudan Savanna Task Force in analysing household livelihood strategies and their poverty status. Stratified random sampling technique was employed in collecting data from the respondents. The respondents were classified {{on the basis of}} whether the farmers are future IAR 4 D (intervention), conventional (ARD) or clean sites (little intervention). This is necessary for the end-line survey and for the impact assessment of the Challenge Programme. A total of 600 households were surveyed for the study. Descriptive statistics, estimated poverty line and the Tobit regression model were employed in the analysis. The result showed that sales of crops and livestock constitute the highest proportion of household income in all the IP sites implying that the households are highly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. There was no significant difference (P< 0. 05) in the number of households below the estimated poverty line in all the treatments however, the poverty gap index was highest for the IAR 4 D sites and least for some R & D sites; Results of the Tobit analysis explaining the factors determining the intensity of household poverty in the region (regales of village type) shows that eight variables affect household poverty intensity (P < 0. 05) viz: Household Head Education, Child Dependency Ratio, Household Size, Farm Income, Household Production Enterprise Portfolio, Non Farm Income, Household <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area</b> and Extension Contact. According to the results obtained from the elasticity coefficients, the important factors that reduce household poverty intensity in the study area were farm income (P < 0. 05), household <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area</b> (P < 0. 10) and non-farm income in order of importance (P < 0. 10). Factors that significantly increase poverty intensity were household size and child dependency ratio (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the performance (in terms of energy) of livestock farms located in a Mediterranean mountain area and characterized by different stocking rates. Farm {{data were collected from}} in-person interviews of farmers of 58 farms representative of the livestock farms of the Madonie and Nebrodi mountains area (Sicily, Italy), including several parameters related to farm characteristics, animal, crop and pasture management. The farm parameters were used to calculate input and output energy values from which agroecosystem performance indicators were derived. Increasing stocking rate corresponded to a more than proportional increase in total inputs per unit area because of a greater farm dependence on external energy sources derived from agriculture (mainly for concentrate feed) and to a lower energy use efficiency. The indicator of dependence on non-renewable energy sources was, on average, very low irrespective of stocking rate. As stocking rate increased the farm autonomy indicator fell and the immediate removal indicator increased. Overall, the best agroecosystem performance in terms of energy was found on farms with lower stocking rates, higher proportions of permanent pastures to <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area,</b> and longer periods of exclusive grazing...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} the Ile-de-France region {{surrounding}} Paris, which is both the biggest conurbation in France and a large agricultural area. In areas such as these, airborne pollutants from road traffic may adversely affect the quality of the food produced by farms close by. This raises questions about the spatial compatibility of farming and road networks, although there is currently no scientific consensus concerning potential health risks for producers and consumers. Some actors in agricultural supply chains have tried to limit potential risks by producing technical guidelines, including isolation distances between major roads and fields farmed under contract. This paper analyses these "isolation distances", using approaches from the agricultural and social sciences: surveys on stakeholders in agribusiness and on farmers, and a cartographic simulation submitted to the surveyed farmers for discussion. The results show that isolation distances serve to create market opportunities in a context of market segmentation, or are applied as a precautionary principle. Though not a widespread practice, safety distances could have considerable impacts on farms in terms of both technical management and <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area,</b> thus calling for further scientific research on this issue...|$|E

The present study, based on micro-simulations on the farm level, shows impacts of various policy options (ranging from non-accession to the granting of full direct payments) on the production structure and profitability of Hungarian agricultural enterprises. For most products prices are expected to be higher in 2004 than in the reference year, 2001. EU accession will have an additional positive effect on the prices of all products. Direct payments would further increase farm profits. In particular crop producers would benefit (due to the increase in the price of corn) while profits in animal production would be affected in a negative way due to increased opportunity costs of forage area and higher labour cost. The presented figures are based on data collected in 14 typical model farms selected from the Hungarian Farm Accountancy Data Network and they cannot be regarded perfectly representative. However, in accordance with other sector studies the figures allow two conclusions. First, the majority of Hungarian agriculture (with respect to the share in <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area</b> as well as the share in total standard gross margins) would suffer no economic harm from an EU accession without direct payments.

40|$|Purpose The {{effect of}} one {{pesticide}} spraying season on DNA damage was measured on B and T lymphocytes among open-field farmers and controls. Methods At least two peripheral blood {{samples were collected}} from each individual: one in a period without any pesticide application, several weeks after the last use (January, at period P 0), and another in the intensive pesticide spraying period (May or June, at period P 4). DNA damage was studied by alkaline comet assay on isolated B or T lymphocytes. Results Longitudinal comparison of DNA damage observed at both P 0 and P 4 periods revealed a statistically significant genotoxic effect of the pesticide spraying season in both B (P = 0. 02) and T lymphocytes (P = 0. 02) in exposed farmers. In contrast, non-farmers did not show any significant modifications. DNA damage levels in B and T lymphocytes were significantly higher in farmers than in non-farmers during the P 4 period (P = 0. 003 and P = 0. 001 for B and T lymphocytes, respectively) but not during the P 0 period.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{three studies}} on Pakistan in which I examine the allocative efficiency of groundwater across farm-level constraints; the optimal management of groundwater given differences in agricultural tenure; {{and the effect}} of a set of policies on the utilization of groundwater. In the first chapter, I estimate the allocative inefficiency of groundwater in Pakistani agriculture using a panel dataset of rural households and show that the utilization of groundwater varies across a set of farm-level constraints (tenure, farm size, access to surface water and location on a watercourse). In the second chapter, I examine the long-run trend of groundwater depletion in Pakistan’s Indus Water Basin under common-pool resource management—the status quo—and under optimal management. I develop a dynamic optimization problem to illustrate long-run steady states of groundwater pumping under different management, hydrologic, economic and tenure assumptions. The analysis shows that the benefits of optimal management exceed the benefits of common property management, and that the small share of sharecropping does not have an important effect on the results. In the third chapter, I use a panel dataset of rural households—the same dataset used in the analysis in the first chapter—to examine the effects of two water policies—increasing access to surface water and increasing the reliability of the supply of surface water (as measured by being located higher up on a watercourse) —on the allocative efficiency of groundwater and land productivity. The results show that farms allocate groundwater more efficiently (over utilization decreases) as the share of <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area</b> with access to surface water increases while increasing the reliability of surface water supply does not appear to improve the utilization of groundwater. Increasing the share of total area with access to surface water has a modest effect on land productivity.

40|$|The use of {{minimum tillage}} {{technology}} reduces {{the quantity of}} tillage required to produce a crop, thereby reducing soil degradation. The reduced tillage results in increased soil organic matter {{and a reduction in}} soil and water erosion. Producers, researchers, and farm implement manufacturers have reduced land degradation through innovative farming practices and equipment. An example is the innovation of minimum tillage equipment and farming practices which is designed to reduce damage caused by increased tilling of the land. Minimum tillage maintains more of the previous crop’s residue {{on the surface of the}} soil, thereby reducing the damaging effects of wind and water erosion. Some Prairie producers have chosen to adopt minimum tillage technology, while others continue to use conventional tillage. The objective of this thesis is to determine which socio-economic, farm, and regional characteristics are influential in determining whether minimum tillage technology and practices are adopted. The theoretical framework for this thesis is based on an agriculture producer’s objective function. A lexicographic utility function is used, which means that each element of the utility function must be satisfied in order of rank with the highest level of utility achieved when the greatest number of elements has been satisfied. For the empirical analysis a Probit model is used to model the decision of whether to adopt minimum tillage technology. A number of socio-economic, farm, and regional characteristics, such as age, education, farm size, soil type, weather, and location of a research farm, were included as explanatory variables. The primary data source for the empirical analysis was farm level data from the Agriculture and Population Census data from 1991, 1996, and 2001, which resulted in over 42, 000 observations in the data set. A number of model specifications and sensitivity analyses were run and the results obtained were consistent with one another, thus the findings presented in this thesis are robust. A number of socio-economic, farm, and regional characteristics are significant in determining whether minimum tillage is adopted.

40|$|The annual {{agricultural}} census in Belgium delivers quantitative data of net and additional areas of land used for agriculture and horticulture. We introduce the term ‘tare land’ {{to indicate the}} latter as the area of land fragments not directly supporting crops or fodder, at farm level or at higher (landscape, region) level. For spatial planning and zoning purposes data on gross agricultural area (being the sum of net and tare areas) are required. However, {{the quality of the}} tare data is not documented or even questioned. In Belgian and international scientific and grey literature, little information on tare is available. In this paper we define two classes of tare, functional tare (fTare) and plan tare (pTare). fTare encompasses the sum of the area of all additional land used by farmers for professional purpose or closely associated to the net agricultural area but not directly used for the production of food, fodder or industrial crops. Plan tare (pTare) is defined as these parts of the statutory agricultural area not specifically used in farming, such as public roads and inclusions of non-farming buildings. By means of a GPS-survey and interviews with farm managers, we used two methods to survey net and tare areas of land. On one hand we surveyed the land within farm enterprises: 3 open air horticultural farms, 6 greenhouse horticultural farms and one mixed farm (open air horticulture and greenhouse). On the other hand we surveyed 10 segments of 25 ha, all situated in one municipality within a major horticultural region of Flanders (northern region of Belgium). fTare areas account on average for 21 % of the <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area</b> in the case of open air horticulture whereas the fTare area is 39 % in case of greenhouse horticultural farms. These averages are significantly different. The mixed farm had an fTare area of 32 %. Within areas designated for agriculture plan tare is 44 %. Hence only 56 % of the land with an agricultural destination is effectively used for agriculture. These figures illustrate the spatial importance of tare areas and the spatially extremely scattered organisation of horticulture in the study area. Knowledge on quality and nature of tare areas is important for multiobjective spatial planning in which economic and ecological sustainability of agriculture is considered. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} (CA) {{is promoted}} as a promising technology to stabilize or improve crop yields in Africa and Madagascar. However, small-scale farmers face difficulties to retain soil cover, {{mainly because of}} competing uses for the biomass produced, especially to feed cattle. To explore the relation between dairy production and CA we developed an optimisation model at farm level. Our aim was to explore trade-offs between CA practices {{and the size of}} dairy cow herds. Our model includes three main components: the farm, the crops and the cattle herd. The optimisation was made on the total net income for three years. Biomass produced by cropping activities can either serve as mulch or to feed cows. We applied a constraint on the minimum soil cover % to keep {{at the end of each}} year for CA fields: from 30 % to 95 %. We simulated two scenarios of milk market: a small milk market with low forage price and an open milk market scenario with higher price of forage. Three prototypes of farms were simulated with different proportion and size of four kinds of field. These three prototypes were: medium-sized farm with hillsides dominating, medium-sized farm with paddy fields dominating and small-sized farm with hillsides. Changing the degree of soil cover to be retained on CA plots did not significantly modify the total net farm income. It was more strongly influenced by the characteristics of the milk market. In case of a limited milk market it was not profitable to have more than seven cows because the expenses were not compensated by animal production. When setting minimum soil cover to 30 % then all of the simulated results include biomass coming from CA cropping system even with 12 cows/farm. Conversely when setting this constraint to 95 %, above 6 / 7 cows/farm forage come only from conventional fields. In all of the situations simulated even with 6 cows, with the current and twice the price for forage, it was possible to keep at least 50 % of soil cover on 30 - 60 % of the <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area.</b> CA was not feasible for farms with no irrigated paddy fields or when forage fetched a high price regardless of the constraint for % of soil cover to be kept on CA fields. Overall, CA systems can be beneficial for dairy cow farmers due to the forage produced, although the milk market and thus the value of biomass for forage, has a strong influence on CA practice at field level.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} legume content in dryland pastures. Most dryland farmers continue to sow ryegrass/white clover pasture mixtures, but white clover fails to persist in drought conditions, leading to poor quality pastures. The objective {{of the study was}} to find out how much lucerne and subterranean clover are currently being utilised, to see which clovers are sown and the to assess the persistence of clovers, based on farmers' visual assessments of their pastures. A postal questionnaire was sent to 360 light land farmers in Canterbury and North Otago. The questionnaire focussed on pasture types, sowing rates, the use of greenfeeds, pasture management and animal carrying capacities on each property. A total of 82 questionnaire responses were received (26 %), 7 were discounted due to the small size of the properties, leaving 75 for the analysis. For the analysis of the results the respondents were stratified into those growing lucerne (n= 50) and those growing pastures only (n= 25). From the questionnaire respondents ten were selected for in-depth interviews, five that grew larger areas of lucerne and five that had predominately subterranean clover based pastures. The interviews and pasture assessments were conducted in October and November 2000. The results showed that for the farms growing lucerne (66. 7 %) the average area is only 17 % of the <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area.</b> The lambing percentage (survival to tailing) was 132 % on lucerne farms and 117 % on farms with 'no lucerne', but for the interviewed farmers growing lucerne the lambing percentage was 147 %, with 124 % for the no lucerne farms. The improved lambing percentage may be attributed to better ewe nutrition resulting in heavier liveweight ewes and the ability to flush ewes over mating. The predominant ewe breed was Border Corriedale (45 % of the farms surveyed), Corriedale (24 %) followed by Coop worth and Border Romney. The preferred sire was Polled Dorset (24 %), Border Corriedales (22 %) then Dorset Downs and Texels. The white clover cover as a percentage of total pasture cover was estimated by farmers as being 21 % in young pastures, but they estimated that this declined to 13 % in older pastures. Ninety seven percent of the surveyed farmers sowed white clover in their pasture mixes at an average sowing rate of 2. 35 kg/ha. Farmers believed that white clover persisted in their pastures for 6. 2 years on average, yet they only renewed their grass/clover pastures every 9. 9 years for the lucerne farmers and 12. 2 years for pasture only farmers. This implies that pastures are without white clover for between one third to one half of the lifetime of the pasture. Red clover is sown by 38 % of the farmers at an average of 2. 35 kg/ha, but has little contribution to pastures at less than 1 % of pasture cover on average. Only 32 % of farmers sowed subterranean (sub) clover in their pasture mixes despite the fact they believed it persists for 15. 4 years on average (beyond their current pasture renewal date). The farm owners visually estimated the sub clover botanical cover to constitute 11 % in young and 6 % in older pastures on the surveyed farms. On the interview farms, sub clover made up 41 % of the pasture cover in young and 35 % in old pastures. Meanwhile on the farms with no lucerne, sub clover was estimated to comprise 22 % in young and 21 % in the older pastures of the lucerne farms, when the farms were visited in mid/late spring. The average area of winter greenfeed sown was 15 hectares (8 % of farm area) for the sheep and beef farmers who did not winter graze additional stock, but 18 hectares (10 %) for the sheep and beef farmers who wintered dairy cows or deer. The latter group represented 18 % of all the farmers surveyed. Annual grass was the most commonly sown greenfeed type (25 %), followed by turnips (18 %) and then turnips and grass (14 %). There was little difference in the area of greenfeed sown between lucerne and pasture only farms...|$|E
40|$|The Salado {{region of}} Argentina covers 9. 5 million ha, {{is located in}} the centre-East of the Buenos Aires Province, and {{concentrates}} about 6. 9 million cattle. Cow-calf systems are predominant in the area. A simulation model was developed with the purpose of assisting in the design and evaluation of cow-calf systems in the Salado Region. The model was designed to produce long term simulations of the dynamic interactions between herd structure, climatic variation and farm management over periods of several decades using daily weather data, real or simulated. Existing models were used to describe soil, pasture and animal components of the farm, linked with management actions in a dynamic framework. The model was driven by decision rules entered by the user, which allowed the representation of management options that respond to changing farm conditions according to a predetermined policy. An object-oriented approach (OOA) was used in the design and implementation of the model. In the OOA, objects in the real world (e. g. cows, paddocks) are represented as objects in the computer program. The simulation of individual cows and individual paddocks made it possible to distribute feed resources flexibly among animals and provided many other points of flexibility in management strategies. The management strategies simulated in trying to improve cow-calf systems in the Salado region were based on Reserva 6, an experimental cow-calf farm located at the INTA-Balcarce Experimental Station. Every spring-summer, 30 % of the area is devoted to make low quality hay (by cutting at high herbage mass), most of which is destined to provide maintenance feed for pregnant adult cows in winter. Cows are kept on a small paddock from weaning (March) to calving (August-September), during which time they receive 6 - 9 kg DM of hay per day. A set of decision rules was developed to represent (on a 100 ha farm) the management applied in Reserva 6 and, using this as a base system, a series of simulation experiments was conducted. Firstly, three preliminary experiments, aimed at gaining insight into the system and testing the model, were carried out. In the first of these, the effect of delaying the breeding season 15 and 30 days was analysed. The model was run over 30 consecutive years using a real weather sequence, 1970 - 2000, from INTA-Balcarce, for each scenario. It was found that, when the appropriate management variables (i. e. weaning and sale dates) were adjusted accordingly, changing the calving period had little effect on the productivity of a cow-calf system. In the second experiment, the dynamic consequences of three different heifer replacement policies on the production outcomes of the system were explored. The policies produced different patterns of oscillations in key farm outputs as a result of periodic behaviour in the age structure of the herd, and the differences between strategies were shown to be dependent on the environmental variability being simulated. The third experiment analysed different policies for hay use during the autumn-winter period, including a control strategy in which no hay was harvested or used. The results suggested that, provided hay was utilized on the farm, the pattern of use did not make much difference to liveweight production. Secondly, the long term performance, in terms of annual liveweight sold, of a range of hay quantity-quality combinations was compared. Each policy was simulated across a range of cow numbers (170 to 350, cows plus heifers in a 100 ha farm) and was replicated 20 times. Each replication consisted of 50 years of random weather sampled from the real sequence (1970 - 2000). The benefit of using hay and the contrasts between the effects of different haymaking strategies on animal outputs increased as the cow numbers increased. The long term analysis suggested that the liveweight production of cow-calf farms, under a calendar-based haymaking policy like that followed in Reserva 6, would be maximized by harvesting 40 - 50 % (but not more) of the <b>total</b> <b>farm</b> <b>area</b> and aiming to harvest hay at medium herbage mass (therefore medium quality). Therefore, the policy currently followed in Reserva 6 of allocating 30 % of the farm to haymaking could be considered as conservative, and its productivity might be increased by making hay at lower herbage mass. Thirdly, the possible advantages of incorporating flexibility into the haymaking policy used in Reserva 6 were evaluated using the same experimental design. The results indicated that controlling haymaking in a flexible fashion, basing the decisions of closing, releasing and cutting paddocks on a simple pasture budget, would give the system productive advantages (i. e. increases in productivity and reductions in variability) in relation to a calendar-based approach. Using a flexible haymaking policy allows the manager to make more hay than required for the next winter, providing a buffer for the system. A flexible haymaking policy permitted significantly greater levels of herbage utilization by making large amounts of hay without negative effects on the carrying capacity of the system. A preliminary analysis of risk and costs highlighted major advantages in using hay in cow-calf systems, especially when a flexible approach to haymaking is implemented...|$|E
