40|$|The {{problem of}} RMS error {{determination}} in ionospheric parameters {{measured by the}} method of vertical HF sounding is considered here. This problem is solved for the case of <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> when the height distribution of electron density is monotonic. An analytical expression is obtained, which relates the variance of deduced parameters to the correlation function of errors in measured characteristics of sounding signals. The computer simulation is provided for errors in real height determination; in reconstruction of vertical velocities of plasma motion; and in effective electron collision frequencies for the measurements of virtual heights, Doppler shift, and radio wave absorption, respectively. Their dependencies on signal polarisation, working frequency range, and geomagnetic latitude of the observation point are determined. The obtained results are useful for planning plasma experiments using HF sounding technique...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the small-scale <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> plasma structures first observed at Millstone Hill, Massachusetts with the 440 MHz incoherent scatter radar. These small-scale obliquely propagating plasma modes occurring {{in the vicinity of}} the midlatitude ionospheric trough, have large radar cross-sections and narrow spectral widths. They have, until recently, been dismissed solely as hard target contamination of the incoherent scatter radar. The geophysical conditions associated with the ionospheric trough, such as the field-aligned current activity and steep plasma density gradients, suggest that these recently discovered small-scale <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> plasmas may also appear in the auroral and polar ionosphere. In fact, this speculation has been corroborated by the preliminary experiments and data analyses at Tromso, Norway and Sondrestromfjord, Greenland. The primary research results are highlighted. Described in Section 3 are the experiments conducted at Arecibo, Puerto Rico in the past summer for simulating the geophysical conditions of generating these <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> plasma structures. Recommendation for the future research is finally given. Attached as the appendix of this report are several chapters which present the detailed results of research in the concerned <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> clutter.

40|$|This thesis {{creates a}} basic {{framework}} {{and provides the}} information necessary {{to create a more}} accurate description of the topside ionosphere in terms of the altitude variation of the electron density (Ne) over the South African region. The detailed overview of various <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> modelling techniques, with specific emphasis on their implications for the efforts to model the South African topside, provides a starting point towards achieving the goals. The novelty of the thesis lies in the investigation of the applicabilityof three different techniques to model the South African topside ionosphere: (1) The possibility of using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques for empirical modelling of the topside ionosphere based on the available, however irregularly sampled, topside sounder measurements. The goal of this model was to test the ability of ANN techniques to capture the complex relationships between the various ionospheric variables using irregularly distributed measurements. While this technique is promising, the method did not show significant improvement over the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model results when compared with the actual measurements. (2) Application of the diffusive equilibrium theory. Although based on sound physics foundations, the method only operates on a generalised level leading to results that are not necessarily unique. Furthermore, the approach relies on many ionospheric variables as inputs which are derived from other models whose accuracy is not verified. (3) Attempts to complement the standard functional techniques, (Chapman, Epstein, Exponential and Parabolic), with Global Positioning System (GPS) and ionosonde measurements in an effort to provide deeper insights into the actual conditions within the ionosphere. The vertical Ne distribution is reconstructed by linking together the different aspects of the constituent ions and their transition height by considering how they influence the shape of the profile. While this approach has not been tested against actual measurements, results show that the method could be potentially useful for <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> studies. Due to the limitations of each technique reviewed, this thesis observes that the employment of an approach that incorporates both theoretical onsiderations and empirical aspects has the potential to lead to a more accurate characterisation of the <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> behaviour, and resulting in improved models in terms of reliability and forecasting ability. The point is made that a topside sounder mission for South Africa would provide the required measured <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> data and answer the many science questions that this region poses as well as solving a number of the limitations set out in this thesis...|$|R
