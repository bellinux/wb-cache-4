500|$|Radiohead {{had created}} Kid A and Amnesiac, {{recorded}} simultaneously, through a years-long process of recording and editing that drummer Phil Selway described as [...] "manufacturing {{music in the}} studio". For their next album, the band sought to capture a more immediate, [...] "live" [...] sound. Yorke told MTV: [...] "The last two studio records were a real headache. We had spent so much <b>time</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> computers and grids, we were like, that's enough, we can't do that any more. This time, we used computers, {{but they had to}} actually be in the room with all the gear. So everything was about performance, like staging a play." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reviewed}} {{a host of}} Westerns from 1992 and 1993 {{and said}} that Brisco was [...] "the most sheer fun of the bunch", calling it [...] "a period piece with slick production values and a mix of drama and humor, fast pace and high camp". In {{an article on the}} 1993 television season, the Toronto Stars Greg Quill wrote that Brisco was a program that represented [...] "American TV craft at the top of its form". In contrast, Elvis Mitchell of Spin magazine gave Brisco a scathing review, calling the show's premise a [...] "tedious... rickety gimmick". Mitchell acknowledged the show's [...] "quick reflexes", but said the humor was [...] "uncomfortable" [...] with a [...] "cynical quickness". He added, [...] "Brisco County relieves us of the burden of laughing. It spends too much <b>time</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> itself in the mirror, admiring its own adorable dimpled half-smile." ...|$|E

500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much <b>time</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E

Viv was sensational. And back then, {{there were things}} I had to do—I was in the projection room for some reason, and I just couldn't concentrate on it. But now I can.

2500|$|Accordingly, {{several studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that the presentation of emotionally arousing stimuli (compared to neutral stimuli) results in enhanced memory for central details (details central to the appearance or meaning of the emotional stimuli) and impaired memory for peripheral details. Also consistent with this hypothesis are findings of weapon focus effect, in which witnesses to a crime remember the gun or knife in great detail but not other details such as the perpetrator's clothing or vehicle. In laboratory replications it was found that participants spend a disproportionate amount of <b>time</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a weapon in a scene, and this looking time is inversely related to the likelihood that individuals will subsequently identify the perpetrator of the crime. Other researchers have suggested arousal may also increase the duration of attentional focusing on the arousing stimuli, thus delaying the disengagement of attention from it. [...] Ochsner (2000) summarized the different findings and suggested that by influencing attention selectivity and dwell time, arousing stimuli are more distinctively encoded, resulting in more accurate memory of those stimuli.|$|E

2500|$|Zorn {{was quoted}} in 1998 as saying [...] "Sometimes I {{get the feeling that}} people just don't see me as a {{composer}}, but it's what I've always been since I was eight years old... I've always thought of myself as a composer, but the world has had a hard <b>time</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me as a composer because a lot of what I compose is controversial." [...] The establishment of Tzadik allowed him to release many compositions which he had been written over the previous two decades for classical ensembles. Zorn's earliest released [...] "classical" [...] composition (for five flutes), [...] "Christabel" [...] (1972) first appeared on Angelus Novus in 1998. Zorn credits the composition of his 1988 piece for string quartet [...] "Cat O' Nine Tails", commissioned and originally released by the Kronos Quartet (Short Stories), to awakening him to the possibilities of writing for classical musicians. This composition was featured on The String Quartets (1999) and Cartoon S/M (2000) along with variations on [...] "Kol Nidre", inspired by the Jewish prayer of atonement which was written {{at the same time as}} (but not part of) the first Masada Book. [...] (1998) was Zorn's first full-scale orchestral release featuring pianist Stephen Drury, the Hungarian Radio Children's Choir and the American Composers Orchestra conducted by Dennis Russell Davies.|$|E
