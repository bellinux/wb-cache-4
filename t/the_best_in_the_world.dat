5|$|Bahrain is {{the site}} of the ancient Dilmun civilisation. It has been famed since antiquity for its pearl fisheries, which were {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> into the 19th century. Bahrain was one of the earliest areas to convert to Islam (628). Following a period of Arab rule, Bahrain was occupied by the Portuguese in 1521, who in turn were expelled in 1602 by Shah Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty under the Persian Empire. In 1783, the Bani Utbah clan captured Bahrain from Nasr Al-Madhkur and it has since been ruled by the Al Khalifa royal family, with Ahmed al Fateh as Bahrain's first hakim. In the late 1800s, following successive treaties with the British, Bahrain became a protectorate of the United Kingdom. In 1971, Bahrain declared independence. Formerly an emirate, Bahrain was declared a Kingdom in 2002. In 2011, the country experienced protests inspired by the regional Arab Spring.|$|E
