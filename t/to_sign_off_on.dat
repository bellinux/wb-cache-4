5|$|The main {{provisions}} of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act included {{the establishment of the}} Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to develop standards for the preparation of audit reports; the restriction of public accounting companies from providing any non-auditing services when auditing; provisions for the independence of audit committee members, executives being required <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> financial reports, and relinquishment of certain executives' bonuses in case of financial restatements; and expanded financial disclosure of companies' relationships with unconsolidated entities.|$|E
5|$|By 5 May 1536, {{the town}} council of Buena Esperanza had now lost all faith in Cerezeda and {{voted for the}} {{abandonment}} of Higueras {{and a return to}} Trujillo; Cerezeda opposed this decision, but the council forced him <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the move. In the meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from the hostile natives. A chaotic evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help would soon be forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that companies are not wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E

5|$|During its {{existence}} the King's Bench's jurisdiction initially covered {{a wide range}} of criminal matters, something significantly reduced later on, along with any business not claimed by the other courts, and any cases which concerned the monarch. It also acted as a court of appeal for the Exchequer of Pleas and Common Pleas, although it was not a court of last resort and required Parliament <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> its decisions. The creation of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1585 created a court from which King's Bench decisions could be appealed to, and with the expansion of the Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's Bench ceased to be an appellate court. Thanks to the Bill of Westminster and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought. The King's Bench was staffed by one Chief Justice, now the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, and a variable number of Puisne Justices; normally three, there were five serving when the King's Bench was dissolved. Those who chose not to retire became Justices of the High Court on the King's Bench's dissolution.|$|E

25|$|Sergius {{sought to}} create a formula that {{would be able to}} fully please both the Chalcedonians and the Monophysites. The {{eventually}} forbade discussion on whether Christ had one or two energies within him and instead insisted that the Lord had two different natures incarnated within a single will and body.

It can be argued that Hominus did not quite understand the point of Sergius’ formula, but it is accepted that he supported it regardless.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the notorious Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) torture memoranda, various reforms have been {{proposed}} to prevent future erroneous and poorly reasoned legal opinions on matters of the utmost national importance. The need for reform is all the more pressing in a post- 9 / 11 world in which the Executive Branch will continue to arrogate, often in secret, various national security-related powers. None of the proposals, however, addresses the supervisory role that Justice Department and other Executive Branch lawyers play in the formation of OLC opinions. This Article argues that the failure to hold more senior government lawyers accountable for the ethical failures of their subordinates dooms the many laudable proposals aimed at protecting against flawed OLC legal advice. By letting higher-up lawyers off the hook, these proposals ignore the collective nature of OLC opinion writing. More ominous, the failure to hold supervisors responsible encourages senior public officials to disengage from difficult legal analyses, therefore depriving opinions of their judgment, expertise, and experience. Most importantly, these officials are better situated to withstand the pressure to approve Executive branch actions. This Article proposes a new professional rule of conduct and process that addresses the responsibilities of senior executive branch lawyers and supervising lawyers who work with OLC lawyers. The proposal will require a greater number of senior lawyers <b>to</b> review and <b>sign</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> OLC opinions and to correct deficiencies where they perceive them. Adhering to the proposal will increase oversight of the OLC, ensure greater accountability, and lead to better and more independent legal advice for the Executive Branch...|$|R
