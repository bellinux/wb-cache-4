5|$|When {{paying a}} state visit to Britain, foreign {{heads of state}} are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are {{allocated}} a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated {{at the foot of}} the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing. The rooms of <b>the</b> <b>suite</b> are linked by narrow corridors, one of them is given extra height and perspective by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane. A second corridor in <b>the</b> <b>suite</b> has Gothic-influenced cross-over vaulting. The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert's uncle LÃ©opoldI, first King of the Belgians. In 1936, <b>the</b> <b>suite</b> briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King EdwardVIII.|$|E
50|$|An exact {{chronology}} of <b>the</b> <b>suites</b> (regarding both <b>the</b> {{order in which}} <b>the</b> <b>suites</b> were composed and whether they were composed {{before or after the}} solo violin sonatas) cannot be completely established. However, scholars generally believe that - based on a comparative analysis of the styles of the sets of works - <b>the</b> cello <b>suites</b> arose first, effectively dating <b>the</b> <b>suites</b> earlier than 1720, the year on the title page of Bach's autograph of the violin sonatas.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>suites</b> are not {{regularly}} programmed in {{the concert}} hall, but their length {{is well suited}} to recordings, {{and they have been}} recorded under the baton of the composer and by several later conductors.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} project {{focuses on}} J. S. Bach's Six <b>Suites</b> and explores <b>the</b> ideology of <b>the</b> <b>Suites</b> as etudes versus concert pieces. It is {{my belief that}} {{the evolution of the}} rank of <b>the</b> <b>Suites</b> in a cellist's repertoire today represents more than just historical coincidence. My premise is that the true genius of <b>the</b> <b>Suites</b> lies in their dual role as !&I efficient teaching pieces and superior performance works. Consequently, the maximum use of Bach's Six Suites as pedagogical material heightens both technical ability and deeper appreciation of the art. The dual nature of <b>the</b> <b>Suites</b> must always be emphasized: not only do these pieces provide innumerable opportunities for building cello technique, but they also offer material for learning the fundamentals of melody, harmony, dynamics, phrasing and texture. It is widely accepted among academic musicians that Bach's keyboard music serves as perfect compositions [...] the model for music theory, music form and music counterpoint. I argue that we should employ <b>the</b> Cello <b>Suites</b> to this same end. The order in which <b>the</b> <b>Suites</b> are presented was deliberately chosen to highlight the contrasts in the pieces. Because the technical demands of each suite grow progressively from the previous one, they were performed non-consecutively in order to balance the difficulty and depth of each recital. The first compact disc consists of <b>the</b> Third <b>Suite</b> in C Major and Fifth Suite in C minor (with scordatura tuning), emphasizing the parallel keys. <b>The</b> Second <b>Suite</b> in D Minor and <b>the</b> Fourth <b>Suite</b> in E-flat Major comprises the compact disc. Finally, in the third compact disc, <b>the</b> First <b>Suite</b> in G Major and <b>the</b> Sixth <b>Suite</b> in D Major (composed for the five string cello piccola, but played here on a four-string cello) highlights the progression of <b>the</b> <b>Suites...</b>|$|R
5|$|The 1938 {{performance}} of <b>the</b> <b>suite</b> by Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, recorded on 78rpm discs, provided the only commercially available recording until {{the advent of}} the LP era in the 1950s; a performance by the Cleveland Orchestra under Fritz Reiner in December 1945 was not issued until many years later. In 1951 Capitol issued Hermann Scherchen's recording of <b>the</b> <b>suite</b> with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, since which many recordings of the work have been issued under a variety of labels. A 2008 edition of the Muze survey of recordings lists 19 available versions by orchestras from Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and the US. The version with baritone voice has rarely found its way on to disc; Vladimir Ashkenazy with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Andrei Laptev (2010) provide a recent example. A DVD of the Bolshoi Ballet production, featuring Raisa Struchkova and Vladimir Vasiliev, was released in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The George VI Victorian Suite was {{originally}} a wedding present by George VI {{to his daughter}} Elizabeth in 1947. <b>The</b> <b>suite</b> consists of a long necklace of oblong sapphires and diamonds {{and a pair of}} matching square sapphire earrings also bordered with diamonds. <b>The</b> <b>suite</b> {{was originally}} made in 1850. The stones exactly matched the colour of the robes of the Order of the Garter, although this may have been a coincidence on George's part. Elizabeth had the necklace shortened by removing the biggest sapphire in 1952, and later had a new pendant made using the removed stone. In 1963, a new sapphire and diamond tiara and bracelet were made to match the original pieces. The tiara is made out of a necklace that had belonged to Princess Louise of Belgium, daughter of Leopold II. In 1969, the Queen wore the complete parure to a charity concert.|$|E
