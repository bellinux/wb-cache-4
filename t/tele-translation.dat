40|$|This study {{reflects}} pedagogical implications {{derived from}} “Translation in the 2 nd foreign language” course offered at Translation Studies Department at Sakarya University, Turkey in 2014 - 2015 academic year / fall term. The insights {{derived from the}} classroom sessions {{were obtained from the}} instructor’s observations based on reflective journals, which were updated on a weekly basis. These observations provided a great deal of qualitative data. The course attendees used a Facebook group forum specifically designed for the course discussions and students-teacher communication. They also received their translation projects and then sent them via Facebook messaging system and e-mail till the deadline identified previously by the instructor. The findings reveal that trainee translators’ teleworking skills increased as they became more conscious users of computer assisted translation (CAT) tools and social networks. In this way, they are more adaptable to work with distant colleagues, clients and translation vendors in their future career.
