5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> wheel are living, {{they will need to}} be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{forensic}} chemists rely {{on numerous}} instruments to identify unknown materials {{found at a}} crime scene. [...] The 20th century saw many advancements in technology that allowed chemists to detect smaller amounts of material more accurately. [...] The first major advancement in this century came during the 1930s with the invention of a spectrometer that could measure the signal produced with infrared (IR) light. [...] Early IR spectrometers used a monochromator and could only measure light absorption in a very narrow wavelength band. [...] It {{was not until the}} coupling of an interferometer with an IR spectrometer in 1949 by Peter Fellgett that the complete infrared spectrum could be measured at once. [...] Fellgett also used the Fourier transform, a mathematical method that can break down a signal into its individual frequencies, {{to make sense of the}} enormous amount of data received from the complete infrared analysis of a material. [...] Since then, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments have become critical in the forensic analysis of unknown material because they are nondestructive [...] and extremely quick to use. [...] Spectroscopy was further advanced in 1955 with the invention of the modern atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometer by Alan Walsh. [...] AA analysis can detect specific elements <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> sample along with their concentrations, allowing for the easy detection of heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium.|$|E
500|$|Reminiscent of Marble Madness and Labyrinth, the {{objective}} of the main game is to guide one of four playable monkeys (AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon) encased in a transparent ball across a suspended series of platforms and through a goal. By moving the analog stick, the player tilts the entire set of platforms <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> level, called a floor, and the ball rolls accordingly. If the ball falls off a floor (an event dubbed a fall out) or the in-game timer reaches zero, the player loses one of their three lives. The speed, in miles per hour, at which the ball is moving is displayed {{in the corner of the}} screen. Pausing the game and selecting the [...] "View Stage" [...] option allows one to rotate the camera around and examine the floor. A replay is presented after a floor's goal has been reached; replays can be saved to a memory card and viewed at whim. Every second remaining on the timer when a floor is completed adds 100 points to the player's score. Collectible bananas found throughout the game are also worth 100 points, while multipliers increasing the player's score by a factor of two or four are activated when a floor is finished in under half the allotted time or via a warp gate. The player receives an extra life for every 100 bananas collected.|$|E
