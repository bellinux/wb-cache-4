40|$|AbstractThe fatigue {{strength}} and the transition of failure mechanism from the high cycle fatigue (HCF) to the very high cycle fatigue regime (VHCF) for EN AW 6056 were investigated at mechanically polished, smooth specimens. Fatigue tests were conducted with a servohydraulic testing machine and a resonant frequency machine at room temperature. Tests run up to a maximum number of cycles N= 2 ⋅ 108. The results reveal that the {{fatigue strength}} decreases with increasing number of cycles, which is known for materials with facecentred cubic lattice. In the very high cycle regime the crack initiation sites of the smooth specimens were internal. Fracture surface and microstructure of the crack initiation sites were investigated by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), electron back scatter diffraction analysis (EBSD) and metallographic methods. The influence of notches was investigated at slightly notched (Kt= 1. 75) and sharp notched (screws M 10, Kt= 4. 7) specimens.

40|$|Accelerated {{testing in}} environments {{aggressive}} {{for the specific}} material have shown that fastener threads that are rolled after strengthening heat treatments have improved resistance to SCC initiation. For example, intergranular SCC was produced in one day when machined (cut) threads of high strength steel (ASTM A 193 B- 7 and A 354 Grade 8) were exposed to an aggressive aqueous environment containing 8 weight % boiling ammonium nitrate and stressed to about 40 % of the steel's yield strength (120 ksi, 827 MPa). In similar testing conditions, fasteners that had threads rolled before heat-treatment (quench and temper) had similar susceptibility to SCC. However, threads rolled after strengthening, exhibited no SCC {{after a week of}} exposure, even when stressed to 100 % of the B- 7 alloy yield strength. Similarly, intergranular SCC was produced in less than one day when machined (cut) threads of nickel-base alloys (X- 750 and aged 625) were exposed to an aggressive 750 F doped steam environment (containing 100 ppm of chloride, fluoride, sulfate, nitrate and a controlled hydrogen overpressure) and stressed to about 80 % of the alloy yield strength (117 ksi, 807 MPa). In similar testing conditions, threads rolled after strengthening exhibited no SCC after 50 days of exposure. This beneficial effect of the optimum <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> process (i. e., threads rolled after strengthening) is due to the retention of large residual compressive stresses in the thread roots (notches) which mitigate the applied notch tensile stresses resulting from joint design pre-loads. use of these material specific aggressive environments can provide an accelerated test to verify that threads were produced by the optimum <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> process. These tests could support fastener acceptance criteria or failure analysis of fasteners with unknown or uncertain manufacturing processes.

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, <b>thread</b> <b>rolling,</b> and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R

30|$|The {{plastic limit}} test (<b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> method as devised by Atterberg) {{has become one}} of the {{standard}} test in soil engineering practice. According to Sridharan and Prakash [21], and Haigh [5], the two liquid limit test methods (cup and cone methods) measure different physical quantities. Cup method gives higher values of LL compared to cone method when the liquid limit is larger; whereas cone method gives higher values than cup method at lower liquid limits. This is primarily because of the controlling mechanisms involved in mobilisation of shearing resistance, primarily viscous resistance with soil of higher liquid limit and mobilisation of frictional resistance for soils at lower liquid limits [21]. According to Sridharan and Prakash [20], the cone penetration method is a measure of the undrained cohesion or undrained frictional resistance of the soil or both. Liquid limit and plastic limit determined by the cone penetration method conceptually do not represent the soil plasticity characteristics because they also represent undrained friction. Recently Haigh et al. [6] has brought out that the plastic limit is a measure of soil brittleness and does not correspond to fixed soil strength and that the plastic limit by fall cone method is not the plastic limit described by Atterberg.|$|R
