5|$|The music, {{philosophy}} and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion, described as senseless, ridiculous {{to the limit}} of self-parody, and even dangerous for the young generation. The 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd. Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's content as much <b>too</b> <b>real.</b>|$|E
5|$|The five reel {{film was}} {{released}} through the Pathé Exchange as a Pathé Gold Rooster Play on October 7, 1917. Charles E. Wagner of the Exhibitor's Trade Review {{found it to}} be a good film with great direction and photography, but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared {{to be involved in the}} accident was <b>too</b> <b>real.</b> Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness; which should prove a strong program for the Pathé program. Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph {{found it to be}} an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences, but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer. A reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film's excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable, but found Warde's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances. The reviewer said that Emile Chautard had made the improbable story more plausible.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the name came from a Pee-wee brand miniature harmonica and the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. Reubens thought the name Pee-wee Herman was a name that sounded <b>too</b> <b>real</b> to be made up, and like a real name a parent would give a child that they didn't really care about.|$|E
500|$|... "Actually, it's part of {{its rich}} {{heritage}} of leaping in to some horrific subject without any background or build-up at all. The implication is that Tony, the villain, had been grooming the child for some time {{before he went to}} prison, when she was only 12. But such a thing really would be <b>too</b> <b>real,</b> and too controversial, so the viewer only gets to see the result of those hinted-at dark machinations.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{opined that}} the Underwood {{character}} is less interesting once he achieves {{his goal of}} becoming president and actually has to govern. [...] "You could take the show seriously {{just as long as}} you didn’t have to take it seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics," [...] wrote Aaron Bady of The New Republic, who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of The West Wing. [...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but <b>too</b> <b>real</b> to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage." ...|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{designed}} Two-Face's {{appearance in}} the film {{as one of the}} least disturbing, explaining, [...] "When we looked at less extreme versions of it, they were <b>too</b> <b>real</b> and more horrifying. When you look at a film like Pirates of the Caribbean– something like that, there's something about a very fanciful, very detailed visual effect, that I think is more powerful and less repulsive." [...] Framestore created 120 computer-generated shots of Two-Face's scarred visage. Nolan felt using make-up would look unrealistic, as it adds to the face, unlike real burn victims. Framestore acknowledged they rearranged the positions of bones, muscles and joints to make the character look more dramatic. For each shot, three 720-pixel HD cameras were set up at different angles on set to fully capture Aaron Eckhart's performance. Eckhart wore markers on his face and a prosthetic skullcap, which acted as a lighting reference. A few shots of the skullcap were kept in the film. Framestore also integrated shots of Bale and Eckhart into that of the exploding building where Dent is burned. It was difficult simulating fire on Eckhart because it is inherently unrealistic for only half of something to burn.|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being <b>too</b> <b>real,</b> is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said [...] "Fifteen" [...] {{was one of}} Swift's best-written songs. James Reed of The Boston Globe {{believed}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] was one of Fearlesss {{most interesting}} songs and stated he could visualize the lyrics of the song scribbled in a diary that chronicled Swift's freshman year in high school. Sean Dooley of About.com named it the best track on Fearless and said it showcased Swift's growth as a songwriter. Josh Love of The Village Voice called the song a [...] "standout" [...] on the album and found it a refreshing contradiction to typical, idealistic country songs. Prior to its single release, Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine suggested for the song be released as a single from Fearless, adding that she loved it. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called the track a fantastically good song that broadened [...] "her potential market from teenage girls to anyone {{who used to be}} a teenage girl". Petridis continued, [...] "You applaud her skill, while feeling slightly unsettled by the thought of a teenager pontificating away like Yoda." [...] Aidan Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle ranked it twelfth on his top 12 singles of 2009 list, commenting, [...] "Damn it if this song isn't too sweet, too vulnerable and just <b>too</b> <b>real</b> to ignore." ...|$|E
60|$|Tom {{meant to}} reverse this image, but love is proverbially desperate in its figures of speech, and any thing was better than {{appearing}} to hesitate.

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{was very}} pleased with the episode, stating that it was [...] "a very good and well-acted episode. I like it because it {{actually}} seemed <b>too</b> <b>real</b> to me. It played less as a paranormal science fiction show than as whether or not something could really happen. The entire cast was wonderful. Overall that was a terrific episode". In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Lazarus" [...] was rated a C+, being described as [...] "as exciting as Scully's taste in men (not very)". The episode's supporting cast, however, was described as [...] "solid". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated episode a B-, finding that it had [...] "no real thematic resonance". He found that the episode left its premise [...] "largely unexplored", and would have benefited from a stronger focus on the relationship between the characters of Willis and Dupre. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode negatively, feeling that it [...] "wasn't up to much", and that it [...] "plays more like an episode of [...] than anything else". However, the exploration of Scully's character history was cited as a positive aspect of the episode. Anna Johns, writing for TV Squad, was critical of [...] "Lazarus", stating that its opening scene was [...] "the only good part" [...] of the episode.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, good-girl Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was <b>too</b> <b>real</b> for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death.|$|E

In particular, Yon has accused Barry A. Johnson of US Central Command of [...] "a subtle but all <b>too</b> <b>real</b> censorship" [...] as well as [...] "ineptitude in handling the press". The article nearly caused the military to ban Yon from re-entering Iraq. Yon frequently criticizes {{what he sees as}} inept public relations efforts from the Army staff.|$|E

2500|$|The {{memorial}} {{was designated}} as a Grade II listed building on 20 December 1965. [...] The designation was raised to Grade I on 28October 2014. [...] GradeI is the highest of the three grades of listing and is applied to [...] "buildings of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important". [...] When the models were shown at the Royal Academy exhibitions, it was their realism that most impressed the critics. [...] But {{it was not to}} everyone's liking. [...] Some critics thought that they were <b>too</b> <b>real</b> in appearance for their intended surroundings. [...] And they were not to the taste of the company's architect, James Lomax-Simpson who thought the composition was too complicated, and would have preferred something [...] "more straightforward, more symbolical and monumental". [...] The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner considered that it is a memorial that is [...] "genuinely moving and which avoids sentimentality". [...] Hartwell et al. in the Buildings of England series say [...] "It is deeply moving".|$|E
