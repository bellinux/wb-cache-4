500|$|The trip to America is approaching. [...] {{is not yet}} complete. Terrible haste... {{the score}} is only half-ready. The copyist, Mr. Kauppi, is staying with us and writing night and day... It is only because of Janne's [...] energy that we are making progress... We lit a lamp in the dining room, a {{chandelier}} in the living room, it was a festive moment. I didn't dare say a word. I just checked that the environment was in order. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed and Janne stayed up. All night long I could hear his footsteps, alternating with music played quietly.|$|E
500|$|Further {{disappointment}} followed as the American 4 x 100m relay team, with Gay as anchor, {{failed to}} qualify for the final. Darvis Patton and Gay failed to pass on the baton in the heat. Gay personally took responsibility for the dropped baton but Patton denied this was true, saying [...] "That's Tyson Gay. He's a humble guy, but I know it's my job to get the guy the baton and I didn't do that." [...] After stating his desire to win four Olympic gold medals (by adding the 400 metres to his repertoire) earlier in the year, Gay finished the 2008 Olympics without a single medal. Having failed to reach the finals of the 100m sprint or relay, he reflected upon his failure to make the podium in Beijing: [...] " [...] <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> grab it and there was nothing. It's kind of the way it's been happening to me this Olympics." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the game}} I told the captain that I {{was not happy}} and that I wanted to leave. After the game we spoke in the {{dressing}} room and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> have dinner. I got a call saying the captain had trashed my equipment. I was told the captain had said, [...] "if {{he does not want to}} play for Notts he can f*** off." [...] I have not spoken to Gallian since, nor have I received an apology. Pietersen was forced to complete the last year of his contract with Nottinghamshire, but [...] "didn't enjoy it at all".|$|E

2500|$|I {{produced}} the Black Crowes, and Jimmy joined {{them for a}} run of live dates in 1999. I saw the show in New York, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> California and recorded the shows, took the tapes away, and fixed them up a little and mixed them. I did Live at the Greek without any input from anyone, as it wasn't originally {{going to be an}} official release. But I think everyone was impressed with it; certainly Jimmy said he was. Then, when Jimmy decided to do a new [...] DVD, he started looking for someone familiar with the modern applications necessary for surround sound mixing. If you listen to the Royal Albert Hall [...] opening in 5.1, you can see Jimmy had this audio concept really early on of giving people a sense of the band going onstage and the audience swells around you. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements needed for the DVD project audio, and afterward, he asked if I would be interested in ‘helping’ him.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the accused}} mutineers was David Creagh, second officer of the Charles II. He testified that after refusing to {{participate}} in the mutiny—the only officer to do so—he was ordered to return below deck. On the way to his cabin, Creagh encountered William May, Captain Gibson's former steward. May, described by Every as one of the [...] "true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen," [...] was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone-chilling exchange:I met with W. May, the Prisoner at the Bar. What do you say here? says he. I made him no Answer, but went down to my Cabin; and he said, God damn you, you deserve to be shot through the Head; and he then held a Pistol to my Head. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> my Cabin, and presently came orders from Every, that those that would go ashore, should prepare to be gone. And when the Captain was got out of Bed, who was then very ill of a Feaver, Every came and said, I am a Man of Fortune, and must seek my Fortune.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> help {{to set the}} leg of {{the injured}} man, which was all the rest I got that morning.|$|E
60|$|I {{hands the}} money back to Major Tucker; and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>goes</b> over <b>to</b> Colonel Rockingham and slaps him on the back.|$|R
60|$|We {{got into}} the barn unperceived, and I watched him climb the ladder <b>to</b> the loft. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> indoors <b>to</b> tell them.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the way of}} {{the songs}} were written, Simon stated - [...] "I start with the rhythm. It's drums first, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> key to sound to guitar to the form of the song to the {{beginning}} of the melody. As the melody begins, so do the words. That's how it's been since Graceland. I write backward." [...] Simon was particularly grateful with the results of the songs written considering of his age.|$|R
60|$|I sat awake {{long after}} dark, but finally my eyes grew heavy and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{sleep on the}} bench until morning.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> her. At {{my first}} step {{she gave a}} little cry and swayed, and had I not taken {{her in my arms}} I believe she would have fallen.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> my pretty rose tree, [...] To tend her {{by day and}} by night; But my rose {{turned away}} with jealousy, [...] And her thorns were my only delight.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{they all}} feel you're rather big, anyhow. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> on <b>to</b> Park Lane {{to hear a}} new pianist and some other music at Eva's." ...|$|R
60|$|I got 'ome {{at about}} a quarter to seven, and slept like a child till pretty near four. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> downstairs <b>to</b> 'ave my dinner.|$|R
6000|$|The {{accounts}} of the Snake Dance contained mention of [...] "Black Mose," [...] who kept a band of toughs from interfering with the dance. His wonderful marksmanship was spoken of. He did not write till he reached Flagstaff. His letter was very brief. [...] "I'm going into the Grand Cañon for a few days, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work on a ranch south of here for the winter. In the spring I'm going over the range into California." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the heath and the wild, [...] To the thistles and thorns of the waste; [...] And {{they told}} me how they were beguiled, [...] Driven out, and {{compelled}} to the chaste.|$|E
60|$|However, for {{the present}} I let him go, knowing no better at that time: <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them with strings together, and with some {{difficulty}} brought them all home.|$|E
60|$|For {{two hours}} my pencil {{traveled}} over my pad with scarcely a rest. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the little room}} I had rented for two days, and there I cut it to half, and then mailed it, white-hot, to the Sun.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] {{said the}} Boots, [...] "we shall all be mad soon. The poor master, he is mad already." [...] And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> up <b>to</b> the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely; but I didn't {{attend to}} it. When the day's work is done, I take my walk. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> have my supper, my drop of grog, and my pipe. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed. A dull {{existence}} you think, I daresay! I had a miserable life, sir, when I was young. A bare subsistence, {{and a little}} rest, before the last perfect rest in the grave--that is all I want. The world has gone by me long ago. So much the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven’t {{seen him}} for some time," [...] said Mr. Tredgold, truthfully. [...] "He gave up smoking and—and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> didn’t <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see him, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess not. But {{there was}} thunder. I heard it, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the window and}} it wasn't raining. It was all stars {{and the sky was}} just getting sort of almost gray. You know what I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was young}} then," [...] he went on. [...] "Lord! how I used to fly round." [...] He {{seemed to take}} my measure. [...] "I was in the East Indies two years, and in Brazil seven. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Madagascar." ...|$|E
60|$|Hastening to {{what was}} called the clerk's winter house with these treasures I {{distributed}} them, and handed the men's packet to one of themselves, who was eagerly awaiting it. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> my room and barricaded the door to prevent interruption.|$|E
60|$|I dressed methodically, {{choosing}} the least frayed of my collars, and shaving much more carefully than was my wont; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> down <b>to</b> the Public Library to consult a map.|$|R
