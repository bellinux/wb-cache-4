5|$|Although {{a handful}} of Chinese {{settlers}} had arrived in Madagascar {{towards the end of}} the reign of Queen Ranavalona III, the first major influx of Chinese migrants followed an announcement by General Joseph Gallieni, first governor general of the colony of Madagascar, requesting 3,000Chinese laborers to construct a northern rail line between Antananarivo and Toamasina. Chinese migrants introduced a number of dishes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> part of urban popular cuisine in regions with large Chinese communities, including riz cantonais (Chinese fried rice), soupe chinoise (Chinese-style noodle soup), misao (fried noodles), pao (hum bao) and nems (fried egg rolls).|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> modified for predation.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E

In the future, such compounds may need to be substituted for antibiotics <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> ineffective due to bacterial resistance.|$|E

5|$|European {{classical}} music changed greatly in the 20th century. New music abandoned {{much of the}} historical, nationally developed schools of harmony and melody in favor of experimental music, atonality, minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. These changes have also made {{classical music}} less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E

The film depicts the events before and after the heist. Kirk Baltz, Randy Brooks and Steven Wright also play supporting roles. It incorporates many themes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profanity, and nonlinear storytelling.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely {{laser beam welding}} and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E
5|$|The fictional Baron's exploits, narrated in {{the first}} person, focus on his {{impossible}} achievements as a sportsman, soldier, and traveller, for instance riding on a cannonball, fighting a forty-foot crocodile, and travelling to the Moon. Intentionally comedic, the stories play on the absurdity and inconsistency of Munchausen's claims, and contain an undercurrent of social satire. The earliest illustrations of the character, perhaps created by Raspe himself, depict Munchausen as slim and youthful, although later illustrators have depicted him as an older man, and have added the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> part of the character's definitive visual representation. Raspe's book was a major international success, becoming the core text for numerous English, continental European, and American editions that were expanded and rewritten by other writers. The book in its various revised forms remained widely read throughout the 19th century, especially in editions for young readers.|$|E

5|$|Through his {{magazines}} and books, Robinson challenged many gardening traditions and introduced new ideas <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> commonplace today. He is most linked with introducing the herbaceous border, which {{he referred to}} by the older name of 'mixed border'—it included a mixture of shrubs, hardy and half-hardy herbaceous plants. He also advocated dense plantings that left no bare soil, with the spaces between taller plants filled with what are now commonly called ground cover plants. Even his rose garden at Gravetye was filled with saxifrage between and under the roses. Following {{a visit to the}} Alps, Robinson wrote Alpine Flowers for Gardens, which for the first time showed how to use alpine plants in a designed rock garden.|$|E
5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, John Ortberg's If You Want to Walk on Water, You've Got to Get Out of the Boat and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's So Amazing About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among baby boomers. Its popularity helped increase sales of Yancey's 2000 book Reaching for the Invisible God, which appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately after publication. What's So Amazing About Grace? {{is one of several}} books by Yancey <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> international bestsellers.|$|E

Those objects <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.|$|E
