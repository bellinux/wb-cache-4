5|$|A {{video of}} Franken at the Minnesota State Fair on September 2, 2009, {{engaging}} in a discussion {{with a group of}} Tea Party protesters on health care reform, began circulating on the Internet and soon went viral. The discussion was noted for its civility, in contrast to the explosive character of several other discussions between members of the 111th Congress and <b>their</b> <b>constituents</b> that had occurred over the summer.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{privilege}} protects contentious {{views expressed}} by MPs {{in the course}} of parliamentary proceedings in the interest of <b>their</b> <b>constituents</b> or the general public, and thus effectively buoys the right of free speech and expression. Members can speak freely and express themselves frankly in Parliament without fearing legal consequences because they are immune from any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or damages for what they have said.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{period for}} parties and candidates began on 11 March and continued until 1 April. It was {{split into two}} phases by Nyepi, the Balinese day of silence. Parties delivered their national agendas indoors between 11 and 25 March. Although this was meant to encourage dialogue between parties and <b>their</b> <b>constituents,</b> these events were poorly attended. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems conducted a tracking survey that showed not all voters knew how to vote for candidates of the new DPD, or were even aware it existed.|$|E

5|$|As Emily's winds eased over land, various {{assessment}} teams left Fort Bragg, North Carolina, {{to determine}} the extent of damage. FEMA informed the North Carolina congressional delegation about the storm's threat to <b>their</b> <b>constituents.</b> The agency later received compliments for their timely preparations for storm-related operations. All airports on the Outer Banks were reopened by September1. In response to the extensive scale of the power outages, power companies flew a helicopter over the region to assess the damage. The power was expected to be out for two weeks. Six emergency vehicles were sent to Dare County to provide drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon {{knew the}} primary bill would be widely {{supported}} in the General Assembly, since both legislators and <b>their</b> <b>constituents</b> {{had grown to}} distrust party nominating conventions. Accordingly, he proposed a bill enacting a mandatory two-stage primary in which a runoff election would be held between the top two candidates in the first round. Historian Lowell H. Harrison maintained that Laffoon expected his rival faction to nominate the aging Beckham to oppose Rhea, and that he hoped a two-stage primary would wear Beckham down. Journalist John Ed Pearce, however, contends that Beckham had already declined to become a candidate—citing his own ill health {{and that of his}} son—before the special session convened. Whatever the case, the legislature passed the bill that Laffoon proposed.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1916, Stevens announced the policy that the CUWS had organized in twenty-two states and planned on recruiting delegates {{for each of the}} 435 House Districts. The delegates were required to form committees to press Congressional Members to favor suffrage and make them aware that <b>their</b> <b>constituents</b> were in favor of women attaining the vote. Another strategy Stevens began implementing early in 1916 required CUWS members to go to other states in which women were allowed to vote, establish residence and register to vote. In this way, they could vote in state and national elections in the hope of filling the legislature with legislators who favored suffrage. Stevens registered to vote in Kansas that year. On 5 June 1916, the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP), having a single platform to acquire a constitutional amendment for national women's suffrage. After attending the NWP convention in Chicago in June, Stevens headed to a convention in Colorado. By October, Stevens was organizing and managing the NWP election campaign in California.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{supported}} {{the pipeline project}} even before the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from <b>their</b> <b>constituents,</b> created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial incentives, and granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by the oil companies on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E

25|$|Another common {{feature of}} polysynthetic {{languages}} {{is a tendency}} to use head marking as a means of syntactic cohesion. This means that many polysynthetic languages mark grammatical relations between verbs and <b>their</b> <b>constituents</b> by indexing the constituents on the verb with agreement morphemes, and the relation between noun phrases and <b>their</b> <b>constituents</b> by marking the head noun with agreement morphemes. There are some dependent-marking languages that may be considered to be polysynthetic because they use case stacking to achieve similar effects, and very long words.|$|E

25|$|Neither the {{president}} nor {{the prime minister}} seemed particularly concerned about official corruption and nepotism. Although these practices were conceivably normal in a society based on kinship, some were bitter over their prevalence in the National Assembly, where it seemed that deputies ignored <b>their</b> <b>constituents</b> in trading votes for personal gain.|$|E
25|$|Serving as the Chairman of the Federation of Synagogues Rabbinate {{for many}} years, Dayan Fisher's {{relationship}} with Federation lay leaders {{was not always}} happy.

25|$|Goldsmith advocates greater direct democracy, such as Switzerland's {{model of}} using referendums. Goldsmith {{believes}} that direct democracy would help combat feelings of disenfranchisement among people and increase accountability. He has also argued {{in favour of}} introducing measures so that MPs can be subject to recall referendums midway through their term if a sufficiently large number of <b>their</b> <b>constituents</b> petition for it.|$|E
25|$|A city's local {{government}} {{is headed by}} a mayor elected by popular vote. The vice mayor serves as the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlungsod (city council), which serves as the city's legislative body.

25|$|In 1952, Feldman assumed {{his first}} and only pulpit, that of Congregation Beth Jacob of Atlanta. That same year, he married his wife, Estelle, and brought his bride to Atlanta. At the time, the synagogue had 40 families, only two of whom were Shomer Shabbat. While other Orthodox synagogues in Atlanta were moving away from Orthodoxy, Rabbi and Rebbetzin Feldman tried to nurture Torah {{observance}} among <b>their</b> <b>constituents.</b>|$|E
25|$|Djou {{ran for a}} full term in November 2010. There {{was some}} {{controversy}} {{over the use of}} robocalling by the Congressman's official U.S. House office, both before the election and afterwards. However, as with all official mass communication between Members of the House and <b>their</b> <b>constituents,</b> the phone survey conducted on behalf of Congressman Djou's office was approved by the bipartisan Franking Commission as an appropriate use of official resources for the purpose of communicating with constituents.|$|E
