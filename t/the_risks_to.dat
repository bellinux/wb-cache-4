5|$|The redback spider's {{affinity}} for human-modified habitat has enabled it to spread to several countries via international shipping and trade. Furthermore, its tolerance to cold {{means that it}} {{has the ability to}} colonise many temperate countries with a winter climate cooler than Australia. This is concerning due to <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> people being bitten who are unaware of its venomous nature, and also to the conservation of local threatened insect species that the redback might prey upon.|$|E
5|$|During April 2011 {{internal}} deliberations of the president's innermost {{circle of}} advisors {{over whether to}} order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton {{was among those who}} argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. relationship with Pakistan. Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden's death, Clinton {{played a key role in}} the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader. During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).|$|E
5|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes several local nature reserves which provide roosts for thousands of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) each winter. The mouth of the river is where it flows into the National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel. It consists of large areas of mudflats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, {{some of which are}} vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. <b>The</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose {{a higher}} risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Constantine {{established}} {{a precedent for}} {{the position of the}} emperor as having great influence and ultimate regulatory authority within the religious discussions involving the early Christian councils of that time, e.g., most notably the dispute over Arianism. Constantine himself disliked <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> societal stability that religious disputes and controversies brought with them, preferring where possible to establish an orthodoxy. His influence over the early Church councils was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity; what proper worship and doctrines and dogma consisted of was for the Church to determine, {{in the hands of the}} participating bishops.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> the unborn child.|$|E

25|$|Asclepias curassavica or {{tropical}} milkweed, {{is often}} planted as an ornamental in butterfly gardens. Its distribution is probably worldwide. Year-round plantings {{may be the}} cause of new overwintering sites along the U.S. Gulf Coast. At these locations, it rarely freezes so the plants are present year round. This leads to year-round breeding of monarchs, which is not beneficial to the migration. This also leads to a dramatic buildup of the dangerous parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha. Because of <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> the monarch population posed by this plant, it is not recommended for planting.|$|E
25|$|A mass {{emigration}} {{was politically}} undesirable for the Soviet regime.

25|$|A {{pollution}} prevention, control, {{and restoration}} plan for Lake Champlain was first endorsed in October 1996 by {{the governors of}} New York and Vermont, and the regional administrators of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In April 2003, the plan was updated, and Quebec signed onto it. The plan is being implemented by the Lake Champlain Basin Program and its partners at the state, provincial, federal, and local levels. Renowned {{as a model for}} interstate and international cooperation, its primary goals are to reduce phosphorus inputs to Lake Champlain, reduce toxic contamination, minimize <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> humans from water-related health hazards, and control the introduction, spread, and impact of non-native nuisance species to preserve the integrity of the Lake Champlain ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Without the {{protection}} of Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere astronauts are exposed {{to high levels of}} radiation. A year in low Earth orbit results in a dose of radiation 10 times that of the annual dose on earth. High levels of radiation damage lymphocytes, cells heavily involved in maintaining the immune system; this damage contributes to the lowered immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also recently been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Outside {{the protection}} of low Earth orbit, galactic cosmic rays present further challenges to human spaceflight, as the health threat from cosmic rays significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade or more of exposure. A NASA-supported study reported that radiation may harm the brain of astronauts and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Solar flare events (though rare) can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes. It is thought that protective shielding and protective drugs may ultimately lower <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> an acceptable level.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{acute and}} late {{risks to the}} CNS from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar proton events (SPEs) are a {{documented}} concern for human exploration of our solar system. In the past, <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> the CNS of adults {{who were exposed to}} low to moderate doses of ionizing radiation (0 to 2 Gy (Gray) (Gy = 100 rad)) have not been a major consideration. However, the heavy ion component of space radiation presents distinct biophysical challenges to cells and tissues as compared to the physical challenges that are presented by terrestrial forms of radiation. Soon after the discovery of cosmic rays, the concern for CNS risks originated with the prediction of the light flash phenomenon from single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina; this phenomenon was confirmed by the Apollo astronauts in 1970 and 1973. HZE nuclei are capable of producing a column of heavily damaged cells, or a microlesion, along their path through tissues, thereby raising concern over serious impacts on the CNS. In recent years, other concerns have arisen with the discovery of neurogenesis and its impact by HZE nuclei, which have been observed in experimental models of the CNS.|$|E

30|$|The current EU {{regulation}} 1107 / 2009 concerning registering {{plant protection}} products (PPP) requires assessing <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> amphibians (and reptiles) from PPP.

In fact, several data analyses show that available aquatic toxicity endpoints for fish and other aquatic organisms cover potential toxicity to aquatic life stages of amphibians [6, 7]. However, terrestrial life stages are not necessarily covered by studies of birds and mammals as indicated in recent literature findings [8, 9], which have demonstrated toxicity of several pesticides if sprayed directly on juvenile frogs. As toxicity data of birds and mammals mostly result from oral exposure scenarios, they are likely <b>to</b> cover <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> amphibians from this route of exposure, too (Weltje et al. in review 2016).
