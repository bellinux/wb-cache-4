25|$|A {{major cause}} of dysgeusia is {{chemotherapy}} for cancer. Chemotherapy often induces damage to the oral cavity, resulting in oral mucositis, oral infection, and salivary gland dysfunction. Oral mucositis consists of inflammation of the mouth, along with sores and ulcers in the tissues. Healthy individuals normally have a diverse range of microbial organisms residing in their oral cavities; however, chemotherapy can permit these typically non-pathogenic agents to cause serious infection, which {{may result in a}} decrease in saliva. In addition, patients who undergo radiation therapy also lose salivary tissues. Saliva is {{an important component of the}} taste mechanism. Saliva both interacts with and protects the taste receptors in the mouth. Saliva mediates sour and sweet tastes through bicarbonate ions and glutamate, respectively. The salt taste is induced when sodium chloride levels surpass the concentration in the saliva. It has been reported that 50% of chemotherapy patients have suffered from either dysgeusia or another form of <b>taste</b> <b>impairment.</b> Examples of chemotherapy treatments that can lead to dysgeusia are cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and etoposide. The exact mechanism of chemotherapy-induced dysgeusia is unknown.|$|E

Diabetic patients have greater chances of developing oral health problems such as tooth decay, salivary gland dysfunction, fungal infections, inflammatory skin disease, periodontal disease or <b>taste</b> <b>impairment</b> and thrush of the mouth. The oral problems in persons suffering from diabetes can be prevented with a good control of the blood sugar levels, regular check-ups and a very good oral hygiene. By maintaining a good oral status, diabetic persons prevent losing their teeth as a result of various periodontal conditions.|$|E

40|$|Odour-induced tastes {{occur when}} smelling certain odours (e. g., sweet-smelling vanilla) and may {{represent}} a universal form of synaesthesia. If odour-induced tastes are perceptually akin to tastes generated by stimulating taste receptors on the tongue, as perceptual data imply, then these two forms of gustatory experience may also share common processing resources in the brain. In this study, we examine this hypothesis for two secondary gustatory processing areas-the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala. We compared nine patients with anteromedial temporal lobe (AMTL) resections that included the amygdala, and three patients with OFC damage, to a healthy comparison group (n = 42), on tests of olfactory, gustatory, and odour-induced taste perception. While AMTL patients had a range of generally small <b>taste</b> <b>impairments,</b> they were unimpaired on tests of odour-induced taste perception. Two of the three OFC cases had <b>impairments</b> in <b>taste</b> hedonics and discrimination. The case with the most profound gustatory deficit was also mildly impaired on tests of odour-induced taste perception. The OFC {{findings are consistent with}} overlaps in circuits supporting taste and odour-induced taste perception, especially those responsible for more perceptual aspects of processing. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Unconsciously {{detected}} chemicals {{may affect}} human behavior (Kirk-Smith et al., 1983; Stern and McClintock, 1998; Zucco et al., 2009), likeability judgments (Li et al., 2007) and brain activity (Lorig et al., 1990; Sobel et al., 1999). No studies, however, have investigated blind smell - the hypothetical olfactory counterpart of blindsight (Weiskrantz et al., 1974). Methods: In this report, free and cued olfactory identification of suprathreshold odorants varying in irritancy (i. e., low or no irritant odours versus irritant odours), and taste identification abilities, {{were examined in}} patient MB who had undergone surgery for a meningioma. Post-operative imaging revealed encephalomalacia in the left gyrus rectus, with ablation of the left olfactory bulb and damage to the right, subcortical abnormality on the left near the orbital cortex, and damage to a small section of the right gyrus rectus. Results: On free identification MB, while denying a capacity to smell the odours, still correctly identified some and detected others significantly above chance. In contrast, awareness always accompanied correct detections of irritant odours. Cued odour identification was at chance and no <b>taste</b> <b>impairments</b> were observed. Conclusions: We suggest, tentatively, that MB’s unusal pattern of awareness when detecting and identifying odours relative to irritant odours may represent an example of ‘blind smell’...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{frequency}} and clinical features of drug-related <b>taste</b> and/or smell <b>impairments</b> are currently unclear. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} study was to identify major drug classes associated with taste and smell alterations reported to the Italian spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting database.

40|$|Certain odors have tastelike qualities when sniffed. To {{the extent}} that these qualities are akin to real taste experiences, {{impairment}} in perception of odor-induced tastes should be accompanied by <b>taste</b> <b>impairment,</b> and vice versa. Twelve patients were selected with possible odor-induced taste impairments or general taste impairments via a screening test, along with a further 6 patients with a probable <b>taste</b> <b>impairment</b> (insular lesion). These 18 patients, along with 19 normal controls, completed a battery of odor, taste, visual control, and neuropsychological tests to assess impairments in odor-induced taste perception and general taste perception. Four patients had an odor-induced <b>taste</b> <b>impairment</b> and were also impaired on taste perception. A further analysis, using regression on the whole sample, indicated that taste impairments were associated with odor-induced taste abnormalities independent of other predictors. This pattern also held for the patient group alone. The insular patients also exhibited both taste and odor-induced taste impairments. This study {{is the first to}} demonstrate a relationship between impaired taste perception and the perception of odor-induced tastes and suggests that both may rely on certain common neural substrates. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} liver disease may have <b>taste</b> <b>impairment</b> and altered zinc metabolism.

All groups of patients had low plasma zinc levels and decompensated cirrhotics had a significantly increased urinary output of zinc. No correlation was found between taste acuity and plasma zinc levels when only cirrhotic patients were considered.

40|$|IntroductionOften {{overlooked}} and underdiagnosed, taste {{disorders are}} frequent and serious conditions: they are implicated in loss of appetite, unintended {{weight loss and}} malnutrition, and lead to reduced quality of life. The lack of consideration given to <b>taste</b> <b>impairment,</b> compared with other disabilities, is striking: {{it is obvious that}} a person with hearing loss may no longer be interested in opera, or a person with visual impairment may no longer enjoy films, but the consequences of <b>taste</b> <b>impairment</b> for those affected are still taken too lightly. Yet taste provides a vital tool for screening soluble chemicals for food evaluation and selection, and thus avoiding potentially toxic substances. The loss of taste is a genuine disability. Do not we say “to lose the taste for life”!a In current medical practice, the importance and therapeutic management of taste disorders is receiving renewed interest, as evidenced by recent reviews (Maheswaran et al., 2014; Malaty and Malaty, 2013; Fark et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2014). Methods to explore, and identify qualitative or quantitative taste alterations are described elsewhere (Bromley, 2000; Venail et al., 2008; Ruo Redda and Allis, 2006; Galindo-Cuspinera et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2009; Wismer, 2008) ...|$|E

30|$|Importantly, {{symptoms}} {{from the}} tumour (such as pain and difficulty swallowing) and its treatments often result in significant physical impairment (e.g. loss of <b>taste),</b> functional <b>impairment</b> (e.g. difficulty breathing, {{as well as}} voice, speech and hearing impairment), and psychosocial problems (e.g. depression, social isolation, and delays returning to work); {{all of which can}} {{have a negative impact on}} all aspects of patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [2, 6 – 8]. Thus, assessing symptoms, changes in physical, functional, and socio-psychosocial impairment, as well as in overall HRQoL, particularly within clinical trials, is necessary not only to evaluate the impact of the disease and its treatments on patients’ lives, but also to make informed decisions on clinical care and rehabilitative services for patients [7 – 9].|$|R

Density of fungiform papillae was also determined in each subject. The biopotentials were recorded by means of differential electrophysiological derivations between two silver electrodes, one in contact with the ventral surface of the tongue and one in perfect adhesion with the dorsal surface.

Taste {{disorders in}} the elderly Magdalena Sykuła, Aleksandra Stelmach, Monika Szacoń, Katarzyna Kuśmierz, Małgorzata Sutuła, Marcin Rząca, Hanna Kachaniuk Introduction: Disorders of the sense of taste mainly affect the elderly. There are many factors that contribute to their development, including various types of chronic diseases, polypharmacy, and the use of stimulants. <b>Taste</b> <b>impairments</b> lead to improper nutritional behaviour in the elderly, which may cause deterioration of their health and reduce their quality of life. Goal: The aim of the study was to estimate taste deficits in the elderly. Method: The participants were 24 persons aged 70 – 86. Sample size was limited by the number of available professional taste test kits (for identification of the four basic gustatory qualities: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter). The respondents were assisted by a researcher to fill in a survey about their health status, eating habits, and subjective assessment of their taste function. Results: Most of the elderly persons assessed their taste function as being good, and the rating increased with the age of the participants. However, the organoleptic test showed that taste identification became less accurate with age. The participants had the greatest trouble recognizing the salty (58 %) and sour (79 %) tastes and had much less difficulty identifying the sweet (96 %) and bitter (92 %) tastes. The subjects' perception of taste became less and less intense with age. Conclusions: 	The seniors were the least likely to accurately recognize the salty taste. 	With age, the accuracy of identification of sweet, sour, bitter and salty gustatory qualities became lower. 	The positive subjective assessment of the taste function in the elderly did not go hand in hand with their actual taste perception, which declined with age. 	The use of stimulants such as alcohol and tobacco, pharmacological treatment of chronic diseases, and use dental prostheses reduced the perceived intensity of taste. 	The taste disorders observed among the elderly can lead to dietary mistakes and thus negatively affect their health. Key words: dysgeusia, seniors, eating habits, health risk...|$|R
40|$|Practical and {{reliable}} methods for the objective measure of taste function are critically important for studies aimed at evaluating eating behavior and <b>taste</b> function <b>impairment.</b> Here we present direct {{measures of the}} peripheral gustatory system activation, {{by means of a}} new, highly reliable and yet non-invasive technique for the electrophysiological recording from the human tongue in response to taste stimuli. Firstly, we validated the efficacy of method based on comparing the bioelectric activity recorded in response to the paradigmatic gustatory stimulus, 6 -n-propylthiouracil (PROP), with parameters defining PROP genotype and phenotype of forty-three subjects. The main results were: 1) PROP stimulation evoked negative monophasic potentials characterized by a fast initial rise followed by a slow decline, which represent the measure of the summated voltage change resulting from the response of stimulated taste cells; 2) direct associations were found between parameters describing the waveform of signals (depolarization amplitude and depolarization rate) and TAS 2 R 38 genotype, fungiform papilla density and PROP phenotype of subjects. Secondly, we developed an automated learning approach capable of discriminating among subjects belonging to three PROP taster categories (super-tasters, medium taster and non-taster), by exploiting features extracted by electrophysiological recordings from the tongue of thirty-nine subjects. Results showed {{that it is possible to}} automatically achieve objective PROP taster status identification with a high accuracy (80 ± 18 %), which reaches 94 ± 15 % when only super-tasters and non-tasters are considered. Finally, preliminary results of the electrophysiological recording in response to sucrose, NaCl, citric acid, caffeine, umami and oleic acid showed the feasibility of the method also for other gustatory stimuli, thus providing a first proof of its general applicability. The proposed approach, representing the first objective and automatic method to directly measure human gustatory responses, may represent a milestone for physiology studies on taste, with applications ranging from basic science and medicine to food tasting evaluations...|$|R

40|$|Conclusion: Delayed {{facial nerve}} (FN) {{impairment}} {{was shown to}} occur after Esteem® surgery, and taste disturbances were found in {{a limited number of}} subjects. Thus, when this type of active middle ear implant (AMEI) is to be implanted, these specific complications need to be shared with the candidate. Objectives: To report on FN involvement in Esteem® AMEI surgery. Methods: A total of 23 males and 11 females, who presented with sensorineural hearing loss of varying severity, underwent surgical implantation of the Esteem® AMEI. FN function was assessed according to the House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. A specific question regarding <b>taste</b> <b>impairment</b> was administered to each patient on the first day and 3 months after surgery. Results: None of the patients presented with a FN deficit in the first postoperative days. In three patients (8. 8 %), FN palsy developed after 7 days (two patients) and 10 days (one patient), and the severities were HB 4 (two cases) and HB 5 (one case).

Objectives: The objective was to study the oral manifestations in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to establish an association between oral manifestations and associated microvascular and macrovascular complications. Materials and Methods: 50 cases of DM were selected who had oral complications. The control group comprised 50 age- and sex-matched diabetic patients without any oral complications. Results: Oral manifestations in DM included periodontal disease in 34 %, oral candidiasis in 24 %, tooth loss in 24 %, oral mucosal ulcers in 22 %, <b>taste</b> <b>impairment</b> in 20 %, xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction in 14 %, dental caries in 24 %, and burning mouth sensation in 10 % cases.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on {{identifying}} the factors that lead to divergent conclusions {{about the role of the}} PROP phenotype in taste perception, food preferences, and nutrition. One of the major issues is the difficulty in obtaining an objective measure of the taste phenotype. Here we present direct measures of the gustatory system activation, by electrophysiological recordings from the tongue, in thirty subjects classified by PROP taster status and genotyped for TAS 2 R 38. The potentials generated by PROP stimulation were recorded by means of differential electrophysiological derivations between two silver electrodes, one in contact with the ventral surface of the tongue and one in perfect adhesion with the dorsal surface. The signals were recorded by a polygraph for human use and visualized in real time on PC. The electrotastegrams (ETGs) were analyzed by Clampfit 10. 0 software and validated by comparing the voltage amplitude of signals with the perceived PROP bitterness intensity, PROP taster status and TAS 2 R 38 genotypes. The ETGs showed that PROP stimulation evoked negative monophasic potentials characterized by a fast initial rise followed by a slow decline. These potentials represent the measure of the summated voltage change resulting from the response of stimulated taste cells. The amplitude of potentials was highly correlated with the perceived PROP bitterness intensity (p< 0. 0001), with voltage reaching as high as 120 mV in super-taster who were homozygous for the tasting variant (PAV) of TAS 2 R 38. The depolarization amplitude, as well as depolarization rate, were associated with PROP taster status and TAS 2 R 38 diplotypes.

40|$|Ability {{to taste}} Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) a bitter {{compound}} {{is widely used}} to know the heritable trait in both genetic and anthropological studies. The study {{is based on the}} ability of a person to sense the taste of PTC. Inability to taste has also been associated with medical illness not typically with <b>taste</b> <b>impairment,</b> so far no study has yet proved whether PTC blindness correlates with childhood obesity. This study is the first attempt to examine PTC sensitivity in obese children and healthy children to determine variation in the perception of bitter tastes which is associated with eating behavior, body mass index, and childhood obesity. The present investigation is carried out in Mysore, during years 2008 - 2009. Phenylthiocarbamide taste sensitivity was measured by administering PTC solution for obese and control children by modified method of Harris and Kalmus. The result focused that tasters were significantly more frequent (67 %) than non-tasters (33 %) in control population. A higher proportion of non-tasters were observed in obese children (72 %) when compare to non-obese subjects (28 %). These differences were not explained by alterations in perception of basic taste sensitivity or age. Increased frequency of non-taster allele is evident in children with obese condition. This could be due to lack of preference for food among non-tasters. As the phenotypic variation in PTC sensitivity is genetic in origin, it may represent a surrogate risk factor for the development of childhood obesit...|$|E
40|$|Taste {{threshold}} {{for the four}} basic tastes were determined to assess <b>taste</b> <b>impairment</b> in 11 children with acute leukemia undergoing marrow transplantation and in 20 normal children. Thresholds were measured on admission, 2 days, and 45 days after transplant using the Up-Down Staircase method. No significant difference was noted between patients at admis-sion and the control group for sweet, bitter, or salt. There {{was a significant difference}} between patients and controls for the sour threshold (p = 0. 006). Patient threshold values on day 2 and day 45 posttransplant were compared with admission val-ues. No significant differences were seen, except for the salt threshold which was increased at day 2 posttransplant when compared with the admission values. We conclude that only minor changes in taste thresholds were demonstrated in this study. These changes probably do not account for abnormal food tastes reported by patients. The decreased food intake of cancer patients can be due in part to changes in the ability to taste. 1, These changes may be caused by the disease itself or by the therapy. 3. 4 In children with leukemia undergoing marrow transplantation, the preparation therapy and the com-plications resulting from treatment can increase nutri-tional needs. 5 Problems of anorexia and mucositis, cou-pled with sensory abnormalities of taste and smell, make it difficult for the patient to maintain an adequate nutri-ent intake. &dquo; This study examines taste ability as meas-ured by the taste {{threshold for}} the four basic tastes (sweet, sour, salt, and bitter) in marrow transplant recip-ients and in normal subjects...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Taste {{and smell}} changes due to {{chemotherapy}} {{may contribute to}} the high prevalence of overweight in testicular cancer patients (TCPs). This study investigates the taste and smell function, dietary intake, food preference, and body composition in TCPs before, during, and up to 1 year after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive TCPs participated. At baseline TCPs were compared to healthy controls (N = 48). Taste strips and 'Sniffin' Sticks' were used to determine psychophysical taste and smell function. Subjective taste, smell, appetite, and hunger were assessed using a questionnaire. Dietary intake was analyzed using a food frequency questionnaire. Food preference was assessed using food pictures varying in taste (sweet/savoury) and fat or protein content. A Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was performed to measure whole body composition. RESULTS: Compared to controls, TCPs had a lower smell threshold (P = 0. 045) and lower preference for high fat sweet foods at baseline (P = 0. 024). Over time, intra-individual psychophysical taste and smell function was highly variable. The salty taste threshold increased at completion of chemotherapy compared to baseline (P = 0. 006). A transient decrease of subjective taste, appetite, and hunger feelings was observed per chemotherapy cycle. The percentage of fat mass increased during chemotherapy compared to baseline, while the lean mass and bone density decreased (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Coping strategies regarding subjective <b>taste</b> <b>impairment</b> should especially be provided {{during the first week of}} each chemotherapy cycle. Since the body composition of TCPs already had changed at completion of chemotherapy, intervention strategies to limit the impact of cardiovascular risk factors should probably start during treatment...|$|E
40|$|In some cases, pine seeds {{can leave}} a bitter taste {{in the mouth}} after consumption. These taste {{disturbances}} either occur immediately or with a time delay of {{two to three days}} and in most cases die away after two weeks at the latest[1]. So far, the symptoms have always been described as reversible. Consumers in Germany and other EU member states have reported these symptoms. According to current scientific knowledge, there is no danger to health. Up till now, these taste disturbances have been described for pine seeds originating from China and Pakistan. Those countries mainly use pine seeds of the Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) for the food sector. There is a suspicion that in addition to this species which is listed as edible by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States (FAO) [2] other types of pine seeds are mixed in which are not included in this list. Even though various approaches are currently used to prove the existence of different species in commercially available pine seeds {{on the basis of their}} fatty acid pattern[3][4], no evidence to substantiate this suspicion has been presented yet. In the view of the BfR, further studies on botanically defined pine seed samples are required to provide such evidence. The cause of the taste disturbances is unknown. The current assumption is that the bitter taste is attributable directly or indirectly to the natural components of the seeds. Based on the studies available, residue from pesticides, poison from mycotoxins or heavy metals can be excluded as a cause. In addition, it is not possible at this point in time to identify, neither by means of visual controls nor chemical and analytical procedures, pine seeds whose consumption leads to <b>taste</b> <b>impairment...</b>|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY In {{a series}} of 126 {{patients}} with Bell's palsy, chemical or overt diabetes mellitus was found in 39 % of the cases. A high frequency of disturbances of taste {{was found in the}} patients who had no diabetes (83 %), as compared to only 14 % of diabetic patients whose taste was affected (p. < 0. 00 1). Thus, the usual site of facial nerve lesion in diabetics appears to be distal to the chorda tympani, while in patients whose glucose tolerance is normal, no such selectivity exists. This may only be explained by a diabetes-related pathogenesis and a vascular rather than a generalised "metabolic " impairment is postulated, leading to a localised facial nerve ischaemia in the distal part of the Fallopian canal. Thus, some cases of Bell's palsy may in fact be a diabetic mononeuropathy. Since Korczyn first reported a high frequency of diabetes mellitus in patients presenting with Bell's palsy, ' this association has been confirmed by others, 23 so that screening for diabetes mellitus was recommended for patients presenting with this neurological deficit. Conversely, the risk of Bell's palsy is increased in diabetes. 2 It was also noted that diabetic patients with Bell's palsy were much more prone to develop a more severe nerve injury and had a less favourable outcome. 45 A suggestion was made that Bell's palsy resulted from ischaemia of the facial nerve, due in many cases to diabetic small vessel disease, ' but no convincing evidence for a causal relation was presented so far. Bell's palsy is prominent among the causes of <b>taste</b> <b>impairment,</b> but the reported frequency of taste involvement in Bell's palsy varies. 67 Taste has not yet been studied in concurrent diabetes mellitus and Bell's palsy, and may perhaps be used to clarify the dilemma of this relationship. 4 Patients and methods One hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients were referred for treatment of Bell's palsy, during a period o...|$|E

Background: Taste has {{an extreme}} {{importance}} on individual nutrition, health and quality-of-life status. Parkinson's disease (PD), {{one of the}} most frequent neurodegenerative disorders, is becoming a systemic disease with an increasing awareness to the importance of non-motor symptoms for early PD diagnosis and early intervention. Dysgeusia may be a non-motor symptom of PD, similar to olfaction, however its role in PD diagnosis have not been well established yet. Purpose: To determine whether taste function is impaired in patients with PD. Research strategy: A systematic review research was carried out on the 30 of November 2015, using PubMed, Cochrane Library, SciELO, Web of Science, Index of Portuguese Medical Journal (IndexRMP. pt) and National Guideline Clearinghouse (guideline. gov). The metaRegister of Controlled Clinical Trials and ClinicalTrials. gov were also searched. We utilized the following equation: (“taste” (MeSH) OR “taste*”) OR “dysgeusia” (MeSH) OR “taste disorders” (MeSH) AND (“Parkinson’s disease” (MeSH) OR “Parkinson*”). Selection criteria: We have selected original studies conducted with PD patients that investigated the symptoms, incidence, prevalence and severity of <b>taste</b> <b>impairment.</b> There was no restriction on the study design, and publication date or status, but on the PubMed database, we have activated filters concerning to species (humans), and language (English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese). Data Extraction: Independent extraction of articles by 2 authors in accordance with the pre-established selection criteria. A standardized template was filled including the following information: author, year, sample, diagnosis and severity of PD, cognition and therapeutic status, purpose, type of intervention, main results and study limits. Results: We have found 334 studies by using the keywords and above search criteria. After adjusting for duplicates 173 remained. Out of this total, 125 were excluded by the title, 26 by the abstract, and 11 after we read the full text. Thus, a total of 11 studies were selected and analyzed in this review. Conclusion: We have observed a lack of standardization on the measurement methods used to assess taste function in PD patients, with great heterogeneity in the participants samples, which reduces the effectiveness and reliability of the results. Even though, an impairment of taste in PD has been described by the majority of the studies, but the clinical usefulness of taste testing seems to be limited at present, and, therefore, further research is encouraged...|$|E
