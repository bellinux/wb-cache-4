25|$|Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr. (July 7, 1868– June 14, 1924) was an American engineer, {{consultant}} and author, known as early advocate of scientific management and {{a pioneer of}} <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>study,</b> and is perhaps {{best known as the}} father and central figure of Cheaper by the Dozen.|$|E
25|$|Frank Gilbreth (husband of Lillian) {{discovered}} scientific management {{while working}} in the construction industry, eventually developing motion studies independently of Taylor. These logically complemented Taylor's time studies, as time and motion are {{two sides of the}} efficiency improvement coin. The two fields eventually became <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s a <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>study</b> was {{undertaken}} by the owners, Bowaters UK, and the railway was deemed to be more expensive than road transport and was closed. However, Bowaters UK offered the main line, some of the locos and rolling stock of the railway to the Locomotive Club of Great Britain for preservation as a tourist railway. Other locomotives and rolling stock were sold to the Great Whipsnade Railway and the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. The SKLR is now the longest continuous operator of the railway.|$|E
50|$|Taylor and Gantt {{launched}} {{the study of}} the deliberate, rational organization of work, primarily in the context of manufacturing. This gave rise to <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies.</b> Related concepts include job shops and queuing systems (Markov chains).|$|R
50|$|The {{systems of}} <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies</b> are {{frequently}} {{assumed to be}} interchangeable terms, descriptive of equivalent theories. However, the underlying principles and {{the rationale for the}} establishment of each respective method are dissimilar, despite originating within the same school of thought.|$|R
50|$|Lillian Gilbreth {{combined}} {{the talents of}} an engineer, psychologist and mother of twelve. Her appreciation of human factors made her successful {{in the implementation of}} <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> scientific management. She went on to pioneer ergonomics in the kitchen, inventing the pedal bin, for example.|$|R
25|$|Lawson Billinton, the District Locomotive Superintendent at New Cross depot {{had sought}} to {{alleviate}} the situation by executing repairs and boiler changes, but this had little impact on the problem. The LB Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent D.E. Marsh received {{much of the blame}} for the problem, which had been developing for some years, and he was granted leave of absence due to sickness in 1910, followed by his resignation in July 1911. Billinton had been invited to take over on a temporary basis during Marsh's sickness, and promptly set about re-organising the works and reducing the backlog by using emerging <b>Time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>study</b> techniques.|$|E
25|$|Productivity is a {{standard}} efficiency metric for evaluation of production systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume many specific forms, for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=inventory turnover). It is also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total time) and yield η (ratio between produced volume and productive time) to better evaluate production systems performances. Cycle times can be modeled through manufacturing engineering if the individual operations are heavily automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include: <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>study,</b> predetermined motion time systems and work sampling.|$|E
25|$|Flourishing in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, {{scientific}} management built on earlier pursuits of economic efficiency. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of , it favored empirical methods to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus {{it was followed by}} a profusion of successors in applied science, including <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>study,</b> the Efficiency Movement (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), Fordism, operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, management science, manufacturing engineering, logistics, business process management, business process reengineering, lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.|$|E
40|$|Health IT {{implementations}} often introduce {{radical changes}} to clinical work processes and workflow. Prior research investigating this effect has shown conflicting results. Recent <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies</b> have consistently {{found that this}} impact is negligible; whereas qualitative studies have repeatedly revealed negative end-user perceptions suggesting decreased efficiency and disrupted workflow...|$|R
40|$|Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is the {{culmination}} of a variety of process improvement methods. These methods began in the 1920 s with the development of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>and</b> the principles of statistical quality control. Thirty years later in the early 1950 s, W. Edwards Deming and Bonnie Small developed the foundations of modern process improvement methods...|$|R
50|$|Task {{analysis}} may be {{of manual}} tasks, such as bricklaying, and be analyzed as <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies</b> using concepts from industrial engineering. Cognitive task analysis is applied to modern work environments such as supervisory control where little physical work occurs, but the tasks are more related to situation assessment, decision making, and response planning and execution.|$|R
2500|$|BAA {{has stated}} that eight {{crossings}} would have slight impact, with barrier closure times increasing {{by no more than}} 13%. Three level crossing more would have been moderately affected, with increases of between 13% and 25% to {{the amount of time that}} the barriers are closed to road traffic. Four crossings would have been [...] "severely" [...] affected, with barrier downtimes increasing by between 25% and 36%. As no independent <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>study</b> had been conducted, the closure times of level crossings and impact to the surrounding area had yet to be assessed at the time of the project's cancellation.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor is also {{credited}} {{for developing}} stopwatch time study, this combined with Frank and Lillian Gilbreth motion study {{gave way to}} <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>study</b> which is centered on the concepts of standard method and standard time. Frank Gilbreth is also responsible for introducing the flow process chart in 1921. Other contemporaries of Taylor worth remembering are Morris Cooke (rural electrification in the 1920s and implementer of Taylor's principles of scientific management in the Philadelphia's Department of Public Works), Carl Barth (speed-and-feed-calculating slide rules [...] ) and Henry Gantt (Gantt chart). Also in 1910 Hugo Diemer published the first industrial engineering book: Factory Organization and Administration.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{thought that}} by {{analyzing}} work, the [...] "one best way" [...] {{to do it}} would be found. He is most remembered for developing the stopwatch time study, which combined with Frank Gilbreth's motion study methods, later became the field of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>study.</b> He broke a job into its component parts and measured each to the hundredth of a minute. One of his most famous studies involved shovels. He noticed that workers used the same shovel for all materials. He determined that the most effective load was 21½ lb, and found or designed shovels that for each material would scoop up that amount. He was generally unsuccessful in getting his concepts applied, and was dismissed from Bethlehem Iron Company/Bethlehem Steel Company. Nevertheless, Taylor was able to convince workers who used shovels and whose compensation was tied to how much they produced to adopt his advice about the optimum way to shovel by breaking the movements down into their component elements and recommending better ways to perform these movements. It was largely {{through the efforts of}} his disciples (most notably H.L. Gantt) that industry came to implement his ideas. Moreover, the book he wrote after parting company with the Bethlehem company, Shop Management, sold well.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s Mogensen further {{experimented with}} <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies</b> using <b>motion</b> pictures. Early 1940s Mogensen was noted for making movies of {{operations}} in hospitals, where {{he discovered that}} surgeons could work faster by avoiding lost <b>motions,</b> <b>and</b> in doing so reduce the mortality rate. At Lake Placid Mogensen kept organizing the Work Simplification Conferences for almost 50 years.|$|R
25|$|Other work {{processes}} involved {{minimizing the}} number of steps in doing individual tasks, such as bricklaying, by performing <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies</b> to determine the one best method, the system becoming known as Taylorism after Fredrick Winslow Taylor who is the best known developer of this method, which {{is also known as}} scientific management after his work The Principles of Scientific Management.|$|R
25|$|This {{reflects}} {{the idea that}} workers {{have a vested interest}} in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies</b> combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies</b> ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|R

50|$|Belles on Their Toes {{was written}} about the Gilbreth family after Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.'s death, and how they survived as their mother, Lillian Moller Gilbreth, {{continued}} the pioneering work in industrial engineering, <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>and</b> industrial/organizational psychology she had shared with her husband.

5000|$|The term [...] "going to the gemba" [...] or, more appropriately, the Japanese term [...] "genchi gembutsu" [...] is also {{perceived}} to be comparable to management by walking around.

[...] In the case of nurses, numerous programs have been initiated to increase the percent of a shift nurses spend providing direct care to patients. Prior to interventions nurses were found to spend ~20% of their time doing direct care. After focused intervention, some hospitals doubled that number, with some even exceeding 70% of shift time with patients, resulting in reduced errors, codes, and falls.|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{coordination}} {{and control of}} production processes became a central issue in industrial capitalism, authors have tried to demonstrate in their writings ways in which science can support this need to control {{on the part of}} entrepreneurs and managers. Foucault has put much emphasis on the relationship between science and power and has tried to demonstrate that the social sciences and their writings have helped to generate power techniques to enhance the role of those who are in charge. His approach, however, leads {{to the conclusion that the}} development of knowledge is not able to liberate the human race from oppression. Habermas has shown that by differentiating between several forms of human action it is still possible to see knowledge even in its written form as an emancipatory force, and to improve the human lot. The author defends this point of view by writing a historical narrative about one specific concept of management science: <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> <b>studies.</b> The writings in this field could equally have been a technique to oppress or to emancipate.
