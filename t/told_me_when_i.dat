500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> ... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ford Obert {{has since}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{came back to}} him there were tears in my eyes, and I didn't know at the moment how much the words with which he met me took for granted my {{consciousness}} of them. [...] "He looks a hundred years old!" ...|$|R

60|$|I {{was quite}} at home now in society, and knew nearly every one, {{and enjoyed the}} {{conversation}} now as much, or more, than the dancing.

They was goin' along close-hauled, with a heavy sea on, not far, it must have been, from the Silver Pits--though they wasn't discovered at that time." ...|$|R
