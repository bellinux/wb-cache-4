5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen's prose was able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>those</b> subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian and naive because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.|$|E
5|$|They {{team up with}} a {{group called}} the Sweeper Alliance to storm the Apostles of the Stars' island, {{organized}} by Chronos assassin Lin Shaolee in disguise to act as decoys for Chronos' own attack. Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. Sephiria Arks faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>those</b> that give Creed immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to walk away, and the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.|$|E
25|$|Multiculturalism – Although the {{theoretical}} foundations of psychology {{are rooted in}} European culture, {{there is a growing}} recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>those</b> differences into greater consideration. Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of acculturation can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.|$|E

500|$|From {{growing up}} in the Seward {{household}} with Canon Seward {{and the members of the}} Lunar Society, Honora Sneyd and her childhood friend Anna Seward developed relatively progressive views for the times on the status of women and equality in marriage, a key to which was female education. Sneyd entered into marriage with Richard Edgeworth on the understanding that they were equal partners in his work. Anna and later Honora's stepdaughter, Maria Edgeworth, were <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>those</b> values and promote them in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century Britain, the ancestors of modern feminists. Today Honora's position on women's rights is best remembered for her rebuke of Thomas Day and his theory of the [...] "perfect wife".|$|E
2500|$|Despite having Kevin Harvick {{filling his}} {{rearview}} mirror, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. {{was able to}} maintain the lead to complete the first Pocono sweep since Denny Hamlin did it in 2006.

It takes a really, really smart guy to understand what to do <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>those</b> gambles. Sometimes they pay off, sometimes they don't."

2500|$|Because it was Rock's {{first time}} {{producing}} a Metallica album, {{he had the}} band make the album in different ways; he asked them to record songs collaboratively rather than individually in separate locations. He also suggested recording tracks live and using harmonic vocals for Hetfield. Rock was expecting the production to be [...] "easy" [...] but had trouble working with the band, leading to frequent, engaged arguments with the band members over aspects of the album. Rock wanted Hetfield to write better lyrics and found his experience recording with Metallica disappointing. Since the band was perfectionist, Rock insisted they recorded as many takes as {{needed to get the}} sound they wanted. The album was remixed three times and cost [...] The troubled production coincided with Ulrich, Hammett and Newsted divorcing their wives; Hammett said this influenced their playing because they were [...] "trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>those</b> feeling of guilt and failure and channel them into the music, to get something positive out of it".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{featured in the}} March 21, 2012 issue of Kerrang! magazine, Bennington stated that the band has returned to more 'familiar' territory on their new record, saying [...] "with this [...] album, we've incorporated a lot of guitar work with big choruses and the heavier electronic stuff to give it that really big wall of sound feeling without getting too metal. This will be more familiar to people than A Thousand Suns was, where we were like 'Fuck it, we're {{just going to go}} bonkers." [...] Bennington also said that the new album's lyrics would be personal and avoid being political, adding [...] "We've been writing a lot about relationships." [...] Bennington and Shinoda echoed similar statements during {{an interview}} with Spin, with the former commenting that [...] "We now know we have the skills and the tools <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>those</b> ideas and make them into what we're actually looking for, as opposed to getting into it and discovering that it just sounds really nü-metal. That's always going to be gross to us, but we can take elements of that and reinvent the vibe, make it new and fresh." [...] The two previewed five songs from the album, as well as announced that they had collaborated with Canadian musician Owen Pallett. The vocalists also stated that they have adopted numerous influences and topics for the album, particularly about people.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the world rankings, the previous year's winner and runner-up were allocated the top seedings in the World Championship, held annually. As more tournaments were added to the calendar and more players joined the circuit in the 1970s, it became increasingly necessary to seed the tournaments, precipitating the [...] "Order of Merit" [...] for the 1975/1976 season. The system was very basic, with seedings {{based on the results of}} the last three World Championships, and rankings were formally introduced in 1976 after the World Championship for the 1976/1977 season using the same criteria. By the 1982/1983 season many more tournaments were being contested, and it seemed reasonable <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>those</b> results into consideration too. The Professional Players Tournament and International Open were awarded ranking status, working on the same system; the Classic carried ranking points from the 1983/1984 season, the UK Championship and British Open from 1984/1985. The revised system was now based on only the two previous seasons, and updated annually after the World Championship. While the ranking point allocations have undergone modifications down the years the basic system has remained the same up until the 2009/2010 season. For the 2010/2011 season, the system was revised to incorporate ranking updates after every tournament—instead of once a season—in an effort to make the rankings more reflective of current form. The current system utilises a two-year [...] "rolling" [...] format where points from tournaments in the current season replace the points from corresponding tournaments of two seasons ago.|$|E
