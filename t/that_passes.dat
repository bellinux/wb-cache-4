5|$|A sungrazing comet is a comet <b>that</b> <b>passes</b> {{extremely}} {{close to the}} Sun at perihelion, generally within a few million kilometres. Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.|$|E

5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal <b>that</b> <b>passes</b> through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
5|$|In Elbridge, NY321 intersects {{with several}} county routes, {{including}} Halfway Road (CR107; former NY368), a connector highway {{leading to the}} hamlet of Halfway. Soon afterwards, NY321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY5. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY931F) just inside the Camillus town line soon after the turn. Forward Road, a local road <b>that</b> <b>passes</b> through a mixture of open fields and forests, serves as a connector between NY321 and NY174.|$|E

5|$|The first {{ascent of}} Mount Adams was in 1854 by Andrew Glenn Aiken, Edward Jay Allen, and Andrew J. Burge. While most sources list the {{aforementioned}} names, {{at least one}} substitutes Colonel Benjamin Franklin Shaw for Andrew Burge.

5|$|In Imperial County, SR78 intersects with SR 86, running {{concurrently}} with it {{southwest of}} the Salton Sea and northwest of San Felipe Creek. SR78 passes through the desert community of Elmore Desert Ranch before entering the city of Westmorland. The route, still concurrent with SR86, enters into the city of Brawley as Main Street, where SR86 splits to the south towards El Centro. SR78 continues north onto the Brawley Bypass, a freeway <b>that</b> <b>passes</b> {{to the north of}} downtown Brawley. SR 111 runs concurrently with SR78 for a short duration before the latter exits from the freeway and continues east.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 496 (I-496) is an {{auxiliary}} Interstate Highway <b>that</b> <b>passes</b> through downtown Lansing in the US state of Michigan. Also {{a component of}} the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway connects I-96 to the downtown area. It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east–west from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north–south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway127 (US127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers.|$|E
5|$|It intersects {{a number}} of city streets as it heads to the northeast, {{traversing}} several mixed-use blocks before crossing over Onondaga Creek, a north–south waterway <b>that</b> <b>passes</b> through most of Syracuse. On the northeast bank of the creek, NY175 turns east onto West Kennedy Street, a short connector between the creek and US11. The route continues for three more blocks along the mostly residential street to US11, where {{the east end of}} West Kennedy Street also marks the east end of NY175.|$|E

5|$|M-83 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan primarily {{serving as a}} link between Interstate75/US Highway23 (I-75/US23) in Birch Run, including a short east–west section with M-54, and the Bavarian-themed town of Frankenmuth. M-83 is primarily a north–south trunkline <b>that</b> <b>passes</b> by such landmarks as Bronner's Christmas Wonderland, Zehnder's and the Bavarian Inn before leaving town. The landscape {{in the remainder of}} the area is composed of farm fields between Frankenmuth and the northern terminus at M-15 near Richville.|$|E
5|$|The Hattiesburg section {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with Interstate 59 (I-59) and US 98 in Hattiesburg, Lamar County, {{where the road}} continues west as part of US 98. From this interchange, MS 198 heads east into Forrest County on Hardy Street, a four-lane divided highway <b>that</b> <b>passes</b> several businesses. The highway passes {{to the south of}} the University of Southern Mississippi before ending at an intersection with US 49. Past this intersection, Hardy Street continues east as a four-lane undivided city street.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{plans to}} rebuild the portion of MD 24 <b>that</b> <b>passes</b> through Rocks State Park, which has been {{undermined}} by the adjacent Deer Creek. The project was originally proposed in late 2009 and initially called for the route to be relocated further from the creek. The project was put on hold due to opposition from area residents and environmentalists. The Maryland State Highway Administration later proposed reconstructing the road along its current alignment while stabilizing the creek. Work on this project, which is projected to cost $13.3 million, is expected to start as soon as May 2014 and will require closing the road.|$|E
