5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E

25|$|While Furtwängler was travelling, the Berlin {{branch of}} the Associated Press leaked a news story on Hermann Göring's orders. It {{suggested}} Furtwängler would probably be reappointed {{as director of the}} Berlin State Opera and of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. This caused <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> New York to turn against him: it seemed that Furtwängler was now a supporter of the Nazi Party. On reading the American press reaction, Furtwängler chose not to accept the position in New York. Nor did he accept any position at the Berlin Opera.|$|E
25|$|These events {{coincided with}} a new {{international}} crisis, centered on the new Kingdom of Bulgaria. The First Balkan War of 1912 opened {{the way to a}} Greater Bulgaria, posing various threats to Romanian territorial ambitions. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> Bucharest was pro-war, and the populace saw an opportunity for hitting the interests of the Triple Alliance. Unusually, Carp numbered himself among the more hawkish proponents of a preemptive war with Bulgaria, suggesting outright the annexation of Southern Dobruja. Instead, Maiorescu signed a Russian-brokered peace deal, through which Romania received Silistra. This concession failed to satisfy Carp and his supporters, and also sparked a militaristic reaction in Bulgaria.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> Britain, meanwhile, {{had long}} been moving toward decolonisation due to {{pressure}} from its colonies. Banda {{was released from prison}} in April 1960 and was almost immediately invited to London for talks aimed at bringing about independence. Elections were held in August 1961. While Banda was technically nominated as Minister of Land, Natural Resources and Local Government, he became de facto Prime Minister of Nyasaland – a title granted to him formally on 1 February 1963. He and his fellow MCP ministers quickly expanded secondary education, reformed the so-called Native Courts, ended certain colonial agricultural tariffs and made other reforms. In December 1962, R. A. Butler, British Secretary of State for African Affairs, essentially agreed to end the Federation.|$|E
25|$|Pietersen {{opened the}} second day, 80 minutes late thanks to rain, with nightwatchmen Hoggard, the latter {{putting on his}} normal single figures, this time 3 runs, but holding the line for 36 balls. Once normal play resumed with Paul Collingwood England {{continued}} to dominate, setting their targets high with a 69 partnership before Collingwood gloved Murali to short leg for 238/5 {{and was replaced by}} skipper Andrew Flintoff who was surprisingly tame. Pietersen went on to hit three 4s in as many balls before hitting a reverse-sweeper 6 but then being bowled lbw by Murali, achieving three Test centuries in consecutive Tests. After the departure of their number four, England crumbled hopelessly from 290/6 to 295 all out just before tea. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> the English camp was swiftly revitalised by the hot drinks as Hoggard bowled Upul Tharanga for a golden duck, having been bowled for nothing in the first innings. Two more men went to see the tourists at 43/3 with a 111 run deficit and before the close of play Geraint Jones redeemed his missed catch to Thilan Samaraweera by stumping soon after, unbeaten opener Michael Vandort remained at the crease for 30 when play closed at 7:30 due to the missed play earlier. After persistent rain over Birmingham, play was started at 4:45 and the fifth wicket held up for 125, helping them take the lead. Both batsmen fought off good efforts by Panesar and Plunkett but eventually it was Hoggard who made the only breakthrough on a day where Sri Lanka stood tall for a short day at 194/5.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn Spanish (and other Romance languages) certain predicates select <b>the</b> subjunctive <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{embedded}} clause, {{while others}} select <b>the</b> indicative <b>mood.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, I present a new {{analysis for the}} predicates that select <b>the</b> subjunctive <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> Spanish {{that is based on}} a semantics of comparison. The main generalization proposed here is the following: in Spanish, a predicate selects <b>the</b> subjunctive <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> its embedded proposition if the proposition is compared to its contextual alternatives on a scale introduced by the predicate. In this proposal, predicates that select <b>the</b> subjunctive <b>mood</b> are thus analyzed as gradable predicates. Furthermore, <b>the</b> subjunctive <b>mood</b> morpheme is claimed to make a semantic contribution, namely to evaluate the contextual alternatives that are compared by the predicate. In comparing this proposal to other approaches, I show that it can more straightforwardly account for a number of properties of these predicates (entailment relations, practical inferences, and contexts with more than two alternatives). New empirical evidence for two crucial properties of the predicates that select <b>the</b> subjunctive <b>mood</b> is provided: these predicates are focus sensitive and they are gradable, two properties that follow directly from the proposal developed here. In the vast literature on <b>mood,</b> <b>the</b> link between the appearance of <b>the</b> subjunctive <b>mood</b> and these important properties has never been made before...|$|R
