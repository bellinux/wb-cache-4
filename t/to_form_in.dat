5|$|Tooth {{development}} is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their {{development is}} largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>in</b> the development of the embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>in</b> the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E
