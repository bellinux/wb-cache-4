40|$|For {{agents to}} act in collaboration, they often require an {{agreement}} that describes how they are to act, {{to which they are}} commited. Typically, agreements are characterised as an explicit course of action or a goal to be acieved. In this paper, it is argued such agreements may over specify <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>required.</b> <b>To</b> overcome this problem, a novel formalisation of agreements between agents is presented that is based on rights as well as actions to be performed. Each agent that is involved in an agreement is bound to uphold the rights of others, and the implications of excersing rights and acting for others. It is argued that this approach provides agents with greater flexibility in the agreements they may reach, while retaining the necessary group commitment...|$|E
40|$|The {{tendency}} {{for the period}} of the helically ordered moments in holmium to lock into values which are commensurable with the lattice is studied theoretically as a function of temperature and magnetic field. The commensurable effects are derived in the mean-field approximation from numerical calculations of the free energy of various commensurable structures, and the results are compared with the extensive experimental evidence collected during the last ten years on the magnetic structures in holmium. In general the stability of the different commensurable structures is found to be in accord with the experiments, except for the tau= 5 / 18 structure observed a few degrees below T_N in a b-axis field. The trigonal coupling recently detected in holmium is found to be <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> explain the increased stability of the tau= 1 / 5 structure around 42 K, and of the tau= 1 / 4 structure around 96 K, when a field is applied along the c-axis.

40|$|Abstract Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{is a widely}} used numerical method for simulating complex systems, with applications ranging from aerodynamic science to hydrology. The lattice-Boltzmann method is a relatively recent technique that {{has been shown to}} be as accurate as traditional CFD methods, but with the ability to integrate arbitrarily complex geometries at a reduced computational cost. Although fluid flow in the lattice-Boltzmann method is easily parallelized, this is not true of the specific problem of modeling solid particles suspended in a fluid. The data structures representing solid particles and <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> communicate information about them constitute time-consuming and serial portions of the simulation. In this paper, we describe a parallel implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method that incorporates new data structures and a modification to the basic algorithm.

40|$|Neutrino {{oscillations}} are {{a widely}} observed and well established phenomenon. It is also {{well known that}} deviations with respect to flavor conversion probabilities in vacuum arise due to neutrino interactions with matter. In this work, we analyze the impact of new interactions between neutrinos and the dark matter present in the Milky Way on the neutrino oscillation pattern. The dark matter-neutrino interaction is modeled by using an effective coupling proportional to the Fermi constant G_F with no further restrictions on its flavor structure. For the galactic dark matter profile we consider an homogeneous distribution {{as well as several}} density profiles, estimating in all cases the size of <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> get an observable effect at different neutrino energies. Our discussion is mainly focused in the PeV neutrino energy range, to be explored in observatories like IceCube and KM 3 NeT. The obtained results may be interpreted in terms of a light O(sub-eV [...] keV) or WIMP-like dark matter particle or as a new interaction with a mediator of O(sub-eV [...] keV) mass.

The medical software includes QMR, Scientific American Medicine, the Slice of Life and generic video laserdisc authoring software developed at the University of Ottawa. The system allows a clinical instructor either in an individual or in a small group teaching setting on a ward or in a classroom, to access high quality differential diagnosis information via QMR, which is then supplemented by the text components of Scientific American Medicine on CD ROM, with video laserdisc of the appropriate anatomy, imagery and pathology provided {{by one of the}} various laserdiscs.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we explore}} {{the topic of}} {{designing}} an architecture and processing algorithms for a multi-agent system, where agents need to address potential unexpected events in the environment, operating under soft real-time constraints. We first develop a classification of unexpected events into Opportunities, Barriers and Potential Causes of Failure, and outline <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> support the allocation of tasks for these events. We then propose a hybrid architecture to provide for agent autonomy in the system, employing a central coordinating agent. Certain agents in the community operate autonomously, while others remain {{under the control of}} the coordinating agent. The coordinator is able to determine which agents should form teams to address unexpected events in a timely manner, and to oversee those agents as they perform their tasks. The proposed architecture avoids the overhead of negotiation amongst agent teams for the assignment of tasks, a benefit when operating under limited time and resource constraints. It also avoids the bottleneck of having one coordinating agent making all decisions before work can proceed in the community, by allowing some agents to work independently. We illustrate the potential usefulness of the framework by describing an implementation of a simulator loosely based on that used for the RoboCup Rescue Simulation League contest. The implementation provides a set of simulated computers, each running a simple soft real-time operating system. On top of this basic simulation we implement the model described above and test it against two different search-and-rescue scenarios. From our experiments, we observe that our architecture is able to operate in dynamic and real-time environments, and can handle, in an appropriate and timely manner, any unexpected events that occur. We also comment on the value of our proposed approach for designing adjustable autonomy multi-agent systems and for specific environments such as robotics, where reducing the overall level of communication within the system is crucial...|$|E

40|$|The {{proteolytic}} active {{sites of}} the 26 S proteasome are sequestered within the central chamber of its 20 S catalytic core particle. Access to this chamber is through a narrow channel defined by the outer alpha subunits. Free proteasome 20 S core particles are found in an autoinhibited state in which the N-termini of neighboring alpha subunits are anchored by an intricate lattice of interactions blocking access to the channel. Entry of substrates into proteasomes can be enhanced by attachment of activators or regulatory particles. An {{important part of this}} activation is channel gating; regulatory particles rearrange the blocking residues to form an open pore and promote substrate entry into the proteolytic chamber. Interestingly, some substrates can open the entrance themselves and thus facilitate their own destruction. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms proposed for channel gating and <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> maintain stable closed and open conformations...|$|R
40|$|Much {{experience}} has been gained with the protocols and mechanisms needed for discovery and allocation of remote computational resources. However, the preparation of a remote computer for use by a distributed application also requires {{the creation of an}} appropriate execution environment, which remains an ad hoc and often clumsy process. We propose here a codification of <b>the</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> negotiate <b>the</b> creation of new execution environments. In brief, we model dynamic virtual environments (DVEs) as first-class entities in a distributed environment, with Grid service interfaces defined to negotiate creation, monitor properties, and manage lifetime. We also show how such DVEs can be implemented in a variety of technologies— sandboxes, virtual machines, or simply Unix accounts—and evaluate costs associated with these different approaches. DVEs provide a basis for both customization of a remote computer to meet user needs and also enforcement of resource usage and security policies. They can also simplify the administration of virtual organizations (VOs), by allowing new environments to be created automatically, subject to local and VO policy. Thus, DVEs have the potential to relieve much of the current administrative burden involved in providing and using Grid resources. ...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{strategies}} {{are becoming increasingly}} relevant in coping with an increasingly dynamic and complex business environment. A concentration upon core competencies is made easier when businesses are able to cooperate with other specialist businesses with different core competencies. Cooperative strategies range from formal alliances reinforced by contracts through to informal networks based upon relationships cemented by trust. Some examples of the motivators of networks include working together to win or carry out a project, or learning. However, unless the network delivers mutual benefit, {{it is unlikely that}} the trust and relationships necessary to cement the network will eventuate. Interaction based upon mutual benefit is normally expected to result in strengthened relationships and trust, provided the experience was positive for all concerned. This study explores a formal business networking group in a regional industrial cluster. The research question that emerges from this background is: how does knowledge sharing emerge within a formal business networking group? Knowledge is a common component across the research issues that support this research question. Exploring the type of alliance, network or cluster that the formal business networking group takes is the first research issue. The second research issue examines how members perceive benefits from networking and how members build and maintain relationships is the third research issue. How do members exchange knowledge is the fourth research issue and the role of the active members in integrating knowledge is the fifth research issue. The sixth and final research issues examine how important trust is to members. A qualitative methodology based upon the analysis of case studies is used for this explorative study. Fourteen embedded case studies are used with each case being a small, large or medium sized member business. A literature review provided prior theory, which is combined with in depth pilot interviews to formulate an interview protocol. Primary data was collected by conducting a total of 24 interviews with owners or senior managers of the participating businesses. In summary, the group is a formal business networking group that includes informal relationships between members. Benefits of membership include both intangible and tangible benefits. Relationships are built through community focused participation enabling interaction around issues, problems and domain similarity. Knowledge is exchanged primarily through relationship development and with active members acting as knowledge integrators. Trust is built over time through demonstrated dependability. Open and honest communications cements all aspects of this relationship-based formal business networking group. The main contribution to theory was a confirmation that the literature based around cooperative strategies was applicable to a formal business networking group in a regional industrial cluster. It was confirmed that participation in networking group activities enabled <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> build the relationships and trust necessary to exchange knowledge by way of rational discourse. A definition of a formal business networking group was developed and confirmed by members. Benefits of networking paraphrased from the literature are confirmed by members as are the indicators of trust. A formal business networking group model was also developed as a product of this research project. The contribution to management practice include a number of education tools that can be used to improve the performance of the formal business networking group and the member businesses. The tables of the benefits of networking and indicators of trust developed for this research can be used as a discussion tool for learning within or outside the group. A better understanding of the knowledge exchange process may encourage interaction amongst members with a resultant strengthening of relationships, trust and knowledge. Finally, the formal business networking group process model is an educational tool that can be used as a discussion piece for members, industry groups or Government when reviewing the allocation of scarce resources. Whilst of interest academically, this study may assist industry groups, Government policy, business networking groups, and individual businesses in working towards outcomes that deliver increased productivity and a greater business knowledge base...|$|E

Such stealthy and hyperuniform states are {{unique in that}} they are transparent to radiation for a range of wavenumbers around the origin. In this work, we employ recently developed inverse statistical-mechanical methods, which seek to obtain the optimal set of interactions that will spontaneously produce a targeted structure or configuration as a unique ground state, to investigate <b>the</b> spin-spin <b>interaction</b> potentials <b>required</b> <b>to</b> stabilize disordered stealthy hyperuniform one-dimensional (1 D) Ising-like spin chains. By performing an exhaustive search over the spin configurations that can be enumerated on periodic 1 D integer lattices containing N= 2, 3, [...] ., 36 sites, we were able to identify and structurally characterize all stealthy hyperuniform spin chains in this range of system sizes. Within this pool of stealthy hyperuniform spin configurations, we then utilized such inverse optimization techniques to demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform spin chains can be realized as either unique or degenerate disordered ground states of radial long-ranged (relative to the spin chain length) spin-spin interactions. Such exotic ground states are distinctly different from spin glasses in both their inherent structural properties and the nature of <b>the</b> spin-spin <b>interactions</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> stabilize them. As such, the implications and significance of the existence of such disordered stealthy hyperuniform ground state spin systems warrants further study, including whether their bulk physical properties and excited states, like their many-particle system counterparts, are singularly remarkable, and can be experimentally realized.
