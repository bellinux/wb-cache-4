5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{follow the}} 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs {{associated with the}} saved to Christ's right, {{and those of the}} damned to his left. The words beneath the lily (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The lettering opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} to Gujarat, Swaminarayan by His preaching and super natural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians. These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would never rob, or kill any living being. Even {{they would not}} see the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian. Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values {{to the people of}} Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat. Swaminarayan had vowed not to kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature.|$|E

5|$|By {{becoming}} chef de canton, Houphouët assumed {{responsibility for}} the administration of Akouè, a canton which comprised 36 villages. He also {{took charge of the}} family plantation—at the time {{one of the most important}} in the country—and worked to diversify its rubber, cocoa and coffee crops. He soon became one of Africa's richest farmers. On 3 September 1944, he established, in cooperation with the colonial administration, the African Agricultural Union (Syndicat agricole africain, SAA). Under his presidency, the SAA brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their working conditions and worked to protect their interests against those of European planters. Anti-colonialist and anti-racist, the organisation demanded better working conditions, higher wages, and the abolition of unfree labor. The union quickly received the support of nearly 20,000 plantation workers, together with that of the left-wing French administrators placed in office by the Provisional Government. Its success irritated colonists <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> took legal action against Houphouët, accusing him of being anti-French for never seeking French citizenship. However, Houphouët befriended the Inspector Minister of the Colonies, who ordered the charges dropped. They were more successful in obtaining the replacement of the sympathetic Governor André Latrille with the hostile Governor Henry de Mauduit.|$|E
5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> accumulate copper.|$|E
5|$|Resuming their advance, the Australians were {{supported}} by three squadrons of Corsairs from the Royal New Zealand Air Force—Nos. 14, 22 and 26 Squadrons—which bombed and strafed {{the ground in front}} of the advancing infantry, as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire. With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the Hongorai, for just one man wounded. Further progress was made over the next week, but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun, mines and other improvised explosive devices. After this, the 15th Brigade's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines. The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also. To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks, the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads, forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support. Additionally, the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry, which they kept under constant observation and fire.|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} interglacial {{period and the}} most recent {{glaciation}} of the Pleistocene (from 131,000 till 12,000 BP), Europe was very different from the Balkans.
