5|$|When {{applied to}} human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of {{participants}} having varying phenotypes {{for a particular}} trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), {{or they may be}} people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said {{to be associated with the}} disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> the risk of disease.|$|E
5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E

25|$|Retrotransposons are transposable {{elements}} which proliferate within eukaryotic genomes {{through a}} process involving reverse transcription. RNA-Seq can provide information about the transcription of endogenous retrotransposons <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> the transcription of neighboring genes by various epigenetic mechanisms that lead to disease. Similarly, the potential for using RNA-Seq to understand immune-related disease is expanding rapidly due {{to the ability to}} dissect immune cell populations and to sequence T cell and B cell receptor repertoires from patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{significant}} intrafamilial variability {{observed in}} the severity of renal and extrarenal manifestations points to genetic and environmental modifying factors <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> the outcome of ADPKD, and results of {{an analysis of the}} variability in renal function between monozygotic twins and siblings support the role of genetic modifiers in this disease. It is estimated that 43–78% of the variance in age to ESRD could be due to heritable modifying factors, with parents as likely as children to show more severe disease in studies of parent-child pairs.|$|E
25|$|Diet: as {{the colon}} {{is exposed to}} many dietary {{substances}} which may encourage inflammation, dietary factors have been hypothesized {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Few studies have investigated such an association; one study showed no association of refined sugar on the prevalence of ulcerative colitis. High intake of unsaturated fat and vitamin B6 may enhance the risk of developing ulcerative colitis. Other identified dietary factors <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> the development and/or relapse of the disease include meat protein and alcoholic beverages. Specifically, sulfur has been investigated as being involved in the etiology of ulcerative colitis, but this is controversial. Sulfur restricted diets have been investigated in patients with UC and animal models of the disease. The theory of sulfur as an etiological factor is related to the gut microbiota and mucosal sulfide detoxification in addition to the diet.|$|E

25|$|In the UK, figures {{reported}} in 2010 {{indicated that the}} number of antidepressant prescribed by the National Health Service (NHS) almost doubled over a decade. Further analysis published in 2014 showed that number of antidepressants dispensed annually in the community went up by 25 million in the 14 years between 1998 and 2012, rising from 15 million to 40 million. Nearly 50% of this rise occurred in the four years after the 2008 banking crash, during which time the annual increase in prescriptions rose from 6.7% to 8.5%. These sources also suggest that aside from the recession, other factors <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> changes in prescribing rates may include: improvements in diagnosis, a reduction of the stigma surrounding mental health, broader prescribing trends, GP characteristics, geographical location and housing status. Another factor that may contribute to increasing consumption of antidepressants is the fact that these medications now are used for other conditions including social anxiety and post traumatic stress.|$|E

500|$|Interestingly, MFGM supplementation {{in infancy}} is {{hypothesized}} to have programming effects <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> circulating lipid levels later in life. Breastfed infants {{are known to}} have a higher total serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol than formula-fed infants in infancy, but lower levels in adulthood. [...] A clinical study in infants has suggested that MFGM supplementation could narrow the gap between breastfed and formula-fed infants with regard to serum lipid status. Specifically, as compared with a control formula, infants receiving MFGM-supplemented formula had higher total serum cholesterol until 6 months of age, similar to breastfed infants. The LDL:HDL ratio did not differ between the formula-fed groups and was significantly higher in the breastfed reference group as compared with both formula-fed groups.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{hallmark}} of {{neurofibromatosis type 1}} (NF 1) {{is the development of}} multiple neurofibromas. Solitary neurofibroma may occur in an individual who does not have NF 1, but multiple neurofibromas tend to develop only in those with NF 1. It has been suggested <b>that</b> hormones <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> the neurofibromas of patients with NF 1. The evidence <b>that</b> hormones <b>may</b> <b>influence</b> the growth of neurofibromas comes mainly from the observation that localised neurofibromas of patients with NF 1 commonly grow during puberty and pregnancy. Because growth hormone (GH) concentrations increase during puberty, it is possible that GH influences the growth of these tumours...|$|R
