5|$|The {{concept that}} would become Nier was first {{proposed}} following the release of Drakengard 2 and the reveal of seventh generation consoles. The original concept was for a third entry in the Drakengard series. It {{was intended to be}} for PlayStation 3 due to the lessening importance of the PlayStation 2, which Drakengard 2 had been made for. However, as the project evolved, the original ideas were reworked and the game eventually became a spin-off from the main series. Despite this, the game's director Yoko Taro continues <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the third Drakengard game. Including concept planning, the total development time lasted three years, with two years spent actually developing the game. It was initially a small-scale project, but during planning it grew into a full-fledged role-playing game. Development was handled by Cavia with help from Square Enix, who had previously provided development support for the Drakengard games. Square Enix had minimal input on Yoko's vision for the game's atmosphere and story, allowing him high creative control.|$|E

25|$|Gramsci {{stated that}} bourgeois {{cultural}} values {{were tied to}} folklore, popular culture and religion, and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these. He was also impressed by the influence Roman Catholicism had and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between {{the religion of the}} learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in Renaissance humanism and the elements of the Reformation that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would have <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an expression of their own experience.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

Motion capture brings the director back {{to a kind of}} intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater."

500|$|Webb {{said that}} Oscorp Tower is pivotal {{as a part}} of a new mythology of the film. He liked that Parker was {{connected}} to the building in some way and <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a Tower of Babel in the middle of Manhattan that has something dark and seedy going on in there." [...] The critic Roger Ebert described the place as a [...] "typical comic-book mega-corporation with a madman at the top." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were divided}} about Rick Grimes' return to Atlanta, {{as well as}} his stand off with Guillermo and his gang. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic {{compared}} Grimes to Mad Men Don Draper, and questioned his character development: [...] "So far, every decision Rick has made has been both within his code and consequence-free," [...] he said. Pierce opined: [...] "Dramatically, this whole sequence plays out pretty hokily. Guillermo's dialogue is ridiculous, and the entire storyline plays like something out of an episodic social-lesson-of-the-week show. Since nothing ends up coming of it from a plot standpoint , it's hard not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> one of those comics where two [...] have a big fight scene {{that turns out to be}} mistaken identity." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Peter Robinson of The Observer gave the song the maximum five stars referring {{to it as}} a [...] "comeback single" [...] and as having a [...] "genius hook". He added that the song [...] " [...] been called lazy, largely by misinformed people who also think that Kylie's 'la la la's would have been better with proper words". Popjustice compared it to [...] "Some Girls" [...] by Rachel Stevens and added [...] " [...] track lays a really strong foundation for the realised comeback that didn't quite happen last time and it's hard not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a late contender for single of the year. [...] It's literally quite good". Myrddin Gwynedd of The New Zealand Herald said [...] "it's got hit written all over it". On the week of November 24, 2008, the Derby Telegraph chose it as single of the week. In the album review, Nekesa Mumbi Moody of The Providence Journal said that along with [...] "Shattered Glass", they were [...] " [...] fun disco tracks".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{regard the}} Zoo TV Tour {{as one of}} rock's most memorable tours. During the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg of the tour, Guy Garcia of Time called Zoo TV [...] "one of the most electrifying rock shows ever staged". In 1997, Robert Hilburn wrote that [...] "It's not {{unreasonable}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the Sgt. Pepper's of rock tours." [...] In 2002, Tom Doyle of Q called it [...] "still the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band", and in 2013, the magazine listed {{it as one of}} the [...] "ten greatest gigs of all time". In 2009, critic Greg Kot said, [...] "Zoo TV remains the finest supersized tour mounted by any band in the last two decades." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork wrote in a review of Achtung Babys 20th anniversary reissue, [...] "Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band—including U2 itself—has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way." [...] Rolling Stone included the tour on its 2017 list of [...] "The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years".|$|E
500|$|After {{speaking}} with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated {{on the idea}} of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, I like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one." [...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person. [...] "It's called Speak Now, and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than I can even tell you," [...] she said. The song was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to Speak Now, an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store. During the opening week of Speak Now, Swift performed [...] "Speak Now" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E
2500|$|While {{preparing}} for the exhibition at Wimbledon, Clijsters called a press conference on 26 March, and then announced that she was returning to professional tennis. She {{said that she had}} been inspired when {{preparing for}} the Wimbledon roof event during January 2009. Clijsters stated that she had asked for wildcards for the Cincinnati and Toronto tournaments. Additionally, Clijsters had also asked for a wildcard at the US Open, after which she planned to evaluate the comeback in terms of success and the feasibility of combining it with her family life. Clijsters also stated that she preferred <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "second career" [...] instead of a comeback, because so many factors (marriage, a baby, the recent death of her father) were different from her first career.|$|E

2500|$|The {{one thing}} these two {{different}} women share is their name: Holly Solomon. Solomon the art dealer {{was one of}} Nelson’s major influences, helping him find his style, which often features shapes, patterns, and words. His 2013 exhibition title “Polka Dots for Holly Solomon," [...] is fitting. Based heavily on pattern and decoration, Nelson uses the polka dot as both object and non-object, while incorporating “affirmations” as text jargon and a nod to society’s obsession with the pursuit of happiness. Taking its cue from its name, Polka Dots For Holly Solomon is a large-scale installation of polka dot patterns and subliminal messages presented across an array of two-dimensional and three-dimensional surfaces. Nelson says that the intention behind his new work is to “mean something and mean nothing at all. I like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> ‘non-conceptualism’.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Haldane (1957 [...] ) drew {{attention}} to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a report}} from MSF over 50 per cent of {{survivors}} indicated they had been assaulted while {{at work in the}} fields. These assaults were usually carried out by groups of men who were armed, women were beaten then raped and left lying on the ground. Others stated they had been assaulted during raids on their villages and a large amount of women stated they had been raped in the undergrowth where they had gone to hide when they fled their homes. When surveyed on their opinions as to the motivation behind the sexual violence, 83 per cent believed that poor organization, training and a lack of discipline played a contributing role. 57 per cent believed that the sexual violence was used as a tactic for the deliberate extermination of the Congolese people, from the witness statements MSF {{came to the conclusion that}} the [...] "Sexual violence has been so clearly linked to the military strategy of warring parties and has occurred in such a systematic way that it is wrong <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a side effect of war" ...|$|E

2500|$|Henry Christeen Warnack in the Los Angeles Times {{was troubled}} by the {{depiction}} of The Christ and wrote that the film [...] "is not daring, it is only poor taste." [...] He opined that it was offensive to the beliefs of Christians, Jews and atheists alike:"he play will ... be popular with everybody {{with the exception of}} three classes: It will probably prove offensive to Christians because they are likely <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> irreverent; to the Hebrew it will seem mystical and exaggerated; the non-church-goer will find it absurd and undramatic. [...] Outside of the Christian, the Jew and the unbeliever, I haven't the [...] doubt of its appeal." [...] Warnack concluded his review as follows:"This violation of good taste and this error in judgment belong to the misconception of the story ... Realizing the vast sum of money and the huge investment of talent and good faith that have been expended in this pretentious film, it is with deep regret that I am compelled to report it as a disappointment." ...|$|E
