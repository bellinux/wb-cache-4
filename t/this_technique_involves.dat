5|$|So-called lobtail feeding was {{observed}} in the North Atlantic. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>involves</b> the whale slapping {{the surface of the}} ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.|$|E
5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer {{down the length of}} the bill. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>involves</b> inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E

The extraction of target minerals by this technique requires that they be soluble, e.g., potash, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, which dissolve in water. Some minerals, such as copper minerals and uranium oxide, require acid or carbonate solutions to dissolve.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>involves</b> {{solving a}} {{difficult}} problem by transforming {{it into a}} better known problem for which we have (hopefully) asymptotically optimal algorithms. The goal {{is to find a}} reducing algorithm whose complexity is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one selection algorithm for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as transform and conquer.|$|E
25|$|Skilled {{players can}} also hold {{a ball in}} place with the flipper, giving them more control over {{where they want to}} place the ball when they shoot it forward. This is known as trapping. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>involves</b> {{catching}} the ball in the corner between the base of the flipper and the wall to its side, just as the ball falls towards the flipper; the flipper is then released, which allows the ball to roll slowly downward against the flipper. The player then chooses the moment to hit the flipper again, timing the shot as the ball slides slowly against the flipper. Multi-ball games, in particular, reward trapping techniques. Usually this is done by trapping one or more balls out of play with one flipper, then using the other flipper to score points with the remaining ball or balls.|$|E
25|$|A {{component}} of stimulus control therapy is sleep restriction, {{a technique that}} aims to match the time spent in bed with actual time spent asleep. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>involves</b> maintaining a strict sleep-wake schedule, sleeping only at certain {{times of the day}} and for specific amounts of time to induce mild sleep deprivation. Complete treatment usually lasts up to 3 weeks and involves making oneself sleep for only a minimum amount of time that they are actually capable of on average, and then, if capable (i.e. when sleep efficiency improves), slowly increasing this amount (~15 min) by going to bed earlier as the body attempts to reset its internal sleep clock. Bright light therapy, which is often used to help early morning wakers reset their natural sleep cycle, can also be used with sleep restriction therapy to reinforce a new wake schedule. Although applying this technique with consistency is difficult, it can {{have a positive effect on}} insomnia in motivated patients.|$|E

50|$|Batman: The Caped Crusader is an arcade {{adventure}} {{which uses}} a unique style, innovated by Jonathan Smith and Charles Davies, to display the action as though it {{takes place in a}} comic book. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>involved</b> having each game location set in its own panel, often with a comic book style caption in the upper-left corner, with inactive panels faded out behind the current active location. This concept was expanded upon by Sega's Comix Zone seven years later.|$|R
25|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} that enables fingerprints to be visualised on metallic and electrically conductive surfaces without {{the need to develop}} the prints first. <b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>involves</b> the use of an instrument called a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP), which measures the voltage, or electrical potential, at pre-set intervals over the surface of an object on which a fingerprint may have been deposited. These measurements can then be mapped to produce an image of the fingerprint. A higher resolution image can be obtained by increasing the number of points sampled, but {{at the expense of the}} time taken for the process. A sampling frequency of 20 points per mm is high enough to visualise a fingerprint in sufficient detail for identification purposes and produces a voltage map in 2–3 hours. As of 2010, this technique had been shown to work effectively on a wide range of forensically important metal surfaces including iron, steel and aluminium. While initial experiments were performed on flat surfaces, the {{technique has}} been further developed to cope with irregular or curved surfaces, such as the warped cylindrical surface of fired cartridge cases. Research during 2010 at Swansea University has found that physically removing a fingerprint from a metal surface, for example by rubbing with a tissue, does not necessarily result in the loss of all fingerprint information from that surface. The reason for this is that the differences in potential that are the basis of the visualisation are caused by the interaction of inorganic salts in the fingerprint deposit and the metal surface and begin to occur as soon as the finger comes into contact with the metal, resulting in the formation of metal-ion complexes that cannot easily be removed.|$|E

2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>technique</b> <b>involves</b> {{selective}} {{removal of}} leaves (for most varieties of deciduous tree) or needles (for coniferous trees and some others) from a bonsai's branches. A common aesthetic technique in bonsai design is {{to expose the}} tree's branches below groups of leaves or needles (sometimes called [...] "pads") by removing downward-growing material. In many species, particularly coniferous ones, this means that leaves or needles projecting below their branches must be trimmed off. For some coniferous varieties, such as spruce, branches carry needles from the trunk to the tip {{and many of these}} needles may be trimmed to expose the branch shape and bark. Needle and bud trimming can also be used in coniferous trees to force back-budding on old wood, which may not occur naturally in many conifers. Along with pruning, leaf trimming is the most common activity used for bonsai development and maintenance, and the one that occurs most frequently during the year.|$|E
