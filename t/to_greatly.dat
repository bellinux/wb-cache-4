5|$|In addition, {{the total}} {{civilian}} population of Nanking in December 1937 {{and the size}} of the Chinese garrison defending the city are used as a basis for calculating the death toll, though the matter is complicated due <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> varying estimates for both of these numbers. For instance, Tokushi Kasahara claims that Nanking's population in 1937 included 400,000 to 500,000 civilians and 150,000 soldiers, whereas David Askew believes it was 200,000 to 250,000 civilians and 73,790 to 81,500 soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition have been shown <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, {{and changes in the}} size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|Dunne {{had hoped}} that by moving to New York to write full-time, {{he would be able}} <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was not happy with them either: a note from the author appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E

Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations. After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new Yamato class of heavy battleships. Their planners recognized Japan {{would be unable to}} compete with the output of U.S. naval shipyards should war break out, so the 70,000ton vessels of the Yamato class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Ermac {{was played}} by actor John Turk in the {{digitized}} games Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and the 1996 compilation title Mortal Kombat Trilogy. As a palette-swapped character, he was physically {{identical to the}} Mortal Kombat games' other male ninjas, save for his red coloring. For Mortal Kombat: Deception, which marked Ermac's return to the series as a playable character after an eight-year absence, {{he was given a}} distinct redesign by Steve Beran, the series' lead character designer and art director. Beran explained that his objective of remaking old characters was <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> differentiate them from their previous incarnations. His Deception design was maintained for the 2011 reboot game, but with an increased black palette.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to the Australian Army during the Second World War as Director of Medicine. He {{played an important role}} in the planning for the Battle of Greece, convincing the British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell to alter his campaign plan to reduce the danger from malaria. In the South West Pacific Area, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> step up production of anti-malarial drugs. Through the activities of the LHQ Medical Research Unit, he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of the efficacy of the new drug atebrin, and persuaded commanders to adopt a tough approach to administering the drug to the troops.|$|E

5|$|For Sihanouk, {{this proved}} to be a {{marriage}} of convenience that was spurred on by his thirst for revenge against those who had betrayed him. For the Khmer Rouge, it was a means <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> expand the appeal of their movement. Peasants, motivated by loyalty to the monarchy, gradually rallied to the GRUNK cause. The personal appeal of Sihanouk, and widespread US aerial bombardment helped recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after 9 October 1970, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of a centralized Khmer Republic.|$|E
5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of synthetic diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E

Brandt's Ostpolitik policy, along with Brezhnev's dÃ©tente, {{contributed to the}} signing of the Moscow and Warsaw Treaties in which West Germany recognized the state borders established following World War II, which included West German recognition of East Germany as an independent state. The foreign relations of the two countries continued to improve during Brezhnev's rule, and in the Soviet Union, where the memory of German brutality during World War II was still remembered, these developments contributed <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> reducing the animosity the Soviet people felt towards Germany, and Germans in general.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding {{of soldiers}} with plunder from those campaigns, {{led to the}} trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders {{rather than to the}} state, and a willingness to follow their generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because in the past century vast tracts of land had been given to veterans who farmed by use of slaves and who came <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later Caesar Augustus) ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made princeps (emperor).|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} dropped torrential rainfall {{over the}} Southeast United States, causing unprecedented devastation in the region.

The heavy rainfall caused streams <b>to</b> <b>greatly</b> exceed their respective flood stages, damaging waterfront property. Many of the deaths occurred in North Carolina, where 30people died. Transportation was disrupted {{as a result of}} the debris scattered by the wind and rain. In Caldwell County alone, 90percent of bridges were swept away.
