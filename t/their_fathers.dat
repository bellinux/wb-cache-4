30|$|Cross {{tabulation}} {{displays the}} number of cases in each category defined by two grouping variables i.e. ‘Prior experience in business’ and ‘Career choice preference after completion of degree’. Total out of 530 respondents 256 respondents said that <b>their</b> <b>father</b> fall in the category of ‘Reputed salaried employees’, 113 told that <b>their</b> <b>father</b> is a small business owner, 92 said that <b>their</b> <b>father</b> is a farmer, 35 students told that <b>their</b> <b>father</b> is a professional and 34 students placed <b>their</b> <b>father’s</b> occupation in ‘others’ category which meant that <b>their</b> <b>father</b> was either retired or not working or had expired. The above data clearly reveals that over 76 % of the students whose father’s occupation status was ‘Reputed salaried employees’ want to take up a job while only 7.9 % of the students whose father’s occupation status was ‘small business owners’ want to become entrepreneurs.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, {{concerned}} that <b>their</b> <b>father's</b> legacy would be permanently lost, Pierre and Sophie Tatischeff tracked {{the rights to}} <b>their</b> <b>father's</b> oeuvre to a bank in Switzerland.

5|$|Yellowhammer males {{learn their}} songs from <b>their</b> <b>fathers,</b> {{and over the}} course of time {{regional}} dialects have developed, with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all are mutually recognised by birds from different areas. Each male has an individual repertoire of song variants within its regional dialect; females tend to mate with males that share their dialect, and prefer those with the largest repertoires.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes. This practice was later adopted by Angevin Kings of England, Kings of Hungary and other European monarchs. From the moment of their coronation, the heirs were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power and historically {{were not included in the}} numbering of monarchs if they predeceased <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b> The nobility disliked this custom, as it reduced their chances to benefit from a possible succession dispute.|$|E
5|$|Gaozong {{awarded the}} {{military}} {{service of the}} Turkic commanders Mishe and Buzhen by appointing them as proxy rulers of ten Western Turkic tribes. The ten tribes were split between the two cousins, and the western half was given to Buzhen while Mishe controlled the eastern tribes. In 685, the sons of Mishe and Buzhen were sent from the Tang capital of Chang'an, where they resided, to succeed <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> in the west. Neither lasted long as Turkic rulers; one was overthrown by his tribal subjects {{and the other was}} deposed by the Second Turkic Khaganate after an invasion in 690.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to examine whether women who were {{abandoned}} by <b>their</b> <b>father</b> experience more anxious, preventive and reactive jealousy than women who grew up in the presence of <b>their</b> <b>father.</b> The sample consisted of 186 female undergraduate students from Curacao (age M = 22. 88; SD = 5. 68) who were categorized into two groups: women who grew up without <b>their</b> <b>father</b> and women who grew up in the presence of <b>their</b> <b>father.</b> We found that women who were abandoned by <b>their</b> <b>father</b> reported significantly more anxious and preventive jealousy than women who grew up in the presence of <b>their</b> <b>father.</b> There were no significant differences between these two groups in reactive jealousy. Possible explanations are discussed in light of the potential function of jealousy for females who grew up without a father. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Because neither Hugh nor Philip were sole or senior king in their own lifetimes, they are not traditionally listed as Kings of France, and are not given ordinals.|$|E
5|$|The Senghenydd {{explosion}} {{remains the}} worst mining disaster in Britain. The deaths of 440 men {{on a small}} community had a devastating effect; 60 victims were younger than 20, of whom 8 were 14 years old; 542 children had lost <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> and 205 women were widowed. The impact on individual households was great: 12 homes lost both a father and son, 10 homes lost two sons each, while {{the death of one}} father and son left an 18-year-old daughter to raise her 6 siblings alone; another woman lost her husband, 2 sons, a brother and her lodger.|$|E

40|$|Recent social {{stratification}} scholarship examines {{the influence of}} parental status or big-class on individuals’ career attainment. The authors draw on the recent micro-class approach to hypothesize {{on the influence of}} the father’s micro-class or occupation-specific resources on individuals’ careers, and study (1) how often individuals work in <b>their</b> <b>father’s</b> occupation and (2) how the father’s micro-class resources affect career progression. Using life-course data on the careers of Dutch men and women, the authors find that 15 percent of men and 5 percent of women enter <b>their</b> <b>father's</b> occupation during <b>their</b> career. Further, men are not able to use <b>their</b> <b>father's</b> resources to achieve career progression after they left <b>their</b> <b>father's</b> occupation. Women’s career progression seems less influenced by <b>their</b> <b>father’s</b> occupation-specific resources...|$|R

Black deduces that the paint swatch matches paint used on the vehicle that killed Burke's son; he also realizes that the boys are being kidnapped to force <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> to confess hidden sins—Comstock's son was returned after he revealed his affair, while Orlando's son was killed because he kept secret a crime involving money. From there, Black sees that Charlie's kidnapping means that Birckenbeuhl is the hit-and-run driver.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{expected}} to obey the will of their father, then their husband, and then their adult son in old age.

Women were exempt from the annual corvée labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning.|$|E

5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to being picked up by <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b> Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in May and June, and {{fighting}} among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses {{a significant amount of}} weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b> They reach full size after around six months, but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season. The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia, appearing on the coat of arms and various coins. The bird features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology.|$|E
5|$|Ecnomiohyla rabborum, {{commonly}} known as Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog, is an extinct species of frog in the family Hylidae. They were relatively large frogs that inhabited the forest canopies of central Panama. Like {{other members of the}} genus Ecnomiohyla, they were capable of gliding by spreading their enormous and fully webbed hands and feet during descent. The males of the species were highly territorial and would guard water-filled tree holes used for breeding. They were also the ones responsible for guarding and caring for the young, including providing food. They were the only known species of frog where the tadpoles derived nutrition by feeding on the skin cells of <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the Surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, Japanese {{military}} personnel and civilians were repatriated to Japan between 1945 and 1946, although some 350 labourers and technicians were permitted to remain behind to carry out repair works to Palau's infrastructure. However, offspring of Japanese-Palauan intermarriages were allowed to remain, although a few migrated to Japan with <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b> In the 1950s, Japanese-Palauans formed an organisation, Sakura-kai to assist Japanese-Palauans and Japanese youths who were abandoned by their parents to search for their parents and kinsmen who were forcibly separated {{as a result of}} forced repatriation of Japanese settlers back to Japan. The organisation became a cultural organisation from the 1980s onwards, as most Japanese-Palauans had reunited with their Japanese families or voluntarily chose to leave certain family separations as they were.|$|E
5|$|From the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 CE) {{until the}} modern period (1840–1919), {{scholars}} and rulers developed a male-dominated patriarchal society in China. Confucianism {{was at the}} root of the development of the patriarchal society in China, and emphasized the distinctions between the sexes and the roles they have within the family. These ideologies continued through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and girls were taught from a very young age to be submissive to <b>their</b> <b>fathers,</b> then to their husbands, and later to their sons. During the Song Dynasty (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.|$|E
5|$|Maria Komnene {{conducted}} the negotiations for {{the marriage of}} Alice to Hugh I of Cyprus, Aimery of Lusignan's eldest surviving son and successor, {{in accordance with the}} agreement <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> had reached. Since the marriage of Alice's mother and Hugh I's father made them step-sister and step-brother, a special dispensation was needed. This was granted by Pope Innocent III. Blanche of Navarre supplied Alice's dowry as she sought to ensure that Alice would stay in Cyprus rather than attempting to lay claim to Champagne and Brie. To strengthen her son's position, Blanche also persuaded Philip II of France in 1209 to promise that he would not allow anyone to challenge Theobald IV's right to the two counties before Theobald reached the age of majority.|$|E
