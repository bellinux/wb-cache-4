Clemson died in 1888, and his will not only left money and land for the college, but made Tillman one of seven trustees for life, who had the power to appoint their successors. Tillman stated that this provision, which made the lifetime trustees a majority of the board, was intended to forestall any attempt by a future Republican government to admit African Americans. Clemson College (later Clemson University) was authorized by the legislature in December 1888.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war, the eastern sea routes of the country were attacked by German U-boat submarines. United States naval defence was very limited and largely obsolete; between January and April 1942, among other naval losses, 46 oil tankers were sunk and 16 damaged. The problem was made worse as 50 tankers {{had been sent to}} help the UK earlier in 1941. Insurers began to refuse <b>to</b> <b>underwrite</b> the remaining vessels and the volume of crude oil reaching the north-east from the Texas Gulf dropped.|$|E
5|$|By April 1955 the Guatemalan government's foreign {{exchange}} reserves had declined from $42million {{at the end of}} 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and other signs of approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed people in the country had risen to 20,000, four times higher than it had been during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 the Eisenhower administration approved an aid package of $53million and began <b>to</b> <b>underwrite</b> the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas's incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn import licences to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be unfit for consumption. When a student newspaper exposed the story, Castillo Armas launched a police crackdown against those criticizing him. Castillo Armas returned some of the privileges that the United Fruit Company had had under Ubico, but the company did not benefit substantially from them; it went into a gradual decline following disastrous experiments with breeding and pesticides, falling demand, and an anti-trust action.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{challenges}} in developing decision support tools for commercial underwriting and describe how several different approaches <b>to</b> the <b>underwriting</b> problem have been addressed in practice. We then describe an expert systembased approach <b>to</b> credit <b>underwriting</b> {{that has been in}} commercial usage for over five years in a variety of financial institutions. The expert system approach addresses many features of the underwriting process that alternative approaches do not. The system is characterized by a functional representation of knowledge and a graph-based inference mechanism. The inference mechanism is unique in its pragmatic approach to the treatment of uncertainty. This approach offers flexibility for modeling various aspects of real world credit decisions not always well treated by traditional approaches. We give examples of how this approach can be and is currently being applied <b>to</b> facilitating <b>underwriting</b> decisions in commercial lending contexts...|$|R

40|$|Drawing a {{framework}} from the organizational economics literature {{this study examines}} the determinants of corporate (i. e. underwriting and investment related) financial performance in the Bermuda insurance market.
