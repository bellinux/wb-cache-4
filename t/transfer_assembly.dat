40|$|The authors {{summarize}} {{the results of}} detailed neutronic and thermal-hydraulic evaluations of the heat pipe cooled thermionic (HPTI) reactor design, identify its key design attributes, and quantify its performance characteristics. The HPTI core uses modular, liquid-metal core heat <b>transfer</b> <b>assemblies</b> to replace the liquid-metal heat transport loop employed by in-core thermionic reactor designs of the past. The nuclear fuel, power conversion, heat transport, and heat rejection functions are all combined into a single modular unit. The reactor/converter assembly uses UN fuel pins to obtain a critical core configuration with in-core safety rods and reflector controls added to complete the subassembly. By thermally bonding the core heat <b>transfer</b> <b>assemblies</b> during the reactor core is coupled neutronically, thermally, and electrically into a modular assembly of individual power sources with cross-tied architecture. A forward-facing heat pipe radiator assembly extends from the reactor head {{in the shape of}} a frustum of a cone on the opposite side of the power system from the payload. Important virtues of the concept are the absence of any single-point failures and the ability of the core to effectively transfer the TFE waste heat load laterally to other in-core heat <b>transfer</b> <b>assemblies</b> in the event of multiple failures in either in-core and radiator heat pipes...|$|R

40|$|The Langley Research Center has {{developed}} a new flow-transfer device for powered wind tunnel models in which the traditional metal bellows have been replaced with nonmetallic diaphragms. Two complete flow <b>transfer</b> <b>assemblies</b> have been fabricated and installed within a twin-jet propulsion simulation system. Calibrations of the force balance have been performed over a range of nozzle mass flow rates up to 15 lbs/sec in order to validate the nonmetallic diaphragm design concept.

50|$|The Alpha joint is {{the main}} rotary joint {{allowing}} the solar arrays to track the sun; in nominal operation the alpha joint rotates by 360° each orbit (however, see also Night Glider mode). One Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) is located between the P3 and P4 truss segments {{and the other is}} located between the S3 and S4 truss segments. When in operation, these joints continuously rotate to keep the solar array wings on the outboard truss segments oriented towards the Sun. Each SARJ is 10 feet in diameter, weighs approximately 2,500 pounds and can be rotated continuously using bearing assemblies and a servo control system. On both the port and starboard sides, all of the power flows through the Utility <b>Transfer</b> <b>Assembly</b> (UTA) in the SARJ. Roll ring assemblies allow transmission of data and power across the rotating interface so it never has to unwind. The SARJ was designed, built and tested by Lockheed Martin and its subcontractors.|$|E

40|$|The {{cryogenic}} {{design features}} {{employed in the}} case of the Infrared Telescope (IRT) for Spacelab 2 are unique. They involve the delivery of helium gas at a temperature of 2 K to the IR detectors from a superfluid supply dewar which is separate from the telescope/detector unit. This design has the advantage that thermal and mechanical vibration disturbances in the liquid helium bath are decoupled from the IR detector. The interfacing of the storage dewar with the IRT telescope/detector unit (called cryostat) is the function of the subsystem which is called the <b>transfer</b> <b>assembly</b> (TA). The TA design is discussed, taking into account the porous plug module, the plumbing module, the helix module, and the dewar heat exchanger units. Aspects of <b>transfer</b> <b>assembly</b> performance are also considered...|$|E

40|$|The {{utilization}} of rotary transformers {{as an alternative}} to slip rings for the power transfer from solar panels to a satellite's main body could be advantageous, especially if an ac bus system is taken into consideration. Different approaches with main emphasis on the electromagnetic design were investigated and showed efficiencies of up to 99 % with a 3 kW power capability.

The assembly includes a {{hermetically sealed container}} enclosing a quantity of inert gas such as nitrogen. Two opposed walls of the container have high thermal conducting characteristics while the connecting walls have low thermal conducting characteristics. Electrodes are positioned adjacent to the high thermal conducing walls and biased relative to the conducting walls to a corona potential for creating an ionic gas wind which must contact the conducting walls to be neutralized. The contact of the gas molecules permits the maximum thermal energy transfer between the walls. Baffles can be positioned adjacent to the electrodes to regulate gas flow between the high thermal conducting surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Future USAF Block 5 D Defense Meteorological Satellites {{will carry}} a {{scanning}} microwave radiometer sensor (SSM/ 1).

The overall design of the SSM/ 1 radiometer was largely influenced by the mechanisms. The radiometer {{was designed to be}} stowed in a cavity on the existing spacecraft. The deployment of the sensor is complex due to the constraint of this cavity and the need for precision in the deployment.
