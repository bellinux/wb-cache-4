5|$|At 15:16, {{while the}} plane was in a shallow right <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> 37,000 feet, the fan disk of its {{tail-mounted}} General Electric CF6-6 engine explosively disintegrated. Debris penetrated the tail in numerous places, including the horizontal stabilizer, puncturing the lines of all three hydraulic systems.|$|E
5|$|For example, a bike in a 10m (33ft) radius {{steady-state}} <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> 10m/s (36km/h, 22mph) {{must be at}} {{an angle}} of 45.6°. A rider can lean {{with respect to the}} bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright if desired. The angle that matters is the one between the horizontal plane and the plane defined by the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.|$|E
5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the <b>turn.</b> <b>At</b> speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} <b>turn.</b> <b>At</b> the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E

5|$|PA 563 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with PA63 in Upper Salford Township, Montgomery County and heads in an easterly direction on two-lane, undivided Ridge Road. The route passes through wooded areas with some homes, turning southeast at the Township Line Road intersection and forming {{the border between}} Salford Township to the northeast and Upper Salford Township to the southwest. PA563 makes a northeast <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> the Barndt Road–Moyer Road junction, continuing northeast on Ridge Road into Salford Township.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} received {{instructions to}} taxi to Runway 31L at 9:54 AM EST, and clearance {{to proceed to}} Los Angeles non-stop under instrument flight rules (IFR) at 10:02 AM EST. Flight 1 became airborne at 10:07 AM EST. Following American Airlines procedures and Departure Control instructions, the aircraft initiated a left turn to a heading of 290. In {{the course of the}} <b>turn,</b> <b>at</b> 1,600 feet, the Boeing banked too far, flipped past 90 degrees, and began an upside-down, nose-first descent in a nearly vertical dive.|$|E
5|$|The {{caissons}} {{are required}} to turn with the wheel {{in order to remain}} level. Whilst the weight of the caissons on the bearings is generally sufficient to rotate them, a gearing mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two smaller ones ensures that they <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced.|$|E
50|$|As was {{customary}} for interurban trolleys, the LVT Philadelphia Division ran fast in open country, {{but once}} in a village or town it slowly progressed down streets, made frequent stops, and navigated sharp streetcar-like <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> intersections. In particular, there was extensive center street operation with 90 degree <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> Perkasie-Sellersville, Souderton, and Lansdale.|$|R

50|$|The 2014 100 mile route {{started and}} {{finished}} at Ham House and took riders through several categorized climbs throughout the Surrey Hills, including Box Hill. The 26 and 50 mile routes both started at Coram's Fields and took riders through London, with the 26 mile route <b>turning</b> <b>at</b> Battersea Park, while the 50 mile route <b>turned</b> <b>at</b> Ham House.|$|R
5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual lean angle of the rear frame from the ideal lean angle {{described}} above. The actual lean angle between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> the same speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} with Highway403 also initially remained unmodified {{from the}} design constructed in 1969, with access between westbound Highway403 and eastbound on the parkway being {{provided by a}} loop ramp and access between westbound on the parkway and westbound Highway403 requiring a left <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> a traffic light.|$|E
5|$|Writer Christos Gage {{took over}} for the Secret Invasion tie-in stories, which end with Osborn taking credit for {{the defeat of the}} Skrulls after he kills the Skrull queen Veranke. This allowed the {{character}} to be placed into an influential position in the aftermath Dark Reign. Although the dark <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> the end was always part of the plan for the storyline, Brian Michael Bendis, Secret Invasions writer, says that Osborn was picked for the leading role because of the changes implemented by Ellis.|$|E

5|$|As Aldenham {{was making}} a <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> a {{position}} north of the islet of Škrda, to sail between islands of Planik and Olib, she hit a mine that exploded under her engine room. The ship broke in two and her bow sank quickly, followed by her stern a little later, at 15:29. Cold weather hampered rescue efforts by Atherton and accompanying motor launches ML 238 and HDML 1162, and only 58 seamen and five officers, including Farrant, were {{pulled out of the}} sea. 126 crewmen died, as well as a wounded Yugoslav Partisan transported from Pag for medical treatment and Yugoslav Partisan liaison officer, Colonel Ivan Preradović. Aldenham was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II.|$|E
5|$|As Caroline neared Batavia, Phoenix {{entered the}} well-defended harbour, making further pursuit impossible. However, Rainier then sighted a second frigate, {{lying at anchor}} in Batavia Roads, {{accompanied}} only by the 14-gun corvette William, the elusive brig Zee-Ploeg, and the 18-gun ship Patriot {{that belonged to the}} Dutch East India Company. Prisoners from Zeerop identified this ship as the 36-gun Maria Riggersbergen under Captain Claas Jager. Although this force was significantly stronger than Caroline, and could call on the support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore, Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate. In his preparations for battle, Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables, giving his ship the ability to easily <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> anchor to face new threats once engaged with the Maria Riggersbergen.|$|E
5|$|In German Flatts, NY28 becomes Columbia Street and intersects the {{northern}} terminus of NY168. In Mohawk, NY28 intersects NY5S. After crossing the Mohawk River, NY28 becomes Mohawk Street and meets I-90 (New York State Thruway) at exit30. In {{the village of}} Herkimer, NY28 has a concurrency with NY5. North of NY5, NY28 begins to parallel the West Canada Creek. In Middleville, it intersects the western terminus of NY29 and {{the northern}} terminus of NY169. The highway executes a 90-degree <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> the three-route junction. NY28 continues towards the north paralleling the West Canada Creek. In Poland, NY28 begins a concurrency with NY8.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called a double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E
5|$|Pee Wee Reese singled and Jackie Robinson homered, scoring {{two runs}} for the Dodgers in the first inning; the Giants had one player reach base on an error, making the score 2–0 after one inning. In the second inning, Gil Hodges singled and reached third base on an error, {{allowing}} the Dodgers to potentially score again. After Rube Walker's hit the Giants threw Hodges out at home plate, and two further outs ended their <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> bat. The Giants had two consecutive hits in their half, a double hit by Thomson and a single hit by Mays, but they failed to score as well after two groundouts, leaving the score 2–0. After one out, Duke Snider walked and Robinson singled to start the third inning, and Jones was removed from pitching duties, replaced by George Spencer.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for {{an upgrade}} of the Drammen Line to {{accommodate}} more trains started in 1991. This {{resulted in the}} Asker Line, which was built in two steps between 2005 and 2011. Ahead of the section stage, consisting of the Bærum Tunnel which would allow trains to run directly from Lysaker to Sandvika, Lysaker Station received a full modernization. The upgrades consisted of demolishing the existing station and building a new station with two island platforms. Snøhetta won the architecture competition for the station. The upgrades allowed several advantages: seven minutes shorter travel time west of Oslo combined with better regularity, trains previously turning at Skøyen Station could instead <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> Lysaker and a near doubling {{of the number of}} trains running through the West Corridor, allowing eleven more trains per hour.|$|E
5|$|SR 243 {{begins at}} SR 74 in the San Jacinto Wilderness near Mountain Center, Riverside County as Idyllwild Road. The highway {{traverses}} north along a winding road through {{the community of}} Idyllwild. SR 243 makes a left <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> the intersection with Circle Drive and continues through Pine Cove. The road continues through the forest past Mount San Jacinto State Park through Twin Pines and the Morongo Indian Reservation before making a few switchbacks and descending {{en route to the}} city of Banning as the Banning Idyllwild Panoramic Highway. The highway continues as San Gorgonio Avenue into the city before making a left onto Lincoln Street and a right onto 8th Street and terminating at a diamond interchange with I-10.|$|E
5|$|SR11, named Chuckanut Drive for its whole route, {{begins at}} a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-5 north of Burlington. From the interchange, the highway travels northwest through farmland, closely paralleling a BNSF Railway route from Mount Vernon to Bellingham, also {{used by the}} Amtrak Cascades service. The road turns north to intersect Bow Hill Road, formerly SR237 until 1991, east of Edison. SR11 continues north to Blanchard, where it begins to traverse a narrow strip of land between the Chuckanut Mountains and Samish Bay. Midway between Blanchard and the Skagit–Whatcom county line, the highway travels through a hairpin <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> Oyster Creek.|$|E
