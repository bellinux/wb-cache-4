Many advocate that compost {{can be made in}} 2 to 3 weeks. Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that in fact modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work.

New aspects concerning the use of this waste as a raw material to extract important bioactive components is the other aspect to minimize environmental pollution through the value addition process. Because of their high value nature and less cost of extraction methods, extraction and use of bioactive compounds from waste pulp as a food additive are gaining interest [8, 9]. Coffee pulp as a by-product contains associated bioactive compounds like polyphenols with good antioxidant properties, which endow additional health benefits. Studies [10, 11] also indicated the possibility of extraction of total polyphenol compounds and antioxidants from coffee pulp to manage coffee waste. However, the effect of varieties and extraction solvents on the total polyphenols and antioxidant capacity has not yet been studied. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the effect of variety and extraction solvents on total polyphenols and antioxidants capacity of coffee cherry pulp of wet processing stations.|$|E

However, the existing scenario of waste management is not very satisfactory in Himachal Pradesh (Sharma et al. 2018). Previous literature studies (Saha et al. 2010) have reported the practice of composting in regions of Kullu, Solan, Shimla and Manali in Himachal Pradesh. Though the type of feedstock use was different, some composting practices were in use at the time of reported literature by Saha et al. 2010. At the time of the reported study of Saha et al. 2010, the municipalities of respective regions had received and utilized funds for the construction of composting yards but the efforts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>compost</b> were not very successful. The reasons for discontinuation of composting at the study locations reported by Saha et al. 2010 are manifold with major reasons being failure to implement complete and proper segregation process at Kullu and Manali study location leading to generation of poor quality compost (Personal Communication with an official of Municipal Corporation Shimla). The reason for discontinuation of composting process in Shimla is due to non-availability of land to meet the increased MSW generated and hence the more preferred treatment of MSW is to burn them in Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) plant as it leads to immediate reduction of waste (Personal Communication with an official of Municipal Corporation Shimla). Other proposed reasons for discontinuation of the composting process in Himachal Pradesh are due to poor segregation, uneconomic viability of compost generated, lack of funding and lack of manpower (Personal Communication with an official of Municipal Corporation Shimla).|$|E

The rubbish, of which 80 % is biodegradable, is transported to five sorting sites where it is piled into heaps, watered and occasionally turned over. After three or four months, a usable compost is obtained and this is put into 50 kg sacks and sold for CFA 2, 500. The compost is distributed to 245 groups of farmers who use it, in combination with other technologies, to improve their soil.

40|$|Abstract: There is {{need for}} proper {{understanding}} of plant nutrients {{status in the}} soil and their requirements by various crops under different farming system. Farmers must be encouraged <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>compost</b> from residues, house refuse and other decomposable wastes available with them. If crop residues have been incorporated into the soil, {{care must be taken}} that it must be incorporated well in advance (about 6 weeks) before planting crops to avoid N-immobilization. There are always advantages of cultivating cereals in rotation with legumes or intercropping with legumes rather than growing monoculture. A leguminous crop which covers the ground is always useful in protecting the soil micro-organisms and improves the water use efficiency. Also, they fix atmospheric â N through symbiosis and improve the soil fertility. Agro forestry also is useful if it is properly managed, frequent pruning is needed in order to avoid competition of alleys with crop plants for nutrients and soil moisture. The use of inorganic fertilizers boosts crop yield but its use has to be done very carefully. Chemical fertilizers can increase yield for short term but may deplete other nutrients from the soil. It is always advantageous if inorganic fertilizers are used along with some organic manure such as farm yard manure, composts etc. Soil fertility can be maintained with organic manures alone if it is available in sufficient quantity. Farmers hardly apply any chemical fertilizers to their crops grown around houses. The simple reason {{is that most of the}} house refuse is thrown out in the nearby field around the house. Also, cattle, sheep, goat, chicken and other animals are always roaming around houses during the dry season and as such their droppings enrich the soil.

40|$|Rural {{women in}} Barani (arid) Punjab are mostly engaged in agriculture. Over {{the last few}} decades, changes in {{development}} policies and thus technologies, it is argued frequently, {{have resulted in a}} changed food production system with a considerable impact on the role that women used to play in agriculture. It is not only {{the role of women in}} agriculture but, it is assumed; the dynamics of rural economies have also been changed. The present study attempts to examine the impact of technological development on the gender in rural areas of Barani Punjab. The analysis reflects that social structure of barani areas is characterized as low economic status of women. The majority of the women is illiterate or has very little schooling. Thus, they lack access to economic opportunities and their participation in the formal labor market is very low. Purdah (covering face) is part of class structure and is a symbol of status. Participation of women in farm activities has direct relationship with the economic status of the family. In the villages with fewer imbalances in power structure, women participate more in economic activities. When women's contribution in food production was analyzed, it provided a good comparison of gender division of labor. Women tend to participate more in livestock management than in crop production. Women are more engaged in linking livestock and crop production. They move inputs and outputs of livestock and crop production. They bring, process and make crop output available to livestock as fodder and feed. They also clean livestock sheds and process manure <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>compost</b> for crop production. In the crop production, the role of women also varies in different crops. Except in seed preparation and cleaning, women contribute less in earlier stages of crop production and play dominant role in post harvest period. They are involved in processing farm produce, storing, drying and winnowing. They also have better understanding of weeds and their use as fodder for livestock. Their contribution is of more significance in seed storage and preparation of seed for sowing. Introduction of technologies in crop production, in general, has negative impact on the contribution of women in crop sector. It is found that agricultural technologies are more male oriented. Thus, women do less productive and economically inferior activities. Women are also losing their land rights and control over land. The present study also identifies areas for intervention and suggests some improvements needed in technology development...|$|E

40|$|Mr John Njoroge is one {{of three}} founder members of the Kenya Institute of Organic Farming, an NGO {{involved}} in the dissemination of information on organic agriculture to smallholder farmers in Kenya. He has been the Director since its formation. Previously he worked with Inades Formation Kenya, a pan-African organization involved in adult education and rural development. In modern agriculture we have become dependent on purchased inputs to produce crops and livestock instead of utilizing the range of materials that are available, or could be made available, on the farms. The result is that as production costs have become more expensive the margin left to the producer has become less. While farmers are persuaded to spend more on chemical plant foods and protectants and on purchased feeds, vaccines and medicines for livestock, nature provides an alternative option: abundant and healthy, production of crops and livestock at little or no financial cost. In the natural bush and forest we can see that plants grow without the application of fertilizers. There is abundant growth and nutrients are recycled as plants shed their leaves and branches, animals leave their droppings and dead organisms return to the soil. All this organic matter combines with the naturally weathered rocks to form a healthy productive soil. If we remember that all things come from the earth and return to the earth we can begin to understand organic farming. Organic farming is a form of agriculture which mimics the natural system of plant and animal growth and death. The natural system is a closed system since everything is recycled more or less where it grows. In agriculture, fertility is removed in the crops and livestock products consumed off the farm and that fertility must be returned. To achieve a fertile and productive soil on a sustainable basis farmers must put effort into proper cultivation, selection of pest resistant varieties, crop rotation, mixed cropping, growing trees on the farm, making compost and providing the right conditions for beneficial insects to control pests. Soil erosion must be prevented as the soil that erodes is the most fertile soil. Nitrogenfixation can be achieved through growing leguminous crops and trees. Trees also provide foliage for mulching and adding nutrients to soil and for feeding livestock, while composting provides a hygienic way of converting all available vegetable and animal waste matter into a form that both improves the physical structure and the nutrient status of the soil. We waste so much that we could use to great benefit. Vegetation which could be composted and bring fertility to crop land is allowed to die and rot around homesteads and along roads. Livestock manure is left in kraals, when it could accelerate the composting of vegetable matter. Household wastes which could go back on the land via the compost pits are thrown aside or buried. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>compost</b> efficiently requires some knowledge. First, a series of three shallow pits is required so that the compost from Pit 1 can be turned into Pit 2 after 21 days and from Pit 2 into Pit 3 after a further 21 days. Following a final 21 days in Pit 3 the compost should be ready for use - 63 days from start to finish. The pits themselves should be 0. 3 metres deep, 1 metre wide and 2 - 3 metres long. The width is critical: {{it should be possible to}} reach to the middle of the compost heap without walking on it. At the bottom of each pit there should be a layer of fibrous vegetation to assist aeration, and whenever a layer of material is added it should be covered with a 10 cm layer of soil to stop gases escaping. Water can be added during dry weather to hasten decomposition, but too much water will cause the internal temperature of the compost heap to fall and not only will decomposition slow down or stop, weed seeds and disease spores will not be killed by the heat. To safeguard compost heaps in the rainy season they may be covered by plastic or corrugated metal sheets, or by banana leaves. Organic farming is not easy, but it is sustainable. If more farmers were to keep their farms fertile through organic means, many of today's farm problems would be solved. The soil would have natural fertility restored for producing healthy crops and animals, it would hold more water and it would be easier to cultivate. Fertile soils contain more living micro-organisms which are beneficial to plant life, and they help plants resist or grow away from pests and diseases. Modern agriculture has its limits. It does not acknowledge these issues and does not take into account specific problems of smallscale producers in developing countries. Imported fertilizers and pesticides are expensive both for the state and the producers. When utilized without care, particulary pesticides, they destroy the natural balance of the land. There are many ways of benefiting from local resources while conserving the environment for a sustainable production of abundant and quality food products. This is the essence of organic farming. All concerned with agriculture development should bear this in mind in decision-making. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTA.

40|$|On most continents food {{production}} has surpassed {{the growth in}} population (Knudsen et al. 2006). Still {{it is estimated that}} approximately 1 billion people are undernourished (FAO 2011) and the greatest number of people suffering from chronic hunger are living in South and East Asia (FAO 2012 a). More than half (3. 1 billion people) of the developing worldâs population live in rural areas. Of these, approximately 2. 5 billion derive their livelihoods from agriculture (FAO 2012 a). The majority of small scale farmers in the global south lack financial and natural resources to be able to improve production and food security (Knudsen et al. 2006). A United Nationsâ report on organic agriculture and food security concludes that organic agriculture increases the availability and access of food in the location where hunger and poverty are most severe (FAO 2007). According to UNEP (United Nations Environmental Program) non-certified organic practices in Africa outperforms conventional industrialized agriculture and provides improved soil fertility, retention of water as well as resistance to drought (UNEP 2008). The Millennium Development Goals are targeting sustainable agriculture specifically (United Nations 2009) and in the report by the IAASTD panel, focus on small scale farmers and the use of sustainable agricultural practices are recommended (IAASTD 2008). Organic farming emerged in the 1920 s with the concept of an inextricable link between soil, plant and animal health and of the composting process as an important element to obtain this. Hence artificial fertilizer was looked upon with great concern. In the 1960 s and 1970 s organic farming faced a turning point due to the negative consequences of industrial farming methods including the use of chemical substances. The work of many volunteers, heavily engaged in organic farming, led to the foundation of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) in 1972 (Kristiansen & Merfield 2006). IFOAM has formulated four basic principles: Principle of health, ecology, fairness and care. They serve to inspire the organic movement, are the basis from where standards are developed and are presented with a vision of world-wide adoption (IFOAM 2005). According to IFOAM organic agriculture is: âA production system that sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people. It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involvedâ (IFOAM 2008). Frequently, in the global south, the meaning of organic agriculture is confused with âfarming without chemical inputsâ, âtraditional farmingâ or âcertified organic farming for export purposesâ (Vaarst 2010). In this assignment organic agriculture is defined by the above mentioned four basic principles and description of organic farming. This includes the use of agro-ecological methods in agricultural systems which do not necessarily have to be certified organic. 2 Agro-ecological methods include the use of compost and legumes to improve soil fertility. Mulching conserves soil moisture and suppresses weeds. Intercropping increases yields and keeps the soil covered, hence preventing soil erosion and promoting soil moisture. Crop rotation with high species diversity prevents pests and diseases from building up as well as contributing to a diversified diet. Agroforestry is less affected by drought (deep root system). At the same time it increases soil porosity, reduces runoff and increases soil cover leading to increased water infiltration and retention in soil (Nakasi et al. Unknown; Vaarst 2010). Livestock are an integrated part of organic agriculture supporting biological cycles within the system, in particular nutrient recycling (Hermansen 2003). Another important aspect is that organic farming does not rely on input of costly artificial fertilizers and chemicals. High inputs can force farmers to borrow money from private lenders with high interest rates. Hence farmers are vulnerable if the harvest fails (Halberg et al. 2006). Also pesticides can lead to poisoning when applying it and through accidents (Pretty 1995 cf. Halberg et. al. 2006). Conscious use of agro-ecological methods requires many skills, a lot of knowledge, assessment and planning (Vaarst et al. 2012). Therefore it is relevant to create a situation where knowledge can be exchanged, developed and debated (Vaarst et al. 2011). Organic farming is labour intensive, for example it requires labour <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>compost,</b> dig trenches, mulch and weed (Vaarst et al. 2011). Farmer Family Learning Groups (FFLG) creates a situation where farmers and their families go together to share their knowledge and experiences as well as help each other perform labour demanding tasks (Vaarst et al. 2011). Organic farming and Farmer Field Schools (FFS) is a way to assist vulnerable groups to empower themselves to claim their rights and have access to resource mechanisms (FAO 2007). The objective of this assignment is to evaluate the benefits and barriers of introducing farmer group learning and development into organic small holder farming systems in the global south. The farmer group learning is exemplified by the concepts of FFS and FFLG. The first section describes the concept of FFS and FFLG. Afterwards benefits and barriers of introducing FFS and FFLG are presented. Finally a case study from three districts in Madhya Pradesh, India is reviewed and analysed in terms of introducing farmer group learning...|$|E
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} important {{to step up}} and encourage the use of organic fertilizers in tropical agriculture because of the problems the use of chemical fertilizers presents to developing countries. For farmers in ACP countries chemical fertilizers are often too expensive, and increase the dependency of both farmers and countries on imports, either because they are imported as finished products, or because the energy required to produce them is imported. As a result, in some countries, farmers are forced to devote practically all their working efforts to paying off debts incurred in the purchase of fertilizers. When rain does not arrive or water is scarce, fertilizer pellets do not dissolve properly and can 'burn' the crops, while in humid zones much of the nutrients can be washed away by torrential rain. Chemicals can also kill beneficial micro-organisms in the soil. Plants which have received heavy applicahons of nitrogen through the use of chemical ferhlizers may suffer from increased susceptibility to pest infestation. Farmers then resort to further chemicals in the form of pesticides, with all the undesirable economic and ecological consequences. In contrast, organic fertilizers not only bring the necessary nutrients to the soil, but also improve its condihon and, above all, its ability to retain moisture. Compost is a form of organic fertilizer which can be a solution to the problems mentioned above and yet is free of the difficulties that occur with the use of several other organic substances -smell, storage and pathogens. Composting is the process whereby vegetable matter is stacked into a heap or pit and allowed to ferment and rot through the action of micro-organisms. In the process of composting, organic wastes are decomposed, nutrients are released, and pathogens are destroyed. Compost protects and nourishes plants and soil and it reduces overall water requirements in areas where lack of water is the fundamental limitation on produchon. Compost is particularly useful for market gardening because it provides a source of nutrients which can be rapidly assimilated by plants. Furthermore, composting can be an excellent alternative to chemical fertilizers in areas where cultivation of a single crop has exhausted the soil. This is a common problem in Sahelian Africa where groundnuts have been grown extensively. The benefits of compost are many: many materials that are suitable for use as organic manure have a high carbon:nitrogen ratio when fresh. By composting they are partly mineralized, thus reducing the C:N ratio, which, in turn, facilitates the release of nitrogen. Also, during composhng temperatures may reach 60 - 70 C, and most weed seeds and pathogens are consequently killed. In the tropics this {{can be one of the}} primary purposes of composting. Another advantage is that during decomposition, weight and mass are reduced, but not necessarily the nutrient content. The structure of the organic material also changes during the process, and the bulky mass is converted into a friable substance. When making compost, different materials may be combined to good effect. Residues with a high C:N ratio, such as rice straw, which on its own mineralizes very slowly, may be combined with material with a low C:N ratio, such as animal manure. This combinahon will ensure the correct rate of composhng. In Sudano-Sahelian Africa, the most common organic or vegetable substances used are dung, peanut oil, fish scraps and miscellaneous vegetable matter. Where composting is new to people, they have to learn about its benefits and the compost making process. The conditions for microbial growth in the compost heap must be as favourable as possible: there must be sufficient air; the heap must not be too dense; there must be sufficient moisture - but not too much (in arid areas the compost is often put in a hole in the ground to prevent dehydration); and there must not be too much light - so the heap should be made in the shade, under a roof or covered with a layer of straw or soil. In the Sahel there has been a structured attempt to encourage Senegalese farmers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>compost.</b> The campaign is conducted by PRONAT (PROtection of NATure against the enemies of crops) team of ENDA (Organization for ENvironment and Development in Africa). Since 1983 they have held training sessions of two to three days for farmers to learn how compost can improve crop yields and soil fertility. The sessions are slide shows, given in Wolof either by research technicians from PRONAT or by farmers with practical experience who give 'hands-on' demonstrahons. After training, farmers return to their villages and pass on the knowledge gained to others in the local group. ENDA published a brochure in French and Wolof in 1985 on composting,which was well illustrated to help those with literacy difficulhes. In addition, CTA and Agromisa have produced one of their Agrodok booklets in English on the preparation and use of compost Politically speaking, the drive towards selfsufficiency in food produchon is a top priority in most developing countries, and teaching composting techniques should be high on the list of means to achieve this end. In the Sahel, for example, there are very fragile soils which have little resistance to the ravages of soil erosion by wind and water. Composting could help rebuild and fortify this fast-disappearing resource.

India, China, Germany, Malaysia, Brazil {{are some of the}} leading countries in world to take advantage of biogas technology. The results of initial trials of biogas bottling plants in India demonstrated that the biogas can be pure up to 98 Â % methane content. The pure biogas can be successfully filled into CNG cylinders to use as vehicular fuel. The bottled biogas was found to replace crude oil, hence, having a bright future. The algae cultivation in waste water is good option to recycle the carbon dioxide a potent green house gas; moreover, algal biomass can be converted into many value-added products like bio-oil. The dead animals and birds can be successfully <b>composted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> nutrient-rich <b>compost.</b> The composting of pig carcasses may be carried out in bins built from treated wood, concrete or bales of hay, over a concrete floor. High-moisture organic waste can be composted using low-moisture bulking agents such as straw, sawdust, peat, peanut shells, rice hull, etc. Vermicomposting is not only a powerful method of recycling the organic waste but it has potentiality for employment generation especially in rural areas. However, the better substrate in shorter period can be obtained from combined process of composting and vermicomposting. Integrated fish farming in wallowing pond or poultry or duck waste-fed aquaculture is a very promising enterprise that can provide additional income to farmers.|$|R
