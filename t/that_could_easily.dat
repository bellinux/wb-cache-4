5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mk. IV in July 1940 {{improved}} matters, {{but it was the}} delivery of the Bristol Beaufighter starting in August that produced a truly effective system. The Beaufighter had considerably more powerful engines, speed that allowed it to catch its targets, and a powerful gun pack of four 20mm cannon <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> destroy a bomber in a single pass. Squadron use began in October, and its first victory came soon after on 19/20 November when a Beaufighter IF of No. 604 Squadron destroyed a Ju 88A-5 near Chichester, very close to the first success of the Mk. III.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} matter {{is made up}} of {{discrete}} units is a very old one, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation. Because of this, they could not convince everybody, so atomism was but {{one of a number of}} competing theories on the nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be explained using the concept of atoms.|$|E
5|$|The Utah beach landings, however, were {{relatively}} uncontested, with assault units landing on largely unoccupied beaches and experiencing far less action than the landings at Omaha. The filmmakers chose {{to begin the}} narrative with a depiction of the more dramatic story of Omaha, despite the strategic inaccuracy of an impossible mission <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> have been pursued from the other beach area. In addition, {{one of the most}} notable of the operational flaws is the depiction of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle. The 2nd SS was not engaged in Normandy until July, and then at Caen against the British and Canadians, 100 miles east. Furthermore, the Merderet River bridges were not an objective of the 101st Airborne Division but of the 82nd Airborne Division, part of Mission Boston.|$|E

5|$|Legal {{disputes}} {{carried on}} for years, {{exacerbated by the}} fact that Marsh owned land near Van Cortlandt Park in particular. Opponents argued that building a park system would divert funds from more important infrastructure like schools and docks; that everyone in the city, instead of just the property owners near the proposed park, was required to pay taxes to pay for the parks' construction; and that since Marsh was trying to parcel off some of his land to developers, the park's size should be reduced in order to prevent him from profiting off park usage. However, most of this opposition was directed at the construction of Pelham Bay Park, which was then in Westchester. Supporters argued that the parks were for the benefit of all the city's citizens, thus justifying the citywide park tax; that the value of properties near the parks would appreciate greatly over time; that the Commission had only chosen property <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be converted into a park; and that Pelham Bay Park would soon be annexed to the city. Ultimately, the parks were established despite the objections of major figures like Mayors William Russell Grace and Abram Hewitt; Comptroller Edward V. Loew; and Assemblymen Henry Bergh and Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E

The party won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach on 30 June 1981. To the surprise of many Fitzgerald excluded Richie Ryan, Richard Burke and Tom O'Donnell, former Fine Gael stalwarts, from the cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, it {{was decided}} to use {{preparations}} of powerful, highly toxic herbicides including 2,4-D, amitrole and bromacil to control the outbreak. Officers using knapsack sprayers were deployed to deal with smaller infestations, while large areas of cannabis were sprayed from small crop dusting aircraft. By 1971, {{only a small number of}} plants were found by the regular summer patrols of field officers, <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be pulled by hand.

25|$|The {{generators}} {{were built}} at the Washington Navy Yard by master joiners who fashioned a contraption of copper plumbing and tanks which, when filled with sulfuric acid and iron filings, would yield hydrogen gas. The generators were Lowe's own design and were considered a marvel of engineering. They were designed to be loaded into box crates <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> fit on a standard buckboard.

25|$|In 2010, a {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study of the}} pinnate Araliaceae showed {{that they could not}} be divided into genera <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be distinguished morphologically. Uncertainties remain about the taxonomy of this group because {{of a large number of}} unpublished species and species of uncertain affinities that have never been sampled for DNA. For these reasons, all of the pinnate Araliaceae were assigned to Polyscias, thereby subsuming six genera (Arthrophyllum, Cuphocarpus, Gastonia, Reynoldsia, Munroidendron, and Tetraplasandra) into Polyscias and increasing the number of species in that genus from about 100 to 159.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have used the}} lack of civitates peregrinae in Roman Dacia, where indigenous peoples were organised into native townships, as evidence for the Roman depopulation of Dacia. Prior to its incorporation into the empire, Dacia was a kingdom ruled by one king, and did not possess a regional tribal structure <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be turned into the Roman civitas system as used successfully in other provinces of the empire. Dacian tribes mentioned in Ptolemy's Geography may represent indigenous administrative structures, similar to those from Moesia, Pannonia, Dalmatia, or Noricum.|$|E

Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something of a joke, as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are just the most visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E

He was not out {{overnight}} – however, Steve Harmison, bowling his third spell of the day, brought the third day's proceedings to an end with a slow delivery that was not read correctly by Clarke, who missed the ball completely to be bowled. England now only needed two wickets on the fourth day – Australia, however, needed 107 runs for the victory.|$|E
25|$|Beyond simply major {{sporting}} events, {{the park}} often also doubled as {{a venue for}} circuses, carnivals, various ethnic and holiday celebrations, and track meets.

Popular national figures such as Adam Forepaugh and P. T. Barnum would often hold their shows here, spending often up to three days located at the park before moving off to other, more typical one night shows in smaller towns.|$|E
