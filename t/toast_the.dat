25|$|The Scots Greys, {{along with}} certain other regiments of the British Army, handled the loyal toast differently. Since the Glorious Revolution, {{officers}} {{were required to}} <b>toast</b> <b>the</b> health of the reigning sovereign. Typically, this meant standing and giving a toast to the monarch. The Scots Greys, however, did not stand for the toast. It is said that this tradition of giving the loyal toast while seated started {{during the reign of}} George III. During his reign, George III would often dine with the regiment; however, because of his health, he was unable to stand during the toasts. Since he could not, he allowed the officers to remain seated during the loyal toasts.|$|E

Even <b>the</b> non-drinker is counseled not to refuse to allow wine to be poured for a <b>toast.</b> Inverting <b>the</b> glass is especially discouraged.|$|R

25|$|At the 1993 Indianapolis 500, winner Emerson Fittipaldi, {{who owned}} and {{operated}} an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview. He eventually relented and also drank from the milk bottle later in the post-race ceremonies after the broadcast was over, but the public relations damage had already been done. The snub led to Fittipaldi being booed at the next ChampCar race, the Milwaukee Mile, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the heart of dairy country, and by some, {{as late as the}} 2008 Indianapolis 500 in which he drove the pace car.

500|$|On St George's Day in 1684 {{at around}} 10pm, an {{explosion}} in the magazine destroyed the interior of Clifford's Tower entirely.

Most historians, however, believe the explosion was not accidental. At the time, it was common in the city to <b>toast</b> <b>the</b> potential demolition of the [...] "Minced Pie", as the castle was known to locals; suspiciously, some members of the garrison had moved their personal belongings to safety just before the explosion, and no-one from the garrison was injured by the event. The heat of the fire turned the limestone of the tower to its current, slightly pink, colour. The now-ruined tower was returned fully to private ownership, eventually forming part of the lands of the neighbouring house and gardens belonging to Samuel Waud.|$|E
