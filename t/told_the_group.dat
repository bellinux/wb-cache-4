25|$|Along {{with the}} sealed orders were {{warnings}} of possible Spanish men {{of war in}} San Luis d'Apra, the main port of Guam, and notification of it being protected by a heavy battery of guns. The existence of the heavy armament was verified by reputable travelers who had visited the island within {{the two or three}} years before 1898. Definite information {{of the size of the}} Spanish garrison was not given, and in the absence of direct knowledge, the captain of the cruiser had to assume that there might be more than a thousand fighting men on the island who were thoroughly familiar with the terrain. Glass held a conference on the Australia, and invited General Anderson, Commander William C. Gibson, naval officer in charge of the transports, and the captains of the three troop carriers were invited to participate in the discussions. Also present at the meeting was T. A. Hallet, third officer of the Australia and a former whaling captain, who had been to the Mariana Islands many times. Hallet <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> that on his last visit to Guam, San Luis d'Apra was strongly fortified. Fort Santa Cruz and the battery on Point Orote, he stated, were efficiently manned and equipped. After a complete appraisal of all the known and unknown factors in the impending battle, the officers completed the arrangements for the attack on Guam.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky {{allowed the}} first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the {{composer}} had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. He forced himself to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from Romeo, Stasov <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> [...] "There were five of you; now there are six". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for Romeo that at their gatherings Balakirev was always asked to play it through at the piano. He did this {{so many times that}} he learned to perform it from memory.|$|E

However, the 7th and 8th team will already be known. Beirne also stated that he hopes that the league will eventually grow to 12 teams within 10 years of forming.|$|R

50|$|Berndsen et al. (1999) {{wanted to}} {{determine}} if the structure of testing for illusory correlations could lead to the formation of illusory correlations. The hypothesis was that identifying test variables as Group A and Group B might be causing the participants to look for differences between <b>the</b> <b>groups,</b> resulting in <b>the</b> creation of illusory correlations. An experiment was set up where one set of participants were <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> were Group A and Group B, while another set of participants were given groups labeled as students who graduated in 1993 or 1994. This study found that illusory correlations {{were more likely to be}} created when <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> were Group A and B, as compared to students of the class of 1993 or the class of 1994.|$|R
500|$|On {{the first}} anniversary of his death, Carradine's widow, Annie, {{announced}} that she had filed a lawsuit for wrongful death against the company that produced the film Carradine was working on {{at the time of his}} death. The lawsuit claimed that the company failed to provide assistance to the actor that had been agreed upon in his contract. [...] "The suit alleges, the assistant left him behind for dinner on the night before the actor was found dead. The assistant and other film staffers apparently could not reach Carradine and decided to leave without him. Carradine called the assistant an hour later but was <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was across town, and he would have to make his own arrangements that evening." [...] Annie Carradine reached a settlement with MK2 Productions in August 2011. She was reported to be receiving about US$400,000 from the company for Carradine's death.|$|E
500|$|The Supremes {{deliberately}} {{embraced a}} more glamorous image than previous black performers. Much {{of this was}} accomplished {{at the behest of}} Motown chief Berry Gordy and Maxine Powell, who ran Motown's in-house finishing school and Artist Development department. Unlike many of her contemporaries, Ross sang in a thin, calm voice, and her vocal styling was matched by having all three women embellish their femininity instead of imitate the qualities of male groups. Eschewing plain appearances and basic dance routines, the Supremes appeared onstage in detailed make-up and high-fashion gowns and wigs, and performed graceful choreography created by Motown choreographer Cholly Atkins. Powell <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> to [...] "be prepared to perform before kings and queens." [...] Gordy wanted the Supremes, like all of his performers, to be equally appealing to black and white audiences, and he sought to erase the image of black performers as being unrefined or lacking class.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their work}} on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones began {{thinking}} of alternatives for the line [...] "There's a chance we're taking, we're taking our own lives": the pair was concerned that {{the latter part of}} the line would be considered a reference to suicide. As the group listened to a playback of the chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to [...] "We're 'saving' our own lives", which his fellow musicians agreed with. Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. [...] "One thing we don't want to do, especially with this group, is look like we're patting ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a choice we're making.'" [...] Around 1:30am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations, including the sound [...] "sha-lum sha-lin-gay". Jones <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> that they were not to add anything else to the tape. [...] "If we get too good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio," [...] he announced.|$|E

500|$|Blur resumed work {{on their}} second album due to a chance meeting with {{producer}} Stephen Street, who had previously worked with the band on their 1991 single [...] "There's No Other Way". With Street now producing the album, Blur recorded a mix of material spanning both the period immediately {{after the release of}} Leisure and their 1992 tour. While the band members were pleased with the recording session results, Balfe, after hearing the songs, told the band they were committing artistic suicide. Although dejected by his response, Blur gave Food the completed album in December 1992. However, the label <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> that the album was unfit for release and at the very least they should add a few more potential singles. Albarn complied, and on Christmas Day wrote the song [...] "For Tomorrow". Although [...] "For Tomorrow" [...] sated Food's concerns, Blur's American label SBK voiced discontent upon hearing the finished tapes of the album. To appease SBK the band recorded [...] "Chemical World", which Blur thought would increase Rubbishs American appeal. However, Blur flatly refused SBK's demand of re-recording the album with American producer Butch Vig, who was popular at the time for his work with Nirvana.|$|E
500|$|Sixteen {{songs were}} {{recorded}} for the album with only 11 making the final cut. The band {{made a conscious}} decision to keep the number of tracks, and therefore the running time of Hey Venus!, down [...] "because the last three albums have been almost an hour long". At just over 36 minutes, the album is the shortest full-length release by the band. Some of the songs left off the record were [...] "really heavy and raw" [...] as a result of which Gruff Rhys feels Hey Venus! is [...] "more consistent with our back catalogue". Both lead single [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] and [...] "Suckers!" [...] were originally cut from the album, for being [...] "too generic" [...] and too [...] "obvious ... melodically" [...] respectively, until the band were persuaded to reconsider. Rough Trade Records boss Geoff Travis <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> that [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] was his favourite song and, following the tracks reworking to include a French horn part, it was reinstated. Similarly [...] "Suckers!" [...] was [...] "really pushed" [...] by producer Dave Newfeld until it too took its place on Hey Venus!.|$|E
500|$|After {{reading the}} veiled accusations made {{against him in}} the Public Ledger, Kent {{determined}} to clear his name, and accompanied by a witness went to see John Moore. [...] The Methodist showed Kent the list of questions he and Parsons had drawn up for the ghost to answer. [...] One concerned William and Fanny's marital status, prompting Kent {{to admit that they}} never married. [...] Moore told him he did not think he was a murderer, rather, he believed the spirit's presence indicated that [...] "there was something behind darker than all the rest, and that if he would go to Parson's house, he might be a witness to the same and convinced of its reality". [...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went to Cock Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room. [...] They were warned that the ghost was sensitive to disbelief and told that they should accord it due respect. [...] When the séance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer, ran around the room shouting [...] "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? [...] Do come, pray Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" [...] When nothing happened, Moore <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> the ghost would not come as they were making too much noise. [...] He asked them to leave the room, telling them he would try to contact the ghost by stamping his foot. [...] About ten minutes later they were told the ghost had returned and that they should re-enter the room. [...] Moore then started to run through his and Parsons' list of questions: ...|$|E

2500|$|Paramount Pictures was {{concerned}} with the film's budget, which reportedly was almost $50 million. By 1997, multiple script drafts from three writers brought costs to approximately $2 million. After delays in production, Paramount Pictures <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> behind the film they had two months to set the project up at another studio. In a review of Carr's sequel The Angel of Darkness, Malcolm L.

[...] When in a 1999 online chat with fans, set up by Time and Yahoo!, Carr was asked if there were film plans for The Alienist or The Angel of Darkness, he responded: [...] "Only 'The Alienist,' and the attempts have been so bad that I have not yet sold 'Angel' to the movies.

Kelly showed the group his revolvers, and pointed out one which he had taken from Constable Lonigan, and further stated that he had shot Lonigan with a worn-out, crooked musket, held together with string and 'could shoot around corners'. He asked those present how they would like detectives pointing revolvers at their mothers and sisters, threatening to shoot them {{if they did not}} say where they were. He blamed such treatment for turning him against the law. He said that he had come only to shoot the two policemen, Devine and Richards, calling them worse than any black trackers, especially Richards, whom he intended to shoot immediately. Tarleton remarked that Kelly should not blame Richards for doing his duty. Kelly then replied, [...] "Suppose you had your revolver ready when I came in, would you not have shot me ?" [...] Mr Tarleton replied [...] "Yes." [...] "Well", said Kelly, [...] "that's just what I am going to do with Richards—shoot him before he shoots me."
