5|$|Walter Skinner assigns Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to {{investigate}} Sandoz's disappearance, {{giving them a}} rubbing of Merkmallen's artifact. Mulder tells Skinner that both Merkmallen and Sandoz espoused panspermia, a theory suggesting an extraterrestrial origin to life on Earth. Mulder begins suffering from a headache and is unable to hear Scully speak, a condition seemingly caused by the rubbing. At the university, the agents meet Dr. Barnes—the man who posed as Sandoz—who professes disbelief in his theories. Mulder's condition worsens, but he refuses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> and, due to seeming telepathic abilities, realizes that Barnes murdered Merkmallen. Later, in Mulder's office, Chuck Burks tells them that the symbols on the artifact are from Navajo.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Barrett {{made headlines}} {{again when he}} {{got into a fight}} with teammate Carlos Zambrano. During a game against the Atlanta Braves on June 1, 2007, tensions began to rise between the two players when the Cubs allowed the Braves to score five runs in the fifth inning. The Braves recorded 20 hits, en route to winning 8-5. However, their productivity became overshadowed by the scuffle between Zambrano and Barrett. As the two returned to the dugout, they had an exchange of words, which escalated into a small fight. After Lou Piniella dismissed the two from the game, another fight ensued within the Cubs’ clubhouse, and Zambrano punched Barrett's lip. The wound required Barrett <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> immediately and receive stitches. Zambrano remorsefully admitted he was at fault after the ordeal, and Barrett later stated they had resolved their differences. Both players received fines for undisclosed amounts of money.|$|E

25|$|Lisa {{protests that}} the Simpsons cannot accept the tobacco executives' money, but Homer misinterprets this {{statement}} and rejects the offer as insulting, demanding $150 billion for tomacco, which they refuse. Dumped {{back at the}} farmhouse, the family sees tomacco-addicted animals from other farms eating their crops. With only one plant left, the family runs into the house, where Lisa urges Homer to destroy it, but Homer refuses until the livestock breaks in. He tosses the plant {{into the air and}} it lands {{in the hands of a}} Laramie executive. The executives' helicopter leaves, but a tomacco-addicted sheep has sneaked on board and attacks them. The helicopter crashes, killing everyone on board except for the sheep and destroying the final tomacco plant. The Simpsons return home to find that the Southern gentleman and his wife are still waiting for Homer to go through the duel. Homer does and is shot in the arm, but declines <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> until after eating one of Marge's mincemeat pies.|$|E
25|$|She {{actively}} but secretly helped {{freedom fighters}} of the Liberation War. In 1971, several people in Dhaka including professor Ghyasuddin Ahmed and famous writer Shahidullah Kaiser collected medicine {{and food and}} delivered those to the posts of Sufia Kamal's house, from where the freedom fighters picked those up for their training outpost. From July 1971, she used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> with food and medicine for the injured people of war. At that time there was an acute crisis of food and medicine in the hospital. She used to give food and medicine to certain rickshaw pullers at the Science Laboratory, Dhaka. They would take the food and medicine to the freedom fighters. She was able to establish closer contact with the freedom fighters such as Abul Barak Alvi, Shafi Imam Rumi, Masud Sadek Chullu and Jwel in August. As the Pakistani army kept their strong watch on her, she would try to help the freedom fighters in different ways ignoring the risks. Except Abul Barak Alvi, all others died in {{the hand of the}} Pakistani Army. The Pakistan Army and their collaborators killed Sufia Kamal's son-in-law, Kahar Chowdhury, because they were very angry with her. Early December 1971 Shahidullah Kaiser, Munier Chowdhury and Dr. Fazle Rabbi cautioned her to leave Dhaka but they themselves did not leave and got caught and later got killed.|$|E
25|$|Ching Leung – Leung is a 27-year-old renowned lawyer. He is Sum’s boyfriend {{towards the}} middle of the series. He is a moody but {{vigilant}} and caring figure who forever strives to do his best. Although he is a kind person, he has an inability to stay faithful and succumbs. At one point he had an affair with Sheung Joi Sum's best friend Shui Mak Mak, but he kept it quiet and reconciled with Sheung Joi Sum without admitting anything about the matter. Eventually information would slip and Sheung Joi Sum actively demands to know who was the other woman, but Ching felt exposing this matter would ruin everything and insists for her to drop the matter since he admitted his mistakes and assures Sheung Joi Sum it would never happen again. Sheung Joi Sum wasn't satisfied with such an answer and whenever he tries to comfort her, Tong Chi On would be around and he becomes jealous. After the big secret was exposed, everyone parted ways for some time and Leung would try to patch things between him and Sheung Joi Sum. Despite the fact that they broke up, Leung continues to love Sum. This is shown when he continues to write in his blog, Days without Sheung Joi Sum, three years after the break-up. He also helps Sheung Joi Sum think of ideas to defend Ling Lei. He eventually dies of a car crash in the end, because he was thinking about Sheung Joi Sum's decision to forgive him or not. Although he could be saved, he refuses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> using his final moments to tell Sheung Joi Sum ways to defeat Wong Sau-Kam. Sheung Joi Sum, who forgave Leung and is willing to renew their relationship, was greatly sadden by his death.|$|E

Soon he is caught by Lois who calls him an idiot. Peter introduces Kathy to the kids as their new mom, but after finding that Chris took her into his room, he angrily confronts her and ends up ripping her in half. He tearfully buries her in the yard and begs Lois for forgiveness. Lois forgives him and they have sex and Lois is shocked when Peter discovers a [...] on her breast, causing her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> the next day to have it tested for breast cancer. The test comes back negative, but while looking through her medical records, Dr Hartman discovers that Lois' mother is a Jewish Holocaust survivor, making Lois and her children Jewish by heritage. Barbara confirms her heritage, and Carter admits he kept it a family secret so that they could join the country club. Despite not being Jewish himself, Peter takes to it eagerly, much to Lois' frustration. That night, Peter is visited by the ghost of his adoptive father, Francis, who warns him that he will go to Hell for not being Catholic. The next day, Peter decides to re-convert the family to Catholicism and becomes prejudiced against Lois' heritage, becoming anti-Semitic.|$|E

[...] However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw comes completely off from my punch, then the doctor bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment.

2500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions were}} prolonged and extensive due to many complications, many stemming from Patrick's struggle's with addiction. Patrick recalled [...] "almost being in tears" [...] after recording vocals for the track [...] "Where Do We Go From Here", {{as he was}} typically smoking three to four packs of cigarettes a day, {{making it difficult for}} him to hit his higher notes, and even breathe at times. Delays also occurred upon Patrick breaking his wrist after celebrating completing a new song, celebrating it, and then slipping and falling on the ice while refusing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> Patrick was still able to play guitar, though his movements were limited. Patrick also would lash out at others, ranging from insulting members of the band's official messageboard for posts he didn't approve of, leading to its ultimate removal, and temporarily kicking band members out of the studio to work on music alone. As such, progress was continually delayed; with Patrick's timetable for a release date shifting from June 2001, to July 2001, to early 2002, to [...] "mid to late summer".|$|E

However, Potiorek forgot to inform the driver, Leopold Loyka, about this decision. On the way to the hospital, Loyka took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. [...] Princip was standing near Moritz Schiller's café when he spotted the car as it drove past, having taken the wrong turn. After realizing the mistake, the driver put his foot on the brake, and began to reverse. In doing so the engine stalled and the gears locked, giving Princip his opportunity. Princip stepped forward, drew his pistol, an FN Model 1910, and at a distance of about 1.5 metres (5ft) fired twice into the car, first hitting Franz Ferdinand in the neck, and then hitting his wife Sophie in the abdomen, after she covered his body.

The bullet lodged in his chest after {{penetrating}} his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech titled [...] "", which he was carrying in his jacket. Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung, and he declined suggestions <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> immediately. Instead, he delivered his [...] with blood seeping into his shirt. He spoke for 90 minutes before completing his speech and accepting medical attention. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot, but {{it takes more than}} that to kill a Bull Moose." [...] Afterwards, probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pleura.

[...] The flight had caused her leg to swell up again, but she was still able to do some bike and run training. On Monday she tried a four-kilometre swim, her first hard swim since the crash; this produced pain in her pectoral muscle, which worsened over subsequent training sessions. On Tuesday she tried another swim session: after 1km she had to stop, and again had to be lifted out of the pool by Lowe. She later wote, [...] "I was 'crying into my goggles', and described the pain as 'unbearable'", adding, [...] "I was convinced I'd broken my rib. Every breath hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly." [...] The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy (ART); he instructed her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for tests, not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture. The hospital's first concern, from the swollen state of her leg, was that she might have a pulmonary embolism. Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures, nor any embolism, but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles; the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed.|$|E
