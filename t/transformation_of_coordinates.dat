40|$|First, {{with purpose}} <b>of</b> {{definition}} <b>transformation</b> parameters <b>of</b> geodetic network {{of the city}} Ormož, we have interpreted the basic theoretical concepts <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems, preparation, realization and processing of GPS survey. We have represented basic terms like geodetic datum, <b>coordinate</b> systems and <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems. We have presented cognitions which were discovered during the preparation and realization of the survey on the fieldwork. We have defined the problem <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems, which is difficult practical problem in Slovene surveying. The roots of this problem originate from Gauss - Krüger coordinate system, which is not homogeneous in Slovenia. For the chosen area (3, 5 x 2, 5 km), we {{have concluded that the}} definition of one set <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> parameters will be enough for achieving few centimetre positional and height accuracy <b>of</b> transformed <b>coordinates.</b> In fact, we have realized static survey on reference points of the geodetic network of Ormož city and RTK survey on reference and detail points. The interpretation of results is realized partly on the practical research and partly on historic facts of establishment of geodetic network. The residuals between given and transformed coordinate points on the points of higher order were according to expectations. But there, in detail points, came to much bigger residuals of size order up to few decimetres. Besides we have noticed an interesting appearance of forming points into groups, which have similar residuals. Also, we have done the analysis <b>of</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>coordinates,</b> which we have determined, and results <b>of</b> <b>transformation...</b>|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of {{theoretical and practical}} part. The theoretical part treats surveying work during the construction of buildings, old and new national coordinate system, the methods of measurement <b>of</b> horizontal <b>coordinates,</b> and the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems. The described method of setting out is polar, paper also describes GNSS measurement method, method for measuring horizontal angles and zenith distances, reduction of measured slope lengths, indirect adjustment of observations, which gives us the most likely value <b>of</b> the horizontal <b>coordinates</b> <b>of</b> points in the geodetic network. For the purpose of establishing a geodetic network was necessary to calculate the local transformation parameters, so the thesis also presents <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems. The practical part of the thesis relates to the calculation <b>of</b> local <b>transformation</b> parameters with application SitraNet and to measurements, calculations and adjustment surveying networks. Based {{on the results of}} adjustment we compare <b>coordinates</b> <b>of</b> points of geodetic network, established by VRS method of measurement, with the most likely values <b>of</b> the horizontal <b>coordinates...</b>|$|R

The Eulerian strain is a two-point tensor that transforms as a second rank tensor under <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>coordinates</b> and transforms as a scalar under <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> the material <b>coordinates.</b> The Lagrangian strain is a two-point tensor that transforms as scalar under <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>coordinates</b> and transforms as a second rank tensor under <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> the material <b>coordinates.</b> These transformation properties are needed when transforming the strain tensors from one frame of reference to another moving frame. 1 I.
