Rocky Mountain News {{recalled}} that the video is [...] "still a thrilling performance, raw but polished, passionate and sincere". Andrew Gilstrap of PopMatters gave the remastered version of the film a rating of 8 out of 10, stating, [...] "It's rare that a band can totally transform a scene—especially one with a stage show that boasts charisma as its only special effect—but it's not hyperbole to say that U2 put on a dominating, flawless-despite-mistakes performance. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> put U2 on the map." [...] In its review of the remastered version of Under a Blood Red Sky, online magazine Pitchfork Media said, [...] "when the group performed at Red Rocks on a rainy June night, with lit torches above a panoramic skyline, the venue provided an ideal backdrop for U2's literally flag-waving music, with everything—earth, wind, fire—in place to maximise and heighten the drama of the moment and the songs." [...] James Wigney of The Sunday Telegraph and the Sunday Herald Sun gave the DVD a score of 5 out of 5, praising the film's concert, but stated that the [...] "footage is still on the fuzzy side". The Advertiser said the DVD's audio commentary was very informative, but criticised the picture quality, stating, [...] "even the remastered version looks like it was shot on a mobile phone".|$|E

There are two natural ways to do so, but only one for which multiplications of matrices corresponds to multiplication of permutations in the same order: <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> associates to σ the matrix M whose entry M'i,j is 1 if i = σ(j), and 0 otherwise. The resulting matrix has exactly one entry 1 in each column and in each row, and is called a permutation matrix.|$|E

Tubridy initially announced his intention {{to take over the}} hosting of The Late Late Show from Kenny but he later stated that he would remain as host of Tubridy Tonight, describing it as his [...] "Jim'll Fix It job" [...] and [...] "little fun-size legacy". It was announced on 11 May 2009 that Tubridy would indeed succeed Pat Kenny as host of The Late Late Show. He vowed to bring back Gay Byrne's [...] "one for everybody in the audience" [...] catchphrase, described by Will Hanafin in the Irish Independent as an attempt to [...] "dig up more old relics than archaeologists would on an excavation", in reference to Tubridy's passion for history.

2500|$|Video game {{journalist}} Lewis Denby stated {{it was a}} [...] "genuinely upsetting game" [...] and that, [...] "there's more to [...] existence {{than almost}} any other videogame character you'll ever meet". Independent game designer Derek Yu enjoyed the game, comparing its visual theme to EarthBound and stating [...] "The lack of dialogue or any action fills me with this strange sense of dread." [...] Gamertell's Jenni Lada scored the game 85 out of 100. She praised the unique premise, distinct art style and abstract gameplay which evokes a [...] "dream world experience". Lada noted the geometry of the dream areas, which allows for loops and exitless rooms, and found that it could be [...] "winding and confusing". Whilst she warned that it won't be to everyone's tastes due to [...] "dark or graphic imagery" [...] and found the ending to be disappointing, she concluded that Yume Nikki was worth experiencing. Kotaku's John Jackson praised the game for its ethereal dream-like setting and its non-linear gameplay mechanic, stating, [...] "Out of every game about dreams, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> probably comes closest to actually resembling one." [...] He goes on to argue the game's limitations and vast, undefinable architecture forces the player to question their surroundings and the significance of the smallest actions and events that confront them.|$|E
