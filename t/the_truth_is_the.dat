500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

2500|$|After a Metrolink {{board meeting}} {{two days after}} her remarks, Tyrrell resigned. Tyrrell stated that she quit because a Metrolink Board {{statement}} called her announcement premature and inappropriate; she maintained that it was proper {{to get out in}} front of the story before the NTSB took over the investigation. [...] She stated that she asked for and received authorization to make the comments from David Solow, Metrolink's chief executive. [...] Solow confirmed that he did give authorization, but said that, in hindsight, he would not have given permission. [...] After her resignation, some good government proponents praised Tyrrell for her candor, including the chief public advocate with California Common Cause. The Los Angeles Times also published an editorial by columnist Patt Morrison sympathetic to Tyrrell's position, in which she says, [...] "I am unclear of the concept of how the truth can somehow be premature. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> truth." ...|$|E

Commentators have widely commented that this is in contravention of Article 158 which stipulates the body that should seek an interpretation from the NPCSC is the Court of Final Appeal. Although the government, after the judgment of Lau Kong Yung & Others v Director of Immigration was handed down, claimed that [...] "the Court had confirmed that the Government had acted entirely constitutionally and legally" [...] in requesting a NPCSC interpretation, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Court never endorsed or ratified the Government's acts. In the judgment, the Court affirmed that the NPCSC had unqualified power to interpret the Basic Law, but never discussed the issue as to whether the reference was legal.

Nevertheless a bit of 2000 surfaced when a group of unknown size called [...] "Vietnam Veterans Against John McCain" [...] set up a website and began sending crude mailers to media members alleging that McCain passed military information to the North Vietnamese during his time as a POW. McCain set up a Truth Squad to combat such attacks and emphasized that he was supported by 75 former POWs. Orson Swindle, who was a POW with McCain, called the flier a [...] "vicious" [...] fraud. [...] "Nothing {{could be further from the}} truth," [...] Swindle said.
