5|$|Established in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J. Becher, and {{modified}} by the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl by 1731, phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials {{were made of}} two parts. One part, called phlogiston, was given off when the substance containing it was burned, while the dephlogisticated part was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> true form, or calx.|$|E

5|$|After the 4–0 series {{win over}} England, which was Bradman's {{farewell}} series, Morris became Australia's vice-captain and was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> leading batsman. He started well, scoring two centuries during Australia's first {{series in the}} post-Bradman era, a tour to South Africa that saw Australia win the Test series 4–0. By {{the end of the}} South African tour, Morris had amassed nine Test centuries and his batting average was over 65, but thereafter his form declined. Australia increasingly fell on hard times as the core of Bradman's team aged and retired. Morris was overlooked for the captaincy and then briefly dropped as his cricketing prowess waned. His career ended after his first wife became terminally ill. Later in his life, Morris served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground for over twenty years.|$|E

5|$|Although many squadrons {{were raised}} at RAAF Station Laverton during World WarII, the base's prime focus {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> aircraft depot. Following {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in September 1939, No.1 AD began expanding to handle the RAAF's growing number of training and combat aircraft, among them the Wirraway, de Havilland Tiger Moth, Lockheed Hudson, Hawker Hurricane, and Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk. The depot assembled and tested new aircraft, and ferried them to operational areas such as northern Australia and New Guinea. It was also responsible {{for the maintenance of}} in-service aircraft, including their engines, instruments, and armament. As well as RAAF equipment, No.1 AD repaired battle-damaged US aircraft such as B-17 Flying Fortresses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E
5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later {{rooms of the}} castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety of the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{unification}} of Italy in 1861, the new Regia Marina (Royal Navy) began a construction program to prepare a fleet of ironclad warships capable of defeating the Austrian Navy. Italy considered the Austrian Empire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> main rival, since it controlled predominantly Italian areas, including Venice. The nascent Italian shipyards were incapable of building the number of ships the new fleet would require, so most of this first generation of ironclads were built by foreign ship builders. In 1862, the four ships of the Regina Maria Pia class were ordered from French shipyards, {{under the direction of}} Vice Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, then the Italian Navy Minister. These ships were designed by the French builders.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Wallace {{published}} a book entitled The Wonderful Century: Its Successes and Its Failures about developments in the 19th century. The {{first part of the}} book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century; the second part covered what Wallace considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> social failures including: the destruction and waste of wars and arms races, the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked, a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals, abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums, the environmental damage caused by capitalism, and the evils of European colonialism. Wallace continued his social activism {{for the rest of his}} life, publishing the book The Revolt of Democracy just weeks before his death.|$|E

5|$|In a final onslaught, Bellatrix {{is killed}} and Harry reveals to Voldemort {{that he is}} alive. He {{explains}} to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Although Voldemort believes by killing Snape he has gained the Wand's loyalty, Snape was in fact never its master. Instead, Draco Malfoy earned the Wand's loyalty when he disarmed Dumbledore just before Snape arrived. Harry believes the Elder Wand recognized Draco as its master, {{up to the point}} where Harry disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior, and the duel will depend on whether or not the wand recognizes Harry <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> master. Voldemort attempts one final Killing Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against Harry and the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort at last.|$|E
5|$|Laid down on 25 May 1910, Rivadavia was {{launched}} and christened on 26 August 1911 by Isabel, {{the wife of}} the Argentine Minister to the United States Rómulo Sebastián Naón. Thousands of people were present to witness the event, including representatives from the Argentine Navy and the country's legation in Washington. The United States sent the assistant chief of the Latin American Division in the State Department, Henry L. James, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> official representative. Two United States Navy bureau chiefs also attended.|$|E
5|$|Matthew died in 1973, {{sparking}} {{an internal}} conflict over who would succeed him {{as head of}} the Harlem congregation. Shortly before his death, Matthew named his grandson, David Matthew Doré, as the new spiritual leader. Doré was 16 years old at the time. In 1975, the synagogue's board elected Rabbi Willie White <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> leader. Rabbi Doré occasionally conducted services at the synagogue until the early 1980s, when White had Doré and some other members locked out of the building. Membership declined throughout the 1990s and by 2004, only a few dozen people belonged to the synagogue. In 2007 the Commandment Keepers sold the building, while various factions among former members sued one another.|$|E

The territory's most important contribution to the war is commonly held <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), under which 8,235 British, Commonwealth and Allied airmen were trained in Southern Rhodesian flight schools. The colony's operational casualties numbered 916 killed and 483 wounded of all races.|$|E
5|$|Super Metroid {{opens with}} a {{narrative}} by bounty hunter Samus Aran. Samus describes the events of her , and how she encountered a Metroid larva, which hatched from an egg and immediately imprinted upon her, believing her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> mother. She brought the larva to Ceres Space Colony, where scientists believed that they could harness its power. Just after she left the colony, she received a distress call and returned to find the scientists dead and the larva stolen by Ridley—the leader of the Space Pirates. Samus escapes from the space colony when its self-destruct sequence is activated, and follows Ridley to the planet Zebes. There, she searches for the stolen larva in a network of caves, and finds that the Space Pirates rebuilt and expanded their base on Zebes.|$|E

China has proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>its</b> most successful territory where it earned $11.6million on its opening day, going on to earn a record-breaking $67million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.
