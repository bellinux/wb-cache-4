Doctors likened the injury to one more likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> a car crash. Then-manager Glenn Roeder signed ex-Newcastle veteran Srníček as cover for Harper, and youth goalkeeper Tim Krul played a full match in Newcastle's 1–0 UEFA Cup win at Palermo on 2 November.

5|$|As soon as Kantakouzenos left Constantinople in July 1341 to {{campaign}} against the Empire's enemies who were assaulting it, Apokaukos made his first moves. Although as commander of the fleet it was his duty to guard the Dardanelles against any attempt by Turks to cross into Europe, he deliberately allowed this <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> order to cause disruption in Thrace. Apokaukos tried to kidnap the young John V, but failed {{and was forced to}} flee to his house at Epibatai. However, when Kantakouzenos returned victorious to the capital, instead of depriving Apokaukos of his offices, and against the counsel of his friends, he pardoned his protégé. Apokaukos put on an exaggerated display of deference to Kantakouzenos, who allowed him to resume his offices and return to Constantinople, while Kantakouzenos left on yet another campaign.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they knew what was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|The factual {{accuracy}} of the series is often criticised by legal professionals and journalists; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury {{not to let the}} series influence their view of trials—referring to an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury service. A complaint was made by a viewer about one episode claiming biased and incorrect information about the MMR vaccine, leading the BBC to unilaterally ban repeats of it in its original form. All six series (with the exception of the two banned episodes from Series Five) have been released on DVD in the UK.|$|E

Video Packages contain commentary that was remixed from WWE '13 and WWE 2K14 with the exception of some not documented before. Through DLC, the WWE Hall of Fame showcase contains what if matches and some from WCW; these matches were announced on Oct 7th 2015 and to be released alongside the Deluxe Editions of the video game.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to other}} countries, the United Kingdom {{definition}} of a drought is much less severe. In Libya in the Sahel region, a drought is usually only recognized after two years without any measurable rainfall.

25|$|The {{proposed}} deal eliminated some of {{the spending}} cuts required by the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> 2015. This did not decrease federal spending; instead, by {{reducing the amount of}} spending cuts the government was going to be forced to make by the sequester, it actually increased government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the sequester remained in place. Some Republicans wanted Speaker John Boehner to pursue a temporary measure that would cover the rest of Fiscal Year 2014 at the level set by the sequester – $967 billion, rather than pass this budget deal, which would have $45 billion in additional spending.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, just as Rabbinic Judaism was in {{part the}} Pharisaic {{response}} to their acknowledgment that the Temple would not be rebuilt in their lifetimes, Christianity reflected the acknowledgment of early Christians that the Second Coming of Christ {{and the establishment of}} God's kingdom on earth was not <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> their lifetimes. The critical analysis of the Gospels involves, at least in part, a consideration of how these concerns affected the Gospels' accounts of Jesus.|$|E
