5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|More serious {{complications}} include laryngospasm, perforation of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, <b>temporomandibular</b> joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased oxygen content, elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding. Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence {{of some of these}} complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill {{on the part of the}} laryngoscopist.|$|E

25|$|<b>Temporomandibular</b> {{joint pain}} is {{generally}} due {{to one of}} four reasons.|$|E
25|$|Osteoarthritis of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joint, a {{degenerative}} {{joint disease}} of the articular surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of bruxism with <b>temporomandibular</b> joint dysfunction (TMD, or <b>temporomandibular</b> pain dysfunction syndrome) is debated. Many suggest that sleep bruxism {{can be a}} causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in TMD. Indeed, the symptoms of TMD overlap with those of bruxism. Others {{suggest that there is}} no strong association between TMD and bruxism. A systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism, there is a positive association with TMD pain, and when stricter diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used, the association with TMD symptoms is much lower. In severe, chronic cases, bruxism can lead to myofascial pain and arthritis of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joints.|$|E
25|$|<b>Temporomandibular</b> jaw pain (chronic {{pain in the}} jaw joint), and cervicogenic {{headache}} (headache {{caused by}} pain in muscles of the neck) are also possible diagnoses.|$|E
25|$|Pain or {{tenderness}} of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joints, {{which may}} manifest as preauricular pain (in {{front of the}} ear), or pain referred to the ear (otalgia).|$|E
25|$|The main {{components}} are the joint capsule, articular disc, mandibular condyles, articular {{surface of the}} temporal bone, <b>temporomandibular</b> ligament, stylomandibular ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, and lateral pterygoid muscle.|$|E
25|$|The <b>temporomandibular</b> joints can be palpated {{anterior}} to or within the {{external acoustic meatus}} during movements of the mandible. Auscultation of the joint can also be done.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{feature of}} the <b>temporomandibular</b> joint is the {{articular}} disc. The disc is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue that is positioned between the two bones that form the joint. The <b>temporomandibular</b> joints {{are one of the}} few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The disc divides each joint into two.These two compartments are synovial cavities, which consists of an upper and a lower synovial cavity. The synovial membrane lining the joint capsule produces the synovial fluid that fills these cavities.|$|E
25|$|Although rare, other {{pathologic}} {{conditions may}} also affect {{the function of}} <b>temporomandibular</b> joints, causing pain and swelling. These conditions include chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, giant cell tumor and aneurysmal bone cyst.|$|E
25|$|Utilization {{of these}} cells as {{curative}} cartilage replacement materials on the cellular level has shown promise, with beneficial applications including the repair and healing of damaged knee menisci and synovial joints; <b>temporomandibular</b> joints, and vertebra.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} of subjective tinnitus are often obscure. While {{it is not}} surprising that direct trauma to the inner ear can cause tinnitus, other apparent causes (e.g., <b>temporomandibular</b> joint dysfunction) are difficult to explain.|$|E
25|$|Sensory {{innervation}} of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joint {{is derived}} from the auriculotemporal and masseteric branches of V3 or mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. These are only sensory innervation. Recall that motor is to the muscles.|$|E
25|$|The resting {{position}} of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joint is not with the teeth biting together. Instead, the muscular balance and proprioceptive feedback allow a physiologic rest for the mandible, an interocclusal clearance or freeway space, which is 2 to 4mm between the teeth.|$|E
25|$|The <b>temporomandibular</b> joints (TMJ) {{are the two}} joints {{connecting}} the jawbone to the skull. It is a bilateral synovial articulation between the temporal bone of the skull above and the mandible below; it is from these bones that its name is derived.|$|E
25|$|Pain {{associated}} with <b>temporomandibular</b> joint disorder and myofascial pain also often {{occurs in the}} same region as pericoronitis. They are easily missed diagnoses {{in the presence of}} mild and chronic pericoronitis, and the latter may not be contributing greatly to the individual's pain (see table).|$|E
25|$|Pain, {{which gets}} worse as the {{condition}} develops and becomes severe. The pain may be throbbing and radiate to the ear, throat, <b>temporomandibular</b> joint, posterior submandibular region and {{floor of the}} mouth. There may also be pain when biting. Sometimes the pain disturbs sleep.|$|E
25|$|There {{has long}} been a {{proposed}} link between whiplash injuries and the development of <b>temporomandibular</b> joint dysfunction (TMD). A recent review concluded that although there are contradictions in the literature, overall there is moderate evidence that TMD can occasionally follow whiplash injury, and that the incidence of this occurrence is low to moderate.|$|E
25|$|While filming City Heat, Reynolds {{was struck}} {{in the face with}} a metal chair and had <b>temporomandibular</b> joint dysfunction. He lost thirty pounds from not eating. The painkillers he was {{prescribed}} led to addiction, which took several years to break. Reynolds underwent back surgery in 2009 and a quintuple heart bypass in February 2010.|$|E
25|$|During chewing, the {{mandible}} {{moves in}} a specific manner as delineated by the two <b>temporomandibular</b> joints. The side of the mandible that moves laterally {{is referred to as}} either the working or rotating side, while the other side is referred to as either the balancing or orbiting side. The latter terms, although a bit outdated, are actually more precise, as they define the sides by the movements of the respective condyles.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{disorders}} {{may include}} musculoskeletal complaints, especially arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, osteoarthritis, dental pain, <b>temporomandibular</b> joint (TMJ) pain, spondylarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout attacks, and pain management {{in cases of}} kidney stones and gallstones. An additional indication is the treatment of acute migraines. Diclofenac is used commonly to treat mild to moderate postoperative or post-traumatic pain, in particular when inflammation is also present, and is effective against menstrual pain and endometriosis.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} ligaments {{associated}} with the <b>temporomandibular</b> joints: one major and two minor ligaments. These ligaments are important in that they define the border movements, or in other words, the farthest extents of movements, of the mandible. Movements of the mandible made past the extents functionally allowed by the muscular attachments will result in painful stimuli, and thus, movements past these more limited borders are rarely achieved in normal function.|$|E
25|$|These two {{bones are}} {{actually}} separated by an articular disc, which divides the joint into two distinct compartments. The inferior compartment allows for {{rotation of the}} condylar head around an instantaneous axis of rotation, corresponding to the first 20mm {{or so of the}} opening of the mouth. After the mouth is open to this extent, the mouth can no longer open without the superior compartment of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joints becoming active.|$|E
25|$|Bruxism {{is usually}} {{detected}} {{because of the}} effects of the process (most commonly tooth wear and pain), rather than the process itself. The large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system, namely the teeth, the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull (the <b>temporomandibular</b> joints). The muscles of mastication that act to move the jaw can also be affected since they are being utilized over and above of normal function.|$|E
25|$|Pericoronitis {{is caused}} by an {{accumulation}} of bacteria and debris beneath the operculum, or by mechanical trauma (e.g. biting the operculum with the opposing tooth). Pericoronitis {{is often associated with}} partially erupted and impacted mandibular third molars (lower wisdom teeth), often occurring at the age of wisdom tooth eruption (15-24). Other common causes of similar pain from the third molar region are food impaction causing periodontal pain, pulpitis from dental caries (tooth decay), and acute myofascial pain in <b>temporomandibular</b> joint disorder.|$|E
25|$|The major ligament, the <b>temporomandibular</b> ligament, is {{actually}} the thickened lateral portion of the capsule, and it has two parts: an outer oblique portion (OOP) and an inner horizontal portion (IHP). The base of this triangular ligament {{is attached to the}} zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the articular tubercle; its apex is fixed to the lateral side of the neck of the mandible. This ligament prevents the excessive retraction or moving backward of the mandible, a situation that might lead to problems with the joint.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{disorder}} of a <b>temporomandibular</b> joint is disc displacement. In essence, {{this is when}} the articular disc, attached anteriorly to the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle and posteriorly to the retrodiscal tissue, moves out from between the condyle and the fossa, so that the mandible and temporal bone contact is made on {{something other than the}} articular disc. This, as explained above, is usually very painful, because unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation.|$|E
25|$|This is {{performed}} to realign the mandible (lower jaw) or maxilla (upper jaw) {{with the rest}} of the skull and/or teeth. This is usually performed to correct skeletal malocclusions, that is discrepancies in tooth position that cannot be corrected by simple orthodontic movement, and realignment of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joints, or to correct facial deformities such as mandibular retrognathia. There is little scarring, and all of the surgery takes places inside of the mouth. Orthodontic braces may have to be worn pre- and post- operation to realign the teeth to match the newly realigned jaw.|$|E
25|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of bruxism is advantageous, {{due to the}} possible damage that may be incurred and the detrimental effect on quality of life. A {{diagnosis of}} bruxism is usually made clinically, and is mainly based on the person's history (e.g. reports of grinding noises) {{and the presence of}} typical signs and symptoms, including tooth mobility, tooth wear, masseteric hypertrophy, indentations on the tongue, hypersensitive teeth (which may be misdiagnosed as reversible pulpitis), pain in the muscles of mastication, and clicking or locking of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joints. Questionnaires can be used to screen for bruxism in both the clinical and research settings.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} often {{attributed to}} fibromyalgia {{that may be}} due to a comorbid disorder include myofascial pain syndrome, also referred to as chronic myofascial pain, diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias, functional bowel disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome, genitourinary symptoms and interstitial cystitis, dermatological disorders, headaches, myoclonic twitches, and symptomatic hypoglycemia. Although fibromyalgia is classified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas. Many sufferers also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high rates of comorbid <b>temporomandibular</b> joint dysfunction. 20–30% of people with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus may also have fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|Formation of the <b>temporomandibular</b> joints {{occurs at}} around 12 weeks in utero when the joint spaces and the {{articular}} disc develop. At approximately 10 weeks the {{component of the}} fetus future joint becomes evident in the mesenchyme between condylar cartilage of the mandible and the developing temporal bone. Two slits like joint cavities and intervening disk make their appearance in this region by 12 weeks. The mesenchyme around the joint begins to form the fibrous joint capsule. Very {{little is known about}} the significance of newly forming muscles in joint formation. The developing superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle attaches to the anterior portion of the fetal disk. The disk also continues posterior through the petrotympanic fissure and attaches to the malleus of middle ear.|$|E
25|$|The most usual {{trigger in}} sleep bruxism that leads {{a person to}} seek medical or dental advice is being {{informed}} by sleeping partner of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep bruxism is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, <b>temporomandibular</b> disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly electroencephalography if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased masseter and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve electroencephalography, electromyography, electrocardiography, air flow monitoring and audio–video recording. It {{may be useful to}} help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism.|$|E
25|$|The {{muscles of}} {{mastication}} (the temporalis, masseter, medial and lateral pterygoid muscles) are paired {{on either side}} and work together to move the mandible, which hinges and slides around its dual articulation with the skull at the <b>temporomandibular</b> joints. Some of the muscles work to elevate the mandible (close the mouth), and others also are involved in lateral (side to side), protrusive or retractive movements. Mastication (chewing) is a complex neuromuscular activity that can be controlled either by subconscious processes or by conscious processes. In individuals without bruxism or other parafunctional activities, during wakefulness the jaw is generally at rest and the teeth are not in contact, except while speaking, swallowing or chewing. It is estimated that the teeth are in contact for less than 20 minutes per day, mostly during chewing and swallowing. Normally during sleep, the voluntary muscles are inactive due to physiologic motor paralysis, and the jaw is usually open.|$|E
25|$|Early {{symptoms}} {{may include}} loss of precision muscle coordination (sometimes first manifested in declining penmanship, frequent small injuries to the hands, and dropped items), cramping pain with sustained use, and trembling. Significant muscle pain and cramping {{may result from}} very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become {{difficult to find a}} comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome. Affected persons may notice trembling in the diaphragm while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth, or symptoms similar to <b>temporomandibular</b> joint disorder. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping.|$|E
