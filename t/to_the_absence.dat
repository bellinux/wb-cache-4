5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Curse of Enchantia was mostly positive, especially {{in regard to}} its graphics and animation. However, the game was derided by some for its confusing user interface system, often illogical puzzle solutions and what some reviewers thought {{was a lack of}} quality humor, plot development and atmosphere, attributing it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of text and dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Ramarayaningar was {{regarded}} as an advocate of democracy and a staunch supporter of empowerment of the depressed classes.

5|$|Entering the 2011–12 season, the Hokies lost star Malcolm Delaney, {{who signed}} a {{conditional}} one-year contract with the French professional basketball team Élan Chalon following his senior year. Garland debuted as a sophomore on November 12, 2011 against East Tennessee State, making his first-ever start at the collegiate level due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of Erick Green. He played 24 minutes throughout the game, recording 13 points, 3 assists, and 2 steals. In Tech's next contest with Monmouth, Garland scored a career-high 18 points off the bench, shooting 7-for-7 from the field.|$|E

5|$|Grissom {{was sent}} to the Lovelace Clinic and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to undergo {{extensive}} physical examinations and to submit to a battery of psychological tests. He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from hay fever, but was permitted to continue when it was determined that his allergies would not be a problem due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of ragweed pollen in space. On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed working {{men out of}} the home and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion. Wealthy capitalists wishing {{to strike a balance between}} the demands of labor and desires of capital looked to Robert Owen's example. George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen. The peaceful atmosphere in Pullman and Hallidayboro can be attributed in part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Male elands {{and female}} greater kudus {{can produce a}} viable male hybrid, {{though it is not}} known if it is sterile. An {{accidental}} crossing of an east African common eland (T. o. pattersonianus) with an east African kudu (T. s. bea) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. This was believed to be due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was sterile, which was unexpected before the study. The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the eland and the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes. Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with domestic (Bos primigenius) and zebu cows (Bos indicus) have also produced sterile hybrids. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos.|$|E

He started the majority of games for the 76ers in his sophomore season at center due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of Andrew Bynum.

5|$|Ramprasad {{was born}} in Halisahar, a village {{on the banks of}} the Ganges about thirty-five miles north of Kolkata, into a Tantric Vaidya family. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of birth records, his actual birth date is not known, but it is {{believed}} to be around 1718 or 1723. His father, Ramram Sen, was an Ayurvedic doctor and Sanskrit scholar. Ramprasad's mother Siddheswari was Ramram's second wife. Ramprasad was sent to a Sanskrit tol (school) where he learned Sanskrit grammar, literature, Persian, and Hindi. As a youth, he had a talent for poetry and learning new languages.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone of stress and deformation, and due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of sediment {{on the ocean floor}} off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average subduction zone thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical subduction zone earthquake.|$|E

5|$|The {{competition}} is a knock-out tournament and in 1999 was contested by the 30 teams that {{played in the}} First, Second and Third Divisions of the Scottish Football League. 28 of the teams entered the first round and two received random byes into the second round to even the number of fixtures. Teams were paired at random and the winner of each match progressed to the next round and the loser was eliminated. The tournament returned {{for the first time}} since 1997 after it was suspended for one season due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of a sponsor.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} with the titular character being considered a possible mascot for the Saturn. This was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of a Sonic the Hedgehog {{game at the}} time of its launch, however the game failed to catch consumer attention. It was one of the earliest examples of 3D platforming as well as the first platform game released on the Saturn. Bug! received positive reviews upon release; critics praised its graphics and colourful visual effects, however the game's music and voice acting were criticised. A sequel, Bug Too!, was released for the Saturn in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} cast comprised former West End standby Nikki Davis-Jones as Elphaba, {{with former}} ensemble {{member of the}} West End production, Emily Tierney, as Glinda. Alongside them were Liam Doyle as Fiyero, Marilyn Cutts as Madame Morrible, Carina Gillespie as Nessarose and George Ure, who was reprising his role as Boq from the West End production. For the first time, the roles of The Wizard and Doctor Dillamond were played by a single actor, Dale Rapley. At the time, the only other actor to play both roles in a single performance was London's David Stoller in November 2008, but this was only due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of several actors.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E
5|$|While {{the revolt}} was {{unfolding}} in London, John Wrawe led his force into Suffolk. Wrawe had considerable {{influence over the}} development of the revolt across eastern England, where there may have been almost as many rebels as in the London revolt. The authorities put up very little resistance to the revolt: the major nobles failed to organise defences, key fortifications fell easily to the rebels and the local militias were not mobilised. As in London and the south-east, this was in part due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of key military leaders and the nature of English law, but any locally recruited men might also have proved unreliable {{in the face of a}} popular uprising.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E

5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation {{in support of the}} preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the final}} Test, Hassett's run-scoring peaked when he stroked 232 against Brown's {{men in a}} drawn match for Victoria. In the Fifth Test at the MCG, he top-scored with 92 before his {{dismissal}} to a one-handed diving catch sparked a collapse and Australia managed only 217 batting first. The tourists took a first innings lead and Hassett made 48 in Australia’s second innings of 197. England made the 95 needed for victory, and the eight-wicket loss was Australia's first Test defeat since the resumption of international cricket after World War II, ending a streak of 25 Tests without defeat. Hassett and Brown described the series as the friendliest they had been involved in, but despite the success on the field, the series was poorly attended and revenue was down by around 25% from the corresponding tour four years earlier, mainly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of Bradman to spark public interest.|$|E
5|$|Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra {{commented that}} Robotrons success, along with Defender, {{illustrated}} that video game enthusiasts {{were ready for}} more difficult games with complex controls. Though {{not the first to}} implement it, Robotron: 2084s use of dual joysticks popularized the design among 2D shooting games, and has since been copied by other arcade-style games. The control scheme has appeared in several other titles produced by Midway Games: Inferno, Smash TV, and Total Carnage. Many shooting games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network use this dual control design. The 2003 title Geometry Wars and its sequels also use a similar control scheme. The input design was most prominent in arcade games until video games with three-dimensional (3D) graphics became popular in the late 1990s. Jarvis attributes the lack of proliferation in the home market <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of hardware that offered two side-by-side joysticks. Most 3D games, however, use the dual joystick scheme to control the movement of a character and a camera. Few console games, like the 2004 title , use two joysticks for movement and attacking.|$|E
