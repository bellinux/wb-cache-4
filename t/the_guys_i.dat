500|$|The team {{rested on}} December 29—the day {{following}} their final regular-season game. They began preparations {{for their first}} post-season game on Tuesday, December 30 through Thursday, January 1, before three days of weekend rest. Roethlisberger did not practice until Monday, January 5—Tomlin stated of the injury, [...] "We will proceed slowly with him because we have that luxury. But we feel comfortable with where he is relative to Sunday and where he’s capable of being next week." [...] Although the January 1 practice {{was expected to be}} normal, Tomlin allowed players to leave after team meetings and a walk-through. Multiple Steelers stated that they would watch the games of the Wild Card round. Some including James Farrior and Ryan Clark watched as fans; however, Chris Hoke said, [...] "I will be watching <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>I</b> am going against... That is how I watch it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{shown in}} the first legs of the tour, the first four songs are always the same. The concert begins with footage of Brooks' {{silhouette}} while singing the opening lines to [...] "Man Against Machine". He then appears via elevator through {{the floor of the}} stage, pauses, and [...] The bridge and final chorus are omitted and it transitions to [...] "Rodeo", followed by [...] "Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House", and [...] "The Beaches of Cheyenne". Next, depending on the venue, other songs such as [...] "The River", [...] "Two Pina Coladas", [...] "Papa Loved Mama", and [...] "Ain't Goin' Down ('Til the Sun Comes Up)". [...] "Unanswered Prayers" [...] follows, with the audience singing the entire song with little accompaniment from Brooks. Additional songs, including [...] "That Summer", [...] "The Thunder Rolls", and [...] "We Shall Be Free" [...] may follow. Excluding the opening, Brooks only performs one song from Man Against Machine, his new album (either [...] "People Loving People" [...] or [...] "All American Kid"; occasionally [...] "Mom"). When questioned on his lack of new songs in the setlist, he remarked, [...] "I'm just like you... I see <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>I</b> like and I want to hear the old stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the album's front cover, {{the band}} {{wanted to take}} a photo with a monkey from the Bronx Zoo. George DuBose {{originally}} took the picture in the zoo's monkey house, but this photo was rejected by the zoo director. The zoo would not allow the band to borrow a chimp for photographing, so DuBose decided to try and hire Zippy the Chimp from The David Letterman Show and was successful. The resulting idea was to take the picture of the band {{standing in front of a}} gorilla cage with Legs McNeil, Joey's brother and Punk Magazine author, in a gorilla costume. Dee Dee is holding Zippy the Chimp, a baby chimpanzee, and because of this, DuBose had to refrain from flashing light as he could possibly spooked it, although according to DuBose, the chimp was already out of control. [...] "Zippy was getting wild," [...] Dubose recalled, [...] "he wasn't looking at the camera and was fucking around with <b>the</b> <b>guys.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't getting the picture because the chimp was out of control, so finally the trainer goes up to Zippy and whacks him across the face." [...] The lack of flash resulted in a lowlighted warmer colored photograph, which would be used as the album's cover.|$|E
2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with <b>the</b> <b>guys.</b> <b>I</b> mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E
