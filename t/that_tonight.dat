Anka said he then offered to let Carson write and publish new lyrics in order to claim a songwriter's credit, along {{with half of the}} royalties every time the song was played. Those lyrics were never used on the show. Anka estimated that [...] "Johnny's Theme" [...] was played live on Carson's Tonight Show more than 1,400,000 times over the course of 30 years. As its original composer, Anka also was paid each time the song was broadcast, earning each man an average of about US$200,000 per year.|$|E
500|$|The film had its {{official}} premiere in Alice Tully Hall at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City on January 19, 2011. Melanne Verveer, United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, gave a speech, saying, [...] "Each {{and every one}} of us is called to act. I hope <b>that</b> <b>tonight</b> each of us will make their own commitment." [...] Additional screenings were held in Los Angeles and Chicago later that month. That October, Not My Life had its international premiere in London. CNN International aired the film in two parts a few days later as part of the CNN Freedom Project. The Swedish premiere was attended by Crown Princess Victoria. Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources, so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of Not My Life, ultimately deciding to release the film at charge in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings. On November 1, an 83-minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses. LexisNexis, the governments of Arizona and Minnesota, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF all purchased licenses. The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti-human-trafficking campaign.|$|E
500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, {{and went on}} to {{describe}} the episode as [...] "A funny, touching, entertaining Glee episode that didn't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in <b>that</b> <b>tonight</b> was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: [...] "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised the storyline, calling it cohesive.|$|E

All this, and I'd still rank Swag as only my fourth- or fifth-favorite episode of the Golden Globe-nominated series' young run." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 3April 1937, Puyi's younger {{full brother}} Prince Pujie was proclaimed heir {{apparent}} after marrying Lady Hiro Saga, a distant cousin to the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. The marriage had been politically arranged by Shigeru Honjō, a {{general of the}} Kwantung Army. Puyi thereafter would not speak candidly {{in front of his}} brother and refused to eat any food provided by Lady Hiro Saga, believing that she was out to poison him. Puyi was forced to sign an agreement that if he himself had a male heir, the child would be sent to Japan to be raised by the Japanese. Puyi initially thought that Lady Saga was a Japanese spy, but came to trust her after the Sinophile Saga discarded her kimono dresses for cheongsam dresses and she repeatedly assured him that she come to the Salt Tax Palace because she was Pujie's wife, not because she was a spy. Behr described Lady Saga as [...] "intelligent" [...] and [...] "level-headed", and noted the irony of Puyi snubbing the one Japanese who really wanted to be his friend. A sign of improved relations came when Puyi gave Lady Saga a diamond encrusted watch as a belated wedding present. Later in April1937, a [...] 16year-old Manchu aristocrat Tan Yuling moved into the Salt Tax Palace to become Puyi's concubine, but though Puyi seemed to have liked her, it remains unclear whether he had sex with her or not. Lady Saga tried to improve relations between Puyi and Wanrong by having them eat dinner together, which {{was the first time that}} they had shared a meal in three years. Wanrong refused to eat with chopsticks, instead using her fingers, which is regarded as [...] "savage" [...] behavior in Asia, but Wanrong stated she was past the point of caring about what others thought about her. Puyi tried to joke away Wanrong's unhappiness by saying <b>that</b> <b>tonight</b> was [...] "Mongol night", and everyone was going to be like a Mongol [...] "savage" [...] by eating with their fingers, but Lady Saga noted his jesting failed.|$|E
