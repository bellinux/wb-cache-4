40|$|This {{paper has}} three goals: {{to show that}} the Mandarin bei is a unified construction, to explore a {{universal}} characterization of the passive, and then to demonstrate that the bei construction is a genuine passive. The bei construction comes in two forms, one with an overt agent, known as the long passive, and the other without, known as the short passive. Previous accounts assign two very different structures to the two forms and posit two lexically different bei’s. This paper, however, based largely on newly discovered natural occurring data in Taiwan Mandarin, demonstrates that bei behaves rather similarly with or without an overt agent and thus dismisses the short passive and argues for a unified bei. Specifically, the bei construction is analyzed, within the Lexical-Functional Grammar, as <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> <b>counterpart</b> of the active ba construction. The paper then explores a universal characterization of the passive and a typology of the syntactic assignment of the demoted agent, and it demonstrates that bei’s agent phrase, demoted to object, is in line with the universal characterization of passive...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a new and novel control technique applied to an active suspension system of a quarter car model using adaptive fuzzy (AF) logic and active force control (AFC) strategies.

40|$|Female {{sexuality}} has commonly {{been viewed}} as <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> <b>counterpart</b> of male sexuality. Building upon Adrienne Rich 2 ̆ 7 s theory of compulsive heterosexuality, I {{would suggest that the}} fundamental location of this problem lies within the subconscious. Cristina Escofet 2 ̆ 7 s stance on this issue is to argue in favor of a deconstruction of Jungian archetypes, revealing their constructed rather than intrinsic character. In this dissertation, I study representative texts by Escofet and Isabel Allende and show not only how they depict patriarchal compulsive heterosexuality, but also try to reconceptualize female sexuality through surrealist and postmodern techniques such as self-reflection, dialogue with our double or Other, and sensorial perception. These techniques are designed to create a new epistemology of jouissance and excess, as defined by contemporary French theory. ^ The significance of my study resides in the interdisciplinary analysis of female sexuality in Hispanic feminist writers. The first chapter proposes that surrealism, postmodernism, and feminism are theoretical frameworks which create new paradigms for social change. In their feminist philosophies, Escofet and Allende emphasize the use of subconscious knowledge as a means of helping them understand the world and create alternative realities. The second chapter shows how Escofet and Allende deconstruct the mysoginist archetype of Eve, which has been largely responsible for identifying women 2 ̆ 7 s sexual identity with the disreputable qualities of the femme fatale and whose mirror-image has long plagued women. In accordance with this stereotype, Lillith (Adam 2 ̆ 7 s sexually active ex-partner), has typically been portrayed as the negative Other, and for generations the she-devil myth which surrounds her has resurfaced in the media, where she assumes the role of innumerable evil female characters. In the third chapter, I examine how class and race differences have been used to intensify the demonization of different types of sexuality. In the same manner as Lillith and Eve, black and indigenous characters express dissent by retelling their stories in words and performance, and by seeking to form a dialog with their readers. The last chapter deals with the importance of the senses for female characters as they try to create their own sexuality from the fragmented bodies we find in surrealist and postmodern art. In this section we shall see how Luce Irigaray and Hélène Cixous 2 ̆ 7 s theories about multiple sexualities are in evidence when Escofet and Allende reconceptualize female sexuality. As no previous scholarship has analyzed the use of the subconscious, the senses, and performance when understanding female sexuality in Latin American literature, this dissertation seeks to provide a tentative exploration of the issues that may help to open up a new field of research in Hispanic feminist cultural studies. ...|$|E

In particular, we develop numerical tools to address the locomotion ofmicroswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and complex geometries, {{as well as the}} motion ofdeformable capsules in micro-fluidic flows. For the active movement, the squirmer is used as our model microswimmer. The finiteelement method is employed to study the influence of the viscoelasticity of fluid on theperformance of locomotion. A boundary element method is implemented to study swimmingcells inside a tube. For <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> <b>counterpart,</b> the deformable capsule is chosen as the modelcell. An accelerated boundary integral method code is developed to solve thefluid-structure interaction, and a global spectral method is incorporated to handle theevolving cell surface and its corresponding membrane dynamics. We study the locomotion of a neutral squirmer with anemphasis on the change of swimming kinematics, energetics, and flowdisturbance from Newtonian to viscoelastic fluid. We also examine the dynamics of differentswimming gaits resulting in different patterns of polymer deformation, as well as theirinfluence on the swimming performance. We correlate the change of swimming speed withthe extensional viscosity and that of power consumption with the phase delay of viscoelasticfluids. Moreover, we utilise the boundary element method to simulate the swimming cells in astraight and torus-like bent tube, where the tube radius is a few times the cell radius. Weinvestigate the effect of tube confinement to the swimming speed and power consumption. Weanalyse the motions of squirmers with different gaits, which significantly affect thestability of the motion. Helical trajectories are produced for a neutralsquirmer swimming, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations, which can beexplained by hydrodynamic interactions alone. We perform simulations of a deformable capsule in micro-fluidic flows. We look atthe trajectory and deformation of a capsule through a channel/duct with a corner. Thevelocity of capsule displays an overshoot as passing around the corner, indicating apparentviscoelasticity induced by the interaction between the deformable membrane and viscousflow. A curved corner is found to deform the capsule less than the straight one. In addition, we propose a new cell sorting device based on the deformability of cells. Weintroduce carefully-designed geometric features into the flow to excite thehydrodynamic interactions between the cell and device. This interaction varies andclosely depends on the cell deformability, the resultant difference scatters the cellsonto different trajectories. Our high-fidelity computations show that the new strategy achievesa clear and robust separation of cells. We finally investigate the motion of capsule in awall-bounded oscillating shear flow, to understand the effect of physiological pulsation to thedeformation and lateral migration of cells. We observe the lateral migration velocity of a cellvaries non-monotonically with its deformability. QC 20140313 </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} a novel active non-intrusive system {{identification}} paradigm is {{developed for the}} purpose of cardiovascular health monitoring. The proposed approach seeks to utilize a collocated actuator sensor unit devised from the common blood pressure cuff to simultaneously 1) produce rich transmural blood pressure waves that propagate through the cardiovascular system and 2) to make measurements of these rich peripheral transmural blood pressures utilizing the pressure oscillations produced within the cuffs bladder in order to reproduce the central aortic blood pressure accurately. To achieve this end a mathematical model of the cardiovascular system is developed to model the wave propagation dynamics of the external (excitation applied by the cuff) and internal (excitation produced by the heart) blood pressure waveforms through the cardiovascular system. Next a system identification protocol is developed in which rich transmural blood pressures are recorded and used to identify the parameters characterizing the model. The peripheral blood pressures are used in tandem with the characterized model to reconstruct the central aortic blood pressure waveform. The results of this study indicate the developed protocol can reliably and accurately reproduced the central aortic blood pressure and that it can outperform its intrusive <b>passive</b> <b>counterpart</b> (<b>the</b> Individualized Transfer Function methodology).

By comparing the hydrodynamic case with <b>counterpart</b> simulations for <b>passive</b> and active Brownian particles, we elucidate the relative roles of self-propulsion, interparticle attraction, and hydrodynamic interactions in determining clustering and phase behaviour. Even {{in the presence of}} an attractive potential, we find that hydrodynamic interactions strongly suppress the motility induced phase separation that might a priori have been expected in a highly active suspension. Instead, we find only a weak tendency for the particles to form stringlike clusters in this regime. At lower activities we demonstrate phase behaviour that is broadly equivalent to that of <b>the</b> <b>counterpart</b> <b>passive</b> system at low temperatures, characterized by regimes of gas-liquid, gas-solid and liquid-solid phase coexistence.

A number of RFID tags and/or readers with known locations are deployed as reference nodes.

ILC algorithm is implemented into AFC-based control scheme to reduce its complexity and hence faster response, by replacing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) method as proposed by previous researcher. The new control scheme named active force control with iterative learning control algorithm (AFCIL) is complemented by the classic proportionalintegral- derivative (PID) control incorporated and designed as the outermost control loop. The PID controller was first designed and tested prior to developing the AFC which was directly cascaded with the PID loop. A number of ILC algorithms were explicitly employed to compute the estimated mass in the AFC loop that is necessary to trigger the control action. The AFC with ILC (AFCIL) suspension system was experimented both through simulation and practical experimentation considering various ILC learning parameters, different operating conditions and a number of external disturbances to test and verify the system robustness. The simulation was conducted using MATLAB/Simulink software package whilst the experimental study utilized the existing experimental rig with a hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) configuration with the proposed ILC algorithms incorporated as the new research contribution. The results obtained via various control schemes in the form of PID, AFCIL and passive systems were rigorously compared and analyzed to ascertain the system performance in terms of its ability to improve riding comfort characteristics.

40|$|The {{disruption}} of three patterns of two-limb coordination, involving cyclical flexion-extension movements {{performed in the}} same or in different directions, was investigated through application of passive movement to a third limb by the experimenter. The three patterns referred to the homologous, homolateral, and heterolateral (diagonal) limb combinations which were performed in the sagittal plane. <b>The</b> <b>passive</b> movement involved a spatiotemporal trajectory that differed from the movements controlled actively. Even though subjects were instructed to completely ignore <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> limb movement, <b>the</b> findings of experiment 1 demonstrated a moderate to severe destabilization of the two-limb patterns, as revealed by analyses of power spectra, relative phase, cycle duration, and amplitude. This disruption was more pronounced in the homolateral and heterolateral than in the homologous effector combinations, suggesting stronger coupling between homologous than nonhomologous limb pairs. Moreover, passive mobilization affected antiphase (nonisodirectional) movements more than inphase (isodirectional) movements, pointing to the differential stability of these patterns. Experiment 2 focused on homolateral coordination and demonstrated that withdrawal of visual information did not alter the effects induced by passive movement. It was therefore hypothesized that the generation of extra kinesthetic afferences through passive limb motion was primarily responsible for the detriment in interlimb coordination, possibly conflicting with the sensory information accompanying active movement production. In addition, it was demonstrated that the active limbs were more affected by their homologous <b>passive</b> <b>counterpart</b> than by their nonhomologous counterpart, favoring the notion of "specific" interference.

The framework is based on active learning algorithms that are statistical {{in the sense that}} they rely on estimates of expectations of functions of filtered random examples. It builds on the powerful statistical query framework of Kearns (1993). We show that any efficient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efficient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classification noise as well as other forms of "uncorrelated" noise. The complexity of the resulting algorithms has information-theoretically optimal quadratic dependence on 1 /(1 - 2 η), where η is the noise rate. We show that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efficiently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the first computationally-efficient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classification noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error ϵ over their <b>passive</b> <b>counterparts.</b> In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efficient active differentially-private algorithms.

In non-standard common speech, however, the perfect of <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> may alternatively be formed by using <b>the</b> long <b>passive</b> with <b>the</b> final vowel changed to the final vowel (usually [...] ) of the verb's perfect. Additionally, in non-standard speech <b>the</b> perfect <b>passive</b> of verbs ending in a [...] that changes to [...] in <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> replace it with [...]|$|R

40|$|Theories {{of spatial}} learning, {{such as those}} of Siegal and White (1975) and Piaget and Inhelder (1967) have {{considered}} active exploration of environments to be beneficial or essential for the development of specific spatial knowledge. Real world empirical research in the form of both laboratory experimental and broader environmental studies tends to support this suggestion, demonstrating that active exploration of an environment, in both children and adults, gives better spatial learning than passive experience. Based on these findings, the working hypothesis adopted in this thesis is that active exploration of a virtual environment (VE) would also result in better spatial learning than <b>passive</b> experience of <b>the</b> same VE. Also considered is the equivalence of real and virtual world experiences, and the degree of transfer of spatial learning between VEs and real equivalent environments. Seven experiments were undertaken, all utilising a yoked active passive paired-subjects design. A range of VEs was employed across the experiments, including a room, a corridor, and both complex and simple small towns. Three studies used children as participants and five, adults, all having both males and females. The key finding was that the experimental hypothesis was supported for children but not for adults. Active child participants (when using a familiar input device) demonstrated superior spatial learning to that of their <b>passive</b> <b>counterparts,</b> but active adult participants did not show superior spatial learning to that of <b>passive</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Underestimation of distances was a universal feature, but was greater in female than male participants. Otherwise, the general equivalence of real and virtual world experiences was confirmed, with transfer of spatial learning occurring from virtual environments to real world equivalent environments for both adults and children...|$|R
