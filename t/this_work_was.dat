In late September, Minnesota struck a naval mine laid by the German U-boat U-117, causing serious damage that kept her out of service for five months. Convoy duty was cut short by the German {{surrender}} in November; thereafter, the Connecticuts were used to ferry American soldiers back from the battlefields of France. <b>This</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> completed by mid-1919.

The laboratory's ordnance engineering division, known as Z Division, after its first director, Jerrold R. Zacharias, was split between Los Alamos and Sandia. Between March and July 1946, Z Division relocated to Sandia, except for its mechanical engineering (Z-4) section, which followed in February 1947. Z Division worked on improving the mechanical and electrical reliability of the Mark 3 Fat Man bomb, but <b>this</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> disrupted by the Crossroads tests.|$|E
