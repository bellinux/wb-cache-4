The Crystal Meth album was first announced before Method Man began working on his and Redman's sophomore collaboration album, Blackout! 2, during which time it was tentatively titled The Crystal Method. In the liner notes of that album, it was given a scheduled release date for 2009. The album, however, was further postponed until it was later mentioned in an MTV interview it would be released in early 2010.

5000|$|With this {{explicit}} background given, Josephus {{began an}} exposition {{of the days}} of Archelaus' reign before Passover of 4 BC. Archelaus dressed in white and ascended a golden throne {{and appeared to be}} kind to the populace in Jerusalem in order to appease their desires for lower taxes and an end to the (political) imprisonment of Herod's enemies. The demeanor of the questioning appeared to turn at some point, and <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> began to call for the punishment of those of Herod's people who ordered the death of the 2 teachers and the 40 youths. They also demanded the replacement of the High Priest, from the appointed High Priest of Herod's to a High Priest, [...] "...of greater piety and purity." [...] Josephus does not tell who would be [...] "...of greater piety and purity". To this request, however, Archelaus acceded, although he was becoming angry at the presumptions of <b>the</b> <b>crowds.</b> Archelaus asked for moderation and <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> that all would be well if they would put aside their animosities and wait until he was confirmed as King by Caesar Augustus.|$|R

25|$|In {{all three}} accounts, after Jesus {{got into the}} ship, the wind ceased and they reached the shore. Only John's account has their ship {{immediately}} reach the shore. Matthew's and Mark's accounts end at this point, but John mentions that the next day some people {{from the other side}} of the sea that looked for Jesus, noted that the disciples left without him, but they didn't know where he went. When they came to Capernaum and asked Jesus how he came there, instead of answering the question, he <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> that they followed him, not because they had seen signs, but because of the free loaves they had eaten the day before, and he advised them not to seek earthly gains, but aim for a life based on higher spiritual values.|$|E
25|$|Batista made an {{appearance}} at No Way Out and <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> that once his arm had healed {{he would return}} to regain the World Heavyweight Championship. At WrestleMania 22, he interrupted a Randy Orton interview, putting SmackDown! on notice that the World Heavyweight Championship would return to him by WrestleMania 23. Batista made his official return during July 7 episode of SmackDown! immediately calling out and entering into a feud with Mark Henry. At Saturday Night's Main Event, Batista won a six-man tag match with Rey Mysterio and Bobby Lashley taking on King Booker, Finlay, and Mark Henry. Henry was legitimately injured and was ruled out of the scheduled match between the two at The Great American Bash, thus further delaying a potential feud between the two after being delayed by Batista's initial injury.|$|E
25|$|At 7:30 pm on Monday evening, October 28, 1907, {{a band of}} Seattle Socialists braved the {{pouring rain}} {{and headed for the}} city's new Pike Street Market, bustling with 1500 shoppers. SPW State Chairman John Downie went first, {{ascending}} a wooden box in an unused part of the marketplace. A cheer erupted from the crowd which encircled the speaker, and more came running, expecting fireworks. Downie <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> of a planned march to the City Council Chamber later that evening — and was promptly arrested. Next came James Lund of Redondo, Washington, who got no further before he, too, was arrested and taken away. Elmer Allison of Local Bangor, A.G.

[...] They both chatted for a few moments, then Nixon and his motorcade continued up Route 320, stopping in Swarthmore, the Springfield Shopping Center, Lawrence Park, Newtown Square, West Chester, before stopping in Paoli. Seven days later, Senator Kennedy appeared in Chester at Sixth and Penn Streets, drawing <b>the</b> largest ever <b>crowd</b> in <b>the</b> city, some 15,000 to 20,000. He continued to hammer away at the themes of America's lagging prestige abroad and lagging economy at home. [...] "I want the U.S. to meet its responsibilities at home and abroad and the U.S. to move forward", he <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds.</b> [...] "This is more of a contest between the comfortable and the concerned - those who are satisfied with things as they are and those who want to move forward." [...] Two days earlier, Kennedy had declared: [...] "I say we can't afford another recession." ...|$|R
25|$|On October 21, 1835, a mob {{of several}} {{thousand}} surrounded the building housing Boston's anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address {{a meeting of the}} Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist George Thompson was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor Theodore Lyman persuaded the women to leave the building, but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> Garrison was gone. The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a rope around his waist, and pulled him through the streets towards Boston Common, calling for tar and feathers. The mayor intervened and had Garrison arrested and rushed off to the Leverett Street Jail for his own protection.|$|E
25|$|On 22 September 2006, French Air Force jets {{were seen}} over the skies of Beirut during Hassan Nasrallah's victory speech, {{possibly}} trying {{to protect him from}} an Israeli assassination attempt. Nasrallah <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> that he had no fear in addressing the masses directly, rather than through armored glass. In September 2006, Hezbollah fighters raided an Israeli arms depot in Shomera, and made off with a large quantity of sidearms, grenades, anti-tank weapons, and LAU rockets. Five Israeli Merkava tanks, an armored bulldozer, and a number of military vehicles entered Lebanon and attempted to search the Hezbollah-controlled village of Marwahin for the arms. They were confronted by four French Army Leclerc tanks, which blocked their advance. The confrontation lasted for half an hour. According to American and German correspondents, the French retreated, while the French commander claimed that the Israelis had turned back. French commander of UNIFIL Alain Pellegrini stated that France would not intervene to disarm Hezbollah.|$|E

5000|$|The {{movement}} was spearheaded by popular Armenian figures and found support among intellectuals in Russia as well. According to journalist Thomas De Waal {{some members of}} the Russian intelligentsia, such as the dissident Andrei Sakharov expressed support for Armenians. More prominent support for the movement among the Moscow elite was interpreted by some in the public: in November 1987 L'Humanité published the personal comments made by Abel Aganbegyan, an economic adviser to Gorbachev, to Armenians living in France, in which he suggested that Nagorno-Karabakh could be ceded to Armenia. Prior to the declaration, Armenians had begun to protest and stage workers' strikes in Yerevan, demanding a unification with the enclave. This prompted Azerbaijani counter-protests in Baku.After the demonstrations in Yerevan to demand unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia began, Gorbachev met with two leaders of the Karabakh movement, Zori Balayan and Silva Kaputikyan on 26 February 1988. Gorbachev asked them for a one-month moratorium on demonstrations. When Kaputikyan returned to Armenia the same evening, she <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Armenians had triumphed" [...] although Gorbachev hadn't made any concrete promises. According to Svante Cornell, this was an attempt to pressure Moscow. On 10 March, Gorbachev stated that the borders between the republics would not change, in accordance with Article 78 of the Soviet constitution. Gorbachev also stated that several other regions in the Soviet Union were yearning for territorial changes and redrawing the boundaries in Karabakh would thus set a dangerous precedent. But the Armenians viewed the 1921 Kavburo decision with disdain and felt that in their efforts they were correcting a historical error through the principle of self-determination, a right also granted in the constitution. Azerbaijanis, on the other hand, found such calls for relinquishing their territory by the Armenians unfathomable and aligned themselves with Gorbachev's position.|$|R
