In 1810, British inventor and merchant Peter Durand, also of French origin, patented his own method, but this time in a <b>tin</b> <b>can,</b> so creating the modern-day process of canning foods. In 1812, Englishmen Bryan Donkin and John Hall purchased both patents and began producing preserves. Just a decade later, Appert's method of canning had {{made its way to}} America. <b>Tin</b> <b>can</b> production was not common until the beginning of the 20th century, partly because a hammer and chisel were needed to open cans until the invention of a can opener by an inventor named Yates in 1855.|$|E

Using <b>tin</b> <b>cans</b> of several sizes to find out the relative importance of dimensional parameters such as diameter and cylinder length, an attempt has been made to determine the average surface area per cubic foot of space occupied by randomly stacked <b>tin</b> <b>cans,</b> as the available surface area is very important for effective heat transfer.

25|$|Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a toxic {{chemical}} compound present in commercially available <b>tin</b> <b>can</b> plastic linings {{and transferred to}} canned food.

The longer food is in a can, and the warmer and more acidic it is, the more BPA leaches into it. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance. In the European Union and Canada, BPA use is banned in baby bottles.|$|E

The port features a railhead. The port has seen growing amounts of crude oil exported, with export figures rising between 1997 and 2000.

25|$|In Portugal, the {{homecoming}} {{is known as}} Recepção ao Caloiro (The Freshman's Reception). It includes numerous events and traditions born in the 19th century in the University of Coimbra. It {{is defined as a}} welcome to the new students, the freshmen (caloiros), and takes place {{at the beginning of the}} academic year in Portuguese university towns. In every classic public university of Portugal {{the homecoming}} is celebrated yearly. The events are followed in varying degrees by other less traditional or smaller institutions. A street parade of students, concerts, and sports events are always organized for the freshmen's reception. The street parade organized in several major Portuguese universities is known as Latada, and its name comes from the tradition of tying tin cans to the freshmen's legs (the word lata is <b>tin</b> <b>can</b> in Portuguese).|$|E

The out line runs {{along the top of the}} front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck above or touching the out line, on any wall, are out. The bottom line of the front wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck means that the ball is out. In this way the <b>tin</b> <b>can</b> be seen as analogous to the net in other racket sports such as tennis. The middle line of the front wall is the service line and is only relevant during serves.|$|E
25|$|Saved {{proved to}} be a major {{breakthrough}} for Oldman. Max Stafford-Clark, artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre, had seen Oldman's performance and cast him as Scopey, the lead role of Bond's The Pope's Wedding, in 1984. For his acclaimed performance, he won two of British theatre's top honours: the Time Out Fringe Award for Best Newcomer, and the Drama Theatre Award for Best Actor—the latter of which was shared with future film co-star Anthony Hopkins for his performance in Pravda. Oldman's turn in The Pope's Wedding led to a run of work with the Royal Court, and from 1984 to 1986 he appeared in Rat in the Skull (Ron Hutchinson), The Desert Air (Nicholas Wright), Cain and Abel, The Danton Affair (Pam Gems), Women Beware Women (Thomas Middleton), Real Dreams (Trevor Griffiths) and all three of Bond's The War Plays: Red Black and Ignorant, The <b>Tin</b> <b>Can</b> People and Great Peace. Oldman {{was a member of the}} Royal Shakespeare Company from 1985 to 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the {{telephone}} {{dates back to the}} string telephone or lover's telephone that has been known for centuries, comprising two diaphragms connected by a taut string or wire. Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic example is the <b>tin</b> <b>can</b> telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items. The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the air, as in the ear, and a string or wire can transmit such collected voice sounds for reproduction at a distance. One precursor {{to the development of the}} electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the University of Göttingen, in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices. Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.|$|E
