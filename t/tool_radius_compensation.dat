40|$|The {{complexity}} of components used in recent optical technologies is ever increasing. In many applications like micro-lens arrays the optically functional surfaces have a smooth and steady geometry, but have an uncontinuous transition between the surrounding surface or other lenses. That type of non-rotationally symmetric surfaces can be machined by ultra precision diamond turning assisted by a Fast Tool Servo System (FTS), which extends the turning kinematics {{by a high}} frequency tool movement. To achieve high form accuracy and optical surface quality, two compensation approaches are discussed in this paper. The form error resulting from the geometry of the diamond <b>tool's</b> <b>radius</b> shaped cutting edge is corrected by the superposition of a compensation value. The form accuracy of the work piece beside the geometrical factors is further influenced by {{the accuracy of the}} FTS and the basis machine, especially regarding the dynamics of the axes. The transfer behaviour of the FTS is improved by applying a pre-control filter with significant order. Its extraction from measurements is shown in the paper. The positioning accuracy is mainly affected by the following error and the transfer behaviour of the axis. Using a pre-control filter, the following error of the axis can be reduced by 90 %. The combination with the <b>radius</b> <b>tool</b> <b>compensation</b> results in a rapid improvement of the form accuracy. Further improvements of the dynamic behaviour of the axis are possible with the application of a model-based control strategy. The dimensioning of such a modelbased system can be facilitated by a modification of the optimisation algorithm which was used to evaluate the pre-control filter. Instead of using ideal parameters for the geometry <b>compensation</b> of the <b>radius</b> <b>tool,</b> the measured geometry could be used to enhance the precision of the compensation, further...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} an algorithm that can generate toolpaths in NURBS form for smooth, high speed and accurate machining. The initial toolpaths are obtained by <b>tool</b> <b>radius</b> <b>compensation</b> method {{which is based}} on the workpiece boundary offsetting. According to different lengths and the continuous short block (CSB) criterion, these offset linear segments can be regarded as CSBs or long straight segments. Junctions are located where the curvature value is greater than the preset curvature threshold value or where it changes abruptly, or at the two end points of any long straight segment. During machining, the NURBS fitting module first looks ahead several CSBs and converts them into parametric curves in real time. During the conversion, continuities of the position, slope or even curvature at the transition of the parametric curves and unfitted line segments can be guaranteed. Then the acceleration/deceleration feedrate-planning scheme is proposed to determine the transition feedrate at the junction between the fitted curves and unfitted long straight segments, and the corner feedrate within the fitted curve. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve machining accuracy and reduce cutting time to satisfy today’s high-speed and high-accurate machining requirements...|$|E
40|$|Tool {{positioning}} and {{tool wear}} or breakage {{is an integral}} part of the development of a micromachining center. The nature of worn tools, producing deficiencies in good surface finish and dimension control, is a major concern in machining operations. Current techniques in place for tool location depend on the encoder feedback of the CNC system, with the assumption of accurate <b>tool</b> <b>radius</b> <b>compensation.</b> Additionally, in order to maintain machining quality and to prevent damage to the work-piece, accurate monitoring or early prediction of tool condition is important. These techniques however are insufficient for micro-machining where the tool itself is usually invisible to the human eye. Because the diameter is so small, accuracy is inherently compromised. Furthermore, due to the micron scales of micro-machining, detection as well as determination of tool wear or breakage is quite challenging. This paper reports on the results of an ongoing research project to investigate and develop machine vision applications for micro machining tool location and tool wear monitoring. The determination of an optimal optical setup is reported together with some algorithms for image processing and feature classification. The optical setup utilizes a 3 mega pixel CMOS capturing device mounted on 12 X ultra zoom lens. Lighting is achieved by direct, indirect and backlighting. Initial image analysis, utilizing basic Gaussian filters and histogram equalization indicates that lighting is a critical factor in this application. Wear determination is performed by a comparison of the image of an unused tool with that of a used tool using exclusive operators. Although the results seem promising, there is need for finer enhancements on images prior to the application of classification algorithms...|$|E

This results in the requirement of tool stoppage or slowdown during a micro-end-milling operation, a deterrent to productivity and to part acceptability. A circular tool path geometry can avoid discontinuities in the tool movements leading to a more consistent and smooth material removal. However, optimal process planning for such a tool path will require detailed understanding of the chip-formation mechanism in circular end-milling. The cut geometry during end-milling along a circular tool path is often approximated {{as that of a}} linear tool path. Although this assumption works well for circular tool paths with higher <b>tool</b> path <b>radius,</b> {{this is not the case}} for lower <b>tool</b> path <b>radius</b> often used in micro-milling.
