Boards may be single-sided, with an unplated component side, or more compact double-sided boards, with components soldered on both sides. [...] Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part's mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> the ends. Leads may be soldered either manually or by a wave soldering machine.|$|E

60|$|Old John having long encroached a good {{standard}} inch, full measure, on {{the liberty}} of Joe, and having snipped off a Flemish ell {{in the matter of}} the parole, grew so despotic and so great, that his thirst for conquest knew no bounds. The more young Joe submitted, the more absolute old John became. The ell soon faded into nothing. Yards, furlongs, miles arose; and on went old John in the pleasantest manner possible, <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> an exuberance in this place, shearing away some liberty of speech or action in that, and conducting himself in his small way with as much high mightiness and majesty, as the most glorious tyrant that ever had his statue reared in the public ways, of ancient or of modern times.|$|E
6000|$|Of course, Paddy {{knew all}} about this. He had been brought up that way. [...] "Be sure, and then you'll never be sorry" [...] {{had been one of}} his mother's {{favorite}} sayings, and he had always remembered it. Indeed, it had saved him a great deal of trouble. So now he was perfectly willing to go right on working and let his hidden visitors watch him until they were sure that he meant them no harm. You see, he himself felt quite sure that none of them was big enough to do him any harm. Little Joe Otter was the only one he had any doubts about, and he felt quite sure that Little Joe wouldn't try to pick a quarrel. So he kept right on cutting trees, <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> the branches, and hauling the trunks down to the dam he was building. Some of them he floated down the Laughing Brook. This was easier.|$|E

About a foot from the butt end I flatten off a place for the trap and tie it in place with a bit of string and loop the chain around the trunk of the tree. Then I make a split in the end of the butt and in this fasten the bait. Mr. Marten runs up the tree to get the bait, steps in the trap and falls off and hangs there. He can't twist a foot off or pull free in any way. Once he steps in the trap he's a goner.|$|E

60|$|Military commanders {{generally}} {{throw some}} sort of a bridge across a stream of water lying in their way, if it is too deep to be easily forded, unless, indeed, it is so wide and rapid as to make the construction of the bridge difficult or impracticable. In this latter case they cross as well as they can by means of boats and rafts, and by swimming. The Po, though not a very large stream at this point, was too deep to be forded, and Scipio accordingly built a bridge. The soldiers cut down the trees which grew in the forests along the banks, and after <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> the tops and branches, they rolled the trunks into the water. They placed these trunks side by side, with others, laid transversely and pinned down, upon the top. Thus they formed rafts, which they placed in a line across the stream, securing them well {{to each other and to}} the banks. This made the foundation for the bridge, and after this foundation was covered with other materials, so as to make the upper surface a convenient roadway, the army were conducted across it, and then a small detachment of soldiers were stationed at each extremity of it as a guard.|$|E
50|$|One {{school of}} thought is to make as many {{connections}} as possible without adding extra wire. This is done by bending the existing leads on resistors, capacitors, etc. into position, <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> extra length, and soldering the lead to make the required electrical connection. Another {{school of thought}} refuses to bend the excessive leads of components and use them for wiring, {{on the ground that}} this makes removing a component later hard or impossible, e.g. when a repair is needed.|$|E

The bulb is then sliced cleanly from top to bottom several times, creating 8 or 16 segments, {{depending on the size of}} the bulb.

In February 1862, he acquired a sample of Confederate money and quickly started producing his own counterfeits. His first printing consisted of 3,000 five-dollar notes, each stamped at the bottom with the words, [...] "Fac-simile Confederate Note - Sold wholesale and retail by S.C. Upham 403 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia." [...] He sold his first batch for a penny per copy.

50|$|Few {{essential}} {{tools are}} needed in carpet weaving: Knives are used to cut the yarn after the knot is made, a heavy instrument like a comb for beating in the wefts, {{and a pair of}} scissors for <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> the ends of the yarn after each row of knots is finished. From region to region, they vary in size and design, and in some areas are supplemented by other tools. The weavers of Tabriz used a combined blade and hook. The hook projects {{from the end of the}} blade, and is used for knotting, instead of knotting with the fingers. Comb-beaters are passed through the warp strings to beat in the wefts. When the rug is completed, the pile is often shorn with special knives to obtain an even surface.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the evenings}} that Surinder and Taani spend at the movies, Surinder realises {{it is the}} strong and {{masculine}} images of men that Taani admires, and later on, he asks his long-time best friend, Balwinder [...] "Bobby" [...] Khosla (Vinay Pathak), a hair-salon owner, for grooming advice that could help him win her love. Bobby gives him a complete makeover, which includes <b>trimming</b> <b>off</b> his mustache (an accidental gag, due to the power cutting off), changing his hairstyle (putting on lots of gel and shaping it to be spiky), and fitting him out in a funky Western-style clothing, which he feels is very tight, from the front and the back, including aviator-style shades with oversize pastel lenses. Surinder is thus transformed into [...] "Raj", a name he borrows from the hero of a movie that Taani had admired. After having that makeover change done by [...] "Bobby", Surinder goes to Taani's dancing competition venue to see her dance, without her recognising him, but he then gets pulled into the dance recital by an instructor. At {{the end of that}} dance class, all of the participants were put into groups of two by random numbers given by the staff, and somehow, both Surinder and Taani had the number '21'. By chance, or, as Surinder puts it that it was not chance but it was by the divine choice of God and so he becomes Taani's partner in the competition. Despite Raj's initial over-the-top attempts to emulate the [...] "cool" [...] images given by heroes, in movies, after the first attempt of impressing Taani in that way, Taani reacts badly, telling 'Raj' to never flirt with her. He and Taani become friends as they work together on their dance routine. Surinder feels encouraged when Taani does not want to tie a rakhi on Raj's wrist during the festival of Raksha Bandhan (doing so would indicate that she thought of him only as a brother). Soon Raj is unable to dance and thus decides to quit the dance competition during the rehearsals and thus is encouraged by Taani. Finally they both are selected for the finals and decide to do a competition of Golgappa (an Indian snack) it is decided that whoever wins this competition can ask for any thing from the other. Raj wins the competition and doesn't ask for anything then. The next day, Raj then decides to invite her to his birthday, claiming the prize for beating her in an eating competition. He tells Taani of how he always spends his birthday alone. So they go on a day of visiting Punjab's wonderful cultures, thus, after some time, Raj declares his love for her.|$|E
