50|$|When font {{substitution}} {{is being}} used to find a replacement for an unavailable character, it can lead to inconsistent visual appearance as part of a word or sentence is displayed in one font and another part is displayed in the substituted font.

Nevertheless, font substitution may be critical to scripts not well supported by a large font inventory having the required Unicode range.|$|R

Further we assume that the alternative employment for both types of workers is such that individual productivity differences do not matter—think of a conveyor belt.

[...] He did not propose to resolve those differences by imposing unity: [...] "Unity of teaching and practice is certainly necessary in the Church, {{but this does not}} preclude various ways of interpreting some aspects of that teaching or drawing certain consequences from it.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the second round}} of ResPubliQA, a Question Answering (QA) evaluation task over European legislation, a LAB of CLEF 2010. Two tasks have been proposed this year: Paragraph Selection (PS) and Answer Selection (AS). The PS task consisted of extracting a relevant paragraph of text that satisfies completely the information need expressed by a natural language question. In the AS task, the exercise was to demarcate the shorter string of text corresponding to the exact answer supported by <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>paragraph.</b> The general aims of this exercise are (i) to move towards a domain of potential users; (ii) to propose a setting which allows the direct comparison of performance across languages; (iii) to allow QA technologies to be evaluated against IR approaches; (iv) to promote validation technologies {{to reduce the amount of}} incorrect answers by leaving some questions unanswered. These goals are achieved through the use of parallel aligned document collections (JRC-Acquis and EUROPARL) and the possibility to return two different types of answers, either passages or exact strings. The paper {{describes the}} task in more detail, presenting the different types of questions, the methodology for the creation of the test sets and the evaluation measure, and analyzing the results obtained by systems and the more successful approaches. Thirteen groups participated in both PS and AS tasks submitting 49 runs in total...|$|E
40|$|Professor Dally {{was getting}} {{requests}} on tips for reading papers, {{so he went}} over his method in class: 1. Before diving in, think about what your goals are, and {{what you want to}} get out of the paper. You need to approach the reading with an aim to extract info; you may want to target specific areas of the paper in case you are looking for something particular. Keeping these objectives in hand will help you while reading. 2. Read the abstract first. This should be an advertisement for the paper. 3. Read the conclusions. Figure out what the authors accomplished, so you know what their goals were. 4. Find the “paper overview ” section in the introduction and read it if you need to. If you don’t know about a certain topic, you may find background material here. 5. Make a quick first pass through the paper, so you understand their presentation of the topics. Figure out how the equations fit into the discussion, but don’t try to understand the math. On the second pass, read the paper more carefully. 6. Highlight important parts of a paragraph so you don’t have to reread <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>paragraph</b> each time. This helps in class discussions as well. 7. Write down an outline as you go- this will help you remember what you have read. You can refer back to this outline as you go through the paper. 8. Look up key references if you are looking for a particular topic. This paper may not have what you are looking for, but it may build on top of a topic you need to research. In the library, you can find guides that list forward references for each paper, which may also be useful in your quest...|$|E

50|$|Article {{spinning}} is {{a specific}} writing technique used in search engine optimization (SEO) and in other applications. Website authors may use article spinning on their own sites to reduce the similarity ratio of rather redundant pages or pages with thin content.

This process can be completely automated or written manually.|$|R
50|$|As {{regards the}} {{relation}} of the two recensions, it may be said that the longer form contains <b>entire</b> <b>paragraphs</b> which are not found in the shorter, while the divergent arrangement of the material often modifies the meaning essentially.

Then, without starting a new paragraph, the review starts in the standard story text format. In this case, the designer could highlight the movie title and select the appropriate character style to apply the formatting only to the title. The rest of the paragraph can then be styled independently.|$|R

Perhaps no novel of our times was worst printed than the first edition of this work.

Logic-based {{controlled}} natural languages usually {{provide some}} facility for compositional representation, minimally including sentence level coordination and sometimes subordination. Although these compositional forms suffice for representing short passages, {{they can become}} unwieldy for expressing <b>entire</b> <b>paragraphs</b> and documents. This paper describes an approach to representing larger composite texts in a controlled natural language. This approach, called discourse-based reasoning, integrates rhetorical structure theory with argumentation theory to define a model for defining composite structures and argument strategies in an ontological representation. Rhetorical structures are used to represent controlled texts, and argument strategies are defined for reasoning about interactions between structures. This provides the basis for expressing, summarizing, and interacting with explanatory and argumentative discourse. This would expand the scope of problems that may be addressed using controlled natural languages...|$|R

He awakens from dreams of witches (see [...] Richard Dorson's 1956 Negro Folktales in Michigan), and from a nickel left by the boys becomes a storyteller of regional fame, able to command pay for his tales, and in the concluding phrase, all but unfit to be a servant.|$|R

More than just being a mere summary, however, a topic sentence often provides a claim or an insight directly or indirectly related to the thesis. It adds cohesion to a paper and helps organize ideas both within the paragraph and the whole body of work at large. As the topic sentence encapsulates the idea of the paragraph, serving as a sub-thesis, it remains general enough to cover the support given in the body paragraph while being more direct than the thesis of the paper.|$|R
