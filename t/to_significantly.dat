In general, this event results in increased sea surface temperatures near Australia.

Situated over land, the system initially embedded within a disorganised trough and to intensify as it slowly tracked eastward.

5|$|As {{early as}} the 18th century, some {{scientists}} had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, Immanuel Kant hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion. In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough <b>to</b> <b>significantly</b> alter a comet's orbit, and {{he argued that the}} non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.|$|E

The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S.

Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength {{about half an hour}} prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina.

Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E

This study examined the relationship of the dimensions of health conception to the dimensions of health-promoting lifestyle, and evaluated which of two alternate structures best modeled the underlying dimensions of health conception, and their relationship to the dimensions of health-promoting lifestyle among older adults. Data gathered for the Older Adult Project in the Health Promotion Research Program at Northern Illinois University were subjected to secondary analysis. The sample was composed of 364 predominantly white, middle-class residents of Northern Illinois, aged 55 to 91. These subjects' scores on the six subscales of the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile and the four subscales of the Laffrey Health Conception Scale were analyzed using multiple regression analyses and covariance structure modeling (LISREL) techniques. The eudaimonistic, clinical, and adaptive health conception dimensions were found <b>to</b> contribute <b>significantly</b> <b>to</b> the explained variance in health-promoting lifestyle. The eudaimonistic health conception dimensions was found <b>to</b> contribute <b>significantly</b> <b>to</b> the explained variance in the self-actualization dimension of health-promoting lifestyle. The eudaimonistic and clinical dimensions of health conception were found <b>to</b> contribute <b>significantly</b> <b>to</b> the explained variance in the health responsibility dimension of health-promoting lifestyle. The adaptive and clinical health conception dimensions were found <b>to</b> contribute <b>significantly</b> <b>to</b> the explained variance in the exercise, nutrition, and stress management dimensions of health-promoting lifestyle. The eudaimonistic and role performance dimensions of health conception were found <b>to</b> contribute <b>significantly</b> <b>to</b> the explained variance in the interpersonal support dimension of health-promoting lifestyle. A comparison of two models of the structure of health conception as related to health-promoting lifestyle validated two latent variables underlying the dimensions of health conception.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to explore the differences of consumer characteristics and expenditures on local food between large scale stores and direct sale stores selling local food and to find some influencing factors on the expenditure on local food from both consumer groups. First, the levels of perceived attributes of local food were high for both consumer groups but were much higher for consumers from direct sale stores of local food. For food consumption patterns, consumers from direct sale stores presented higher levels than large scale stores and were found <b>to</b> be <b>significantly</b> different. Food choice motives were found <b>to</b> be <b>significantly</b> different in both groups. In addition, for the consumer characteristics, age and living with children under age 18 were found <b>to</b> be <b>significantly</b> different between both groups, while sex, education and household income were not.
