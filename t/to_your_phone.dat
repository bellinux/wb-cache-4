As you progress through the chapters in the game, you will meet new characters, unlock new areas, get more in-game currency etc. You go around the Barnyard and either explore the area(s) the game has to offer or follow the story and complete the missions by going to the barn animal that sent you a text <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>phone.</b> You can find these characters by looking for, and following the quickest path to, the '!' on the map. As you continue through the chapters, the game will continue increasing in variety as well. There are a lot of in-game movie references as well including dialogue from the characters and certain in-game objects. As you get to the mid-part of the game, however, you lose the same character, Ben, that is lost in the movie. As you {{get to the end of}} the game, specifically Chapter 8, things only get worse as the leader of the Barnyard, Otis, runs off and you are put in charge. However, the tides suddenly turn as you, the other animals, and Otis take one finale stand against the final boss. Note that depending on the chapter you're in, there will be either more or less missions than the previous chapter(s).|$|E

40|$|Use {{of mobile}} devices {{may have a}} {{negative}} effect on face-to-face interaction in social situations. This can happen when ignoring other people in a social situation by attending <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> instead. This thesis explores what kind of mobile technology usage could improve human-to-human interaction in social situations. In a focus group study (n= 14), three behavioral and three technological solutions were evaluated as use cases. The participants favored a solution where people would alter their behavior so that they would just ignore their mobile devices in social situations. Two technological solutions where mobile devices would support human-to-human interaction or automatically restrict usage in social situations were considered to be useful to some extent. Using mobile technology only as a social tool in social situations was considered a potential behavioral solution, but a solution of not having a mobile device with you was not. The least favored was a technological solution where mobile devices would be explicit and proactive participants of social interaction. Based on the results, it is plausible that mobile technology could be improved, by support or by restrictions, to go better with social situations. People may approve some level of automation in social situations, but there also are certain dangers for designers to be careful about. If the intentio...|$|E
40|$|Purpose â€“ The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{synthesized}} overview of empirical work carried out in the MultiMemoHome Project in the area of designing multimodal reminders for home care. The paper aims to present an overview of multimodal interaction techniques and how they can be used to deliver messages to the user in a way that is more appropriate to the user's needs, the devices available, and the physical and social environment that the person is in when they receive a message. Design/methodology/approach â€“ The paper argues that electronic reminders or notifications delivered in the home (such as appointments or when to take medication <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>phone,</b> computer or TV) should be available in multiple sensory modalities (visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory) in order to increase their usability and acceptability and make them accessible to a wider range of users. This paper supports these arguments by presenting an overview of a series of empirical studies that have been carried out (and reported elsewhere) on the design and evaluation of multimodal reminders for the home. Findings â€“ The paper provides some guidelines and lessons learned on how to design personalisable multimodal reminder systems for the home. Originality/value â€“ This paper presents a synthesized overview of a body of existing research on multimodal reminder design for the home. Its contribution is in the argument and presentation of empirical findings that support these arguments. A set of guidelines emerging from the body of work is also presented. </p...|$|E
