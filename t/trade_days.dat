30|$|For the Tenth General Election (29 th November 1999), it {{significantly}} {{corresponds to}} an extra 0.59 and 0.54 % daily returns compared to ordinary <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> for 30 and 60 <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> respectively {{after the election}} date. A different scenario is observed for the Eleventh General Election (21 st March 2004), where a positive effect (2.14 %) {{is found in the}} 30 trading day-period before the election. However, the index reversed its upward trend after the election date such that when compared to ordinary <b>trading</b> <b>days,</b> the daily returns were reduced by 0.31, 0.27 and 0.25 % during the first 30, 60 and 90 <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> respectively after the event. It is worth-mentioning that the effect of the Eleventh General Election could last up to 90 <b>trading</b> <b>days,</b> while it only lasted up to 60 trading after the earlier two events. In sharp contrast, the duration of effect for the following two general elections was shortened to 15 <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> only. Specifically, the Twelfth General Election (8 th March 2008) exhibited a significant negative before-election-effect, while the Thirteen General Election (5 th May 2013) showed a positive after-election-effect. According to Fama’s (1965) efficient market hypothesis, this finding may signify that the Bursa Malaysia is more information efficient for the last two general elections.|$|R
