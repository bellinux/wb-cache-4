40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is to present a theory for <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> {{radiation}} <b>force</b> produced by dual-frequency ultrasound beams in lossless and non-dispersive fluids. A formula for <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> exerted on a three-dimensional object by a dual-frequency beam is obtained stemming from the fluid dynamics equations. Dependence of <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> to nonlinear effects of the medium is analyzed. The developed theory is applied to calculate <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> exerted on solid elastic (brass and stainless steel) spheres by a low-amplitude dual-frequency plane wave. <b>The</b> <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> is calculated by solving the dual-frequency plane wave scattering problem for solid elastic spheres. Results show that <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> on <b>the</b> analized spheres presents fluctuations similar to those present in the static radiation force. Furthermore, analysis of the static and <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>forces</b> on <b>the</b> stainless steel sphere shows that they have approximately the same magnitude.

This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} the in-process surface roughness prediction in the CNC turning process of the plain carbon steel with the coated carbide tool by utilizing <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio. <b>The</b> <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>forces</b> are measured to analyze the relation between the surface roughness and the cutting conditions. The proposed surface roughness model is developed based on the experimentally obtained results by employing the exponential function with six factors of the cutting speed, the feed rate, the tool nose radius, the depth of cut, the rake angle, and <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio. <b>The</b> <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio can be calculated and obtained by taking the ratio of the corresponding time records of the area of <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> feed <b>force</b> to that of <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> main <b>force.</b> <b>The</b> relation between <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio and the surface roughness can be proved by the obtained frequency of them in frequency domain which are the same frequency.

40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the relation between the surface roughness and <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio during the in-process cutting in CNC turning process. The proposed surface roughness model is developed based on the experimentally obtained results by employing the exponential function with five factors of the cutting speed, the feed rate, the tool nose radius, the depth of cut, and <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio. <b>The</b> <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio is proposed to predict the surface roughness during the cutting, which can be calculated and obtained by taking the ratio of the corresponding time records of the area of thedynamic feed force to that of <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> main <b>force.</b> <b>The</b> in-process relation between <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio and surface roughness can be proved by the frequency of <b>the</b> <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> which corresponds to the surface roughnessfrequency.

50|$|In 1835 {{a number}} of {{prominent}} citizens of Arbroath commissioned a review of possible routes for a railway, examining the waggonway proposal; technology had now proceeded {{to the point where}} a railway was the natural transport medium. The Edinburgh firm of railway engineers Grainger and Miller had been commissioned to carry out the review, and they proposed a route rather different to Stevenson's; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway had opened in 1832, and involved street running in Dundee itself. This was now seen as undesirable, and the final access to Arbroath Harbour was changed to be on dedicated land. The estimated cost of construction was £36,871, and the scheme was launched to the public at a meeting of 7 August 1835; £40,000 was subscribed within a month.

5000|$|The basic {{recurring}} theme in Hindu mythology {{is the creation}} of the world by the self-sacrifice of God—"sacrifice" [...] in the original sense of [...] "making sacred"—whereby God becomes the world which, in the end, becomes again God. This creative activity of the Divine is called lila, the play of God, and the world is seen as the stage of the divine play. Like most of Hindu mythology, the myth of lila has a strong magical flavour. Brahman is the great magician who transforms himself into the world and then performs this feat with his [...] "magic creative power", which is the original meaning of maya in the Rig Veda. The word maya—one of the most important terms in Indian philosophy—has changed its meaning over the centuries. From the might, or power, of the divine actor and magician, it came to signify the psychological state of anybody under the spell of the magic play. As long as we confuse the myriad forms of the divine lila with reality, without perceiving the unity of Brahman underlying all these forms, we are under the spell of maya. (...) In the Hindu view of nature, then, all forms are relative, fluid and ever-changing maya, conjured up by the great magician of the divine play. The world of maya changes continuously, because the divine lila is a rhythmic, dynamic play. <b>The</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>force</b> of the play is karma, an important concept of Indian thought. Karma means [...] "action". It is the active principle of the play, the total universe in action, where everything is dynamically connected with everything else. In the words of the Gita Karma is the force of creation, wherefrom all things have their life. Fritjof Capra ...|$|E
