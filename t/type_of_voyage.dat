50|$|The {{traditional}} fisherman always obeyed {{the known}} {{rules of the}} use of the tides, the wind rules, the currents and the seasonal effects on fishing. Due to these factors the incursions on the sea vary much in relation to the duration of the voyage, the course followed and the type of fish netted. A common voyage used to last three days to a week (sometimes more, according to old fishermen) on the high seas, up to 120 km from the coast. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>voyage</b> is getting rarer as the jangada sailer now rarely sails for more than three days and will sail no farther than 50 km out from the coast. At the same time groups of jangadas voyaging together are getting rarer; the most common voyage now is a single fishing crew on a single jangada.|$|E

50|$|The tramp ship is a {{contract}} carrier. Unlike a liner, often called a common carrier, {{which has a}} fixed schedule and a published tariff, the ideal tramp can carry anything to anywhere, and freight rates are influenced by supply and demand.

There are three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> charters, <b>voyage,</b> time and demise.|$|R
5000|$|Voyage charter: The {{voyage charter}} {{is the most}} common charter in tramp shipping. [...] The owner of the tramp is obligated to provide a {{seaworthy}} ship while the charterer is obligated to provide a full load of cargo. [...] This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> charter is the most lucrative, but can be the riskiest due to lack of new charterers. During a voyage charter a part or all of a vessel is leased to the charterer for a voyage to a port or a set of different ports. There are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>voyage</b> charter - net form and gross form. [...] Under the net form, the cargo a tramp ship carries is loaded, discharged, and trimmed at the charterer's expense. Under the gross form the expense of cargo loading, discharging and trimming is on the owner. The charterer is only responsible to provide the cargo at a specified port and to accept it at the destination port. Time becomes an issue in the voyage charter if the tramp ship is late in her schedule or loading or discharging are delayed. If a tramp ship is delayed the charterer pays demurrage, which is a penalty, to the ship owner. The number of days a tramp ship is chartered for is called lay days.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the fantastic Voyage in French Literature from 1662 to 1789, that is to say a number of works of prose-fiction in which can clearly be {{recognised}} a pattern <b>of</b> <b>voyage</b> and discovery, but in which the author (in spite of a somotimes ambiguous attitude) encourages the reader's disbelief in the characters and the adventures recounted. This study therefore aims at being complementary to those of Geoffrey Atkinson on the Extraordinary Voyage. The Fantastic Voyage was felt as an entity by contemporaries, in spite of a certain confusion of issues in the classification of fiction. Its sources are numerous, for it is one <b>of</b> the earliest <b>types</b> <b>of</b> fiction; but the genre underwent during the seventeenth century a definite twist which increased its dependence on contemporary philosophy, either of a rationalistic or <b>of</b> an occultist <b>type.</b> Nevertheless, the existing pattern could also be applied to literary criticism (of an author or a genre) to the satire of manners, or to the spreading of revolutionary ideas; its study therefore has a sociological as well as a literary interest. After an examination <b>of</b> the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> fantastic <b>Voyages</b> (determined either by the setting or by the philosophical attitude of the author), there is a summary of the salient features of the genre. Finally, there is a bibliography of the works studied within the period considered, which helps one to appreciate the popularity <b>of</b> this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> fiction. <p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{transport}} of aquatic organisms {{from one place}} to another by ship’s ballast water has created substantial environmental impact on discharging areas. In order to avoid that, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) recommends treating the ballast water by different methods. The paper presents four methods of managing ballast water, accepted by the Organization: treating by filtration and irradiation with ultraviolet light, treating by de-oxygenation, treating with biocide and treating by heating. The comparative analysis of the treating technologies allows the ship-owner to choose such equipment by analyzing the advantages and the disadvantages. Considering that not only the quality parameters are important but also the cost, the study is completed by a mathematical model for calculation of unit cost for treating ballast water onboard. The purpose of this study is to develop an instrument for selecting the optimum method of ballast water treatment suitable for each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> vessel or <b>voyage,</b> so the ship-owners would be able to choose a treatment method comparing the costs, based on the specific requirements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} are {{presented}} the formulations {{of the fundamental}} maritime transportation problems and then is studied the case when restrictions are inclusions. In classical mathematical programming problems, in general, and in maritime transportation problems, in particular, we admit that we know exactly the coefficients which interfere in the problem. This assumption is not satisfied in most real problems because: the coefficients of the problem are submitted to measurement errors; the coefficients are not known exactly, but we known only that they belong to some convex sets. Next, we will study the maritime transportation problem, in general, {{and then we will}} study the case when restrictions are inclusions. In economical analysis <b>of</b> a <b>voyage</b> <b>of</b> a vessel Q, we have in view the following criterions: the reduction <b>of</b> <b>voyage</b> duration, the reduction of fuel consumption and avoidance exposing the vessel and equipments to excessive fraying or damages. In maritime transportation problem there is the following axiom: when the economical criterion is contradictory to vessel safety criterion, in choosing the route is priority the safety criterion. This axiom is called the navigation principle. Because the unit costs (per ton of transported merchandise) depends on: l- the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> merchandise; the distance and duration <b>of</b> <b>voyage</b> between the loading ports " "i and the unloading ports " "j; the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> the vessel " "k, then they represent a quantity lijkc characterized by 4 indices. Therefore, the classical maritime transportation problem is the following: Let determine the merchandise quantities lijkx (<b>of</b> <b>type</b> l) transported on the route. i j with the vessel <b>of</b> <b>type</b> k such that the sum 1 1 1 1 q pm n lijk lijk l i j k c x to be minimal...|$|R
