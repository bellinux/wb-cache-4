5|$|In 1930, the {{congregation}} became divided over {{the need for}} the Jewish community <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> shochet to ritually slaughter animals for kosher meat, and over whether the synagogue should hire a Reform or Conservative rabbi. More traditional members broke away to form the Beth El Congregation, affiliated with Conservative Judaism.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{worked for}} the Rogers firm for three years, then left in 1862 {{to start his own}} practice. In January 1863, he was {{appointed}} assistant district attorney of Erie County. With the American Civil War raging, Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863, requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> substitute. Cleveland chose the latter course, paying $150 to George Benninsky, a thirty-two-year-old Polish immigrant, to serve in his place.|$|E
5|$|In May 1993, {{the band}} {{heard that a}} record {{executive}} from Creation Records would be scouting for talent at King Tut's in Glasgow. Together, they found the money <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> van and make the six-hour journey. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club because no one notified the venue that Oasis had {{been added to the}} bill. The band eventually secured the opening slot and played a four-song set that impressed Creation founder Alan McGee.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, the {{employees}} {{from the office}} prepare for Phyllis Lapin's (Phyllis Smith) wedding. Michael Scott (Steve Carell), acting under advice from Todd Packer (David Koechner), instructs Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> stripper {{for the men and}} delegates Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to hire one for the women. While Dwight hires a stripper, Jim ends up hiring a Ben Franklin impersonator (Andy Daly) instead.|$|E
5|$|Shatner had {{presented}} his idea to studio head Frank Mancuso while filming The Voyage Home. Mancuso liked Shatner's idea and agreed <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> writer {{to draft a}} film treatment. Shatner wanted novelist Eric Van Lustbader, but negotiations between Lustbader and Paramount failed over the author's requested $1million salary. Shatner dictated the story himself {{and gave it to}} Paramount's production president Ned Tanen for input.|$|E
5|$|The Red Star Line changed Kroonland from American to Belgian {{registry}} on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason {{given for}} the change was to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the Belgian flag the next day. In May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, refused to sign on for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red Star <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> replacement crew.|$|E

5|$|U.S. President Abraham Lincoln {{diverted}} several regiments of militia {{and volunteer}} troops after the Battle of Gettysburg {{to control the}} city. The rioters were overwhelmingly working-class men, mostly Irish or of Irish descent, who feared free black people competing for work and resented that wealthier men, who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $9,157 in 2017) commutation fee <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> substitute, were spared from the draft.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E
5|$|Amato (Bruce Willis) is an {{international}} arms dealer who the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been tracking, as they believe Amato is planning the sale of FIM-92 Stinger missiles stolen from a military arms depot. The FBI agrees to allow Metro-Dade to conduct the surveillance as its equipment was in place first. Crockett and Tubbs watch Amato's abusive relationship with his wife Rita (Katherine Borowitz). When Rita attempts <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> hitman to kill Amato, Crockett intercepts the call and meets with her, arranging her help in their case in return for her safety. She explains that she has tried to leave Amato before, but he hired thugs to rape her divorce lawyer's wife to scare her into place.|$|E

5|$|In 1875 no one {{living outside}} {{of two or}} three back streets of Lynn had heard of Christian Science. Now, the very name is a catch phrase. In those early days the leader and teacher paid out half of her ten dollars a week <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> hall, {{patching}} out the rest of her living with precarious fees as an instructor in mental healing; now, {{she is one of the}} richest women in the United States. She is more than that—she is the most powerful American woman.|$|E
5|$|Mottola {{had assumed}} the top {{position}} at Sony, the parent label of Columbia, and began taking the company through {{various stages of}} change. One he felt was {{very important for the}} label's success was to discover a young and very talented female vocalist, to rival Whitney Houston from Arista Records, or a pop star to match Madonna, who was signed to Sire Records at the time. He felt that Carey represented both. Mottola's confidence in Carey led him <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey's demo, as well as to create new material. Among them were Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|New York decided <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> {{general manager}} {{for the first time}} in {{franchise}} history following the 1978 season. The search grew contentious and fractured the relationship between owners Wellington and Tim Mara. Finally, the Maras asked NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to step in with a recommendation. Rozelle recommended George Young, who worked in personnel for the Miami Dolphins and had been an assistant coach for the Baltimore Colts. Young was hired, but the rift between the Maras lasted for several years.|$|E

5|$|Slowed by knee injuries, Motley {{left the}} Browns after the 1953 season. He {{attempted}} a comeback in 1955 as a linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers but was released {{before the end}} of the year. He then pursued a coaching career, but was turned away by the Browns and other teams he approached. He attributed his trouble finding a job in football to racial discrimination, questioning whether teams were ready <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> black coach. Motley was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pilot}} was set in and around Boston, {{production}} was set in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The episode cost $10 million to produce, {{making it one of}} the most expensive pilots in television history. Following the pilot's filming, production for the series moved to New York. The producers were forced <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> new cow for the remainder of the season because they were not allowed to travel the original cow from Canada to New York. Production team members noted that they were prepared to paint new cows if viewers noted the differences in spots.|$|E
5|$|After {{her husband}} Scott (William Schallert), the marshal of Oracle, Texas, is killed by two assailants, his widow Rose (Beverly Garland) is named {{temporary}} marshal. That night, Rose asks Erica Page (Allison Hayes) to close her saloon at 3 AM {{in accordance with}} town regulations, but Erica insists her saloon is open for business 24 hours. The women fight, but eventually Erica, who loses the fight, closes for the night. After Rose exits, Erica tells lackey Jake (Jonathan Haze) <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> killer, which he does, finding a man named Cane Miro (John Ireland). As Cane enters town, Rose shoots at him, mistaking him for a man she has been searching out. She apologizes. Cane tells Rose that {{he has come to}} Oracle to see town mayor Gideon Polk (Martin Kingsley).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{identify}} two situations {{that can lead}} <b>a</b> firm <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>an</b> executive who supports a corporate culture that differs from the firm's current culture. In the first case, there is similarity between the firm's culture {{and that of the}} candidate and in the second case, executives who support the firm's culture constitute a minority of available candidates. In both cases the firm prefers <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>an</b> available candidate, rather than risk a prolonged vacancy. We show how these scenarios can lead to the eradication of unique cultures and to the perpetuation of more common cultures...|$|R

5|$|Asia League {{was created}} {{primarily}} {{for the development of}} hockey in Asia. The league allows teams <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the participating countries to increase their skills and benefit from having some more experienced players on their teams. China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.|$|E
5|$|B'nai Israel was {{the only}} Jewish {{congregation}} in Memphis, and from {{the time it was}} established members were split between traditionalists and reformers. When remodeling their new building, the congregation voted eighteen to fourteen to maintain traditional separate seating for men and women. By 1858, with enough funds <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> full-time spiritual leader, they consulted Rabbi Isaac Leeser, the leader of America's Orthodox Jewish community, but were also in contact with Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, the leader of America's fledgling Reform movement, who had dedicated B'nai Israel's sanctuary earlier that year. The members had advertised for their first spiritual leader in Wise's newspaper, The Israelite (along with other English-language Jewish newspapers) {{at the same time they}} advertised for a kosher butcher. Leeser recommended Jacob J. Peres, an Orthodox rabbi.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he could not afford <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi {{asked one of the}} company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E
