Hot temperatures have been implicated as a factor in a number of studies. One study completed {{in the midst of the}} civil rights movement found that riots were more likely on hotter days than cooler ones (Carlsmith & Anderson 1979). Students were found to be more aggressive and irritable after taking a test in a hot classroom (Anderson et al. 1996, Rule, et al. 1987). Drivers in cars without air conditioning were also found to be more likely <b>to</b> <b>honk</b> their horns (Kenrick & MacFarlane 1986), which is used as a measure of aggression and has shown links to other factors such as generic symbols of aggression or the visibility of other drivers.|$|E

40|$|Aging can impair {{executive}} {{control and}} emotion regulation, affecting driver decision-making and behavior, especially under stress. We used an interactive driving simulator to investigate {{ability to make}} safe left-turns across oncoming traffic under pressure in 13 older (3 ̆e 65 years old) and 16 middle-aged (35 - 56 years old) drivers. Drivers made left-turns at an uncontrolled intersection with moderately heavy oncoming traffic. Gaps between oncoming vehicles varied and increased gradually from 2 s to 10 s. Drivers made two left-turns with a vehicle honking aggressively behind (pressure condition), and two left-turns without the honking vehicle (control condition). Results showed that middle-aged drivers made more cautious turning decisions under pressure (by waiting for larger and safer gaps, p 3 ̆c. 001), but older drivers did not. Further, older driver turning paths deviated under pressure compared to the control condition (p 3 ̆c. 05), but the middle-aged group did not. Moreover, across all subjects, better executive function was significantly correlated with larger increases of accepted gap size from control <b>to</b> <b>honking</b> (p 3 ̆c. 01). The findings suggest that older drivers are more sensitive to traffic challenges from environmental pressure and that neural models of older driver performance and safety must factor in age-related changes in executive control and emotion processing...|$|R

Its repertoire is a mix of Balkan and Balkan-inspired songs, and modern pop and R&B rearranged for brass, usually by the members themselves.

5000|$|The film is {{the story}} of two conmen, Ramesh (I. S. Johar) and Mahesh (Mehmood), whose only life {{purposes}} are to make the maximum money by cheating and theft. They land {{in the hands of a}} high profile Portuguese dictator (Kamal Kapoor) who wants to blow up India with the formula of an atomic bomb, Nuclear weapon, developed by a scientist of Hong Kong, who is killed along with his daughter by high treason thieves in the hope of securing the formula, which however the scientist has already secured in a safe deposit locker in the Bank of Hong Kong. Coincidentally the scientist’s daughter is a look alike, of a girl called Ms. Sonia / Usha Roy (Sonia Sahni), who the dictator wants to act like the deceased patriotic daughter, go to the bank taking her identity and take out the formula, to be later secured by him, and misused against India. For this he makes Mr. Pran (Pran), his CID officer to be close to Sonia as her engaged partner, after she wins the Beauty contest of Miss Bombay. Simultaneously he makes another of his cronies, Ramayan Tiwari, to pursue Ramesh and Mahesh, that they should also become the love interests of Sonia, so that she could be brought to Hong Kong on some pretext or the other.The story takes a turn when Mahesh really falls in love with Sonia, while posing as a blind man, out to win her sympathies, but not before she realizes the truth and is totally hurt, that he tried to cheat her as a blind man. Repentant Ramesh and Mahesh now becoming totally patriotic, decide to go <b>to</b> <b>Honk</b> Kong with Sonia and catch the culprits who want to inflict such drastic harm to India.

A Calgary protest attracted 100 protesters including the Raging Grannies, while 60 protestors in Edmonton shouted slogans and sang O Canada. In northern Canada, a handful protested in the territorial capitals of Iqaluit and Yellowknife. The provincial capital of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, drew a protest of 60 at Province House. Windsor's protest drew {{a couple of dozen}} people. Downtown Nanaimo had a small and passionate crowd demanding a public inquiry. In Halifax, 80 people protested and were joined by an NDP MP, and in Victoria hundreds demanded accountability. Peterborough, the riding of Dean Del Mastro, the Conservative MP responsible for responding to the robocall scandal also had around 100 protesters. In Regina's Victoria Park, protestors blindfolded a statue of Sir John A. Macdonald. North Bay residents held a protest at their MP's office, while twenty people in Kelowna held a two-hour protest and asked drivers <b>to</b> <b>honk</b> their horns. Kamloops had ten residents protest. In Montreal, protesters, some of whom held up placards, held a demonstration and demanded a full public inquiry. Protests also took place in Winnipeg with more than 300 people in attendance including current and former NDP and Liberal MPs. In the riding where much of the robocall scandal began, Guelph, a small rally was held, as a few dozen protested in Kitchener.Simultaneously, protests were held in St. John's, and planned for Brampton, Brantford, Hamilton, Kingston, London, Nelson, Oshawa, Saskatoon, Hope, and Fort St. John.The second round of protests occurred March 31, 2012, in a number of Canadian cities including Toronto, St. John's, Brantford, Kitchener-Waterloo, Regina, Winnipeg, Victoria, Vancouver, Kelowna, Fraser Valley, Saint John, Montreal, Hamilton, Halifax, Calgary, Lethbridge, Edmonton, Canmore, Nelson, Ottawa (April 1), and Windsor.

5000|$|IMTS systems {{typically}} had 25 {{watts of}} transmitter {{power at the}} mobile station and 100-250 Watts at the terminal — unlike the older cellular car telephones that had maximum power output of 3 watts and modern cellular handsets with power outputs of 0.6 watts. Mobile installations normally consisted of a [...] "head unit" [...] or the telephone handset which sat in a cradle with a direct dialing keyboard. These looked and functioned much like a landline, or hardwired, telephone. Unlike cellular handsets, these units passed through a dial tone when the receiver was lifted from the cradle {{and in this way}} seemed more like a landline telephone than a cellular handset. There was a separate large radio transceiver chassis, typically measuring at least a foot square and 6 inches high, that was mounted either in the trunk or under the seats of an automobile. These transceivers were connected to the handset cradle with a multi-conductor cable usually around [...]5 inch thick. The mobile antennas almost always required a hole to be drilled {{in the body of the}} car to mount the antenna in; until the 1970s there were no [...] "on-glass" [...] antennas - these were developed later for the cellular car-mounted telephones. The antennas looked much like those used for CB radios and were about 19 in. long (1/4 wavelength at 155 MHz). These mobile telephone systems required a large amount of power (10 to 15 amperes at 12 volts) and this was supplied by thick power cabling connected directly to the automobile's battery. It therefore was quite possible and not uncommon for an IMTS telephone to drain an automobile's battery if used for moderate periods of time without the automobile engine running or if left on overnight. Optionally these units were also connected to the car's horn and were switched <b>to</b> <b>honk</b> the horn as a ringer when receiving an incoming call if the user was away from the car at the time of the call.|$|E
