I do not think they need it." ...|$|E

I’m just astounded. I hate to pick up the paper. I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> individuals and both parties backing the individuals have a certain degree of insanity." ...|$|E

Bowie told Movieline [...] "I had some initial problems working with Hoggle and the rest because, for one thing, what they say doesn't come from their mouths, but {{from the side of the}} set, or from behind you." [...] Connelly remarked, [...] "it was a bit strange , but I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> Dave [...] and I got over that and just took it as a challenge to work with these puppets.

500|$|MDOT has {{indicated}} {{that it has not}} requested jurisdiction, but rather if it assumed control of the route, the community would need to support a through-route. Several proposals have arisen, including creating a [...] "spur" [...] from US41/M-28 through the east end of Ishpeming to meet CR480 west of Negaunee. This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining [...] "caving grounds", and to the south of the Mather A & B Mine complex. According to Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Board Chairman, [...] "the land that was purchased by Ishpeming and Negaunee, the mining company land, this has the potential to help in the development of that if this is compatible. I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> cities will be interested in taking a look at what the land uses are and where this [...] would push through." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, it was {{revealed}} Elliott {{had been working on}} a new album. Two months later, Ciara confirmed she would appear on the album, singing and rapping on the potential first untitled single at the time. Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers. Elliott went on to say, [...] "I was eight songs deep and I let Tim listen and he was like, 'Nah, you're going in the wrong direction. You trippin'.' I had to go back in the studio and come up with new records. , he was like, 'This is the Missy people are listening to.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Upon first listen, Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{said that}} she was [...] "semi-horrified" [...] at the song, but since it was a Max Martin-produced track she [...] "gave it another chance", and commented: [...] "It’s {{definitely}} a Max Martin song. It has a good beat and cheesy, yet catchy lyrics." [...] However, Coachman said that the song should have been sung by Mark Salling (Puck) and Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina) rather than Monteith and Michele. Coachman liked the fact that this song and [...] "Get It Right" [...] fit in with the episode, and wrote, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> songs are pretty good anthems, and hopefully they do speak to the audience. She stated, however, that she [...] "probably won’t be singing along to them in my car anytime soon". In an album review giving Glee: The Music, Vol. 5 a total of two out of five stars, Andrew Leahey of Allmusic said that the new Glee songs [...] "aren’t good enough to make much of a difference". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair gave the song four stars for its lyrics, but said that the tune [...] "sucked".|$|E

2500|$|An {{aim of the}} Tractatus is {{to reveal}} the {{relationship}} between language and the world: what {{can be said about}} it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: [...] "What we can say at all can be said clearly," [...] he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be. He wrote in the preface: [...] "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should {{have to be able to}} <b>think</b> <b>both</b> sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{noted that}} in order for Thai {{corruption}} to be addressed, the Thai people must first confront certain biases and beliefs they hold due to their cultural and religious background. He asked of the Thai people [...] "Can Thailand automatically become a land of free speech without the draconian lese majeste law and the Computer Crimes Act, when many people are intolerant of anything negative said about the monarchy, and about themselves, and won't hesitate to file a libel charge, advocate censorship or take the matter into their own hands violently? Will Thailand become a land of free speech and criticism if many people in the media who engage in criticism of others on a daily basis can't take criticism or accusations themselves?" [...] "As people continue to fight and call for democracy, equality and free speech, it's imperative they examine such values at a personal level and not be mistaken in thinking that the only struggle is an external one. Sometimes, I fear that it might be easier {{to get rid of the}} external and visible tyranny than the tyranny that exists invisibly deeply within us. And to make it more complicated, I <b>think</b> <b>both</b> external and internal tyranny are intertwined." ...|$|E
