50|$|Some private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) telephone systems use a paging facility {{that acts as a}} liaison between the telephone and a PA amplifier. In other systems, paging equipment is not built into the telephone system. Instead the system includes a separate paging controller connected to a <b>trunk</b> <b>port</b> of the telephone system. The paging controller is accessed as either a designated directory number or central office line. In many modern systems, the paging function is integrated into the telephone system, and allows announcements to be played over the phone speakers.|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} in data-intensive research in recent years, the Ethernet circuit, which is a high speed point-to-point connection, {{can be used for}} transmitting large amounts of data between sites. Customers use the <b>trunk</b> <b>port</b> to connect to the operator network. It allows multiple Ethernet circuits to share the same <b>trunk</b> <b>port</b> by using the trunk and results in the efficient utilization of the bandwidth of the port. It distinguishes each (VLAN) service on the basis of VLAN identifiers. When redundancy needs to be offered in the network using two trunk ports, detecting an individual Ethernet-circuit failure over the trunk and load balancing per-flow traffic between active trunks is not possible because the existing technique, namely link aggregation, has limitations. Link aggregation does not support per-VLAN failure detection and must only be setup between directly connected network elements. Hence, it cannot be used for end-to-end failure detection when intermediate network elements are involved. In this thesis, alternative Layer 2 technologies are identified for detecting per-Ethernet circuit failure over trunk and per-flow traffic load balancing. Both traditional networking-based as well as software-defined networking (SDN) -based approaches are investigated to solve the aforementioned problems, and the findings are summarized. An SDN-based design to solve both failure detection and load balancing problems is proposed. Furthermore, the proposed solution is validated using proof of concept (POC) implementation. Finally, the performance of the POC implementation is evaluated and the findings are summarized along with recommendations for future work. Our findings reveal that existing Layer 2 technologies lack support in successfully detecting per-Ethernet circuit failure over trunk and per-flow traffic load balancing between active trunks. However, an SDN-based approach can successfully be deployed to solve both the problems. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer ScienceTelecommunication...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{different}} queuing regimes on the {{mean and standard deviation}} of the frame inter-arrival delay of a LTE traffic stream under the presence of background Ethernet traffic. The background traffic is used to represent traffic that would be generated by different functional subdivisions in the physical layer of traditional LTE base station. In this work, a Switched Ethernet architecture is used as the fronthaul section of a Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN). Contention in this fronthaul becomes an important issue since different traffic streams originating from different functional subdivisions with different quality of service specifications will be transmitted over the same physical links. <b>Trunk</b> <b>ports</b> then, will have to handle the queuing management and prioritization. Handling the traffic with different queuing regimes will reflect on the latency and latency variations of the LTE traffic...|$|R

40|$|Summary. More {{than half}} of Internet traffic today is contributed by {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) systems. P 2 P systems build their overlay topology largely agnostic of the Internet underlay, which often leads to traffic management challenges for Internet Service Providers (ISP) and potentially inefficient neighborhood selection for P 2 P nodes. To overcome this, we propose to use an oracle hosted by the ISPs, so that ISPs and P 2 P users can cooperate for improved performance. The oracle can be queried by P 2 P nodes while choosing neighbors for content search, and it will rank the possible neighbors of the querying node according to a locality indication, like the AS-hop distance. The ISP gains by keeping traffic within its Autonomous System (AS, and the P 2 P node can experience improved performance like lesser delay and better bandwidth. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits of our scheme by performing experiments in a real Testlab consisting of routers, switches and computers running actual instances of P 2 P applications. We show how we configure representative AS topologies for P 2 P networks using VLANs and <b>trunking</b> <b>ports,</b> and present experimental results with content search phase of a P 2 P network using different file sharing and search query distributions. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} networking, <b>port</b> <b>trunking</b> {{is the use}} {{of multiple}} concurrent network connections to aggregate the link speed of each participating port and cable, also called link aggregation. Such high-bandwidth link groups may be used to interconnect switches or to connect high-performance servers to a network.|$|R

5000|$|The {{boot process}} for the 2960 Series is worthy of a special mention: the OCP {{contained}} a mini OPER terminal and a cassette deck. At boot, the OCP would perform its Initial Program Load (IPL) from the nominated IPL device [...] The IPL code provided the means for the OCP to discover the system's hardware configuration, by enquiring down the Stream(s), <b>Trunk(s)</b> and <b>Port(s)</b> to find the default or manually elected boot device for the microcode set and/or Operating System to be booted. This process was called a GROPE or General Reconnaissance Of Peripheral Equipment. The cassette load method also allowed engineering staff to load and execute diagnostic software.|$|R

50|$|Hardware Sagar {{trunking}} (HPT) is {{a technology}} that allows multiple hardware ports to be combined into a single group, effectively creating a single connection with a higher bandwidth, {{sometimes referred to as}} a double-barrel approach. This technology also provides a higher degree of fault tolerance because a failure on one port may just mean a slow-down rather than a dropout. By contrast, in software <b>port</b> <b>trunking</b> (SPT), two agents (websites, channels, etc.) are bonded into one with the same effectiveness; i.e., ISDN B1 (64K) plus B2 (64K) equals data throughput of 128K.|$|R
5000|$|Ptarmigan is a mobile, {{cryptographic}} {{digital and}} modular battlefield {{wide area network}} communications system based on the Plessey System 250 architecture. It was initially {{designed to meet the}} needs of the British Army of the Rhine in West Germany and replaced the BRUIN system. The system consists of a network of electronic exchanges known as trunk nodes. These nodes are connected by multichannel UHF and SHF radio relay links that carry voice, data, telegraph and facsimile communications. The Single Channel Radio Access subsystem is effectively a VHF secure mobile telephone system that gives isolated or mobile users an entry point into the PTARMIGAN network. Ptarmigan has undergone a number of upgrades since it came into service in 1982. ( [...] First delivery of Ptarmigan equipment was to 1 Armoured Division HQ and Signal Regiment in December 1984, and did not enter service until February/March 1985) These include the introduction of an Air Portable Secondary Access Node for 16 Air Assault Brigade, and the General Purpose <b>Trunk</b> Access <b>Port</b> software enhancement which provides interconnectivity to other nations' tactical communications systems.|$|R

5000|$|VLANs {{operate at}} Layer 2 (the data link layer) of the OSI model. Administrators often {{configure}} a VLAN to map directly to an IP network, or subnet, {{which gives the}} appearance of involving Layer 3 (the network layer). In the context of VLANs, the term [...] "trunk" [...] denotes a network link carrying multiple VLANs, which are identified by labels (or [...] "tags") inserted into their packets. Such trunks must run between [...] "tagged ports" [...] of VLAN-aware devices, so they are often switch-to-switch or switch-to-router links rather than links to hosts. (Note that the term 'trunk' is also used for what Cisco calls [...] "channels" [...] : Link Aggregation or <b>Port</b> <b>Trunking).</b> A router (Layer 3 device) serves as the backbone for network traffic going across different VLANs.|$|R
