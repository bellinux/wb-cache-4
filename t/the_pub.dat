5|$|Following from draft {{plans in}} August 2016, a new {{planning}} application was submitted by Interesting Developments on 16 January 2017 to convert <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> {{back into a}} house as it appeared around 1900, demolishing the 20th century extensions and modifications and restoring historic features such as the interior fireplaces and the oculus window, A separate part to the planning application included three two-storey two-bedroom terraced houses to be constructed on <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> garden, along with a redesigned and landscaped car park to include a charging station. An additional house {{to the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> was considered but not proposed; campaigners criticised the absence of plans to preserve some historic features, the partial demolition of the building and the proximity of the new buildings. Despite objections, planning permission was granted by Medway Council on 13 June 2017.|$|E

Phil smashes through the door using a crowbar that was left in the room. He starts taking cash and drinking alcohol, and interrupts Peggy before she can call the police about Stacey.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> is unclear, but one {{reported}} theory is that it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664.

Another theory is that it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E

At the airport, they see Sharon, Phil and Grant with the police. Sharon confronts and then punches Chrissie, who is then arrested for Den's murder. Chrissie says that she will only co-operate in {{exchange}} for a meeting with Sharon. This is earned, and she tries to make Sharon realise why she killed her father, to no avail. She reveals that she forged Den's signature on the document in which Den handed over <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> to Chrissie, thus <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> legally belongs to Sharon. Jake visits Chrissie in jail and asks her to marry him. She finds out that he has lost the £25,000 that was to be her bail money, and storms out of the visiting room, calling Jake an idiot. She begins plotting revenge on Sharon for sending her to prison by trying to force her to testify in court about what Den was really like, wanting to see Sharon crumble at confessing how he cheated and supposedly beat her mother (which he never did). After a week in prison, she gives up and dismisses her solicitor, and decides to plead guilty to murder. After an emotional farewell to Jake, she walks into her cell with a contented smile.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 December 1979, 22-year-old Teresa DeSimone had been working as a {{part-time}} barmaid in the Tom Tackle public house (now called The Encore public house) in Commercial Road, Southampton. By day she was employed as a full-time clerk for the Southern Gas Board. She had been employed at <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> {{for less than a}} month, working two evenings each week, partly to widen her social circle and partly to supplement her income to pay for the Ford Escort car that she had bought three months previously. <b>The</b> <b>pub</b> was located centrally in the city, only 50yards (46metres) from the police station and law courts, and near the city's central train station and the Gaumont Theatre (now The Mayflower). When her shift at the Tom Tackle ended at 23:00 (11:00p.m.) she went on to a night club in nearby London Road, in the company of her friend Jenni Savage. Although the discothèque was a relatively short distance from the public house, they travelled in Savage's car, leaving DeSimone's Ford Escort in <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> car park.|$|E

5|$|Peggy starts dating {{businessman}} George Palmer (Paul Moriarty), {{unaware that}} he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering.

Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he {{will not be able to}} handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a lumpectomy. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a mastectomy, but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for Rio de Janeiro after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> to local businessman Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently row over the running of <b>the</b> <b>pub.</b> Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, Pat (Pam St. Clement), so she shames them by reading Frank's Dear Jane letter to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes depressed and begins to rely heavily on tranquillisers. When Frank's daughter, Janine (Charlie Brooks), taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up <b>the</b> <b>pub</b> with a baseball bat.
