5|$|The family {{continued}} {{collecting and}} selling fossils together, {{and set up}} a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn. Although the stories about Anning <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> her successes, Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too, and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{storytelling}} {{tends to}} be melodramatic, and the stories <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> struggles against social oppression in which characters are silenced by economic, political, and other social forces. The characters are clearly delineated as good or evil—the good drawn sympathetically and the evil with the contempt of the artist's moral indignation.|$|E
5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E

5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The story lines <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.|$|E
5|$|The legendary sagas <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> elves as legendary {{ancestors}} or on heroes' {{sexual relations}} with elf-women. Mention {{of the land of}} Álfheimr is found in Heimskringla while Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar recounts a line of local kings who ruled over Álfheim, who since they had elven blood were said to be more beautiful than most men. According to Hrólfs saga kraka, Hrolfr Kraki's half-sister Skuld was the half-elven child of King Helgi and an elf-woman (álfkona). Skuld was skilled in witchcraft (seiðr). Accounts of Skuld in earlier sources, however, do not include this material. The Þiðreks saga version of the Nibelungen (Niflungar) describes Högni as the son of a human queen and an elf, but no such lineage is reported in the Eddas, Völsunga saga, or the Nibelungenlied. The relatively few mentions of elves in the Chivalric sagas tend even to be whimsical.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, when {{married couples}} argue they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> {{who is right}} and who is wrong. Also couples <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> who proves the other wrong which can cause more {{problems}} and can make the problem worse because it will {{make it harder to}} forgive one another.|$|E

25|$|Each of {{the five}} {{characters}} have their own unique fighting style and their own specific set of spells and feats. Gameplay strategy is thus different for each character. Dorn is a Barbarian, and his feats <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> increasing his brute strength and ability to resist damage, as well as granting him powerful abilities to aid in melee combat, {{such as the ability}} to wield two-handed weapons in each hand. Vhaidra relies on unarmed combat, so her feats <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> increasing her speed and combos, as well as granting her close-range abilities, such as pushing enemies away from her. As Ysuran is a necromancer, his feats <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> increasing the power of his magic and granting him new spells, such as the ability to use shadow magic. Borador tends more towards archery, but is also capable of melee combat. His spells <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> allowing him to use a shield offensively, and granting him the ability to set traps for enemies and disarm traps intended for the player. Allessia is a cleric and has access to many healing and defensive spells. She can also use melee combat. Later in the game she gains the ability to reanimate the dead, and have them fight alongside her.|$|E

25|$|Each of {{the three}} {{characters}} have their own unique fighting style and their own specific set of spells and feats. Gameplay strategy is thus different for each character. As Kromlech is a fighter, his spells and feats <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> increasing his brute strength and ability to resist damage, as well as granting him powerful abilities to aid in melee combat, {{such as the ability}} to swing his weapon in a circle or slam it into the ground to damage groups of nearby enemies. As Vahn relies on ranged attacks, his spells and feats <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> increasing the power of his bow and granting him the ability to fire special types of arrows, such as exploding arrows, ice arrows or multiple arrows. As Adrianna is a sorceress, her spells and feats <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> increasing the power of her magic and granting her numerous new spells, such as the ability to shoot ice or fire from her fingers, shoot a ball of thunder or call down meteors on her enemies.|$|E

Many of these {{programs}} are modeled after traditional African ceremonies, with the focus largely on embracing African cultures.|$|E
25|$|Image {{processing}} and image analysis <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> 2D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixel-wise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processing/analysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{styles of}} music have survived most {{in remote areas}} such as the island of Corsica and mountainous Auvergne, as well as the more nationalistic regions of the Basques and the Bretons.
