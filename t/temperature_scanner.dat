The aim of the diff erent heat treatment were to obtain diff erent levels of precipitates ’ dissolution.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{quantitative}} PET imaging it {{is important}} to correct for all image-degrading effects, for example detector efficiency variation. Detector efficiency variation depends on the stability of detector efficiency when operating conditions vary within normal limits. As the efficiency of APD-based light detection strongly depends on ambient temperature, temperature-dependent detector efficiency normalization may be needed in APD-based PET scanners. We have investigated the temperature dependence of the LabPET APD-based small-animal PET scanner. MATERIALS AND METHODS First a simulation study was performed to evaluate the effect of different APD temperature coefficients on the <b>temperature</b> dependence of <b>scanner</b> sensitivity. Five experiments were also performed. First the immediate effect of <b>temperature</b> changes on <b>scanner</b> sensitivity was evaluated. Second, the effect of temperature changes that have stabilized for a few hours was investigated. In a third experiment the axial sensitivity profile was acquired at 21 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Next, two acquisitions of the NEMA image quality phantom (at 21 degrees C and 23 degrees C) were performed and absolute quantification was done based on normalization scans acquired at the correct and incorrect temperature. Finally, the feasibility of maintaining a constant room temperature and the stability of the scanner sensitivity under constant room temperature was evaluated. RESULTS Simulations showed that the relation between temperature-dependent APD gain changes and scanner sensitivity is quite complex. A temperature deviation leading to a 1 % change in APD gain corresponds to a much larger change in scanner sensitivity due to the shape of the energy histogram. In the first and second experiment a strong correlation between <b>temperature</b> and <b>scanner</b> sensitivity was observed. Changes of 2. 24 kcps/MBq and 1. 64 kcps/MBq per degrees C were seen for immediate and stabilized temperature changes respectively. The NEMA axial sensitivity profile also showed a decrease in sensitivity at higher temperature. The quantification experiment showed that a larger quantification error (up to 13 %) results when a normalization scan acquired at the incorrect temperature is used. In the last experiment, temperature variability was 0. 19 degrees C and counts varied by 10. 2 Mcts (1. 33 %). CONCLUSION The sensitivity of the LabPET small-animal PET scanner strongly depends on room temperature. Therefore, room temperature should be kept as stable as possible and temperature-dependent detector efficiency normalization should be used. However, with constant room <b>temperature</b> excellent <b>scanner</b> stability is observed. Temperature should be kept constant within 0. 5 degrees C and weekly normalization scans are recommended...|$|R

40|$|Problem addressed? An {{average of}} 14 bikes stolen {{every day in}} Dublin (Dublin Cycling Campaign) {{this is a real}} issue for cyclists. More often than not the bike is never seen again. When a person has their bike stolen they will most likely report it to the police, An officer will file a report and for the {{majority}} of cases that is where the issue will end. Police are too busy with what they deem to be more serious crime to invest much time in a bike theft. Therefore, broader thinking is required to address this issue. My solution is to leverage the growing trends of crowd sourcing and mobile applications. Crowd sourcing the bike riding community to help one another find stolen bikes. Initially this project will be focused on bikes but further iterations of the application could easily be expanded to include other high value items such as cars. Three key feature of the application will be 1. Notifying a user if there is unauthorized movement of their bike. This will take place through an external sensor placed on the bike which will communicate with the user’s phone 2. Being able to browse a shared database of bikes listed as stolen by users and having the ability to report a suspected sighting of a stolen bike, which will notify the original owner and relevant authority’s. 3. Being able to scan the immediate area for bikes that have been registered as stolen and are using the sensors. Should bikes listed as stolen be found by the system all relevant information will be displayed to the user along with an approximate distance to the stolen bike. This is triangulated via the signal strength of the Bluetooth sensor on the bike. The user can then contact the original owner through the app and let them know they have a legitimate sighting of their stolen bike confirmed through the sensor technology. The technology used to implement this solution will include an application built on the android platform, using googles cloud hosted firebase database, google maps API integration and remote sensors. These sensors contain a micro-computer powered by an ARM chip. The sensors include motion and <b>temperature</b> <b>scanners</b> along with NFC compatibility.

A ventilation-level dependent vibration induces specific peaks in the frequency spectrum of the EEG. These frequency peaks {{are in the range}} of physiologically relevant brain rhythms (gamma frequency range), and thus interfere with their reliable acquisition. This ventilation dependent artifact was most prominent on the electrodes placed directly on the subject's head, so it is not sufficient to simply place the EEG's amplifier outside the scanner tube. Instead, the ventilator must be switched off to fully eliminate the ventilator's artificial manipulation of EEG recordings.

40|$|ABSTRACT] We first {{describe}} the atmospheric correction algorithm for OCTS (Ocean Color and <b>Temperature</b> <b>Scanner)</b> {{that has been}} used for the standard product generation at NASDA/EOC (Earth Observation Center). During the pixel-wise processing, the algorithm selects 2 aerosol models out of 10 candidate models and determines the 2 ̆ 2 interpolation ratio 2 ̆ 2 based on the estimated spectral ratio of aerosol optical thickness at 670 and 865 nm bands. We then discusses several variants of the aerosol model selection scheme and compares the performance of the schemes by simulating the atmospheric correction process in use of modeled aerosol signals. The results suggest the superiority of a scheme that iteratively determines the final candidate aerosol models. We finally compares the OCTS algorithm and the old CZCS algorithm in use of a data set of 32 in-situ observation that were conducted contemporaneously with the satellite observation. While the OCTS algorithm gives smaller estimation error in the normalized water-leaving radiances, the CZCS algorithm attaines similar performance of errer factor 2 in terms of the satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration.

40|$|In ocean-color remote sensing, {{approximately}} 90 % of {{the flux}} at the sensor originates from atmospheric scattering, with the water-leaving radiance contributing the remaining 10 % {{of the total}} flux. Consequently, errors in the measured top-of-the atmosphere radiance are magnified a factor of 10 in the determination of water-leaving radiance. Proper characterization of the atmosphere is thus {{a critical part of}} the analysis of ocean-color remote sensing data. It has always been necessary to calibrate the ocean-color satellite sensor vicariously, using in situ, ground-based results, independent of the status of the pre-flight radiometric calibration or the utility of on-board calibration strategies. Because the atmosphere contributes significantly to the measured flux at the instrument sensor, both the instrument and the atmospheric correction algorithm are simultaneously calibrated vicariously.

40|$|This thesis has two aims. The {{first one}} is the {{investigation}} {{and analysis of the}} errors occurring in the measurements with pulsed time-of-flight (TOF) terrestrial laser scanners (TLS). A good understanding of the error sources and the relationships between them is necessary to secure the data accuracy. We subdivide these errors into four groups: instrumental, object-related, environmental and methodological. Based on our studies and the results obtained by other researchers, we have compiled an error model for TLS, which is used to estimate the single-point coordinate accuracy of a point in the point cloud, transformed to the specified coordinate system. The second aim is to investigate systematic instrumental errors and performance of three pulsed TOF laser scanners – Callidus 1. 1, Leica HDS 3000 and Leica HDS 2500 – and to develop calibration procedures that can be applied by the users to determine and correct the systematic errors in these instruments. The investigations have been performed at the indoor 3 D calibration field established at KTH and outdoors. The systematic instrumental errors, or calibration parameters, have been estimated in a self-calibration according to the parametric least-squares adjustment in MATLAB®. The initial assumption was that the scanner instrumental errors are similar to those in a total station. The results have shown that the total station error model is applicable for TLS as a first approximation, but additional errors, specific to the scanner design, may appear. For example, we revealed a significant vertical scale error in the scanner Callidus 1. 1, caused by the faults of the angular position sensor. The coordinate precision and accuracy of the scanners, estimated during the self-calibration, is at the level of several millimetres for Callidus 1. 1 and Leica HDS 3000, and at the submillimetre level for Leica HDS 2500. In other investigations, we revealed a range drift of up to 3 mm during the first few hours of scanning, presumably due to the changes in the <b>temperature</b> inside the <b>scanners.</b> The angular precision depends on the scanner design (“panoramic” or “camera-like”), and the angular accuracy depends on the significant calibration parameters in the scanner. Investigations of the influence of surface reflectance on the range measurements have shown that the indoor illumination and surface wetness have no tangible influence on the results. The type of the material does not affect, in general, the ranging precision for Callidus 1. 1, but it affects the ranging precision and accuracy of the scanners Leica HDS 3000 and Leica HDS 2500. The reason may be different wavelength and, possibly, different design of the electronics in the laser rangefinders. Materials with high reflectance and those painted with bright “warning” colours may introduce significant offsets into the measured ranges (5 – 15 cm), when scanned from close ranges at normal incidence with the scanner Leica HDS 3000. “Mixed pixels” at the object edge may introduce a range error of several centimetres, on the average, {{depending on the type of}} the material. This phenomenon leads also to the distortions of the object size, which may be reduced by the removal of the “mixed pixels” based on their intensity. The laser beam intensity recorded by the scanner tends to decrease with an increased incidence angle, although not as assumed by the popular Lambertian reflectance model. Investigations of the scanner Leica HDS 2500 outdoors have revealed no significant influence of the “normal” atmospheric conditions on the range measurements at the ranges of up to 50 m. Finally, we have developed and tested two simple procedures for the calibration of the vertical scale (and vertical index) error and zero error in laser scanners. We have also proposed an approach for the evaluation of the coordinate precision and accuracy in TLS based on the experiences from airborne laser scanning (ALS). QC 2010112...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{results of}} {{circulation}} {{in the upper}} Gulf of Thailand using a 2 -dimensional model suggested counter-clockwise circulation and a clockwise gyre during the northeast and the southwest monsoons, respectively. A review of previous reports relevant to circulation, {{and the results of}} surface chlorophyll-a distribution estimated by OCTS (Ocean Color and <b>Temperature</b> <b>Scanner)</b> data support the results during the northeast monsoon. Anyway, residual circulation analyzed from oceanographic buoys deployed in the upper gulf illustrated both clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations during the southwest monsoon. Therefore, the objective of this study is trying to investigate the current patterns and their controlling factors especially during the southwest monsoon. The 2 -dimenional circulation model is applied again but this time uses meteorological wind data from local stations around the study area as inputs. The experiments also include investigation of current patterns due to the difference of wind gradients in east-west and north-south direction. The results show that counter-clockwise circulation can be developed during the southwest monsoon when wind magnitude in the east or the south is significantly stronger than that in the west or the north, respectively, which possibly happens in the real situation. It can be concluded that the circulation patterns in the area are controlled by not only wind direction but also its gradient. We also found that external flows through the open boundary can change the patterns of circulation just in the southernmost area...|$|E
40|$|High {{phytoplankton}} biomass often {{occurs in}} plumes near river mouths or in eutrophic coastal waters for short time periods. However, we observed an increased phytoplankton biomass {{in a narrow}} jet-shaped protrusion into the western South China Sea (SCS) using satellite chlorophyll a (chl a) data from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and concurrent ship measurements in 1999. In June, regional phytoplankton biomass appeared as a large jet shape extending from the coastal waters of Vietnam eastward towards the SCS, about 200 km northeast of {{the mouth of the}} Mekong River; this feature intensified {{in the form of a}} large jet or gyre from July to September, decayed in October, and disappeared entirely in November. The gyre was about 400 km in diameter with chl a concentrations from 0. 5 to 2 mg m(- 3). Data on sea surface temperature (SST), winds, and sea surface height anomalies indicated a strong offshore upwelling during a period of strong southwesterly winds alongshore. The upwelling coincided with the regional increase in phytoplankton biomass in terms of shape, timing, and location. We observed this phenomenon during every southwesterly monsoon season from 1997 to 2002 using chl a images from 3 satellite ocean color sensors-SeaWiFS, Ocean Color and <b>Temperature</b> <b>Scanner</b> (OCTS), and Ocean Color Imager (OCI) -and it appeared to be related to the cross-shelf upwelling that delivers nutrients to surface waters. The phytoplankton then flowed with a large anticyclonic gyre into the western SCS...|$|E
