They have been interpreted as a strategy to reduce predation risk, enhance foraging success and/or provide a social advantage. In the archipelago of the Azores, four species of dolphins are commonly involved in mixed-species associations: the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, the striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, and the spotted dolphin, Stenella frontalis. In {{order to understand the}} reasons why dolphins associate, we analysed field data collected since 1999 by research scientists and trained observers placed onboard fishing vessels.

The temporal distribution, habitat (water depth, distance to the coast), behaviour (i. e. feeding, travelling, socializing), size and composition of mixed-species groups were compared with those of single-species groups. Results did not support the predation avoidance hypothesis and gave little support to the social advantage hypothesis. The foraging advantage hypothesis was the most convincing. However, the benefits of mixed-species associations appeared to depend on the species. Associations were likely to be opportunistic in the larger bottlenose dolphin, while there seemed to be some evolutionary constraints favouring associations in the rarer striped dolphin. Comparison with previous studies suggests that the formation of mixed-species groups depends on several environmental factors, and therefore may constitute an adaptive response...|$|E
40|$|In the {{laboratory}} we {{have access to}} the massive Coulomb three-body systems D++D++D- and H++H ++H-. The systems are produced through collisions of 4. 0 keV D+ 3 and H+ 3 on He, producing three charged fragments in the continuum. The long-range Coulomb inter action between the fragments can lead to highly correlated motion. ^ The laboratory frame energies and scattering angles of the three fragments are measured in triple coincidence. Transforming to the center of mass (c. m.) frame, the c. m. energies and mutual correlation angles can be determined for each measured three-body event. When the observed triple events are plotted on a WYJ Dalitz plot as a function of total c. m. energy, patterns and trends develop in the experimental data. ^ To understand the physical origins of these patterns, a series of classical numerical simulations of three charged bodies was executed modeling the D+ 3 and H+ 3 post-dissociation dynamics. The experimental data can then interpreted within the classical simulation framework combined with the quantum mechanical properties of the parent D+ 3 and H+ 3. ^ New insights has been gained on the dynamics of polar N-body systems. A new, heretofore unconsidered dissociation channel has been discovered where tenuous <b>temporary</b> <b>associations</b> between oppositely charged fragments can form. These Keplerian-like two-body systems lead to a rich domain of post-dissociation dynamics.

Using data collected between 2003 - 2011 in the oceanic archipelago of Madeira, the grouping structure of short-finned pilot whales was studied using photo-identification methods and mtDNA sequences and microsatellite markers to test the hypotheses that (1) {{there is at least}} one pelagic and one or more island-associated communities, and (2) groups are made of related individuals, with a matrilineal social structure. Pilot whales demonstrated a large degree of variability in site fidelity, including residents (up to 14 -year interval), regular visitors and transients. The social and temporal analyses revealed a well-differentiated society with long-lasting relationships (of years). The genetic analyses suggested that individuals of the three residency patterns may not be genetically isolated, and that small groups are made up of related individuals, suggesting some degree of social philopatry, while large groups are probably <b>temporary</b> <b>associations</b> of smaller groups. It is proposed that the pilot whales encountered in Madeira belong to a single population encompassing several clans, possibly three clans of island-associated whales and others of transients, each containing two to three matrilineal pods, each with a mean of 15 individuals (SD= 9, range: 4 - 29). We suggest that the clans interact for mating purposes when they meet. For management decisions, it is considered that the island-associated whales should not be regarded as demographically independent populations, but instead as stable social entities to be included in governmental management plans and requiring periodic evaluation of their status.

Transect observations are used to calculate monthly densities, frequency of social foraging, and size and composition of social groups for all species. Additional data taken to quantify the foraging logistics of 22 species includes foraging substrate, time spent at a foraging station, and distance travelled between foraging stations. These data are used to generate indices of logistic similarity and interspecific association for species pairs {{in order to test}} the hypothesis that species which are similar in their foraging logistics are more likely to associate than those which are not. Causes of solitary behavior and variation in intraspecific social behavior are also examined. Exclusively solitary foraging behavior is strongly associated with species that use sparse, unpredictable prey too small to share. These species, referred to as "extensive foragers," appear to be constrained from both intraspecific and interspecific association by being logistic mismatches with all but their closest competitors, with which the potential for interference competition is high. Evidence is presented to refute the hypothesis that solitary behavior is due to low vulnerability to predators. Species which are intraspecifically solitary tend to use evenly distributed resources, and gregarious species use patchy and abundant resources. Exceptions are most frequent among permanent residents, which may continue to maintain social and spacing systems used in the breeding season. Among gregarious species, permanent residents are more likely to maintain stable group sizes than winter residents. A correlation exists between similarity of foraging logistics and likelihood of interspecific association, but it is subject to considerable variance. Causes of this variance include the tendency of transient migrants not to associate with other species, and the tendency of certain species to form <b>temporary</b> <b>associations,</b> regardless of logistic similarities.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study conducted by Camac and Glucksberg (1984) {{it was reported that}} components drawn from apt metaphors do not show the same lexical priming effects as semantically associated pairs. Specifically, they found that in a standard lexical decision task, semantically associated pairs were responded to more quickly than randomly paired words, while pairs drawn from apt metaphors showed no reaction time difference over randomly paired words. This finding led them to conclude that metaphors do not rely on preexisting associations for comprehension, rather, metaphor processing creates new but <b>temporary</b> <b>associations.</b> The present study consisted of three experiments designed to demonstrate the replicability of Camac and Glucksberg 2 ̆ 7 s findings and to test the notion that metaphor processing results in the formation of new associations. Experiment 1 was essentially a replication of Camac and Glucksberg 2 ̆ 7 s work, and produced effects identical to those described above. Experiment 2 controlled for the mean printed frequency of the metaphor and associate pairs, a factor which was not held constant in the Camac and Glucksberg experiment. Experiment 2 produced essentially the same pattern of results as those found in Experiment 1 and the original Camac and Glucksberg study, which indicate that a difference in printed frequency is not the cause of the observed effects. Experiment 3 required subjects to make lexical decisions for word pairs immediately following contextual paragraphs designed to bias subjects towards metaphorical or literal interpretation. It was hypothesized that if the processing of a metaphor causes the temporary formation of new associations, lexical decisions should occur more quickly for pairs following a metaphorical context than those following a literal context. The results for Experiment 3 only partially supported this hypothesis.

Non-social factors can influence animal social structure. In killer whales (Orcinus orca), fish- versus mammal-eating ecological differences are regarded as key ecological drivers of their multilevel society, including group size, but the potential importance of specific target prey remains unclear. Here, we investigate the social structure of herring-eating killer whales in Iceland and compare it to the described social structures of primarily salmon- and seal-eating populations in the Northeast Pacific, which form stable coherent basic units nested within a hierarchical multilevel society. Using 29023 photographs collected over 6 years, we examined the association patterns of 198 individuals combining clustering, social network structure, and temporal patterns of association analysis. The Icelandic population had largely weak but non-random associations, which were not completely assorted by known ranging patterns. A fission–fusion dynamic of constant and <b>temporary</b> <b>associations</b> was observed but this was not due to permanent units joining. The population-level society was significantly structured but not in a clear hierarchical tier system. Social clusters were highly diverse in complexity and there were indications of subsclusters. There was no indication of dispersal nor strong sex differences in associations. These results indicate that the Icelandic herring-eating killer whale population has a multilevel social structure without clear hierarchical tiers or nested coherent social units, different from other populations of killer whales. We suggest that local ecological context, such as the characteristics of the specific target prey (e. g., predictability, biomass, and density) and subsequent foraging strategies may strongly influence killer whale social association patterns.

Although much work has focused on the impact of ecological factors {{on the size of the}} <b>temporary</b> <b>associations,</b> or parties, it seems that chimpanzees, especially the males, form parties to gain social benefits, and that these benefits are dependent the particular composition of these parties. This paper examines the social determinates of the association patterns of male chimpanzees, members of the Sonso community in the Budongo Forest Reserve, western Uganda. Male chimpanzees showed clear preferences for association partners, and these partners had a strong tendency to associate in small parties. Strength of association within dyads accounted for a significant fraction of the variance in party size [all parties containing males: r(2) = 0. 30; male parties only: r(2) = 10. 24 (all dyads), r(2) = 0. 50 (dyads with positive associations only) ]. These results supported the hypothesis that association was the result of tactical decisions, and refuted predictions of alternate hypotheses: random and passive (independent attraction to the same locations, such as fruiting trees) association. Further support for the tactical association hypothesis was provided by observations that association between males was flexible and that association patterns resolved into alternative association strategies, with some males shifting between strategies over time. The presence of cycling females influenced party size, which increased with the number present. The number of adult males in a party was also greater when cycling females were present, although remained similar whether one, two, three or four such females were in the party. Samples sizes for parties containing more than two cycling females were low however. it is suggested that, for a Machiavellian primate in fission- fusion social system, the need to make decisions concerning association partners is cognitively demanding and may be an important, frequently used, function of the intelligence demonstrated by captive chimpanzees...|$|E

In general, current approaches do not adopt a network perspective {{to highlight the}} multidimensional system created through the activities undertaken by the intermediaries. In this paper we present an empirical analysis of a regional policy supporting the creation of specialized intermediaries in the Italian region of Tuscany. In the programming period 2007 - 2013 (effectively starting from 2010), the regional government of Tuscany funded twelve ‘innovation poles’. They are regional innovation intermediaries (organized to provide a range of services, including brokering and matchmaking) that bring together a number of universities and innovative service providers with potential end-users of these services. Their main goal is to promote linkages between regional actors: universities, public research organizations, KIBS, large businesses and SMEs. We highlight two main domains of interactions that support the entire system of the poles. The first domain is that in which we find the agents promoting the system of poles: this network involves both the organizations directly managing the poles, {{through the creation of}} <b>temporary</b> <b>associations,</b> and the organizations who have shareholdings in those managing organizations. The second domain relates to competence networks initiated by the system of the poles not only through the provision of services by the various operators, but also through the skills of employees and consultants, the collaboration agreements with parties outside the poles, and through the facilities of laboratories and incubators. By creating such multilayer networks we focus on interrelations between the poles based on the activities, undertaken jointly, in supporting the member companies. For each of these domains we examine the characteristics of the networks and the centrality index of the agents involved. Moreover, by adopting the analysis of multilayer networks (recently developed by De Domenico et al., 2015), we identify and compare the emerging communities in aggregate networks and in the multilayer networks with regard to the networks promoting the poles and in the competence networks...|$|E

Although social structure {{has been described}} for some dolphin communities, the selective pressures affecting fission-fusion patterns and their consequences on dolphin communication are not well understood. The goals {{of the present study}} were three-fold: 1) to quantify the rate with which fission-fusion occurred and identify the selective pressures influencing an individual 2 ̆ 7 s decision to leave and join a temporary group; 2) to examine the communication signals produced during temporary separations; and 3) to estimate the distances over which dolphins could remain in acoustic contact while separated. It was found that a dolphin 2 ̆ 7 s decision to join or leave a group was related to social considerations such as the class of individual encountered (e. g., mothers with calves, adult single females, adult males, and juveniles) as dolphins move in different environments. The decision was also influenced by ecological characteristics such as the habitat where a dolphin was found. The two aspects in turn determined the rate of fission-fusion. Mothers with calves regularly using deep waters had high rates of fission-fusion. Those females encountered other females in the same reproductive condition frequently and associated with them. In contrast, mothers with calves using shallow waters had lower fission-fusion rates. Those females encountered juvenile dolphins often but they did not associate with them frequently. Temporarily separated dolphins did not always produce the sounds typically used for long-distance communication, and sometimes they did not use any detectable acoustic signal to find each other. On average, this absence of communication occurred at distances less than 50 m. When both whistles and echolocation produced, they were apparently involved in maintaining contact between mothers and their calves and other associates. Estimates of active spaces defined by whistle transmission indicated that communication range varied between habitats. Shallow seagrass areas had the smallest active space while channels had the greatest active space. Findings indicated that the distances over which dolphins remain in acoustic contact and can be considered members of groups are much greater than has been described from observations of dolphin spacing and activity alone...|$|E
