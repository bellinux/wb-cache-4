5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited <b>the</b> <b>marchers,</b> and they were forced to spend the night on the stone floor of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that this was so). On Saturday 24 October <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final day, a week hence.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April, <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> reached Tiruthuraipoondi and {{had planned}} to stay at a choultry which was managed by Ramachandra Naidu, a close {{associate}} of Pillai. Despite the collector's warning, Naidu provided accommodation to <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> at his choultry. His actions led to him being arrested by the police the following day. The arrest of Iyer and Naidu created fear among the people. Pillai, however, convinced {{the people that they}} could provide food without getting caught by the police. As a result, food packets were found tied to the branches of roadside trees, and when the group rested on the banks of Kaveri there were indicators where huge food containers were buried. The British policemen, who were deployed to suppress <b>the</b> <b>marchers,</b> suffered from starvation when local residents refused them food and water. The Indian staff who were employed by the British stopped performing their daily activities, while barbers and washermen refused to serve the government employees.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive <b>the</b> <b>marchers,</b> who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{concept of}} syndicating {{programmes}} across local radio stations {{had previously been}} used by <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> Radio Group bouquet of stations, which eventually became part of The One Network. In addition to The One Network's networked programmes from Bristol, <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> stations simulcast many of its sub-regional programming throughout its four local licenses.|$|R

GCap put <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> Group stations up for sale in 2005, but in March 2006 the sale was called off.|$|R
5|$|A {{second group}} of {{students}} headed for central London, waving effigies of the brown dog, joined by a police escort and, briefly, a busker with bagpipes. As <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> reached Trafalgar Square, they were 1,000 strong, facing 400 police officers, 15 of them on horseback. The students gathered around Nelson's Column, where the ringleaders climbed onto its base to make speeches.|$|E
5|$|During the march, Rajagopalachari and <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} Civil Disobedience Movement as well as khadi and social issues like caste discrimination. They socialised with the untouchables and refrained from entering the temples in which the former were denied entry. They also swept {{the streets of the}} villages and spoke up for the unity of Hindus and Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} remained {{deeply concerned}} about the Bolshevik threat, and in May 1919 the Winnipeg General Strike broke out, creating a national crisis which ministers feared {{would lead to a}} revolution. The mounted police were deployed to maintain public order and generate intelligence on the strikers; 245 mounted police were sent into the city, supported by four machine guns mounted on lorries. On June 21, which became known as Bloody Saturday, military veterans marched through the city in support of the strikers; the authorities called in the mounted police to break up <b>the</b> <b>marchers.</b> By the time the police arrived, the protesters had begun to riot and the police carried out two mounted charges. The police then concluded that they were losing control of the situation and fired their revolvers into the crowd, killing one man and injuring others. <b>The</b> <b>marchers</b> fled and the strike collapsed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Marcher</b> Lordships were <b>the</b> {{basic units}} of {{administration}} {{for the next}} 450 or so years, until Henry VIII passed the Laws in Wales Act 1535.

5|$|After World War I the {{memorial}} {{became one of}} the centerpieces of the Adelaide Anzac Day march. The route for the march starts at the National War Memorial, heads west along North Terrace, and turns right down King William Road before culminating in a service at the Cross of Sacrifice (in the Adelaide Park Lands opposite the St Peter's Cathedral). As <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> turn on to King William Road they salute the South African War Memorial.|$|E
5|$|The republican {{movement}} initially {{struggled to}} generate {{public support for}} the second hunger strike. The Sunday before Sands began his strike, 3,500 people marched through west Belfast. During the first hunger strike four months earlier <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> had numbered 10,000. Five days into the strike, Independent Republican MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Frank Maguire died, resulting in a by-election. There was debate among nationalists and republicans regarding who should contest the election: Austin Currie of the Social Democratic and Labour Party expressed an interest, as did Bernadette McAliskey and Maguire's brother Noel.|$|E
5|$|For {{the march}} itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest {{discipline}} and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> not from Congress Party members, {{but from the}} residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline. The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based {{on the needs of}} the local residents. Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.|$|E

5|$|In the end {{the fines}} were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had {{nevertheless}} demonstrated an important point. After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was therefore {{a good opportunity to}} assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} that {{most if not all}} Jews left Wales after Edward I's act of 1290, {{although}} the writ of the English king would not have run in many of <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> Lordships. <b>The</b> Welsh chronicle Brut y Tywysogion refers to the act but only {{in the context of the}} Jews in neighbouring England. But there is a remarkable record of an unnamed Jew in the commote of Manor Deilo in Carmarthenshire (outside <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> Lordships) in 1386/7.|$|R
5|$|King next {{attempted}} {{to organize a}} march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against the State of Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> around and asking them to disperse {{so as not to}} violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement. The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.|$|E
5|$|C. Rajagopalachari, a close {{associate}} of Gandhi, led the march which had close to 150 volunteers, {{most of whom}} belonged to the Indian National Congress. It began at Trichinopoly (now Tiruchirappalli) on 13 April 1930 and proceeded for about 150 miles towards the east before culminating at Vedaranyam, a small coastal town in the then Tanjore District. By collecting salt directly from the sea <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> broke the salt law. As {{a part of the}} march, Rajagopalachari created awareness among the people by highlighting the importance of khƒÅdƒ´ as well as social issues like caste discrimination. The campaign came to an end on 28 April 1930 when the participants were arrested by the police. Its leader Rajagopalachari was imprisoned for six months. The march along with the ones at Dandi and Dharasana drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement.|$|E
5|$|Not one of <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> even {{raised an}} arm {{to fend off}} the blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
50|$|Stories {{and legends}} {{have long been}} linked to Manoa Falls. However, {{none other than the}} legend of <b>the</b> Night <b>Marchers</b> evokes shuddering fear from the locals. The Night Marchers-or the Phantom Marchers- are told to be the Spirits of Ancient Hawaiian Warriors. As the legend tells, the direct path of <b>the</b> Night <b>Marchers</b> is <b>the</b> Banyan Tree located in the {{beginning}} of the Manoa Falls Trail. It is said <b>the</b> Night <b>Marchers</b> haunt <b>the</b> Manoa Falls Trail and the sounds of banshee screams can be heard as you hike the trail. If one is ever hiking the Manoa Falls Trail it is important to listen for the sound of Conch Shells, the beating of drums, and the light of torches, for these all mark the arrival of <b>the</b> Night <b>Marchers.</b> If one encounters the arrival of <b>the</b> Night <b>Marchers</b> it is crucial to do the following: crouch low to the ground, rest on stomach, and resist the temptation to look <b>the</b> Night <b>Marchers</b> in <b>the</b> Eye. One real life encounter of <b>the</b> Night <b>Marchers</b> happened in <b>the</b> 1970s when two Hawaiian Fishermen claimed they saw the torches of <b>the</b> Night <b>Marchers.</b> <b>The</b> fishermen were baiting their lines when around 10pm they heard the sound of the conch shell followed by the sight of torches in the distance. The fishermen in response laid down on lava rock and avoided eye contact until <b>the</b> Night <b>Marchers</b> left.|$|R

25|$|In late 1933, Gold {{served a}} brief prison {{sentence}} {{after having been}} arrested for participating in a hunger march in Wilmington, Delaware. Hunger marches had been occurring throughout the United States since 1931. Catholic social activist Dorothy Day herself encouraged Gold {{to participate in a}} march from New York City to Washington, D.C. Gold was one of 315 marchers who left New York City on November 29, 1932, bound for Washington. <b>The</b> <b>marchers</b> reached Wilmington on December 2, their number having increased by several hundred. Their permit to march in the city was withdrawn. That night, the police herded most of <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> into a warehouse downtown, but Gold, most of the women and most of <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> from New England stayed in a rented church two blocks away. That night, <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> at the church were refused permission to hold a meeting in the street, so they held it on the church steps. When the police tried to stop the meeting, <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> resisted. The police began beating the people listening to the speaker, and <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> fled into the church and barricaded the doors. The police fired tear gas through the windows of the building, then broke down the doors and entered the building with weapons drawn. <b>The</b> <b>marchers</b> resisted by hurling chairs at the police, but were beaten and gassed repeatedly until subdued. Twenty-three marchers, including Gold, were arrested. Four police and three marchers were hospitalized. Gold was convicted of incitement to riot, and served a brief prison term in Wilmington in late 1933 and early 1934. Gold participated in additional hunger marches in 1933 and 1934, and was arrested again in Albany, New York, in late October 1934.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days after}} the first march, on March 9, 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr. led a {{symbolic}} march over the bridge. By then local activists and residents had been joined by hundreds of protesters from across the country, including numerous clergy and nuns. Whites made up one-third of <b>the</b> <b>marchers.</b> That day King pulled <b>the</b> <b>marchers</b> back from entering the county and having another confrontation with county and state forces. But that night, white minister James Reeb, who had traveled to the city from Boston, was attacked and killed in Selma by white members of the KKK.|$|E
50|$|These {{stations}} were {{owned and operated}} by <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> Radio Group until the GWR Group's purchase in 2000. Five years later, the owners merged with Capital Radio to form GCap Media (later Global Radio). By 2008, locally produced programming had been cut back to daily four-hour breakfast shows and a regional weekday drivetime show from Wrexham for <b>the</b> <b>Marcher,</b> Coast and Wirral areas, although Coast retained an opt-out for Welsh language programming.

5|$|In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a {{coalition}} of the Despensers' enemies across <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and headed west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by {{a coalition}} of <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> Lords and <b>the</b> local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing that he might be deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned <b>the</b> <b>Marcher</b> Lords for their actions.|$|R
