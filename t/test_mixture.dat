40|$|The {{efficacy}} of sodium hypochlorite was assessed against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 suspended in low (8 % v/v) or high (80 % v/v) concentrations of serum or in a high (80 %) concentration of blood. In the presence of 8 % serum, 100 p. p. m. available chlorine in the disinfectant <b>test</b> <b>mixture</b> inactivated 3. 75 log TCID 50 HIV/ml within 30 s. When the <b>test</b> <b>mixture</b> contained 80 % serum, 500 p. p. m. available chlorine inactivated more than 4 log TCID 50 HIV/ml in 1 - 2 min. Lower concentrations of available chlorine were unable to inactivate the virus completely. In the presence of 80 % blood, 1000 p. p. m. available chlorine in the disinfectant <b>test</b> <b>mixture</b> was unable to inactivate 3. 75 log TCID 50 HIV/ml, although 2500 p. p. m. available chlorine was able to inactivate at least 1. 5 log TCID 50 HIV/ml. In all test mixtures, the chlorine rapidly became combined and thus less active. Our results emphasise the importance of cleaning prior to disinfection with sodium hypochlorite since it {{may prove to be}} ineffective in the presence of high levels of organic matter. In cases where prior cleaning is impossible, care must be taken to use the higher recommended concentration (a minimum of 10, 000 p. p. m. available chlorine) ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{application}} of multivariate calibration techniques to multicomponent analysis by UV-VIS {{molecular absorption spectrometry}} is {{a powerful tool for}} simultaneous determination of several chemical species. However, when this methodology is accomplished manually, it is slow and laborious, consumes high amounts of reagents and samples, is susceptible to contaminations and presents a high operational cost. To overcome these drawbacks, a flow-batch analyser is proposed in this work. This analyser was developed for automatic preparation of standard calibration and <b>test</b> (or validation) <b>mixtures.</b> It was applied to the simultaneous determination of Cu 2 +, Mn 2 + and Zn 2 + in polyvitaminic and polymineral pharmaceutical formulations, using 4 -(2 -piridilazo) resorcinol as reagent and a UV-VIS spectrophotometer with a photodiode array detector. The results obtained with the proposed system are in good agreement with those obtained by flame atomic absorption spectrometry, which was employed as reference method. With the proposed analyser, the preparation of calibration and <b>test</b> <b>mixtures</b> can be accomplished about four hours, while the manual procedure requires at least two days. Moreover, it consumes smaller amounts of reagents and samples than the manual procedure. After the preparation of calibration and <b>test</b> <b>mixtures,</b> 60 samples - 1 can be carried out with the proposed flow-batch analyser...|$|R
