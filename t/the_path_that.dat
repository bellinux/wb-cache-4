5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>that</b> {{minimizes}} the maximum weight {{of any of}} its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E

5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock {{climbing}} that is performed on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls, without the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (<b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>that</b> a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to build}} a railway to connect Norway's two largest cities, Oslo and Bergen, were {{launched}} by Andreas Tanberg Gløersen in 1871. He proposed that the line run via Hallingdal and Voss and include two short branch lines which would connect to the two major fjord systems in the area, Sognefjord and Hardangerfjord. The narrow gauge Voss Line from Bergen to Voss opened in 1883, and the Bergen Line was completed as standard gauge in 1909. During {{the construction of the}} Bergen Line, <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>that</b> ran up Flåmsdalen was upgraded by NSB to allow access to the area around Myrdal. The Hardanger Line, which connected the Bergen Line to Hardangerfjord, opened in 1935, and was the country's first railway to open with electric traction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a new problem}} that occurs when drawing wiring diagrams or public transportation networks. Given an embedded graph G = (V, E) (e. g., the streets served by a bus network) and a set L of paths in G (e. g., the bus lines), we want to draw <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> along <b>the</b> edges of G such that they cross each other as few times as possible. For esthetic reasons we insist that the relative order of <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> traverse a node does not change within the area occupied by that node. Our main contribution is an algorithm that minimizes the number of crossings on a single edge {u, v} ∈ E if we are given {{the order of the}} incoming and outgoing <b>paths.</b> <b>The</b> difficulty is deciding the order of <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> terminate in u or v with respect to the fixed order of <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> do not end there. Our algorithm uses dynamic programming and takes O(n 2) time, where n is the number of terminating paths. ...|$|R

5|$|The Persian {{strategy}} for 480 BC was probably to simply progress through Greece in overwhelming force. The cities in any territory {{that the army}} passed through {{would be forced to}} submit or risk destruction; and indeed this happened with the Thessalian, Locrian and Phocian cities who initially resisted the Persians but then were forced to submit as the Persians advanced. Conversely, the Allied strategy was probably to try and stop the Persian advance as far north as possible, and thus prevent the submission of as many potential Allies as possible. Beyond this, the Allies seem to have realised that given the Persians' overwhelming numbers, they had little chance in open battle, and thus they opted to try to defend geographical bottle-necks, where the Persian numbers would count for less. The whole Allied campaign for 480 BC can be seen in this context. Initially they attempted to defend the Tempe pass to prevent the loss of Thessaly. After they realised that they could not defend this position, they chose the next-most northerly position, the Thermopylae/Artemisium axis. The Allied performance at Thermopylae was initially effective; however, the failure to properly guard <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>that</b> outflanked Thermopylae undermined their strategy, and led to defeat. At Artemisium the fleet also scored some successes, but withdrew due to the losses they had sustained, and since the defeat of Thermopylae made the position irrelevant. Thus far, the Persian strategy had succeeded, while the Allied strategy, though not a disaster, had failed.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the finite-dimensional representation theory of the Lorentz group mostly follows that of the subject in general. Lie theory originated with Sophus Lie in 1873. By 1888 the classification of simple Lie algebras was essentially completed by Wilhelm Killing. In 1913 the theorem of highest weight for representations of simple Lie algebras, <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>that</b> will be followed here, was completed by Élie Cartan. Richard Brauer was 1935–38 {{largely responsible for the}} {{development of}} the Weyl-Brauer matrices describing how spin representations of the Lorentz Lie algebra can be embedded in Clifford algebras. The Lorentz group has also historically received special attention in representation theory, see History of infinite-dimensional unitary representations below, due to its exceptional importance in physics. Mathematicians Hermann Weyl and Harish-Chandra and physicists Eugene Wigner and Valentine Bargmann made substantial contributions both to general representation theory and in particular to the Lorentz group. Physicist Paul Dirac was perhaps the first to manifestly knit everything together in a practical application of major lasting importance with the Dirac equation in 1928.|$|E
