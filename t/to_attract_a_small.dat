40|$|Parametric {{resonance}} is {{a particular}} type of resonance in which a parameter in a system changes with time. A particularly interesting case is when the parameter changes in a periodic way, which can lead to very intricate behavior. This di↵ers from periodic forcing in that solutions are not necessarily periodic. A system in which parametric resonance is realized is when a fluid bath is shaken periodically, which leads to an e↵ective time dependent gravitational force. This system will be used to study the onset of surface waves in a bath with non-uniform topography. A linear model for the surface waves is derived from the Euler equations in the limit of shallow waves, which includes the geometry of the bottom and surface tension. Experiments are performed to compare with the proposed model and good qualitative agreement is found. Another experiment which relies on a shaking fluid bath is that of bouncing fluid droplets. In the case of two droplets the shaking allows for a larger bouncing droplet <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> moving droplet in a way that creates a bound system. This bound system is studied and shows some analogous properties to quantum systems, so a quantum mechanical model for a two dimensional atom is studied, as well as a proposed model for the droplet-wave system in terms of equations of fluid mechanics...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} {{vitality of}} many communities has declined {{as a result}} of changes in their economic structures. In some places, economic growth is being fostered by the inmigration of retirees. This exploratory study investigated the importance of public recreation services and parks in retirees’ choice of community, using a random sample of retired persons who had moved to South Carolina in the past twelve months. The instrument developed for the study was comprised of three sections: (a) importance of recreation and parks; (b) demographics, and (c) personal characteristics. Results suggest that retirees who perceive recreation or parks to have been important in their selection of a community appear to have different values and feel more attached to their new community than do those who do not perceive these services to have been important. The findings suggest that recreation park agencies have a vital role to play in the attraction of new residents. Keywords: retiree relocation decisions, recreation parks, community attachment, values. Retiree’s Choice of Community: The Importance of Recreation and Parks The economic vitality of many communities has declined {{as a result of}} changes in their economic structure. Economic growth in most communities had traditionally been fostered by the location of new businesses.

40|$|Utilizing App Stores {{as part of}} an ‘in-the-large’ {{methodology}} requires {{researchers to}} have a good understanding of the effects the platform has in the overall experimental process if they are to utilize it effectively. This paper presents an empirical study of effects of the operation an App Store has on an App lifecycle through the design, implementation and distribution of three games on the WidSets platform which arguably pioneered many of the features now seen as conventional for an App Store. Although these games achieved in excess of 1. 5 million users it was evident through their App lifecycle that very large numbers of downloads are required <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> even <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of active users and suggests such Apps need to be developed using more commercial practices than would be necessary for traditional lab testing. Further, the evidence shows that ‘value added’ features such as chat increase not only the popularity of an App but also increase the likelihood of continued use and provide a means of direct interaction with users...|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{decentralized}} {{structure of}} Atmosphere and {{the popularity of}} the world-building contests, the Atmosphere community still preferred to gather in worlds created by Adobe and its partner DigitalSpace, such as Adobe's annually-revamped HomeWorld and DigitalSpace's Atmospherians Community. As the HomeWorld was the primary starting place for new users, the community found it easier to establish lively crowds there. When Adobe shut down HomeWorld, along with a number of other Adobe-hosted worlds, many builders made attempts at emulating the success of HomeWorld with their own starting points. However, without the constant stream of new users that HomeWorld experienced, most of these attempts failed <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> more than <b>a</b> <b>small</b> group of regulars.|$|R

The female was identified as Corethrella sp. of family Chaoboridae. The reddish meals in the mid-guts of ten females were examined with the benzidine tests (Hemastix) for hemoglobin, and they were confirmed to be apparently blood. Williams and Edman (1968) reported that some individuals of North American species of Corethrella brakeleyi and C. wirthi contained avian and mammalian bloods in their stomachs. This finding seemed to be the second record of blood feeding in the family Chaoboridae. This species will be described as a new to science elsewhere...|$|R

5000|$|The {{intent of}} the decoy was to catch large numbers of waterfowl. A decoy or fake duck was used <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> birds onto <b>a</b> <b>small</b> patch of water. The pond was {{equipped}} with a long cone-shaped wickerwork tunnel. A [...] "decoyman" [...] with a trained dog then herded the birds into the tunnel. Once the birds had been trapped in the tunnel, they could then be caught as required. Originally, the birds trapped here were a source of food. The advantage over simply shooting the birds was that ducks caught by this method did not have pellets or lead shot in their bodies {{that would have to}} be removed prior to consumption, allowing them to command higher prices. Today, the National Trust organise demonstrations, and any birds caught are ringed for ornithological study.|$|R

Seeking ever to hear the authoritative voice of God within them, and endeavouring to attain to a life altogether free from carnal desires, like that of [...] "the angels in heaven, who neither marry nor are given in marriage," [...] they claimed to exercise a priesthood [...] "after the order of Melchizedek," [...] appeasing the wrath of God, and ransoming the souls of the lost by sufferings endured vicariously after the example of Christ.|$|R
5000|$|In 1647 Fox {{began to}} preach publicly: in market-places, fields, {{appointed}} meetings {{of various kinds}} or even sometimes [...] "steeple-houses" [...] after the service.

It is not clear at what point the Society of Friends was formed but there was certainly {{a group of people}} who often travelled together. At first, they called themselves [...] "Children of the Light" [...] or [...] "Friends of the Truth", and later simply [...] "Friends". Fox seems to have had no desire to found a sect but only to proclaim what he saw as the pure and genuine principles of Christianity in their original simplicity, though he afterward showed great prowess as a religious legislator in the organization he gave to the new society.|$|E
5000|$|The Publius Enigma is an Internet {{phenomenon}} (and potentially an unsolved problem) {{that began}} with cryptic messages posted by a user identifying only as [...] "Publius" [...] to the unmoderated Usenet newsgroup alt.music.pink-floyd through the Penet remailer, a now defunct anonymous information exchange service. The messenger proposed a riddle {{in connection with the}} 1994 Pink Floyd album The Division Bell, promising that the answer would lead to a reward. Pink Floyd's lead singer, David Gilmour, denied any involvement while album artist Storm Thorgerson was bemused by the ordeal. Drummer Nick Mason claimed that EMI Records were ultimately responsible. It remains unclear if the enigma involves a genuinely solvable puzzle as part of an early Internet-based contest or was a convoluted hoax engineered in part by the band's management. Regardless, the mystery continues <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> but loyal cult following.|$|E
50|$|Born in Jerusalem, he {{was sent}} as a {{representative}} and arbitrator by the Jerusalem community to Russia in an important European rabbinic dispute. The outbreak of World War I prevented his return to Palestine. In 1915 he went to Boston to collect tzedakah and decided {{to stay in the}} city and become a Rebbe. He managed <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> group of followers but soon left Boston for New York. He became known for his love of his fellow Jew and his uncompromising adherence to the highest standards of rabbinic law. In the classic Chasidic tradition, he traveled to many Jewish communities throughout the northeast, spending special weekends infusing spirituality and Chasidic warmth in the lives of many Jews. Religious Jews from as far as San Francisco would travel to Boston to spend Sabbath and the holidays with their Rebbe (Chasidic leader). In 1939 Rabbi Pinchas D. Horowitz relocated his congregation to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, remaining there until his death on November 28, 1941.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} decades, sport {{activities were}} hold only in {{local and regional}} areas and they used <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> group of people. These activities were mostly far from professionalism and mainly amateurish. Reaching many people took too much time. After the developments in technology and especially in mass communication systems, all sportive branches have started to reach much more people. Today, sport activities are followed by many people. The sport activities today are not only a sport but also a sector which run millions of dollars. Because of these developments, a concept called as “sport industry” has emerged. Especially football and other specific branches of sports such as basketball, volleyball and baseball have started to reach much more people. Male and female athletes in this industry have become well-known stars. Big companies have signed sponsorship agreements with world-famous stars and teams, and by this way they have started to market their products to the target consumers. Many of old and big companies have realized {{the positive effect of}} sport on the people. So, they have tried to introduce themselves in global market through some of sport clubs or organizations. Many old companies in the world have been applying this strategy for marketing. This strategy is getting more popular day by day. By developing technology and globalization, big Turkish companies have tended to provide sport sponsorships. As a typical example, Turkish Airlines Corporation has been trying to increase its brand familiarity and reliability through advertisement for 10 years. In this study in which the sponsorship activities of THY are examined, the explorational research type that is mostly used with case research, has been carried out by deepening the information collected from secondary data. Marketing and sponsorship activities which were used by THY have been analyzed, and material and immaterial values gained by THY by means of these activities have been thoroughly examined. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} 1800 to 1827 {{there were three}} streams of Baptists in Scotland: Scotch, Haldaneite and 'English' Baptists. Scotch Baptists were {{distinguishable}} by their belief in the plurality of elders and a desire for unanimity in doctrine and practice. Haldaneite Baptists were a network of churches that came into being, in the period 1808 to 1810, after Robert and James Haldane adopted Baptist principles in 1808. 1 laldaneites, like the 'English' Baptists who had close ties to English Particular Baptists, normally held to a 'sole pastor and deacons' model of church leadership. A strong commitment to home evangelisation brought these three bodies closer together, leading to a merger of their home mission societies to form the Baptist Home Missionary Society for Scotland (B. H. M. S.). The B. H. M. S. was a marked success, with workers over much of rural Scotland, especially the Highlands and Islands, leading some Scottish Baptists to view the society as a 'Baptist Union' prior to 1869. The majority of Scottish Baptists, however, felt {{the need for a}} separate union of churches, but disagreement over the aims and objectives of a union led to three unsuccessful merger attempts. The first Baptist Union was an exclusively Calvinistic body, but it foundered due to personal conflict between its leaders. The second attempt, 1835 <b>to</b> 1842, <b>attracted</b> only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> proportion of churches, mainly small Highland congregations. The next Baptist Union, 1843 to 1856, began on an inclusive basis and prospered until 1847. Its leader, Francis Johnston, influenced by militant Morisonians, moved to an exclusive Arminian Union by 1850, excluding the majority of the churches. Failure was inevitable, and acknowledged as early as 1852. The successful union, formed in 1869, was preceded by an association of individual Baptists which rebuilt trust between the church leaders. The decisive factor, in the late I 860 s, that ensured the completion of this vision, was the presence {{of a large number of}} ministers trained in Spurgeon's College, London. They had seen the success of the newly formed London Baptist Association and inspired their colleagues in Scotland to form a similarly practical and inclusive body. The 1869 Baptist Union prospered in the last quarter of the nineteenth century...|$|R

The music in the book was numbered as were the keys on the organ itself. Jose proceeded to play all of the tunes in the book one after the other. He played through the whole book and being a Saturday the store was very busy and his playing began <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> crowd of people intently listening to the little boy at the keyboards.

His mother said to his father, [...] "You should buy this organ."…and his dad agreed. Jose was self-taught eventually going through the whole Sears Magnus Harmonica Corporation Chord organ library of music books. The organ had 12 chord buttons and a 3-octave keyboard which he played for two years. At age 11, his parents bought him his first full sized organ which was a Hammond organ Spinet Blonde Model M3. Finally he started taking formal keyboard lessons at the Lyon & Healy store downtown Chicago with Paul Renard (who later went on to create [...] "The Music Dynamics Method for Sight Reading", became a staff organist for the Hammond Organ Company and was co‐inventor with Howard Holman of the electric piano which was developed in 1954 at the Wurlitzer Company in Chicago, Illinois...Sun Ra was the first musician to record with an electric piano, the Wurlitzer, for his 1956 recording Angels and Demons at Play.)
