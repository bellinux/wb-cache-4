500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25. However, {{in the early}} stages of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. It was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly, when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, she fell down to the floor. However Madonna then continued the performance as planned. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine". Richard Smirke from Billboard praised the performance and Madonna's recovery, saying that [...] " [...] didn't let the fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored the matador theme of her recent Grammy Awards performance." [...] Madonna explained on The Jonathan Ross Show that she was told to start walking towards the stage further than originally planned. Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> compos mentis". The singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core strength and her daily exercise routine. The accident led to an increase in viewership of the awards show. According to the British Phonographic Industry, the event resulted a 95% increase in Twitter activity about the show compared with the previous year, with an exchange of 7.8million tweets, while 6.8million viewers tuned in to watch the performance. The singer's fall was voted the most shocking [...] "Celebrity Moment of 2015" [...] by UK's Channel 5.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, they do," [...] replied Tommy, [...] "I walked {{three miles}} {{to see one}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> near putting in another {{beautiful}} bit about weeping-willows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was coming}} round <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite through with your case, but it's tolerably evident {{you have no}} more use for me," [...] he said. [...] "Stopping here?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Blanche was {{a little}} embarrassed when Rivers replied: [...] "I don't like to agree to do that. Mebbe you'd better come over <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blue Cañon! She {{went to the}} missionary. Nas Ta Bega, I thought I saw her there. But I wasn't sure. I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{afraid it}} might be true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{made her}} {{bring me the}} letters?' he asked himself. It was a very unusual attention. His heart replied, very sullen and shameful: 'She wanted to know; she wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> all right.' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had only}} come, after all, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> asleep and had heard nothing. Whatever this {{business}} {{might be on}} which they were engaged, they evidently meant to conduct it with the utmost secrecy. Whatever these things meant, they did not mean murder.|$|E
60|$|He {{replied that}} it was, adding that if <b>I</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> might move {{a few feet}} over in his direction. He also called me an opprobrious name.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will see}} presently," [...] rejoined Earl. [...] "Read it aloud. Uncle writes such a twisted hand, <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> read aright." [...] And Randy started at once:-- ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} it closely. The paper bore our Florentine water-mark, and was written with a Spread-Eagle. 'I type-wrote it,' I answered, gazing at it with care <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{recognised}} it.|$|R
60|$|Again this {{wonderful}} horse amazed me. He pointed his alert and quivering ears {{at me and}} followed with never {{so much as a}} single start or shying bound. He seemed to reason that as I had led him through many dangers safely I could still be trusted. Around us huge trucks rattled, electric cars clanged, railway engines whizzed and screamed, but Ladrone never so much as tightened the rein; and when in the dark of the chute (which led {{to the door of the}} car) he put his soft nose against me <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still with him, my heart grew so tender that I would not have left him behind for a thousand dollars.|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{talking like}} Christian and Faithful by the way, he and I came down upon a hamlet by the Tarn. It {{was but a}} humble place, called La Vernede, {{with less than a}} dozen houses, and a Protestant chapel on a knoll. Here he dwelt; and here, at the inn, I ordered my breakfast. The inn was kept by an {{agreeable}} young man, a stone-breaker on the road, and his sister, a pretty and engaging girl. The village schoolmaster dropped in to speak with the stranger. And these were all Protestants--a fact which pleased me more than I should have expected; and, what pleased me still more, they seemed all upright and simple people. The Plymouth Brother hung round me with a sort of yearning interest, and returned at least thrice <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> enjoying my meal. His behaviour touched me deeply at the time, and even now moves me in recollection. He feared to intrude, but he would not willingly forego one moment of my society; and he seemed never weary of shaking me by the hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{were others}} coming, and {{presently}} a little group of perhaps {{eight or ten}} of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> real. There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, {{there was something in}} these pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{original}} lyrics, Reed said, [...] "Jesus. Best left forgotten. Obviously, I didn't {{want to use}} real names yet. <b>I</b> probably wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> wasn't using a name that really meant something to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|With Souths {{unwilling to}} match the offer from Wests Tigers, Pettybourne joined his new club from 2013. Pettybourne said, [...] "Madge and the {{coaching}} staff {{said they wanted to}} keep me, but it was my choice. I just bought a house so I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> comfortable paying it off, but it was more for my family." [...] Pettybourne stayed at the Wests Tigers for one season, playing in 12 games and failing to score any points.|$|E
5000|$|The first African-American {{family to}} move to Kenilworth, the Calhouns, was met with {{resistance}} from some in the community, such as a cross burning and racially charged vandalism, while others voiced shock over the offenses. However, most residents expressed {{their support for the}} family. Walter Calhoun, a young student and athlete at the time, recalls [...] "They bent over backwards <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never left out." [...] Four years after the shocking incident, two teenagers visited Harold Calhoun in his downtown office where they confessed and apologized for the cross burning.|$|E
5000|$|Bryan was {{committing}} suicide under a train. He {{came up on}} to the platform and introduced himself. I said: [...] "How nice to meet you, Mr Forbes. There’s a chance I might be in your film." [...] He said: [...] "Well, I’m afraid {{this is the last}} day of shooting. They’ve brought you here under false pretences." [...] He drove me home <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> OK - and that was it... So, at the age of 17, I did the cleverest thing I’ve ever done: said yes when Bryan asked me to marry him. I don’t think I’ve topped that.|$|E
5000|$|Although he {{remained}} an Iowa State signee, he began visiting other schools [...] "just … <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> a good decision". He made official visits to Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Ole Miss, before eventually committing to Alabama.|$|R
5000|$|One of Corbett's most {{distinctive}} features is her tattooed arms, {{which include a}} pair of scissors wrapped in thread, a sewing needle, measuring tape, and safety pins. The 'craft tattoos' remind her of “what I do and why and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> keep going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Fates {{arranged}} it otherwise," [...] {{answered the}} Scot. [...] "I felt afraid that my fears might weaken my arm. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> {{gave him a}} good thrust.

5000|$|Though Kara {{focused on}} {{producing}} his work, {{he did have}} several notable showings and his work appeared in locations around California. In 1965, his sculpture of Elizabeth Taylor was commissioned for and appeared in The Sandpiper. This film brought him exposure in Hollywood and beyond. [...] "Elizabeth came to see it <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not doing something outrageous. She approved," [...] Kara told Curtis. A short promotional film called Statue for the Sandpiper (an original movie promotion) features Kara in action. He was flown to the unveiling in Paris where the actors and producers viewed and commented on the piece.|$|E
5000|$|A perfect result. There {{was a bit}} of a rush at {{the start}} as {{everybody}} went out on the track to take advantage while it was still dry. I was probably able to read the conditions better than everybody else and managed to be very quick in the middle sector. I had my second run towards the end because the surface can dry very quickly and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a position to take advantage and defend my pole position if necessary. The race tomorrow will be very close but I want the ten points. David Coulthard, following the qualifying session.|$|E
5000|$|Johnson {{elaborated}} to the Herald Sun on how his son Moe (3-years-old at {{the time}} this was written) inspired this song: [...] "He was drinking a lot of soya milk {{at the time}}. I told him if he kept drinking too much, he would grow a tail with an eyeball at the end. He looked at me trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> kidding. When he figured that out, he attached his elbow to his butt and pointed his finger around the room. He had made this tail with an eyeball. He pointed at me and said, 'Dad, you look good.' I {{thought that was a}} sweet thing to say." ...|$|E

I'm not trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> myself out <b>to</b> be a martyr because this is my choice.|$|R
2500|$|Van Brocklin, a heavy {{cigarette}} smoker, {{suffered a}} number of illnesses, including a brain tumor. [...] After it was removed, he told the press, [...] "It was a brain transplant.

5000|$|After {{the poor}} {{commercial}} {{performance of their}} debut album, Aim and Ignite, Fun decided to put Jeff Bhasker as producer for their second studio effort. The band's frontman, Nate Ruess, met with Bhasker at his hotel in New York City in February 2011. Ruess was anxious about meeting Bhasker, so he arrived early at the bar in the Bowery Hotel on the Lower East Side [...] "and had a little to drink just <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> loosened up." [...] According to Bhasker, he wasn't really wanting to meet the band, as he [...] "was working with Beyoncé, and also with Alicia, Kanye and Jay-Z, and doing {{this had been a}} big goal in my life. I had no intention of being distracted." ...|$|E
5000|$|Madonna's live {{return to}} BRIT Awards after 20 years was widely {{promoted}} {{in the media}} {{in the days leading}} up to the ceremony and during the show itself. During the performance of [...] "Living for Love", she walked onstage wearing an oversized cape. When standing on stairs situated on the stage, the cape's cord failed to separate, so when Madonna's backing dancer pulled the cape behind her, she fell down the stairs and noticeably hit the stage hard. She paused momentarily as her backing music continued, before she managed to separate herself from the cape and then continued performing. In an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show, Madonna blamed her fall on a wardrobe malfunction as her cape had been tied too tightly so it could not be unfastened in time, before adding: [...] "I had a little bit of whiplash, I smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3am <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> compos mentis. I know how to fall, I have fallen off my horse many times." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bowyer {{appeared}} in victory lane after his victory lap to start celebrating his second win of the season, {{and his first}} Sprint Cup Series win at Talladega Superspeedway. He also earned $226,450 in race winnings. [...] "Kevin coming {{on the outside and}} Juan (Montoya) pushing me got me to the lead. I turned (Marcos Ambrose) around and got into my teammate (Harvick) and I was sick about that but here he came {{at the end of the}} race," [...] said Bowyer of his triumph. He also stated, [...] "I thought we had it for sure. When two cars hook up, they just drive off from them and they and Reutimann were coming on the outside and ran us down, and then I quit dragging my brakes and we kind of took off again. Door to door there and all of a sudden ... Mike Dillon is yelling at me in my ear that the caution was coming out. I looked over <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ahead of him. I thought I was, but I didn't know." [...] Harvick was happy for his teammate after the race, saying, [...] "About 6 inches ... It's just one of those deals where we've won a few by a few inches and we've lost a few. It's hard to complain because you can wind up on the wrecker pretty easy. Happy we kept the trophy at RCR. If you're going to lose to somebody, it's good to lose to your teammates and keep the trophy and the money in the right house." [...] Johnson, who finished seventh, was optimistic as he left the race leading the point standings: [...] "It's going to be an awesome championship battle all the way to Homestead, and I'm really looking forward to it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “It {{was kind}} of {{interesting}} to watch it in the mirror,” Logano said of Harvick trying to pass him in the closing laps. “I was watching him drive in and I was like, ‘He’s {{going to get me}} eventually,’ so <b>I</b> just wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> stayed at least three or four car lengths up on him so he didn’t get to me.” ...|$|R
