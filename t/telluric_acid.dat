40|$|<b>Telluric</b> <b>acid</b> {{ammonium}} phosphate (TAAP) {{is a new}} class-m ferroelectric with a transition temperature of $ 45 ^ 0 C$. Recent Raman spectroscopy studies of this crystal suggest that the phase transition takes place predominantly by the order-disorder nature of the hydrogen bonds of the type N-H-O. The hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics {{are known to be}} very sensitive to external pressure and deuteration. In view of this, the effect of hydrostatic pressure on ferroelectric properties of TAAP has been studied up to 6 kbar. It was found that $T_c$ shifts to lower temperatures under the influence of external pressure. At low pressures, $T_c$ decreases more rapidly than at high pressures. The pressure derivative evaluated from the linear portion of the curve is $- 2. 69 ^ 0 C kbar^{- 1 }$. The effect of pressure on the spontaneous polarisation is to reduce its value although the continuous nature of the transition does not undergo any change up to the maximum pressure employed. These results and the shift of $T_c$ to higher temperature upon deuteration support the order-disorder nature of the hydrogen bonds during the phase transition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This work {{presents}} a detailed {{investigation of the}} preparation of MoVTeNbOx catalysts by hydrothermal synthesis. Phase-pure synthesis of M 1 has been achieved applying the metals in a molar ratio Mo/V/Te/Nb = 1 / 0. 25 / 0. 23 / 0. 12. Raman, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and SEM/EDX analysis show that the elements are inhomogeneously dis-tributed in the initial suspension that is formed after mixing the metal salts in an aqueous medium. Iso- and heteropoly anions of molybdenum, free <b>telluric</b> <b>acid</b> as well as supra-molecular polyoxometalate clusters are observed in the solution, whereas all metals {{have been found in}} the pre-cipitate. Complete rearrangement of molecular building blocks under hydrothermal conditions is essential for for-mation of phase-pure materials. Optimized synthesis conditions with respect to temperature and time result in the formation of a precursor consisting of nano-structured M 1 characterized by an extended periodic organization in the [001] direction and a fairly homogeneous distribution of the elements. Residual ammonium containing supra-molecular species in the precursor result in the formation of phase mixtures during the subsequent crystallization by heat treatment in inert gas. Phase-pure M 1 exhibits a dis-tinct degree of flexibility with respect to the chemical composition that becomes obvious by incorporating Nb not exclusively into pentagonal bi-pyramidal units, but also into octahedral coordinated positions as shown by EXAFS. Anisotropic growth of the needle-like M 1 crystals has been observed during the final heat treatment performed at 873 – 923 K in inert atmosphere disclosing a potential method to control the catalytic properties of MoVTeNbOx catalysts...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} effort in Malaysia to develop a novel {{catalyst}} material that converts the vast natural resources of palm oil into higher valued oleochemicals through selective oxidation. Molybdenum oxide based catalysts are highly suitable for such processes and empirical optimization of the catalyst by doping with foreign cations has far reached a high level. The current material with outstanding activity for propane and propene selective oxidation is MoVTeNb Oxide [1]. The reason for its high activity is considered to lie in structural arrangement of the material and the huge variety of Mo-O bond lengths. Two phases are identified, {{the first one is}} pseudo hexagonal and the second one is orthorhombic with pentagonal bipyramides as general features. Whilst the calcined catalyst has been extensively investigated, the formation mechanism of such structures is still completely unknown. The aim of this work is to prepare tailored catalyst material by using Nano Technology (Bottom up Approach) to assemble molecular units of molybdates to supramolecular structures. Understanding such a process is only successful, if the chemical complexity of the system is significantly reduced by at the same time maintaining the structural complexity. The current preparation routine for MoVTeNb Oxides is the “slurry method”, in which a mixture of solid and liquid phases (slurry) is spray dried and calcined. Such procedure is extremely complex, as it is affected by a multitude of variables. Reproducibility and catalyst optimization can only be successfully achieved if every synthesis parameter is understood. EXPERIMENTAL Mo 1 V 0. 33 Te 0. 22 Nb 0. 11 Ox was prepared according to the method mentioned in the literature. Two solutions were prepared, the first one containing appropriate amounts of ammonium heptamolybdate, ammonium metavandate and <b>telluric</b> <b>acid</b> that were heated to 80 °C, and the second one niobium oxalate. The two solutions were combined at 40 °C, leading to precipitation of slurry, as described in the literature. This slurry was spray dried and calcined first in air at 275 °C for two hours and subsequently in helium at 600 °C for another two hours. The resulting black material was analyzed by XRD and TEM. In order to study the effect of every metal compound single and binary solutions prepared and analysed by Raman spectroscopy. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Raman spectrum of the combined MoVTe solution (solution 1) showed a new terminal Mo=O band at 1006 cm- 1 that is not found in the Raman spectra of the single compounds. In addition the band at 648 cm- 1 that is characteristic for <b>telluric</b> <b>acid</b> was diminished. This data indicates a chemical reaction during the mixing and heating process, in which tellurium could have been incorporated into the heptamolybdate units, as observed in (NH 4) 6 (Mo 6 TeO 24) (TeOH) 6 (H 2 O) 7 single crystals [2]. Addition of niobium oxalate leads to precipitation. As in the synthesis process of the similar system of Mo(VW) 5 O 14, a mechanism involving formation of oligomolybdates through connection via linker atoms (Nb in this case) can be proposed. The spray-dried solid containing Mo, V, Te and Nb shows the main Raman bands of AHM (slightly shifted), but also the additional band at 1006 cm- 1, indicating that the structure developed in solution was preserved. Both the spray dried material and the precalcined material are poorly crystalline. Crystallization only occurred after calcination in inert gas at 600 °C. Analysis by XRD and TEM confirms the existence of the major phases M 1 and M 2, described in the literature. REFERENCES 1. P. DeSanto Jr., D. J. Buttrey, R. K. Grasselli, C. G. Lugmair, A. F.

DMo-V-Nb-Te-O {{mixed metal}} oxides are the most {{efficient}} catalysts for new alkane-fed processes leading to some important C 2 and C 3 compounds in the chemical industry, such as ethylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile [1]. The purpose {{of this research is}} to study factors influencing the morphology of the orthorhombic M 1 phase catalyst. Control of the crystallite dimensions of the desired catalyst phase, M 1, requires control of composition and impurity phase content. The M 1 phase was synthesized by mixing ammonium vanadate, ammonium heptamolybdate, <b>telluric</b> <b>acid,</b> and ammonium niobium oxalate in sequence, similar to a procedure used earlier by PhD student Xin Li [2, 3]. The M 1 phase was observed for calcination temperatures between 575 °C and 625 °C and for several starting compositions. The lower V/Mo ratios, longer calcination times, or close proximity to the limits of calcination temperature produced higher-purity crystalline M 1 phase, as long as all conditions fall within reasonable ranges. Higher calcination temperatures resulted in increased crystal size along the c-axis. One of our goals is to obtain crystallites with small dimension along c-axis, but large dimensions perpendicular to c-axis, since the catalytically active surface is oriented perpendicular to c-axis. For this reason, reducing the c/ab_average ratio is a priority. Under the same element ratio, pH, and argon calcination time, 550 °C argon calcination is found to be near optimal to approach the goal. For temperatures below 500 °C, for the calcination temperature, the Mo-V-Nb-Te-O {{mixed metal oxides}} did not crystalize very well. The pentagonal ring building-blocks found in the M 1 phase do not fully self-assemble if the calcination temperature is too low or if there is insufficient time for growth; they exist only as disordered clusters [4]. These disordered products are much less active than the well-ordered orthorhombic M 1 phase. Increasing the calcination time up to 96 h for this sample did not result in a well-ordered orthorhombic M 1 structure. Without adjusting the precursor solution pH, all samples prepared to date contain the desired M 1 phase along with another phase, known as M 2, as pseudo-hexagonal tungsten bronze-type (HTB-type) impurity. The M 1 phase cannot be crystallized from precursor solutions with pH above about 3. 5. For precursor solutions with pH < 2, the product becomes highly sintered after calcination and likely does not contain the M 1 phase. The sample could not be ground into powder for XRD analysis, so the phase content has not yet been characterized. It appears that the M 1 phase is only stable within the pH range 2. 8 - 3. 5.
