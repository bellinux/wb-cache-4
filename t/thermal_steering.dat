40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this paper}} is to report thermal {{dosimetry}} characteristics of external deep regional pelvic hyperthermia combined with intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) for treating bladder cancer following transurethral resection of bladder tumour, and to use thermal data to evaluate reliability of delivering the prescribed hyperthermia dose to bladder tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 14 patients were treated with MMC and deep regional hyperthermia (BSD- 2000, Sigma Ellipse or Sigma 60). The hyperthermia objective was 42 °[*]±[*] 2 [*]°C to bladder tissue for ≥ 40 [*]min per treatment. Temperatures were monitored with thermistor probes and recorded values were used to calculate thermal dose and evaluate treatment. Anatomical characteristics were examined for possible correlations with heating. RESULTS: Combined with BSD- 2000 standard treatment planning and patient feedback, real-time temperature monitoring allowed <b>thermal</b> <b>steering</b> of heat sufficient to attain the prescribed thermal dose to bladder tissue within patient tolerance in 91. 6...|$|E

Diverse technologies, from catalyst coking to graphene synthesis, entail hydrocarbon dehydrogenation and condensation reactions on metals, and assembly into carbon overlayers. Imperative to gaining control over these processes, through <b>thermal</b> <b>steering</b> of the formation ofpolyaryl intermediates and the controlled prevention of coking, is the exploration and elucidation of the detailed reaction scheme that starts with adsorbed hydrocarbons and culminates with the formation of extended graphene. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy, high-resolution electron energy loss and thermal desorption spectroscopies, in combination with theoretical simulations to uncover the hierarchy of pathways and intermediates underlying the catalyzed evolution of ethene adsorbed on Rh(111) to form graphene. These investigations allow formulation of a reaction scheme whereby, upon heating, adsorbed ethene evolves via coupling reactions to form segmented one-dimensional polyaromatic hydrocarbons (1 D-PAH). Further heating leads to dimensionality crossover (1 D→ 2 D) and dynamical restructuring processes at the PAH chain ends, with subsequent activated detachment of size-selective carbon clusters. Rate-limiting diffusional coalescence of these dynamically self-evolved precursors culminates (≤ 1000 K) in condensation into graphene of high structural perfection. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
