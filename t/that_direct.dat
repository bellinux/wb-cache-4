5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} challenge the civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, Arthur Garfield Hays and Norman Thomas, believed <b>that</b> <b>direct,</b> militant action was the best path. Hays {{was the first of}} many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU. Another group, including Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change. Both groups worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Wurster's and Ganzert's visit to the site, the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the {{springing}} line of the vaults. No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert.

5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed <b>that</b> <b>direct</b> experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by declaring that the real heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. The Militia often claims <b>that</b> <b>direct</b> action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E
5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe <b>that</b> <b>direct</b> appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E

5|$|According to the Bermuda Weather Service, {{the islands}} of Bermuda {{experience}} a damaging tropical cyclone once every six to seven years, on average. Due to the small area of the island chain, landfalls and direct hits are rare. Strictly speaking, only nine landfalls have occurred during years included in the official Atlantic hurricane database, starting in 1851. When hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo struck Bermuda just days apart in October 2014, that season became the first to produce two landfalls. Two damaging storms impacted Bermuda in September 1899, but {{the center of the}} first storm narrowly missed the islands. Tropical cyclones, and their antecedent or remnant weather systems, have affected the territory in all seasons, most frequently in the late summer months. A study of recorded storms from 1609 to 1996 found <b>that</b> <b>direct</b> hits from hurricanes were most common in early September and late October, with an intervening relative lull creating two distinct 'seasons'.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree <b>that</b> <b>direct</b> laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{had earlier}} taken several {{measures}} to oppose Gray and the FHLBB, including recruiting {{a study from}} then-private economist Alan Greenspan saying <b>that</b> <b>direct</b> investments were not harmful, and getting President Ronald Reagan to make a recess appointment of a Keating ally, Atlanta real estate developer Lee H. Henkel Jr., to an open seat on the FHLBB. By March 1987, however, Henkel had resigned, upon news of his having large loans due to Lincoln. Meanwhile, the Senate had changed control from Republican to Democratic during the 1986 Congressional elections, placing several Democratic senators in key positions, and starting in January 1987, Keating's staff was putting pressure on Cranston to remove Gray from any FHLBB discussion regarding Lincoln. The following month, Keating began large-scale contributions into Cranston's project to increase California voter registration. In February 1987, Keating met with Riegle and began contributing to Riegle's 1988 re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|The crocodilian {{has perhaps}} the most complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have heart valves <b>that</b> <b>direct</b> blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary oedema, or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|The {{small number}} of Roman and Byzantine coins found during {{excavations}} of Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites from this era suggests <b>that</b> <b>direct</b> trade with the Sogdians remained limited. This was {{despite the fact that}} ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk, and discoveries in contemporary tombs indicate that the Han-dynasty Chinese imported Roman glassware. Valerie Hansen wrote in 2012 that no Roman coins from the Roman Republic (507–27 BC) or the Principate (27 BC – 284 AD) era of the Roman Empire have been found in China. Warwick Ball (2016) highlights a discovery at Xi'an, China (the site of the Han capital Chang'an) where a hoard of sixteen Roman coins from the reigns of Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD) have been discovered. The Roman coins found at Óc Eo, Vietnam, near Chinese-controlled Jiaozhou, date to the mid-2nd century AD. A coin of Maximian (r. 286–305 AD) was also discovered in Tonkin. Roman coins of the 3rd and 4th centuries AD have been discovered in Japan; they were unearthed from Katsuren Castle (in Uruma, Okinawa), which was built from the 12th to 15th centuries AD.|$|E
5|$|It appears, however, <b>that</b> <b>direct</b> {{trade with}} the Sogdians {{remained}} limited {{in light of the}} small amount of Roman and Byzantine coins found in Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites belonging to this era. Although Roman embassies apparently reached Han China from 166 AD onwards, and the ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk while the Han-dynasty Chinese imported Roman glasswares as discovered in their tombs, Valerie Hansen (2012) wrote that no Roman coins from the Roman Republic (507–27 BC) or the Principate (27 BC – 330 AD) era of the Roman Empire have been found in China. However, Warwick Ball (2016) upends this notion by pointing to a hoard of sixteen Roman coins found at Xi'an, China (formerly Chang'an), dated to the reigns of various emperors from Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD). The earliest gold solidus coins from the Eastern Roman Empire found in China date to the reign of Byzantine emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450) and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found (compared to thirteen-hundred silver coins) in Xinjiang and the rest of China. The use of silver coins in Turfan persisted long after the Tang campaign against Karakhoja and Chinese conquest of 640, with a gradual adoption of Chinese bronze coinage {{over the course of the}} 7th century. The fact that these Eastern Roman coins were almost always found with Sasanian Persian silver coins and Eastern Roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like talismans confirms the pre-eminent importance of Greater Iran in Chinese Silk Road commerce of Central Asia compared to Eastern Rome.|$|E
