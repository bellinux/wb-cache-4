The Naga insurgency in northwest India had begun in the 1950s. The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed. In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded {{with a series of}} attacks, which killed 18 people.

5|$|Reading the {{deceased}} Surridge's journal, Finch learns V {{is the result}} of human experimentation and has been targeting the people who detained him. Despite being stonewalled by the government, Finch searches for the true identity of V, tracing him to a bioweapons program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him that the program, which was directed by Sutler (who was then Undersecretary of Defence), resulted {{in the creation of the}} deadly St. Mary's Virus. He further reveals that Creedy, a leader of the Norsefire Party, released the virus onto English soil, killing 100,000 British residents and framing the outbreak as an attack by a <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisation.</b> The Party, which promised security in times of social instability, used the ensuing wave of fear to elevate Sutler to the newly created office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in Parliament, becoming the elected government. Finch later discovers the man he met was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in the Norsefire government is severely shaken.|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} the attack the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) issued a statement. It was {{released}} under the heading Ulster Central Intelligence Agency â€“ Miami Showband Incident Report:A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus. As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At the precise moment of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire, killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting the South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA Forkhill boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are being treated for gunshot wounds after last night but not in hospital.It {{would appear that the}} UVF patrol surprised members of a <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisation</b> transferring weapons to the Miami Showband minibus and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that the killing of the three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to the relatives of the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the minibus.|$|E

40|$|Since September 11 th 2001 (9 / 11), {{substantial}} {{research has}} been conducted and published on the phenomenon of Islamist motivated militant terrorism; notably on the contemporary phenomenon of â€˜global Jihadismâ€™ and its growing threat to nations and the wider international community. However, little has analysed the different phases of â€˜ideological evolutionâ€™ and â€˜geopolitical transformationâ€™ manifested within the wider phenomenon itself. As a result, Islamist militant <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisations</b> are often lumped together and defined, or identified, as belonging to a single ideological and geopolitical homogenous movement. This study endeavours to highlight that not only is this notion incorrect, but that the phenomenon is threefold consisting of three fundamentally different ideological and geopolitical phases of Islamist militant terrorism and thus categories of Islamist militant <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisations</b> in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The three phases and categories of Islamist militant <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisations</b> are identified in the study as â€˜Nationalâ€™, â€˜Regionalâ€™ and â€˜Globalâ€™. Each comprises and represents different ideological contours and geopolitical ambitions. Collectively, these three phases and categories of organisations make up this studyâ€™s hypothesis that there have been three ideological and geopolitical sequential shifts in the phenomenon. The studyâ€™s sequential shift paradigm tracks the trajectory of the phenomenon beginning with the manifestation of National Islamist militant <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisations,</b> developing into Regional Islamist militant <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisations</b> and, finally, into Global Islamist militant <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisations.</b> The hypothesis is tested through an examination of Islamist militant <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisations</b> in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Here, the considered organisations are measured against the sequential shift paradigm, which provides key insight into their ideological and geopolitical contours. In turn, this helps to identify and categorise the National, Regional and Global phases and categories of Islamist militant <b>terrorist</b> <b>organisations</b> in the two considered regions and, therefore, further advances support for the studyâ€™s hypothesis. The analysis presented in this thesis on the phenomenon of Islamist militant terrorism finds that the studyâ€™s hypothesis applies and is analytically accurate {{in the context of the}} Middle East. In the context of Southeast Asia the analysis supports that there has been a shift from National to Regional Islamist militant terrorism but, however, that the third and hence Global phase of the phenomenon has thus far, although active in the region, failed to fully manifest. Therefore, the analysis presented in this thesis supports that the phenomenon of Islamist militant terrorism in Southeast Asia has not undergone a decisive ideological evolution or geopolitical transformation into Global Islamist militant terrorism...|$|R
