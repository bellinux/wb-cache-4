40|$|The {{combustion}} products of fuels containing the elements C, H, O, N and S are calculated. The methodology {{is based on}} the equations obtained in the stoichiometric balance of atoms. The adiabatic flame temperature is determined considering that the pressure of the boiler furnace remains constant. The scope of this work is limited to the analysis of natural gas (methane) with molecular formula CH 4 . The methodology can, however, be employed for the calculation of {{combustion products}} of a great variety of hydrocarbons under <b>the</b> <b>established</b> <b>restrictions.</b> In the development of the methodology two cases are contemplated: Φ ≤ 1 (lean and stoichiometric mixture) and Φ > 1 (rich mixture). In the first case it is considered that when the combustion is complete, the combustion products are O 2 , H 2 O, CO 2 , N 2 , SO 2 , and the solution follows directly. When the combustion is incomplete, however, the products H, O, N, H 2 , OH, CO, NO, O 2 , H 2 O, CO 2 , N 2 and SO 2 can be generated, according to Stephen R. Turns, (2000). When bal-ances of atoms are performed, four conservation equations are obtained, one for each of the C, O, H and N elements. An additional restriction requires that the sum of the molar fractions of the products equals one mol. Finally, seven equilibrium constants, corresponding to the seven chemical reactions of combustion, are introduced. All this provides a system of four nonlinear equations which is solved with the Newton-Raphson method...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{justification}} of {{substantial part of}} the concepts of "restrictions in land use", "encumbrances of land rights" as economic and legal categories is done. The common characteristics of these concepts are singled out based on the analysis of current legislation of Ukraine. These characteristics are following: 1) the restrictions and encumbrances are established {{for the use of}} land by its owners and users; 2) they are established in the framework provided by law or agreement; 3) they stay in force within the term established by law or contract; 4) change of legal of the land plot title does not terminate <b>the</b> <b>established</b> <b>restrictions</b> or encumbrances; 5) All restrictions in land use are a subject to state registration (Art. 110 Land Code of Ukraine). Based on the views systematization of domestic scientists and own views there are obvious need to justify a separation of overall concept of "restrictions in land use" and "encumbrances of land rights" into two separate concepts, taking into account the target criteria as the primary and as well the forms and grounds of their establishment to develop scientifically grounded definitions that reflect the specific attributes of these restrictions and encumbrances. Consequently, restrictions in land use and the encumbrances of land rights are separate economic and legal categories that do not depend on each other and limits of land rights and other natural resources. The author's definitions of the studied concepts are suggested. Restrictions in land use is a definition of the limits and conditions of land use and other natural resources (mode of land use) in socially significant interests (public benefit and safety, environmental, historical and cultural values, creating the necessary conditions for other state needs) in land management documentation on the basis of local authorities decisions or in court order. Restrictions in land use have territorial and individual character on a specified land plot. Encumbrance of land rights is the restriction of land rights by the law or act of authorized authority, by official or contract in the way of imposing a ban {{on the use of the}} land, including through its alienation as servitude or obligation adopted by land user voluntarily or in court order to ensure the legitimate interests of stakeholders, which are expressed in granting them additional rights and in laying the responsibilities on land user. Encumbrances of land rights arise only individually on specifically identified land plot and are in direct connection with this land plot and follow it in case of transfer of ownership of such land plot to another person. Using these concepts in research and law-making will differentiate the scope of their application in land and other relations...|$|E

The health status of each human represents the health demand and the medical goods and services are the supply. The role of the valuation studies in health economy is to favour a better use of the limited resources to the unlimited needs. The basic principles of a cost efficacy analysis are relatively simple.

Based on a traditional approach, the thrust reverse noise detection tool detects two consecutive sound events, and applies pattern recognition techniques for the classification of each of them (such as landing and thrust reverse). A second improvement refers to the use of a microphone array linked to a noisemonitoring unit, which enables tracking the direction of arrival of the sound, thus improving the classification rates. By taking the latter, it is also possible to track the aircraft location along the runway, which enables sound pressure measurements to be transformed into sound power level estimations.
