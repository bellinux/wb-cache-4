In the first place, Ado-Ekiti is situated at the heartland of Ekiti and is thus less exposed to cross-border attacks or non-Ekiti influences. Consequently, over many centuries, waves of immigrant groups seeking haven settled in Ado-Ekiti and several other Ado communities. Many of these immigrants were refugees, they left <b>their</b> <b>old</b> <b>homelands</b> in parts of Ekiti, Akoko, Owo etc. where their leaders lost out in chieftaincy contests. Some were war captives, these were brought in droves by Aduloju and his lieutenants from their slave wars of the 1870s and 1880s in parts of Owo, Ose and Akoko. They were settled in Ado communities where they increased the local population, and enriched the culture with their lineage names and festivals in similar circumstances, citizens of Ado communities left their fatherland and settled in a few places in the neighbourhood up to Ijesaland. Ibadan sacked many Ado communities in 1873 and made a huge haul of prisoners of war and other captives who eventually settled in Iwo, Ibadan and some Remo towns such as Iperu and Makun Sagamu. However, Ado communities especially the mother town offset part of their losses {{with a large number}} of slaves and prisoners of war from Owo, Ose and Akoko.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{highlights}} the {{multiple layers of}} how an Assyrian Christian minority group in Sweden constructs the image of ‘the Muslim’. The thesis contributes to a larger debate about diaspora, reconciliation, and local manifestations of Islamophobia by following the view of ‘the Muslim’ in a Syriac Orthodox Church in Gothenburg. The ethnographic study analyses how the congregational members tell of diasporic, collective memories of oppression and genocide committed by Muslims, and frames ‘the Muslim’ as a violent figure throughout history. Their narratives are also influenced by the Islamophobic discourse in Europe. The interlocutors draw on present day conflicts in <b>their</b> <b>old</b> <b>homelands</b> such as {{the civil war in}} Syria and Iraq, and the turmoil in Turkey. This amplifies their view of ‘the Muslim’ as static and radical, and thus ‘incompatible’ in Western society. When discussing individual Muslim friends, however, the interlocutors’ narratives are ambivalent and reflect an insight of Muslims as being children of their common God. Lastly, Christianity plays a vital and multifaceted role in the narratives of the Assyrian Christians; Christianity is in this study both the foundation of conflict and dichotomisation between Christians and Muslims, as well as the most potent source of reconciliation between these groups...|$|R

However, the children of these immigrants were not learning traditions of <b>their</b> <b>old</b> <b>homelands,</b> or of centuries-old aspects of Sephardic culture. In response to this situation, Albert Levy, editor of the Sephardic newspaper La Vara, recognized {{that he and his}} paper could help to build bridges between the first generation immigrants from the Second Diaspora and their American children. Thus, on August 31, 1934, Levy published the first English section page in La Vara, which had previously been printed exclusively in the Ladino language in Hebrew characters. The main goal of this page was to reach out to Sephardic youth who were increasingly primary English speakers. This strategic move to English succeeded in creating an open arena for Sephardic youth to gain access to Jewish, and more importantly Sephardic, issues. These issues led to the ultimate formation of their unique identity, which centered on access to education; the lack of unity among Jews in New York; concerns about anti-Semitism; concerns about nationalism; an interest in strong historical ties to other world Jewish communities; and cultivating Jewish-American identity as well as connections to the Hispanic community in the metropolitan region. This paper explores the complicated question of the identity of Sephardic American Jews based on the issues raised by La Vara, and discusses how and why Sephardic identity changed over time...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the responses of}} communities of south-eastern Zimbabwe to their eviction from the Gonarezhou National Park (GNP) and their forced settlement in the peripheral areas of the park. The thesis establishes that prior to their eviction, the people had created a utilitarian relationship with their fauna and flora which allowed responsible reaping of the forest s products. It reveals that {{the introduction of a}} people-out conservation mantra forced the affected communities to become poachers, to emigrate from south-eastern Zimbabwe in large numbers to South Africa for greener pastures and, to fervently join militant politics of the 1960 s and 1970 s. These forms of protests put them at loggerheads with the colonial government. The study reveals that the independence government s position on the inviolability of the country s parks put the people and state on yet another level of confrontation as the communities had anticipated the restitution of their ancestral lands. The new government s attempt to buy their favours by engaging them in a joint wildlife management project called CAMPFIRE only slightly relieved the pain. The land reform programme of the early 2000 s, again, enabled them to recover a small part of <b>their</b> <b>old</b> Gonarezhou <b>homeland.</b> The local people opposed the government s later attempt to create a transfrontier park with Mozambique and South Africa, arguing that it would further dislocate their lives. It is, therefore, the contention of this study that the establishment of the GNP created perpetual contestation by indigenous communities during the colonial and post-colonial periods.

For some older migrants, particularly those who have no home to go back to, and for those whose visit home makes them increasingly aware that they are tourists in <b>their</b> <b>old</b> <b>homeland,</b> Medjugorje becomes an imagined surrogate home. This place allows them to partake in spiritual peace, and immerse themselves in the superficial Croatian domesticity that locals are happy to provide as part of their servicing of tourists.

40|$|Nowadays {{diaspora}} becomes crucial issue {{once people}} actively involve in global world. In diasporic world, people inevitably engage {{with their new}} environment, adjust with the new life and adapt to the unaccustomed-yet habits. However, on {{the same time they}} will look back at <b>their</b> <b>old</b> <b>homeland</b> which is sometimes totally different from their new world. In that situation people will face the struggling condition to keep going with two different worlds by some process of negotiating, transforming, or even contesting. This paper aims at discussing the negotiation process experienced by the Asian Indian characters during their lives in America in Jhumpa Lahiri’s The Third and Final Continent and This Blessed House. As one of the ethnic groups which has been scattering throughout global world, Asian Indian people endure the situation when they are in in-betweeness in their daily lives. The short stories, which are parts of Lahiri’s short story collection, Interpreter of Maladies, concern mostly with the diasporic postcolonial topics. This paper draws the ideas of diaspora proposed by Steven Vertovec which mentions that diaspora can be as the type of consciousness, in which it is regarded as the dual or paradoxical nature. Through scrutinizing the wives and husbands characters in both short stories, the result shows that through some different ways, all the Asian Indian characters do both negotiation by adjusting to the new world [...] America, and old world [...] India. Both the Americaness and Indianess are reflected in their habits and apparatuses such as life styles, beliefs, foods, costumes, and others. The old world nostalgia, to which the characters feel deep meanings, have been created in some ways in their diasporic lives in the new world. Since the process of engaging two worlds is inherited through generations, the degree of in-betweeness is different among the characters. In The Third and Final Continent, since the characters can be categorized as the first generation of immigrant, their ties to the old world is bigger than those of the characters in This Blessed House. However, negotiation in diasporic life is a process, it may be different among persons, and it is fluid. Keywords : negotiation, diaspora, identity, old world, new world. ...|$|E

A recently published armorial from the library in Modena confirms this assumption both in terms of content and symbolism. Among 153 coats of arms, besides two constructed coats of arms of the Nemanjići, are ten land and 139 lineage arms, two complex coats of arms of the Radulovići, and an illustration containing their motto. A comparison has shown that it is one of the copies of the Korjenić-Neorićev grbovnik from 1595, made upon request of the Radulovići of Dubrovnik, who in the sixteenth century established themselves as shipowners, merchants and members of the prestigious Confraternity of St Anthony. The armorial is executed in coloured ink, by an inexperienced hand, while the artistry of the blazon and the accompanying illustrations lags behind the first Illyrian armorials, resembling most closely those in the Fojnica Armorial. The legend of the Bosnia-Hum noble descent, their origin from Dubrovačko Primorje, social status and connections with the Kingdom of Naples, link the Radulovići with the founders of the Illyrian Heraldry: the Ohmućević, Dolisti-Tasovčić, Korjenić-Neorićand Diničić. By the start of the seventeenth century, Radulovićbrothers came into possession of the feud and city of Polignano in Apulia, and with it the title of marquis.

The Radulovićarms is constructed on a homonymycally adopted arms of the Radijelovićlineage from the Korjenić-NeorićArmorial, whose complex variant includes another six arms from the same collection.

Predaja o bosansko-humskom podrijetlu, zavičajnost u Dubrovačkom primorju, socijalni status i veze s Napuljskim kraljevstvom svrstavaju kapetane i brodovlasnike Raduloviće u krug začetnika ilirske heraldike. Početkom 17. stoljeća kupuju feud i grad Polignano u Apuliji, stječu titulu markiza i trajno sele na novi posjed. Osnovu njihova grba čini homonimijski preuzet znamen Radijelovića iz Korjenić-Neorićeva grbovnika, a u njegovu kompleksnu varijantu uključeno je još šest grbova iz iste zbirke.

The armorial housed in Modena proves that, at the close of the seventeenth century, the Radulović had their own copy of the Illyrian Armorial, adapted to their needs and their family history. Although it is possible that the Radulović also had an older version of the armorial, this copy was most likely made for the most infl uential member of the lineage, Archbishop of Chieti and Cardinal Nikola Radulović (1627 - 1702) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Scottish immigrants {{settled in the}} South Island. All over New Zealand, the Scots developed different means to bridge the <b>old</b> <b>homeland</b> and the new. Many Caledonian societies were formed, well over 100 by the early twentieth century, who helped maintain Scottish culture and traditions. From the 1860s, these societies organised annual Caledonian Games throughout New Zealand. The Games were sports meets that brought together Scottish settlers and the wider New Zealand public. In so doing, the Games gave Scots a path to cultural integration as Scottish New Zealanders.|$|R
5000|$|Features {{characteristic}} {{of a number of}} locales in the East Slavic language space were noted as well, reflecting perhaps the heterogeneous origin of the Doukhobors' settlements in Molochna River after 1800, e.g., similarly to Belarusians, Doukhobor speakers don't palatalize r in [...] "редко" [...] (redko, 'seldom'). Remarkable was the dropping of the final -t in the 3rd person singular form of verbs. This can be considered a Ukrainian feature, and it is also attested in some Russian dialects spoken in Southern Ukraine (e.g., Nikolaev, not too far from the Doukhobors' <b>old</b> <b>homeland</b> on the Molochna).|$|R

50|$|After Scots and Frisian, {{the next}} closest {{relative}} is modern Low German {{of the eastern}} Netherlands and northern Germany, which was the <b>old</b> <b>homeland</b> of the Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain. Other less closely related living languages include Dutch, Afrikaans, German and the Scandinavian languages. Many French words are also intelligible to an English speaker, as English absorbed {{a tremendous amount of}} vocabulary from the Norman language after the Norman conquest and from French in later centuries; as a result, a substantial proportion of English vocabulary is very close to the French, with some slight spelling differences (word endings, use of old French spellings, etc.) and some occasional lapses in meaning.|$|R
