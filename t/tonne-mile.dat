50|$|This is, of course, {{appropriate}} to {{certain types of}} activities. It is of most use when considering 'piece-work', where the activity being managed consists of discrete activities having simple dependencies, and where other factors can be neglected. Therefore, adding another person to a packaging team will increase the output of that team in a predictable manner. In transport industry, this concept is superseded by passenger-mile and <b>tonne-mile</b> for better costing accuracy.|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{literature of}} industrial organization {{shows that the}} distances between consumers and firms have first-order implications for competitive outcomes whenever transportation costs are large. To assess these effects empirically, we develop a structural model of competition among spatially differentiated firms and introduce a GMM estimator that recovers the structural parameters with only regional-level data. We apply the model and estimator to the portland cement industry. The estimation fits, both in-sample and out-of-sample, demonstrate that the framework explains well the salient features of competition. We estimate transportation costs to be $ 0. 30 per <b>tonne-mile,</b> given diesel prices at the 2000 level, and show that these costs constrain shipping distances and provide firms with localized market power. To demonstrate policy-relevance, we conduct counter-factual simulations that quantify competitive harm from a hypothetical merger. We are able to map the distribution of harm over geographic space and identify the divestiture that best mitigates harm. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{estimator}} for models of competition among spatially differentiated firms. In contrast to existing methods (e. g., Houde (2009)), the estimator has flexible data requirements and is implementable with {{data that are}} observed at any level of aggregation. Further, the estimator {{is the first to}} be applicable to models in which firms price discriminate among consumers based on location. We apply the estimator to the portland cement industry in the U. S. Southwest over 1983 - 2003. We estimate transportation costs to be $ 0. 30 per <b>tonne-mile</b> and show that, given the topology of the U. S. Southwest, these transportation costs permit more geographically isolated plants to discriminate among consumers. We conduct a counterfactual experiment and determine that disallowing this spatial price discrimination would increase consumer surplus by $ 12 million annually, relative to a volume of commerce of $ 1. 3 billion. Heretofore it has not been possible examine the surplus implications of spatial price discrimination in specific, real-world settings; these implications have been known to be ambiguous theoretically since at least Gronberg and Meyer (1982) and Katz (1984) ...|$|E
