Residual and <b>trapped</b> <b>fuel</b> can {{polymerize}} or even carbonize at hot spots or in hot components. Even without hot spots, heavy fuels can create a petroleum residue, {{as can be seen}} in gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel tanks that have been in service for years. Rocket engines have cycle lifetimes measured in minutes or even seconds, preventing truly heavy deposits. However, rockets are much more sensitive to a deposit, as described above. Thus, kerosene systems generally entail more teardowns and overhauls, creating operations and labor expenses. This is a problem for expendable engines as well as reusable ones, because engines must be ground-fired some number of times before launch. Even cold-flow tests, in which the propellants are not ignited, can leave residues.|$|E
40|$|Processes {{of erosion}} and {{redeposition}} {{and their impact}} on plasma facing materials in devices for magnetically confined fusion are discussed. Volatile molecules formed in the erosion process are partly pumped out but the majority of species released from the wall components returns to the surface causing the modification of its morphology. Prompt redeposition and redeposition after global transport reduce the gross erosion at any surface. Detailed analysis shows that erosion and deposition can coexist on otherwise erosion-dominated surfaces due to local inhomogenities. The erosion yield of redeposited material of sub-monolayer thickness significantly differs from that observed for thick targets. On deposition dominated areas one observes the formation of thick co-deposits containing a mixture of <b>trapped</b> <b>fuel</b> atoms (hydrogen isotopes) and species removed originally from the wall. This leads to a large and long-term fuel accumulation (tritium inventory) in a device. Reduced mechanical integrity of such layers stimulates their flaking and peeling-off if a critical thickness has been reached. This, in turn, results in the formation of hydrogen-rich dust particles.

40|$|International audienceFusion fuel {{retention}} (trapping) {{and release}} (desorption) from plasma-facing components are critical issues for ITER and for any future industrial demonstration reactors such as DEMO. Therefore, understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind {{the retention of}} hydrogen isotopes in first wall and divertor materials is necessary. We developed an approach that couples dedicated experimental studies with modelling at all relevant scales, from microscopic elementary steps to macroscopic observables, {{in order to build}} a reliable and predictive fusion reactor wall model. This integrated approach is applied to the ITER divertor material (tungsten), and advances {{in the development of the}} wall model are presented. An experimental dataset, including focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, isothermal desorption, temperature programmed desorption, nuclear reaction analysis and Auger electron spectroscopy, is exploited to initialize a macroscopic rate equation wall model. This model includes all elementary steps of modelled experiments: implantation of fusion fuel, fuel diffusion in the bulk or towards the surface, fuel trapping on defects and release of <b>trapped</b> <b>fuel</b> during a thermal excursion of materials. We were able to show that a single-trap-type single-detrapping-energy model is not able to reproduce an extended parameter space study of a polycrystalline sample exhibiting a single desorption peak. It is therefore justified to use density functional theory to guide the initialization of a more complex model. This new model still contains a single type of trap, but includes the density functional theory findings that the detrapping energy varies as a function of the number of hydrogen isotopes bound to the trap. A better agreement of the model with experimental results is obtained when grain boundary defects are included, as is consistent with the polycrystalline nature of the studied sample. Refinement of this grain boundary model is discussed as well as the inclusion in the model of a thin defective oxide layer following the experimental observation of the presence of an oxygen layer on the surface even after annealing to 1300 [*]K...|$|E

As per pollutant emissions, a drastic reduction of unburned hydrocarbons between 32 % and 45 % was obtained with AFRBD (animal fat residue biodiesel). Particulate matter emissions were also reduced at low and medium load ranges, but no differences were detected at high loads.

40|$|International audienceA laboratory-scale {{swirling}} burner, presenting many similarities {{with gas}} turbines combustors, {{has been studied}} experimentally using Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) on OH radical and acetone vapor in order to characterize the flame stabilization process. These diagnostics show that the stabilization point rotates in the combustion chamber and that air and fuel mixing is not complete {{at the end of}} the mixing tube. Fuel mass fraction decays exponentially along the mixing tube axis and transverse profiles show a gaussian shape. However, radial pressure gradients tend to <b>trap</b> the <b>fuel</b> in the core of the vortex that propagates axially in the premixing tube. As the mixing tube vortex enters the combustion chamber, vortex breakdown occurs through a Precessing Vortex Core (PVC). The axially propagating vortex shows a helicoidal trajectory in the combustion chamber which trace is observed with transverse acetone PLIF. As a consequence, the stabilizing point of the flame in the combustion chamber rotates with the PVC structure. This phenomenon has been observed in the present study with a high speed camera recording spontaneous emission of the flame. The stabilization point rotation frequency tends to increase with mass flow rates. It was also shown that the coupling between the PVC and the flame stabilization occurs via mixing, explaining one possible coupling mechanism between acoustic waves in the flow and the reaction rate.

50|$|From an army manual on {{pile driving}} hammers:The initial start {{up of the}} hammer {{requires}} the piston (ram) to be raised {{to a point where}} the trip automatically releases the piston, allowing it to fall by gravity. As the piston falls, it activates the fuel pump, which discharges a metered amount of fuel into the ball pan of the impact block. The falling piston also blocks the exhaust ports, and compression of <b>fuel</b> <b>trapped</b> in the cylinder begins. The compressed air exerts a pre-load force to hold the impact block firmly against the drive cap and pile. At the bottom of the compression stroke, the piston strikes the impact block, atomizing the fuel and starting the pile on its downward movement. In the instant after the piston strikes, the atomized fuel ignites, and the resulting explosion exerts an even greater force on the already moving pile, driving it further into the ground. The reaction of the explosion rebounding from the resistance of the pile drives the piston upward. As the piston rises, the exhaust ports open, releasing the gases and force of the explosion into the atmosphere. After the piston stops its upward movement, it again falls by gravity to start another cycle.|$|R

40|$|Recently, the {{development}} of a novel ultrasonic inspection technique that detects radial fatigue cracks {{on the far side of}} so-called “weep” holes in thin airframe stiffeners was reported [1]. These cracks tend to be located on the upper part of the weep hole (at 12 o’clock position) therefore are not readily detectable by conventional ultrasonic inspection techniques from the lower skin of the wing. The new technique utilizes circumferential creeping waves propagating around the inner surface of the hole to perform the inspection. However, the wet wing has to be emptied and dried out before inspection because even a small amount of fluid <b>fuel</b> <b>trapped</b> in these rather small (approximately 6 – 7 mm in diameter) holes would strongly affect the propagation of circumferential creeping waves.

To understand the fate of CH 4  trapped below ice, we measured depth-distributions of CH 4  concentrations {{in the water column}} near bubbles trapped below ice in Lake Erken. We also performed a 21 d incubation experiment at low temperature (2. 3 [*]±[*] 0. 2 °C) to investigate the potential for CH 4  oxidation.

CH 4  oxidation was observed as a significant decrease in CH 4  concentration, a significant increase in stable isotope  13 C signature, and an increase in MOB during the incubation.

40|$|Atomobile {{evaporative}} emission canisters contain activated carbon sorbents that <b>trap</b> and store <b>fuel</b> vapors emitted from automobile fuel tanks {{during periods of}} hot ambient temperatures and after engine operation. When a vehicle is started, combustion air is pulled through the canister, and adsorbed vapors are removed from the sorbent and routed to the intake manifold for combustion along with fuel from the tank. The two primary requirements of an effective canister sorbent are that (1) {{it must be a}} strong enough adsorbent {{to hold on to the}} fuel vapors that contact it and (2) it must be a weak enough adsorbent to release the captured vapors in the presence of the airflow required by the engine for fuel combustion. Most currently available commercial canister sorbents are made from wood, which is reacted with phosphoric acid and heat to yield an activated carbon with optimum pore size for gasoline vapor adsorption. The objectives of Task 5. 7 were to (1) design and construct a test system for evaluating the performance of different sorbents in trapping and releasing butane, gasoline, and other organic vapors; (2) investigate the use of lignite char as an automobile fuel evaporation canister sorbent; (3) compare the adsorbing and desorbing characteristics of lignite chars with those of several commercial sorbents; and (4) investigate whether the presence of ethanol in fuel vapors affects sorbent performance in any way. Tests with two different sorbents (a wood-derived activated carbon and a lignite char) showed that with both sorbents, ethanol vapor breakthrough took about twice as long as hydrocarbon vapor breakthrough. Possible reasons for this, including an increased sorbent affinity for ethanol vapors, will be investigated. If this effect is real (i. e., reproducible over an extensive series of tests under varying conditions), it may help explain why ethanol vapor concentrations in SHED test {{evaporative emission}}s are often lower than would be expected...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this study, {{effects of}} {{premixed}} and equivalence ratios on CO and HC emissions of a dual fuel HCCI engine are investigated. Tests {{were conducted on}} a single-cylinder engine with compression ratio of 17. 5. Premixed gasoline is provided by a carburetor connected to intake manifold and equipped with a screw to adjust premixed air-fuel ratio, and diesel fuel is injected directly into the cylinder through an injector at pressure of 250 bars. A heater placed at inlet manifold is used to control the intake charge temperature. Optimal intake charge temperature results in better HCCI combustion due to formation of a homogeneous mixture, therefore, all tests were carried out over the optimum intake temperature of 110 - 115 ºC. Timing of diesel fuel injection has a great effect on stratification of in-cylinder charge and {{plays an important role}} in HCCI combustion phasing. Experiments indicated 35 BTDC as the optimum injection timing. Varying the coolant temperature in a range of 40 to 70 ºC, better HCCI combustion was achieved at 50 ºC. Therefore, coolant temperature was maintained 50 ºC during all tests. Simultaneous investigation of effective parameters on HCCI combustion was conducted to determine optimum parameters resulting in fast transition to HCCI combustion. One of the advantages of the method studied in this study is feasibility of easy and fast transition of typical diesel engine to a dual fuel HCCI engine. Results show that increasing premixed ratio, while keeping EGR rate constant, increases unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions due to quenching phenomena and <b>trapping</b> of premixed <b>fuel</b> in crevices, but CO emission decreases due to increase in CO to CO 2 reactions.

40|$|The {{reprocessing}} of spent nuclear fuel, {{a common}} method for manufacturing weapons-grade special nuclear materials, {{is accompanied by}} the release of fi ssion products <b>trapped</b> within the <b>fuel.</b> One of these fi ssion products is a radioactive isotope of Krypton (Kr- 85); a pure β- emitter with a half-life of 10. 72 years. Due to its chemical neutrality and relatively long half life, {{nearly all of the}} Kr- 85 is released into the surrounding air during reprocessing, resulting in a concentration of Kr- 85 near the source that is several orders of magnitude higher than the typical background (atmospheric) concentrations. This high concentration of Kr- 85 is accompanied by a proportionately high increase in air ionization due to the release of beta radiation from Kr- 85 decay. Millimeter wave (MMW) sensing technology can be used to detect the presence of Kr- 85 induced plumes since a high concentration of ions in the air increases the radar cross section due to a combination of atmospheric phenomena. Possible applications for this technology include the remote sensing of reprocessing activities across national borders bolstering global anti-proliferation initiatives. The feasibility of using MMW radar technology to uniquely detect the presence of Kr- 85 can be tested using commercial ion generators or sealed radioactive sources in the laboratory. In this paper we describe our work to derive an ion dispersion model that will describe the spatial distribution of ions from Kr- 85 and other common lab sources. The types and energies of radiation emitted by isotopes Co- 60 and Cs- 137 were researched, and these parameters were incorporated into these dispersion models. Our results can be compared with the results of MMW detection experiments in order to quantify the relationship between radar cross section and air ionization as well as to further calibrate the MMW detection equipment...|$|R

The objectives were to further the fundamental understanding of the processes involved in the initial stage of diesel spray formation. Tests were conducted at atmospheric conditions and on a rapid compression machine with motored in-cylinder peak pressures up to 8 MPa, and injection pressures up to 160 MPa. The light source and long range imaging optics were optimised to produce blur-free shadowgraphic images of sprays with a resolution of 0. 6 µm per pixel, and a viewing region of 768 × 614 µm. Such fine spatial and temporal resolutions allowed the observation of previously unreported shearing instabilities and stagnation point {{on the tip of}} diesel jets. The tip of the fuel jet was seen to take the shape of an oblate spheroidal cap immediately after leaving the nozzle, due to the combination of transverse expansion of the jet and the physical properties of the fuel. The spheroidal cap was found to consist of residual <b>fuel</b> <b>trapped</b> in the injector hole {{after the end of the}} injection process. The formation of fuel ligaments close to the orifice was also observed, ligaments which were subsequently seen to breakup into droplets through hydrodynamic and capillary instabilities.

The frame rate was up to 5 million images per second and exposure time down to 20 ns, with a fixed resolution of 1280 × 960 pixels covering a viewing region of 995 × 746 µm.

40|$|Naturally, {{there are}} complex {{interactions}} among {{internal combustion engine}} parameters such as in-cylinder pressure, emissions, speed, and load. These basic relationships are studied in a naturally aspirated, spark-ignited, two-stroke, large-bore natural gas engine. The typical application for such an engine is operating heavy machinery such as large compressors and oil field pump jacks. Cylinder pressure averaged over 300 cycles is captured for eight speeds from 350 to 525 RPM and six loads of 50 % to 100 % of maximum torque at each respective speed. Non-sequential individual cycle pressure curves are captured to depict cyclic variation at each operating point. Emissions are measured for each operating point. Equivalence ratio, delivery ratio, and trapping efficiencies are also calculated. The behavior of these parameters are then quantified and described {{in the context of}} cyclic variation. It is shown that low load cyclic variation is extreme, having coefficient of variance (COV) of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) values over 40 %. Low load cycles are shown to frequently misfire or experience partial burn. Cyclic variation is shown to decrease with increasing load and decreasing speed. Air flow rate is shown to increase with engine speed. It is also shown that the overall system equivalence ratio is highest at high loads and low speeds, and the values are between 0. 55 and 0. 90. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is suspected to decrease with increasing load, likely due to improved scavenging at high load. Delivery ratio is shown to be, on average, slightly greater than 1. 0 at most operating conditions. <b>Fuel</b> <b>trapping</b> efficiency has a complex trend with increasing speed. Air trapping efficiencies disagree with those calculated for fuel, and are likely incorrect due to the lean-burning nature of the engine. Scavenging efficiency results are not credible. Emissions of CO 2, NO, and THC are shown (and emissions of CH 4 are suspected) to have an inverse correlation with cyclic variation; emissions of O 2 are shown (and emissions of CO are suspected) to have direct correlation with cyclic variation...|$|R
40|$|Energy in {{buildings}} is recognised {{as a major}} environmental and financial issue. Scientists have recognised that in near future the energy produced from fossil fuels may {{not be sufficient to}} fulfil the man's energy needs and that continuous resources exploitation at current rates will be harmful to the stability of earth's climate. Carbon dioxide, which is released during the combustion of conventional <b>fuels,</b> <b>traps</b> heat within earth's atmosphere and as a result the global temperature is expected to rise at levels above any experienced before by our civilisation. In order for the carbon dioxide emissions, which are released to the atmosphere by human activities with{{in buildings}}, to be stabilised and reduced, all new buildings should be designed towards net operational zero emissions. More than forty percent of the energy consumed in UK is within buildings. By exploring all the options for the provision of low carbon energy and the efficient use of energy this thesis provides a background in technologies and examines their value to a building. Low and zero carbon technologies are qualitatively and quantitatively assessed especially for new buildings. For all the technologies examined, technical aspects of their design are appraised and their financial viability in the current business environment is examined. Procedures for the optimisation of design are proposed based on the research conclusions. A new assessment tool CARB-FM, i. e. Carbon Abatement Relative Balance Financial Method, has been developed, and tested on a number of cases. CARBFM is a multifaceted tool which considers the technology, the financial cost and the environmental impact. CARB-FM {{can be used as a}} decision making tool for any kind of project which assesses the environmental credits of technologies by energy saving of primary energy resources. Future bUilding design must encapsulate the life time energy requirements, and planners, engineers and architects can apply CARB-FM to provide a low-carbon design solution in which the most cost efficient energy saving measures will have been i. ntroduced by engineering design during early stages of the design process.

40|$|The {{retention}} of deuterium (D) fuel in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak is studied {{using a new}} &# 039;static&# 039; gas balance method. C-Mod solely employs high-Z molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) for its plasma facing materials, with intermittent application of thin boron (B) films. The primarily Mo surfaces are found to retain large fractions, similar to 20 - 50 %, of the D- 2 gas fuelled per quiescent discharge, {{regardless of whether the}} Mo surfaces are cleaned of, or partially covered by, B films. Several experiments and calculations show that it is improbable that B retains significant fractions of the fuel. Rather, retention occurs in Mo and W surfaces through ion bombardment, implantation and diffusion to trap sites. Roughly 1 % D of the incident ion fluence, Phi(D), to surfaces is retained, and with no indication of the retention rate decreasing after 25 s of integrated plasma exposure. The magnitude of retention is significantly larger than that extrapolated from the results of laboratory studies for either Mo or W. The high levels of D/Mo in the near surface, measured directly post-campaign (similar to 0. 01) in tiles and inferred from gas balance, are consistent with <b>trapping</b> sites for <b>fuel</b> retention in the Mo being created, or expanded, by high D atom densities in the near surface which arise as a result of high incident ion fluxes. Differences between C-Mod and laboratory retention results may be due to such factors as the multiply ionized B ions incident on the surface directly creating traps, the condition of Mo (impurities, annealing) and the high-flux densities in the C-Mod divertor which are similar to ITER, but 10 - 100 x those used in laboratory studies. Disruptions produce rapid heating of the surfaces, releasing trapped hydrogenic species into the vessel for recovery. The measurements of the large amount of gas released in disruptions are consistent with the analysis of tiles removed from the vessel post-campaign-the campaign-integrated retention is very low, of order 1000 x less than that observed in a single, non-disruptive discharge...|$|R
40|$|The Lean NOx Trap (LNT) {{process is}} one of the {{technologies}} in development to abate the oxides of nitrogen (NOx, primarily NO and NO 2) in the exhaust emitted from lean-burn combustion engines (e. g., diesel engines). The LNT catalyst consists of a noble metal (usually Pt) and a NOx storage material (such as Ba or K), on an alumina support. The process involves a cyclic operation of the engine between long fuel-lean phase (e. g., 60 s) and relatively short rich pulse (e. g., 5 s). The entire cycle can be divided into numerous steps with the following three being the most important: (1) oxidation of NO to NO 2 on Pt and (2) NOx storage on Ba under lean conditions; and (3) regeneration of the catalyst reducing the NOx to N 2 under rich conditions. This work will focus on the kinetic aspects of the NO oxidation and the NOx reduction steps (steps 1 and 3) of the cycle. ^ The first step, NO oxidation, was studied on various Pt catalysts with varying average Pt particle size (2 - 9 nm) and support (Al 2 O 3, SBA- 15, Carbon, Nb 2 O 5). The forward reaction was found to be close to first order with respect to the reactants NO and O 2, while it was close to negative first order with respect to the product NO 2, indicating that NO 2 inhibits NO oxidation. These apparent reaction orders were found to be independent {{of the size of the}} Pt clusters or the support material. A reaction mechanism consistent with these experimentally observed reaction orders was proposed, and consisted of the following steps: (1) Quasi-equilibriated adsorption of NO on Pt; (2) Quasi-equilibriated dissociative adsorption of NO 2 on Pt giving surface NO and O; (3) irreversible molecular adsorption of O 2 on Pt. Surface O was proposed to be the most abundant reaction intermediate. The rate per unit of surface Pt atom was found to be a function of both, the Pt particle size and the support. The rate was found to increase by about 20 - 50 times, depending on the support, when the average Pt cluster size increased from 1. 9 to 9. 1 nm. Based on in-situ XAS, XPS and TEM evidences, it is hypothesized that only those Pt particles capable of resisting Pt oxidation, which is the cause of the catalyst deactivation under the oxidizing reaction conditions, are responsible for the reaction. Pt oxidation, in turn, depends on the Pt particle size and the support material, and results in a higher NO oxidation rate on those catalyst with lower extent of Pt oxidation during the reaction. ^ The final step, which is the regeneration of the <b>trap</b> catalyst under <b>fuel</b> rich conditions, is proposed to involve a localized reaction front of the reductant H 2, which travels through the catalyst bed and gets completely consumed while regenerating the trapping sites. For typical 60 s lean- 6 s rich cycles, the N 2 selectivity was found to be 96 %. The process involves the release of NOx from the trapping material, followed by its reduction over Pt. The regeneration reactions were found to be fast and insensitive to the changes in the temperature or to the presence of CO 2 and H 2 O, and were limited only by the supply of the H-atoms. The catalyst does not differentiate between H 2 or NH 3 as the source of H-atoms, and NH 3 is equivalent to and as effective as H 2 in regenerating the trap catalyst, giving similar concentration profiles and product selectivity. The results also indicate that the catalyst regeneration using H 2 as the reductant occurs via intermediate NH 3 formation, which serves as a carrier of the hydrogen atoms. This NH 3 eventually gets further oxidized by the stored NOx to N 2, thereby restricting the NH 3 slip to only the end of the cycle where the stored NOx are depleted, while maintaining the high selectivity of the process towards N 2. ...|$|R
