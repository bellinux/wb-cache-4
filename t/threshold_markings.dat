25|$|During {{the impact}} and short ground roll, the nose gear collapsed, the right main gear {{separated}} from the aircraft, penetrating the central fuel tank and cabin space, and the left main gear was pushed up through the wing. The aircraft {{came to rest on}} the <b>threshold</b> <b>markings</b> {{at the start of the}} runway. A significant amount of fuel leaked, but there was no fire. Four crew members and eight passengers received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries (concussion and a broken leg).|$|E
5000|$|The runway is {{the surface}} from {{threshold}} to threshold, which typically features <b>threshold</b> <b>markings,</b> numbers, and centerlines, but not overrun areas at both ends.|$|E
5000|$|Non-precision {{instrument}} runways {{are often}} used at small- to medium-size airports. These runways, depending on the surface, may be marked with <b>threshold</b> <b>markings,</b> designators, centerlines, and sometimes a 1000 ft mark (known as an aiming point, sometimes installed at 1500 ft). They provide horizontal position guidance to planes on instrument approach via Non-directional beacon, VHF omnidirectional range, Global Positioning System, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The runway <b>thresholds</b> are <b>markings</b> {{across the}} runway that denote the {{beginning}} and end of the designated space for landing and takeoff under non-emergency conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Visual runways {{are used}} at small airstrips {{and are usually}} just a strip of grass, gravel, ice, asphalt, or concrete. Although there are usually no {{markings}} on a visual runway, they may have <b>threshold</b> <b>markings,</b> designators, and centerlines. Additionally, they do not provide an instrument-based landing procedure; pilots {{must be able to}} see the runway to use it. Also, radio communication may not be available and pilots must be self-reliant.|$|E
50|$|During {{the impact}} and short ground roll, the nose gear collapsed, the right main gear {{separated}} from the aircraft, penetrating the central fuel tank and cabin space, and the left main gear was pushed up through the wing. The aircraft {{came to rest on}} the <b>threshold</b> <b>markings</b> {{at the start of the}} runway. A significant amount of fuel leaked, but there was no fire. Four crew members and eight passengers received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries (concussion and a broken leg).|$|E
5000|$|A {{rotating}} beacon {{is at the}} north end of the airport. The Runway and Taxiways have medium intensity lighting systems (MILS). Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) are at each end of the runway, as well as lights showing the end of the threshold. A Precision Approach Path Indicator system is at each end. “Lighted airfield signs at IFP are at aircraft hold positions, taxiway intersections, and at the intersection of the connecting taxiways and runways”. [...] There are also mandatory hold signs. The medium intensity runway lighting can be turned on by a pilot clicking the radio transmission button in the cockpit. Airfield markings control the traffic efficiently on the ground. Runway 16/34 has centerline, <b>threshold</b> <b>markings,</b> aiming points, and runway designation markings. Taxiways have hold short markings before runway intersections and centerlines. The Airport’s aprons have centerlines to control traffic and designated tie down areas. A segmented circle is located close to the airport for visual reference on how a pilot should perform the traffic pattern for the Runway.|$|E
