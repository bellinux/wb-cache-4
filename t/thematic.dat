5|$|Gerard Way {{has also}} stated {{that one of their}} biggest {{influences}} were The Smashing Pumpkins, often giving them credit for their <b>thematic</b> videos.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the permanent exhibition, there are frequent <b>thematic</b> exhibitions which have covered maps, sacred texts, {{the history of the}} English language, and law, including a celebration of the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Arab conquests during the 7th century, the whole administrative and military system of the Empire was reformed, and the <b>thematic</b> system established. According to this, the Empire was divided into several themata, which were regional civil and military administrations. Under the command of a stratēgos, each thema maintained its own, locally levied forces. Following a series of revolts by <b>thematic</b> forces, under Constantine V the larger early themes were progressively broken up, while a central imperial army, the tagmata, was created, stationed at or near Constantinople, serving as a central reserve that henceforth formed the core of campaigning armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{film has}} a <b>thematic</b> {{connection}} to the children's book The Velveteen Rabbit, which appears in the film, before the wedding.|$|E
5|$|Up to the 20th century he was {{credited}} with establishing the <b>Thematic</b> system but modern scholarship now points more to the 660s, under Constans II.|$|E
5|$|A Multiple Property Submission (MPS) is a <b>thematic</b> group {{listing of}} the National Register of Historic Places that {{consists}} of related properties that share a common theme and can be submitted as a group. Multiple property submissions must satisfy certain basic criteria for the group of properties {{to be included in}} the National Register.|$|E
5|$|After Bardanes's retirement, Nikephoros {{formally}} dismissed him and confiscated {{much of his}} property. The other <b>thematic</b> generals {{who took}} part in the revolt were also dismissed from their posts, the metropolitan bishops of Sardis, Amorion and Nicomedia were punished for their support of the uprising by exile to the small island of Pantelleria off Sicily, while the soldiers of the Anatolian armies were left unpaid for a year.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{development}} for a follow-up film a <b>thematic</b> sequel, Split, with Willis reprising {{his role as}} David Dunn in a cameo role, was released in January 2017. After financial and critical success, Shyamalan immediately began working on a third film, titled Glass, which will be released January 18, 2019.|$|E
5|$|First {{movement}} in moderate or fast tempo, and in sonata form. The exposition {{consists of two}} or three <b>thematic</b> and tonal areas and, as common in the Classical style, moves from tonic to dominant (in major mode works) or to the relative major (in minor mode works). However, as often with Schubert, the harmonic scheme of the exposition involves additional, intermediate tonalities, which may be quite remote from the tonic-dominant axis, and sometimes imbue certain expository passages with the character of a development section. The main themes of the exposition are often in ternary form, with their middle section digressing to a different tonality. The themes generally do not form symmetrical periods, and irregular phrase lengths are prominent. The exposition ends with a repeat sign. The development section opens with an abrupt turn into a new tonal area. A new theme, based on a melodic fragment from the second <b>thematic</b> group of the exposition, is presented in this section over recurrent rhythmic figuration, and then developed, undergoing successive transformations. The first <b>thematic</b> group returns in the recapitulation with different or additional harmonic digressions; the second group returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The short coda maintains the tonic key and mainly soft dynamics, achieving a resolution of the movement's conflicts and ending pianissimo.|$|E
5|$|In Taking Sides (2001), Szabó {{returned}} to <b>thematic</b> territory he had explored in Mephisto. Stellan Skarsgård plays real life German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, and Harvey Keitel a U.S. Army investigator interrogating Furtwängler about his {{collaboration with the}} Nazis. The film won several awards at the Mar del Plata Film Festival in Argentina, including Best Director.|$|E
5|$|In a 2002 {{review in}} The New York Times, film critic Dave Kehr compares the film with Stella Dallas (1937) for the <b>thematic</b> {{similarity}} {{of the series}} of sacrifices made by the female lead, and with Gone with the Wind (1939) as an epic mirroring social upheavals. Film critic Mark Cousins and author Tejaswini Ganti agree that the film is the Gone with the Wind of Indian cinema.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{with its}} land counterpart, the exact {{size of the}} Byzantine navy and its units {{is a matter of}} {{considerable}} debate, owing to the scantness and ambiguous nature of the primary sources. One exception are the numbers for the late 9th and early 10th century, for which we possess a more detailed breakdown, dated to the Cretan expedition of 911. These lists reveal that during the reign of Leo VI the Wise, the navy reached 34,200 oarsmen and perhaps as many as 8,000 marines. The central Imperial Fleet totalled some 19,600 oarsmen and 4,000 marines under the command of the droungarios of the basilikon plōimon. These four thousand marines were professional soldiers, first recruited as a corps by Basil I in the 870s. They were a great asset to the Imperial Fleet, for whereas previously it had depended on <b>thematic</b> and tagmatic soldiers for its marines, the new force provided a more reliable, better trained and immediately available force at the Emperor's disposal. The high status of these marines is illustrated {{by the fact that they}} were considered to belong to the imperial tagmata, and were organized along similar lines. The Aegean <b>thematic</b> fleet numbered 2,610 oarsmen and 400 marines, the Cibyrrhaeot fleet stood at 5,710 oarsmen and 1,000 marines, the Samian fleet at 3,980 oarsmen and 600 marines, and finally, the Theme of Hellas furnished 2,300 oarsmen with a portion of its 2,000 <b>thematic</b> soldiers doubling as marines.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} postmodern novels, Fowles uses {{multiple}} different stylistic and structural techniques to highlight his <b>thematic</b> interests in The French Lieutenant's Woman. When discussing these stylistic concerns, many literary critics {{comment on the}} importance of the narrator and the narration, the intertextual references to other literary works, and the multiple endings.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Daddies' studio albums {{are written}} to varying extents as concept albums, {{featuring}} either recurring lyrical themes or an abstract progressive narrative. According to Perry, this lyrical interconnectedness is intended as means of providing an album with threads of <b>thematic</b> stability against wildly varying musical styles.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well-crafted, {{does not}} rise to {{the same level of}} {{inspiration}} as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to {{bring out the best in}} him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann's Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its <b>thematic</b> material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium.|$|E
5|$|Several planned filming {{locations}} {{were abandoned}} due to budget constraints. For <b>thematic</b> reasons, the film's penultimate fight scene between JTRO and L Dubba E was originally set at Dawn's Liquor Marta key {{location in the}} film. The store's owners refused permission for filming and the location was changed to a long-abandoned gas station. Bryan Goddard, who portrays Sugga Nigga, acquired permission for the crew to film on the property.|$|E
5|$|Shinya Tsukamoto as Mokichi. Tsukamoto {{felt that}} the {{relation}} of his character to Rodriguez was of central importance to the <b>thematic</b> content of the film. He adopted a lifestyle of fasting and abstention from social interaction throughout {{the production of the}} film. He reported that he and Garfield tried to stay in character on the sets even between takes.|$|E
5|$|Songs in the Key of X: Music {{from and}} Inspired by The X-Files is a 1996 {{compilation}} album released {{in association with}} the American science fiction television series The X-Files. The album contained a mixture of songs that were either featured in the series, or shared <b>thematic</b> elements with it. Songs in the Key of X peaked at No. 47 on the Billboard 200 album sales chart after its release.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{features}} an Abhisheka Mandap, Sahaj Anand water show, a <b>thematic</b> garden and three exhibitions namely Sahajanand Darshan (Hall of Values), Neelkanth Darshan (an IMAX {{film on the}} early life of Swaminarayan as the teenage yogi, Neelkanth), and Sanskruti Darshan (cultural boat ride). According to Swaminarayan Hinduism, the word Akshardham means the abode of almighty Lord Swaminarayan and believed by followers as a temporal home of God on earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} historian Simon Wessley {{describes the}} novel, alongside Barker's Regeneration, as an exemplar of contemporary fiction which uses {{the experience of}} the World War I trenches to examine more contemporary understandings of PTSD. De Groot argues that this reinvestigation of a traumatic history mirrors a growing interest among both literary authors and historians in trauma as a <b>thematic</b> subject.|$|E
5|$|The first {{installment}} in the franchise, , {{was released on}} September 11, 1987. The following entries have nearly always been unrelated to each other except in carrying over <b>thematic</b> and gameplay elements. The Megami Tensei games, and the later Shin Megami Tensei titles form {{the core of the}} series, while other subseries such as Persona and Devil Summoner are spin-offs marketed as part of the franchise. There are also stand-alone spin-off titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} on March 19, 2015. Review aggregator Metacritic characterized TouchTone reviews as generally favorable. Critics praised the game's visual style and story, but criticized the way the game did not allow players to skip puzzles. Reviewers found the light-bending puzzle premise unoriginal, but appreciated its <b>thematic</b> connection.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} {{regarded}} as a difficult work upon its release, and its experimental stylistic, structural, and <b>thematic</b> idiosyncrasies have often provoked emotional judgments from critics, ranging from fascination to repulsion. Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thematic</b> and period {{setting of}} Carnivàle {{required}} an unusual casting approach. While some actors were hired for their genetic disabilities, most actors were specifically cast for their unique and distinct looks {{to fit the}} 1930s period. Award-winning costumes and make-up enhanced the illusion. Reviews generally lauded the actors and characters, and several actors received award recognition for their performances.|$|E
5|$|A {{museum was}} opened inside the {{preserved}} building {{to mark the}} 100th birthday of Mikhail Bulgakov on May 15, 1991. The upper floor of the museum houses an exhibition of various Bulgakov objects, and the lower floor contains <b>thematic</b> exhibitions. The house, built in 1888 and designed by architect N. Gardenin, was thoroughly renovated before {{the opening of the}} museum. A memorial plaque with Bulgakov's portrait is now hanging {{on the front of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are <b>thematic</b> rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E
5|$|Bridging the {{age when}} gods lived alone and {{the age when}} divine {{interference}} in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together. These were {{the early days of}} the world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and they are often divided into two <b>thematic</b> groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.|$|E
5|$|First {{shown as}} a {{technical}} and <b>thematic</b> demonstration video at Nintendo's Shoshinkai trade show in December 1995, Ocarina of Time was developed concurrently with Super Mario 64 by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD) division. Both were the first free-roaming 3D game in their respective series. Nintendo planned to release Super Mario 64 as a launch game for the Nintendo 64 (N64) and later release Ocarina of Time for the 64DD, a disk drive peripheral for the system which was also still in development.|$|E
5|$|Hindustan Times {{included}} Rudraveena {{in their}} 2015 list of 10 memorable films directed by Balachander. On Chiranjeevi's 60th birthday, Indo-Asian News Service included {{the film in}} their list of underrated performances by the actor. Koratala Siva Srimanthudu (2015) starring Mahesh Babu and Shruti Haasan was compared with Rudraveena for its similarities on a <b>thematic</b> level (rural development and father-son conflict). Commenting on the same, Mahesh stated that Srimanthudu was more mainstream and commercial than realistic in its approach.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 the Notre Dame Island {{site was}} reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands {{simultaneously}} accessible again, albeit {{only for a}} brief time. Minor <b>thematic</b> exhibitions were held at the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's Island site permanently closed, shutting out the majority of attractions. Man and His World was able to continue in a limited fashion with {{the small number of}} pavilions left standing on Notre Dame Island. However, the few remaining original exhibits closed permanently in 1984.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for <b>thematic</b> unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since, {{the film has}} {{generated}} significant academic attention with regard to its <b>thematic</b> symbolism, and is now widely {{regarded as one of}} Lynch's major works and one of the greatest films of the 1980s. Publications including Sight & Sound, Time, Entertainment Weekly and BBC Magazine have ranked it among the greatest American films of all time. In 2008, Blue Velvet was chosen by the American Film Institute {{as one of the greatest}} American mystery films ever made.|$|E
5|$|No {{definite}} conclusion as to {{the date}} of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus. It {{would have been very}} unusual for a former Domestic to be appointed to the subordinate position of a <b>thematic</b> strategos, and there is reason to doubt the authenticity of the tale of Zaoutzes' seeing in Nikephoros a potential future emperor and offering the hand of an—otherwise unknown—daughter in marriage.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{as he did}} {{incidents}} {{in the order of}} their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a <b>thematic</b> organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and glorification of Florence permit him to see in the altered fortunes of his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties of his age.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have noted}} {{similarities}} between this album {{and those of}} musicians and composers in several musical genres—from pop to contemporary classical, even show tunes and jazz-based time signatures. The lyrics and their rich <b>thematic</b> elements have been noted for their literary quality, earning comparisons to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, William Carlos Williams, and Walt Whitman. Genre labels that have been applied to the album include indie folk, indie pop, baroque pop, indie rock, folk rock, , chamber folk, and lo-fi.|$|E
