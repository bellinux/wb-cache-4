Band 5 was primarily used to identify cultural features. Band 6 sensed the vegetation boundaries between land, water, and landforms. Band 7 was the most proficient at sensing through atmospheric haze, and identified water and land boundaries, vegetation, and landforms. The scene size for the scanners of the MSS was 170 km to 185 km, which is the area the sensors could survey per scan.

40|$|A print quality problem {{encountered}} in wide-format inkjet printing {{is a type}} of solid-area non-uniformity referred to as "thermal <b>banding.</b> " <b>Thermal</b> <b>banding</b> can be observed, for example, in a print in which a gray or colored border surrounds an area with little or no printing. Although the same tone is specified for all sides of the border, the print density of the top and bottom borders is relatively high, while the density of the side borders between the top and bottom bands is clearly lower. Current theory holds that <b>thermal</b> <b>banding</b> is related to the temperature inside the inkjet head. As the head prints a solid area, it heats up, causing larger drops to be produced. The large drops increase the print density. When a white or mostly-white area is produced, the head cools since little or no jetting occurs. The cool head produces smaller drops and lower print density results. This paper discusses <b>thermal</b> <b>banding</b> and shows how the problem can be quantified using a commercially-available, camera-based image analysis system.

ABSTRACT: Land surface temperature (LST) is important factor in surface feature mapping, analysis, and estimation of emissivity and heat balance studies. The knowledge of surface temperature is important for various applications in Remote sensing field. Feature mapping and analysis can be done according to their emissivity and brightness temperature. In this investigation an attempt {{has been made to}} estimate surface temperature from ASTER and to use the relationship between aster <b>thermal</b> <b>bands</b> for feature mapping. ASTER has 5 <b>thermal</b> <b>bands</b> (wave length ranging from 8. 125 µm to 11. 65 µm) and these are used in comparison. ASTER <b>thermal</b> <b>bands</b> have been used to convert digital numbers to exoatmospheric radiance using published ASTER user manual gains and offsets. The exoatmospheric radiance is then converted to surface radiance by applying the Emissivity Normalization method, assuming the emissivity of the Investigation area is constant (0. 96, the emissivity of urban areas). The surface temperature is then extracted from the surface radiance, based on ASTER images ofMay 2007. The extracted temperature data were compared to individual ASTER temperature bands.

Andaman and Nicobar arc {{is the only place}} in India where volcanic activity, a continuation of the Indonesian geothermal fields, and can be good potential sites for geothermal energy. Cambay graben geothermal belt is 200 km long and 50 km wide with Tertiary sediments. Thermal springs have been reported from the belt although they are not of very high temperature and discharge. During oil and gas drilling in this area, in recent times, high subsurface temperature and thermal fluid have been reported in deep drill wells in depth ranges of 1.7 to 1.9 km. Steam blowout have also been reported in the drill holes in depth range of 1.5 to 3.4 km. The thermal springs in India's peninsular region are more related to the faults, which allow down circulation of meteoric water to considerable depths. The circulating water acquires heat from the normal thermal gradient in the area, and depending upon local condition, emerges out at suitable localities. The area includes Aravalli range, Son-Narmada-Tapti lineament, Godavari and Mahanadi valleys and South Cratonic Belts.|$|E

However, as the maximum temperature of this blackbody is 315 K, the low gain state of the 4 micron band cannot be calibrated {{in the same manner}} as the rest of the <b>thermal</b> <b>bands.</b> Regular observations of the moon provide an alternative calibration source. The lunar surface temperature has been recently mapped by the DIVINER sensor on the LRO platform.

Furthermore, the emissivity of the lunar surface is well known near 8. 5 microns due to the Christiansen feature (an emissivity maximum associated with Si-O stretching vibrations) and the solar reflectance is negligible. Thus, the 8. 5 micron band is used for relative calibration with the 4 micron band to de-trend any temporal variations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{different}} methods of Bayesian segmentation algorithm were used with different band combinations. Sequential Maximum a Posteriori (SMAP) is a Bayesian image segmentation algorithm which unlike the traditional Maximum likelihood (ML) classification attempts to improve accuracy by taking contextual information into account, rather than classifying pixels separately. Landsat 7 ETM+ data with Path/Row 186 - 26, dated 30 September 2000 for a mountainous terrain at the Polish- Ukrainian border is acquired. In order {{to study the}} role of <b>thermal</b> <b>band</b> with these methods, two data sets with and without the <b>thermal</b> <b>band</b> were used. Nine band combinations including ETM+ and Principal Component (PC) data were selected based on the highest value of Optimum Index Factor (OIF). Using visual and digital analysis, field observation data and auxiliary map data like CORINE land cover, 14 land cover classes are identified. Spectral signatures were derived for every land cover. Spectral signatures as well as feature space analysis were used for detailed analysis of efficiency of the reflective and thermal bands. The result shows that SMAP as the superior method can improve Kappa values compared with ML algorithm for all band combinations with on average 17 %. Using all 7 bands both SMAP and ML classifications algorithm achieved the highest Kappa accuracy of 80. 37 % and 64. 36 % respectively.

The stability and calibration of the ETM+ has been monitored extensively since launch. Though not monitored for many years, TM now has a similar system in place to monitor stability and calibration. University teams have been evaluating the on-board calibration of the instruments through ground-based measurements since 1999. This paper considers the calibration efforts for the <b>thermal</b> <b>band,</b> Band 6, of both the Landsat- 5 and Landsat- 7 instruments. Initial calibration results for the Landsat- 7 ETM+ <b>thermal</b> <b>band</b> found a bias error which was corrected through changes in the processing systems in late 2000. Recent results are suggesting a calibration error in gain, apparent with high temperature targets. For typical earth temperature targets, from about 5 - 20 C, the gain error is small enough to be within the noise of the vicarious calibration process. However, for very high temperature targets (greater then 35 C), Landsat- 7 appears to be predicting several degrees too low. Questions remain on whether the change happened suddenly or is varying slowly, so the team will wait for another collection season before making any updates to the calibration.

The instrument is operated by Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aerospacial (INTA) {{and it has}} been involved in several field campaigns since 2004. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} analyze the feasibility of retrieving land surface temperature from the 10 AHS <b>thermal</b> infrared <b>bands,</b> from 71 to 80, located in the region between 8 and 13 μm. For this purpose, three different methods have been considered: (i) the single-channel method, which uses only one thermal band; (ii) the split-window method, which uses a combination of two thermal bands; and (iii) the TES (temperature and emissivity separation) method, which needs at least four <b>thermal</b> <b>bands.</b> The calibration of the AHS <b>thermal</b> <b>bands</b> and the algorithms have been tested with in situ measurements collected in the framework of the SPARC (Spectra Barrax Campaign) and EAGLE (Exploitation of AnGular effects in Land surfacE observations from satellites) field campaigns, which took place simultaneously in the agricultural area of Barrax (Albacete, Spain), and also in the framework of the AGRISPECTRA field campaign, carried out over an olive orchard in Córdoba (Spain), in July 2004. AHS flights were conducted at two different altitudes, 975 m and 2745 m above ground level. The results show that AHS bands 71 (8. 18 μm), 72 (8. 66 μm), and 73 (9. 15 μm) were affected by a calibration problem. Taking into account that AHS bands 74 (9. 60 μm) and 80 (12. 93 μm) are located in an absorption region, bands from 75 to 79 have been finally selected for land surface temperature retrieval. The single-channel method has been applied to AHS band 75 (10. 07 μm), which shows the highest atmospheric transmissivity, whereas the split-window method has been applied to the combination between bands 75 and 79 (12. 35 μm), which provides the best results according to simulated data. All the AHS <b>thermal</b> <b>bands</b> ranging from 75 to 79 have been used in the TES method. The tests conducted on the different algorithms used in this study show that single-channel and split-window methods provided similar results, with root mean square errors (RMSE) between 1. 6 and 1. 9 K. The TES method slightly improved the results, with a RMSE of 1. 4 K.

40|$|The {{infrared}} {{thermal mapper}} (IRTM) {{was designed to}} measure the emitted and reflected radiance of Mars. Carried by the Viking Orbiter, the IRTM contains four small Cassegrainian telescopes which each image the same, seven circular areas. There is a total of twenty-eight channels in four surface and one atmospheric <b>thermal</b> <b>bands</b> from 6 to 30 microns and a broad solar reflectance band. All channels are sampled simultaneously, using the spacecraft scanning capability to map the radiance over small and {{large areas of the}} planet. All channels use thermopile detectors; spectral passbands are determined by a combination of interference filters, detector lense materials, antireflection coatings, and restrahlen optics...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} generalized band {{structures of}} Rayleigh wave in 1 -D phononic crystals {{in the context}} of Green-Nagdhi thermoelastic (TE) theory. Solutions of the coupled equations included thermal field are obtained firstly. Then according to boundary conditions, phase velocity is derived. The transfer matrix methodology is adopted in order to formulate the band structures of generalized TE Rayleigh wave. It is demonstrated that the band structure of TE Rayleigh wave is comprised of elastic and <b>thermal</b> <b>bands.</b> For Aluminum-Epoxy phononic crystal, the thermoelasticity can influence the transmission ability of band gaps as well as narrow down the band gap width.
