5000|$|May 8, 2009: A Cessna 172N, {{registration}} number N172SV, is seriously damaged in a forced landing after losing engine power immediately upon takeoff from Northwest Regional. The pilot suffers minor or no injuries. Following the accident, {{an examination of}} the airplane reveals that the throttle control rod-end to carburetor <b>throttle</b> <b>arm</b> hardware was missing; this is deemed to be the primary cause of the crash. A contributing factor was the pilot's decision to fly the airplane without a current annual inspection.|$|E
50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the throttle butterfly. The fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide carburettor. Between the float chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle spindle. This arm has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the <b>throttle</b> <b>arm</b> moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|E
40|$|Challenges in {{controlling}} highly nonlinear {{systems are not}} limited to the development of sophisticated control algorithms that are tolerant to significant modeling imprecision and external disturbances. Additional challenges stem from the implementation of the control algorithm such as the availability of the state variables needed for the computation of the control signals, and the adverse effects induced by non-collocated sensors and actuators. The present work investigates the adverse effects of non-collocated sensors and actuators on the phase characteristics of flexible structures and the ensuing implications on the performance of structural controllers. Two closed-loop systems are considered and their phase angle contours have been generated as functions of the normalized sensor location and the excitation frequency. These contours were instrumental in the development of remedial actions for rendering structural controllers immune to the detrimental effects of non-collocated sensors and actuators. Moreover, the current work has focused on providing experimental validation for the robust performances of a self-tuning observer and a sliding mode observer. The observers are designed based on the variable structure systems theory and the self-tuning fuzzy logic scheme. Their robustness and self-tuning characteristics allow one to use an imprecise model of the system and eliminate the need for the extensive tuning associated with a fixed rule-based expert fuzzy inference system. The first phase of the experimental work was conducted in a controlled environment on a flexible spherical robotic manipulator whose natural frequencies are configuration-dependent. Both controllers have yielded accurate estimates of the required state variables in spite of significant modeling imprecision. The observers were also tested under a completely uncontrolled environment, which involves a 16 -ft boat operating in open-water under different sea states. Such an experimental work necessitates the development of a supervisory control algorithm to perform PTP tasks, prescribed <b>throttle</b> <b>arm</b> and steering tasks, surge speed and heading tracking tasks, or recovery maneuvers. This system has been implemented herein to perform prescribed <b>throttle</b> <b>arm</b> and steering control tasks based on estimated rather than measured state variables. These experiments served to validate the observers in a completely uncontrolled environment and proved their viability as reliable techniques for providing accurate estimates for the required state variables...|$|E

The wheelchair {{is equipped with a}} combined actuator and is driven in a manual mode with two round levers {{at the expense of the}} muscular power of a passenger and in a motor mode with an electric actuator of the right rear wheel. On the steering pillars of the wheelchair there are control and monitoring elements, hand <b>throttle,</b> brake <b>arms,</b> a headlight, and a rear mirror. The wheelchair is additionally equipped with an accumulator battery with a charger, a battery discharge indicator, electric signal, parking and main brakes, a steering wheel lock, an indicator and signalling devices of turning and braking...|$|R
5000|$|The BushCat is a two-place {{side-by-side}} strut-braced high-wing monoplane. It is {{an evolution}} of the Cheetah XLS, with some key changes. The landing gear has been updated to a single [...] "spring" [...] aluminum bar, the brakes have been improved (now hydraulic), and a more ergonomic <b>throttle</b> (longer <b>arm</b> rest). The changes {{are said to be}} a difference of 5% from the original Cheetah XLS design. Primary construction is of fabric-covered aluminum tube construction, available in the US with a choice of 3 Rotax engines, ranging from 65 to 100 HP. It can also be ordered with a Jabiru 2200. The plane features dual throttles, single center-mounted control stick, and flaps controlled by a ceiling-mounted bar. It has a useful load of 628 lb and can carry up to 81 lb of luggage. Manufacturer testing has shown the airframe to be capable of handling +6/-4 G. It is marketed as being an affordable Light Sports Aircraft, with other options available. As of 7/2014 the Firewall back kit cost is $22900 and the factory built SLSA ranges from $49995-63495 depending on engine choices.|$|R
50|$|Biker Mice from Mars is {{a science}} fiction action {{animated}} series created by Rick Ungar that began airing in 1993, in the United States and lasted for three seasons. It follows three anthropomorphic mice motorcyclists named Throttle, Modo, and Vinnie who escape a war on their home planet Mars before arriving to defend the Earth from the evil that destroyed their homeland (the Plutarkians) and to one day return to Mars. The mice's signature weapons consist of a cestus and a laser (<b>Throttle),</b> a bionic <b>arm</b> (Modo), and flares (Vinnie). Despite the frequent battles, no blood is shown, no firearms are used and many villains are monsters, aliens, and robots.|$|R
