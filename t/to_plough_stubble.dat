Spring wheat cv. Torka was sown after: pIoughed stubble cultivated on this field, <b>ploughed</b> <b>stubble</b> and straw, <b>ploughed</b> <b>stubble</b> with straw and 30 kg nitrogen per hectare. During all the years of studies on leaves and ears of spring wheat septo ria of leaf blotch and glume blotch (Mycosphaerella graminicola, Phaeosphaeria nodorum) were found. Brown rust (Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici) was seen on leaves of wheat only during years 2001 - 2002. Besides on ears fusarium ear blight (Fusarimn sp.) was present in 2002 and sooty mould (Cladosporium sp., Alternaria sp.) in 2001. According to health of overground parts of plants the good forecrops to spring wheat were oat, chinese mustard, oleiferous radish. The biggest impact on presence of diseases of leaves and ears had the weather during years of studies.

Experimental wheat was cultivated after spring cross plants such as spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. oleiferus Metz.), white mustard (Sinapis alba L), chinese mustard (Brassica juncea L.), oleiferous radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleiferus L.), false flax (Camelina sativa L.), crambe (Crambe abbysinica Hoechst.) and after oats (Avena sativa L.) as a control. The other experimental factor was the method of after-harvest residue management, i. e. <b>ploughing</b> in the <b>stubble,</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the <b>stubble</b> and straw, <b>ploughing</b> in the <b>stubble</b> and straw with nitrogen added. The occurrence of root rot and stem base diseases was affected by weather conditions and forecrop species. Winter wheat roots were attacked to the lowest degree when spring rape and radish were used as forecrops, and to the highest degree - when grown after oat. The culm base was most intensely infected with fusarium foot rot (Fusarium spp.). The remaining root-rot diseases occurred every year but with different intensity. The method of utilization of after-harvest residues did not have a clear effect on the intensity of infection of the roots and culm base of winter wheat...|$|R

It is possible to decrease the level of wear by us-ing the proper technology. In this work, we concentrated on the possibility of increasing the wear resistance of surfacing. We tested the resistance of two kinds of surfacing materials in an operational test and compared them with the wear of the basic, untreated material. The comparison was carried out on the basis of lineal proportions and component weight meas-urements taken before and after the operational test and on laboratory tests of the hardness and metallography.

40|$|Abstract. Stubble burning has {{traditionally}} been used in semi-arid land for pest and weed control, and to remove the excess of crop residues before seeding in no-tillage systems. We compared differences in soil properties in a long-term (10 years) tillage trial on a carbonated soil in semi-arid north-east Spain under no-tillage with stubble returned and stubble burnt, with the conventional tillage system (mouldboard <b>plough,</b> <b>stubble</b> returned) as a reference. Differences in total soil organic C and C in particulate organic matter, mineralisation potential, soil physical properties (bulk density, penetration resistance, and aggregate size distribution and stability), and earthworm populations were quantified. The effect of stubble burning was absent or insignificant {{compared with that of}} tillage in most of the parameters studied. The most significant effect of stubble burning was the change in soil organic matter quality in the topsoil and penetration resistance. No-till plus stubble burning stocked an amount of organic C in the soil similar to no-till without burning, but the particulate organic matter content and mineralisation potential were smaller. Earthworm activity was similar under the 2 no-till systems, although a trend towards bigger earthworms with increasing penetration resistance was observed under the system with burning. Our results indicate that the role of burnt plant residues and earthworms in organic matter accumulation and soil aggregation in Mediterranean carbonated soils under no tillage is of major importance, meriting further attention an...|$|R

40|$|The Kverneland Ecomat and The Ecomat Seeder {{has been}} tested in three {{different}} field studies. All the studies were conducted on soils with different clay content during 2005 in Säby outside Uppsala. In one of the trial spring ploughing with the Ecomat and spring ploughing and seeding with Ecomat Seeder were compared with conventional autumn mouldboard ploughing and spring mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> <b>to</b> conventional depth (22 - 23 cm). In this study {{the quality of the}} seedbed, the number of emerged plants and weeds, the penetration resistance and the yield were examined. Shallow spring ploughing (10 cm) with the Kverneland Ecomat has shown to be a good alternative <b>to</b> conventional autumn <b>ploughing</b> when growing spring crops. During the season 2005 tilling with the Ecomat resulted in a higher yield than conventional ploughing. In 2002 - 2005 the average yield for shallow spring ploughing was 4 percent higher than after conventional autumn mouldboard ploughing and 10 percent higher than after spring mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> <b>to</b> conventional depth (22 - 23 cm). In the other two studies, <b>ploughing</b> <b>to</b> different depth in the autumn with the Ecomat was compared with conventional mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> and <b>stubble</b> discing. The crop in one of the studies was restricted to winter wheat, and in the other it was restricted to spring barley. In these trials we examined the yield, the decomposition of crop residues, the presence of pathogens, the energy for fracturing and the specific draught requirement. In the monotonous winter-wheat crop succession {{there were no significant differences}} between tillage and the presence of fungi pathogens. In both trials there were positive interaction between the tillage depth and yield. The deepest treatments with the Ecomat (17 cm) resulted in the same yield as with conventional ploughing...|$|R
