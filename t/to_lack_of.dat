5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony {{and later the}} Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, {{though there is no}} evidence to prove the theory. It is considered unlikely due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, however—the year bids from {{contractors}} were to {{be entertained}} by the city—the project was halted and the project's engineering staff laid off. Officially, the plan was delayed due <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> funding, but Hylan and New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) Chairman John Delaney also wanted to secure freight service for the tunnel. The status of the tunnel as mixed-use created tension and deadlock between Hylan, Delaney and the New York State Transit Commission; the latter emphasized passenger service for the tunnel. After an investigation issued by Governor Al Smith, planners eliminated freight service from the plan, as per the Nicoll-Hofstadter Act {{signed into law by}} the governor; this then led <b>to</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interest from contractors.|$|E
