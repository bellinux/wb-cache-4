Such a drug, called Mifepristone, was in fact approved in the United States in September 2000; {{one of the last}} months of the Clinton presidency. Also the political issues related <b>to</b> <b>Haiti</b> have close parallels to an episode in the Clinton presidency: the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power by the United States in 1994.|$|E
5|$|International {{governments and}} {{agencies}} through the United Nations sent relief supplies and monetary assistance <b>to</b> <b>Haiti,</b> following Gordon's devastating impact there.

They, along with Joseph's pregnant wife Juliette, were travelling to Joseph's native island of Haiti.

Napoleon wanted to regain the colony of Saint Domingue, but {{preferred}} to save his main French army for more important matters, closer to home. The now inconvenient Polish units were accompanied by contingents of Germans and Swiss French allies, as well as by French units that had fallen out of favour with Napoleon and the French high command.|$|E

5|$|The prologue to {{the novel}} is Carpentier’s most often quoted text, in which he coins the term lo real maravilloso ("marvellous reality") in {{reference}} to seemingly miraculous occurrences in Latin America. This is contrasted {{with the lack of}} magic and imagination in European folklore. Furthermore, his trip <b>to</b> <b>Haiti</b> in 1943 is recounted, {{as well as some of}} the research he did to gather facts for the novel. Carpentier also denounces the commonplace and formulaic instances of the marvellous that is found in surrealist novels due to its inorganic and false origins, as opposed to the natural magic that is found in Latin America.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel, an {{illiterate}} slave, is a {{protagonist of}} African origin. He {{begins as a}} young slave who, during the unravelling of the novel, travels to Cuba before returning <b>to</b> <b>Haiti.</b> He is twice branded as a slave but now is a free man. Although he grows old, he remains a witness rather than actor and more often reacts to, as opposed to causes, events throughout the novel. He is in admiration of Macandal's qualities prior {{to the loss of}} Macandal's arm; he accompanies Macandal into the mountains and is saddened by his departure.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s an {{outbreak}} of African swine fever hit the neighboring Dominican Republic. Officials feared the flu might spread throughout <b>Haiti</b> and <b>to</b> the United States, where it could devastate the pork industry. The United States Agency for International Development, known as USAID, and the Haitian government led a campaign, known by the French acronym PEPPADEP, <b>to</b> exterminate <b>Haiti's</b> pigs. Farmers who were compensated received pigs imported from the United States that were far more vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>Haiti's</b> environment and expensive to keep. In the year following the slaughter, levels of enrollment in schools were dramatically lower throughout Haiti's countryside.|$|R

5|$|Alejo Carpentier {{grew up in}} Havana, Cuba and {{was born}} on December 26, 1904 in Lausanne, Switzerland. He {{subsequently}} moved to France in 1933 (at the age of 29) and returned to Cuba six years later, in 1939. Once in Cuba, Carpentier joined {{a group of young}} writers whose goal was to establish a literature faithful to the New World, by recovering origins, history, and tradition. In 1943, he travelled <b>to</b> <b>Haiti,</b> where he was made aware of Dominique Hyppolyte's play, Le Torrent, about the Haitian Revolution, which features a character named Ti Noel. As The Kingdom of This World coincides with Carpentier's return to Cuba, it is very much influenced by the author's re-encounter with himself and his origins.|$|E
5|$|Atlanta was a casemate ironclad {{that served}} in the Confederate and Union Navies during the American Civil War. She was {{converted}} from a Scottish-built blockade runner named Fingal by the Confederacy after she made one run to Savannah, Georgia. After several failed attempts to attack Union blockaders, the ship was captured by two Union monitors in 1863 when she ran aground. Atlanta was floated off, repaired, and rearmed, serving in the Union Navy {{for the rest of}} the war. She spent most of her time deployed on the James River supporting Union forces there. The ship was decommissioned in 1865 and placed in reserve. Several years after the end of the war, Atlanta was sold <b>to</b> <b>Haiti,</b> but was lost at sea in December 1869 on her delivery voyage.|$|E

In 1861, he became a representative at the Haitian Bureau of Emigration, empowering him with the transfers of funds for free blacks who sought to move <b>to</b> <b>Haiti,</b> via New York.
