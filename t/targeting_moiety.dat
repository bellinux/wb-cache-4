40|$|A self-consistent {{field study}} is {{presented}} {{on the design}} of active and passive targeting block-copolymeric micelles. These micelles form in water by self-assembly of triblock copolymers with a hydrophilic middle block and two hydrophobic outer blocks. A minority amount of diblock copolymers with the same chemistry is taken to coassemble into these micelles. At the end of the hydrophilic block of the diblock copolymers, a <b>targeting</b> <b>moiety</b> (TM) is present. Assuming that the rotation of the micelle towards the target is sufficiently fast, we can elaborate a single gradient cell model, wherein the micelle is in the center and the receptor (R) substrate exists on the outer plane of the spherical coordinate system. The distribution function of the <b>targeting</b> <b>moiety</b> corresponds to a Landau free energy with local minima and corresponding maxima. The lowest minimum, which is the ground state, shifts from within the micelle to the adsorbing state upon bringing the substrate closer to the micelle, implying a jumplike translocation of the <b>targeting</b> <b>moiety.</b> Equally deep minima represent the binodal of the phase transition, which is, due to the finite chain length, first-order like. The maximum in-between the two relevant minima implies that there is an activation barrier for the <b>targeting</b> <b>moiety</b> to reach the receptor surface. We localize the parameter space wherein the <b>targeting</b> <b>moiety</b> is (when the micelle is far from the target) preferably hidden in the stealthy hydrophilic corona of the micelle, which is desirable to avoid undesired immune responses, and still can jump out of the corona to reach the target quick enough, that is, when the barrier height is sufficiently low. The latter requirement may be identified by a spinodal condition. We found that such hidden TMs can still establish a TM-R contact at distances up to twice the corona size. The translocation transition will work best when the affinity of the TM for the core is avoided and when hydrophilic TMs are selected. </p...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{targeting}} of antigen to antigen presenting cells (APC) increases immune responses. However, it is unclear if more than one APC-specific targeting unit in the antigenic molecule will increase responses. To address this issue, we have here made heterodimeric vaccine molecules that each express four different fusion subunits. The bacterial ribonuclease barnase and its inhibitor barstar interact with high affinity, and the barnase-barstar complex was therefore used as a dimerization unit. Barnase and barstar were fused N-terminally with single chain fragment variable (scFv) s targeting units specific for either MHC class II molecules on APC or the hapten 5 -iodo- 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrophenylacetyl (NIP). C-terminal antigenic fusions were either the fluorescent protein mCherry or scFv 315 derived from myeloma protein M 315. The heterodimeric vaccine molecules were formed both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the four different fused moieties appeared to fold correctly since they retained their specificity and function. DNA vaccination with MHC class II-targeted vaccine induced higher mCherry-specific IgG 1 responses compared to non-targeted control. Since mCherry and MHC class II are in trans in this heterodimer, this suggests that heterodimeric proteins are formed in vivo without prior protein purification.

The phages are genetically modified to display a <b>targeting</b> <b>moiety</b> on their surface and are used to deliver a large payload of a cytotoxic drug to the target bacteria.

40|$|The central {{problem in}} cancer {{chemotherapy}} is the severe toxic {{side effects of}} anticancer drugs on healthy tissues. Invariably the side effects impose dose reduction, treatment delay, or discontinuance of therapy. To limit the adverse side effects of cancer chemotherapy on healthy organs, we proposed a drug delivery system (DDS) with specific targeting ligands for cancer cells. The proposed DDS minimizes the uptake of the drug by normal cells and enhances the influx and retention of the drug in cancer cells. This delivery system includes three main components: (i) an apoptosis-inducing agent (anticancer drug), (ii) a targeting moiety-penetration enhancer, and (iii) a carrier. We describe one of the variants of such a system, which utilizes camptothecin as an apoptosis-inducing agent and poly(ethylene glycol) as a carrier.
