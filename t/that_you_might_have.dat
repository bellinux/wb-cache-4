500|$|Shortly {{before the}} game's release, IGN posted {{a review of}} the game, citing {{numerous}} bugs and crashes in the PlayStation 3 release. The game also contained a bug, causing the game to freeze and the screen to blur when friends signed out of and into the PlayStation Network. The IGN review was edited shortly thereafter, removing all references to the PS3 version's bugs, causing controversy in the PlayStation communities. Reviewing PlayStation 3 Game of the Year edition, Digital Chumps and Spawn Kill confirmed that most bugs remained, citing occasional freezes, several animation and scripting issues, along with other bugs, requiring a restart of the game. Even IGN retroactively cited bugs with the original release as well as the Game of the Year edition, calling it [...] "a fantastic game", but warned players to [...] "be aware <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> to deal with some crashes and bugs".|$|E
2500|$|To {{help promote}} the album, Hogan {{appeared}} in the November 2006 edition of FHM, becoming the first FHM cover model under 21 years old. As a result, the November issue had no liquor advertising. Dana Leslie Fields, executive publisher and president of FHM, said: [...] "In the very rare instance <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> a cover star {{under the age of}} 21, they don't {{want to be in the}} position of seeming to market to anyone under age." ...|$|E
2500|$|The hippies {{inherited}} various countercultural {{views and}} practices regarding sex and love from the Beat Generation; [...] "their writings influenced the hippies {{to open up}} {{when it came to}} sex, and to experiment without guilt or jealousy." [...] One popular hippie slogan that appeared was [...] "If it feels good, do it!" [...] which for many [...] "meant you were free to love whomever you pleased, whenever you pleased, however you pleased. This encouraged spontaneous sexual activity and experimentation. Group sex, public sex... homosexuality under the influence of drugs, all the taboos went out the window. This doesn't mean that straight sex... or monogamy were unknown, quite the contrary. Nevertheless, the open relationship became an accepted part of the hippy lifestyle. This meant <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> a primary relationship with one person, but if another attracted you, you could explore that relationship without rancor or jealousy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{not so bad}} as all <b>that.</b> But <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{been less}} abrupt. Russ, you seem to take an--an awful tragic view of your--your own case." ...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2013, Ryan stated, [...] "It's {{going to}} be a CBS procedural. We're going to solve a case every week, but we're going to do it with a lot of humor and a lot of fun. And I would say the stealth thing I would like to get in is, in a day and age when income {{inequality}} and class inequities dominate a lot of the country, this is {{going to be}} an opportunity to put a young working-class kid in Detroit in the middle of Beverly Hills, you can do a lot of stealth social commentary. My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, that would be something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Mr. Crowe strikes the deepest {{registers}} with the tortured character of Bud White, a part {{that has had}} less cut out {{of it from the}} book than either Mr. Spacey's or Mr. Pearce's ... but Mr. Crowe at moments reminded me of James Cagney's poignant performance in Charles Vidor's Love Me or Leave Me (1955), and I can think of no higher praise." [...] Kenneth Turan, in his review for Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "The only potential audience drawback L.A. Confidential has is its reliance on unsettling bursts of violence, both bloody shootings and intense physical beatings that give the picture a palpable air of menace. Overriding that, finally, is the film's complete command of its material." [...] In his review for The Independent, Ryan Gilbey wrote, [...] "In fact, it's a very well made and intelligent picture, assembled with an attention to detail, both in plot and characterisation, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> feared was all but extinct in mainstream American cinema." [...] Richard Williams, in his review for The Guardian, wrote, [...] "L.A. Confidential gets just about everything right. The light, the architecture, the slang, the music ... a wonderful Lana Turner joke. A sense, above all, of damaged people arriving to make new lives and getting seduced by the scent of night-blooming jasmine, the perfume of corruption." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Serious! a quoi bon? I am serious--serious in my {{surprise}} <b>that,</b> when <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> had either of these women, you should have preferred that hideous wife of yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Permit me {{to present}} to you the Marquis de Sogrange," [...] Peter begged. [...] "He is my oldest friend, Baroness. I think <b>that</b> {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{to say to me}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> very well say before him." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. He means <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> married. Curious, {{how little}} they {{understand}} our position.|$|E
6000|$|... "I greatly feared from my {{previous}} experience of your impatience under restraint <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> left us," [...] he said kindly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing at all," [...] he {{answered}} reassuringly. [...] "I simply thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> lost your way. These are lonely parts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, surely, Mark, {{there can}} be no hurry about <b>that.</b> I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> stayed a little longer before running away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{had done}} {{anything}} else, I think, Anthony, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> very well <b>have</b> called me--whatever is {{the reverse of}} an angel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am rubbing nothing in," [...] {{the doctor}} replied with unruffled calm. [...] "I speak the truth. If {{you had been}} possessed of the same moral stamina as His Excellency, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{preserved}} your health and the things <b>that</b> count. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been as useful to your country as he is to his." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Only {{if you do}} love him--! I {{would give}} my right hand, Clary, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> that which shall make you happy in life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR CHARLES,--I {{have often}} been {{thinking}} {{of you and your}} whereabouts in Germany, and wishing I knew more about you; and at last it occurred to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>have</b> the same wish about me, and that therefore I should do well to write to you.|$|R
60|$|One day he {{was sitting}} under a bush playing so sweetly <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> easily <b>have</b> mistaken the notes for those of a bird, when an old man passed by. 'What trade {{do you wish to}} follow, my son?' he asked in a {{friendly}} voice, stopping as he did so in front of the youth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't go {{quite so}} far as <b>that,</b> but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> gone a little further than you did. Haven't you a message for me?" [...] Then he smiled before he added, [...] "You were sent to {{denounce}} my folly--and you can't do it. If you trusted your own impulses you would give me your benediction instead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did you let us sleep, Uncle 'Rasmus?" [...] I demanded. [...] "We {{should have}} {{remained}} awake so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{an opportunity to}} rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{gone on to}} Burgos, {{and fallen}} in the assault there; or shared in that dreadful retreat to the {{frontier}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you?' said Miss Grandison. 'Well, I have {{sometimes}} thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> a latent suspicion of that subject, too. I {{thought you were}} his confidant.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gregson's good,' said Reece, 'put him down. <b>That</b> makes five. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> young Lee in too. I've {{seen him}} play {{like a book}} at his form net once or twice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] I said. [...] "I {{could not}} help it, but I had been {{thinking}} that it was of dear Lucy <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wished to ask, and so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> time to wait, not on my account, but because I know your time must be precious, I have written {{it out on the}} typewriter for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{disaster}} to Teddy and Mrs. Teddy hit him hard. He {{winced at the}} thought of Mrs. Teddy's white face; the unspoken accusation in her eyes. He felt he could never bring himself to say his one excuse to her: [...] "I did not keep Hugh back. If I <b>had</b> done <b>that,</b> then <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> the right to blame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ask none, sir. But I {{have thought}} it {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are {{thinking}} of my cousin,' said Ferdinand. 'I thought that you had discovered, or <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> learnt, {{that there was no}} real intention of our union.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stephen, how can you! We came West {{in order}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> more {{chance for the}} career to which you are entitled. Our friends in Boston were more than good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{should have}} fancied"; and Eveline Annersly's eyes twinkled. [...] "Did it ever occur to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} {{a good deal}} from you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} help <b>that.</b> Or rather <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> helped it if you pleased. It was {{necessary}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should meet, but I didn't tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were to see {{a great deal of}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{perhaps you}} know it," [...] he answered, taken aback at my manner, [...] "though she always insisted upon its being kept a dead secret, so <b>that</b> one day <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> a {{pleasant}} surprise." ...|$|R
