2500|$|Transmission {{of color}} images using {{mechanical}} scanners had been conceived {{as early as}} the 1880s. A practical demonstration of mechanically-scanned color television was given by John Logie Baird in 1928, but the limitations of a mechanical system were apparent even then. Development of electronic scanning and display made an all-electronic system possible. [...] Early monochrome <b>transmission</b> <b>standards</b> were developed prior to the Second World War, but civilian electronics developments were frozen during much of the war. In August 1944, Baird gave the world's first demonstration of a practical fully electronic color television display. In the United States, commercially competing color standards were developed, finally resulting in the NTSC standard for color that retained compatibility with the prior monochrome system. Although the NTSC color standard was proclaimed in 1953 and limited programming became available, {{it was not until the}} early 1970's that color television in North American outsold black and white or monochrome units. [...] Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s.|$|E
