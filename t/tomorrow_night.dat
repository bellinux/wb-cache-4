5000|$|The center-stage {{table that}} {{collects}} props from both time periods throughout {{the play is}} a vivid metaphor of the chaos/order dichotomy. As Paul Edwards, professor of English and History of Art at Bath Spa University, explains: [...] "At {{the end of the}} play, the table has accumulated a variety of objects that, if one saw them without having seen the play, would seem completely random and disordered. Entropy is high. But if one has seen the play, one has full information about the objects and the hidden order of their arrangement, brought about by the performance itself. Entropy is low; this can be proved by reflecting that <b>tomorrow</b> <b>nights</b> performance of the play will finish with the table in a virtually identical disorder — which therefore cannot really be disorder at all." ...|$|R

5000|$|After {{leaving the}} Navy, Dooley and three former Navy corpsmen {{established}} a hospital near Luang Namtha, Laos. The hospital was five {{miles south of}} the Chinese border. In an article entitled [...] "Why I'm A Jungle Medic," [...] printed in Think magazine, June 1958, Dooley said they chose Laos because the country, with 3,000,000 people, had only one [...] "bonafide" [...] doctor. Dooley went on to establish additional medical clinics and hospitals under the sponsorship of the International Rescue Committee. He explained to the Laotian Minister of Health that he wished to work in an area near the Chinese border because [...] "there are sick people there and furthermore people who had been flooded with potent draughts of anti-Western propaganda from Red China." [...] Dooley founded the Medical International Cooperation Organization (MEDICO) under the auspices of which he built hospitals at Nam Tha, Muong Sing, and Ban Houei Sa. The plan for MEDICO was that it would build, stock, supply, and train staff for small hospitals; after 16 months, MEDICO planned to turn over these hospitals to the host country's government.During this same time period, he wrote two books, The Edge of <b>Tomorrow</b> and The <b>Night</b> They Burned the Mountain, about his experience in Laos, including descriptions of atrocities he said were committed by communist soldiers.|$|R
