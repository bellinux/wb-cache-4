5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with <b>the</b> <b>conclusions</b> of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. <b>The</b> <b>conclusions</b> of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine {{the flexibility of the}} neck of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus.

5|$|On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen {{issued its}} {{report on the}} matter. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence. Clinton said she accepted <b>the</b> <b>conclusions</b> of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>conclusions</b> of {{the study}} was that the people buried in Lindow Moss may have had a less varied diet than their European counterparts.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} on property induction {{were conducted to}} explore whether an incoherent premise discounted the believability of <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> when there were two premises. In all three experiments, a single premise increased or decreased the likelihood of <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> depending on <b>the</b> nature of explanatory coherence of a premise and a conclusion. However, when there were two premises, one that shared the reason with <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> (coherent premise), and {{one that does not}} (incoherent premise), the believability of <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> was affected differently in three experiments. When two premises and <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> were presented simultaneously in Experiment 1, the believability of <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> was increased. That is, an incoherent premise did not seem to affect the believability of <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> as much as the coherent premise. The incoherent premise seemed to decrease the believability of <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> a little bit when the two premises and <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> were presented sequentially so that each premise was not ignored in Experiment 2. The incoherent premise decreased the believability of <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> below <b>the</b> baseline condition in Experiment 3, where participants were asked to write down reasons for each premise being true. Results of three experiments suggested that only the confirming evidences were processed under natural conditions. A few possible theoretical implications were considered...|$|R

It would be self-contradictory to assert the premises and deny <b>the</b> <b>conclusion,</b> because <b>the</b> negation of <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> is contradictory {{to the truth of}} the premises.|$|R

5|$|The 1949 Intelligence Survey Group had {{produced}} the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, {{which found that}} the CIA had failed in its responsibilities in both the coordination and production of intelligence.

In May 1950, President Truman decided that Smith was the man he needed for the CIA. Before Smith could assume the post on 7 October, {{there was a major}} intelligence failure.

5|$|The Minister {{had decided}} that the Jehovah's Witnesses' {{doctrine}} prohibiting its adherents from taking part in military service was contrary to national security and, thus, to public order and the public interest.

The appellants had not shown that the Minister had based his conclusions on false or unfounded facts; thus, unless <b>the</b> <b>conclusions</b> were irrelevant, the Court could not interfere with the Minister's opinion since his discretionary power had been exercised within statutory limitations.|$|E
5|$|After the {{elections}} of 2011, Mirela Holy, who had declared her opposition to the project prior to {{the elections}}, was appointed Minister of Environment and Nature Protection.

Objections were raised by authors of the EIA that the reviews were not published {{and the names of}} the authors have been kept secret. Prime Minister Zoran Milanović said he wanted to collect opinions from the foremost Croatian, European, and worldwide experts before deciding on the matter, which has been under consideration since the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{a genetic}} study was made basing on the {{evolutionary}} history of common elands.

5|$|John Shaw {{and other}} historians, {{military}} and civilian, have based <b>the</b> <b>conclusions</b> {{of their work}} on the incursion {{on the premise that}} the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective. The next large-scale North Vietnamese offensive, the Nguyen Hue Offensive of 1972 (called the Easter Offensive in the West) would be launched out of southern North Vietnam and western Laos, not from Cambodia, was cited as proof positive that the Cambodian operations had succeeded. The fact that PAVN forces were otherwise occupied in Cambodia and had no such offensive plan (so far as is known) was seemingly irrelevant. The fact that logistically, a northern offensive (especially a conventional one backed by armour and heavy artillery) would be launched closer to its source of manpower and supply also seemed to be of little consequence.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003. The DSB urged the Air Force to re-engine the aircraft without delay, saying {{doing so would}} not only create significant cost savings, but reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase aircraft range and endurance; these conclusions were in line with <b>the</b> <b>conclusions</b> of a separate Congress-funded study conducted in 2003. Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed {{to account for the}} cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to account for the cost of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E
