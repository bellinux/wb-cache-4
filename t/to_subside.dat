5|$|Romanticism began <b>to</b> <b>subside</b> as a {{movement}} in the 1830s, but it continued to significantly affect areas such as music until the early twentieth century. It also had a lasting impact {{on the nature of}} Scottish identity and outside perceptions of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the marshy ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure <b>to</b> <b>subside,</b> and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|The entire Colorado Plateau {{then started}} to uplift from near sea level to several {{thousand}} feet (over a kilometer) in elevation. An alternate {{theory is that}} the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region <b>to</b> <b>subside</b> relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends <b>to</b> <b>subside</b> with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|Mountains {{continued}} to rise in the Sevier orogenic belt to the west during the Cretaceous while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the Gulf of Mexico helped {{the southern end of}} the basin <b>to</b> <b>subside,</b> which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways ever, called the Western Interior Seaway, drowned much of western North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of Cedar City, Utah while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, stable platform ramp in Nebraska and Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The genre {{entered a}} new level {{following}} the release of Little Caesar (1931), which featured Edward G. Robinson as gangster Rico Bandello. Caesar, along with The Public Enemy starring James Cagney as Tom Powers and Scarface (1932), featuring Paul Muni as Tony Comante, were, by standards of the time, incredibly violent films that created {{a new type of}} anti-hero. Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began <b>to</b> <b>subside</b> after the end of Prohibition. The backlash against gangster films was swift. In 1931, Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making them and that he himself had never allowed his 15-year-old son to see them.|$|E

5|$|After Mindaugas' death, {{the state}} did not {{disintegrate}} and Treniota took over the title of Grand Duke. However, his power was fragile; he was challenged by Tautvilas, who had not forgotten his own claims to power. Tautvilas was also assassinated by Treniota. However, just a year later, in 1264, Treniota was killed by Mindaugas' former servants. His son Vaišvilkas and his brother-in-law Shvarn from Volhynia took over the control in Lithuania. Daumantas was forced to flee to Pskov, was baptized Timofei, ruled successfully from 1266 to 1299 and even became a saint. In 1265 Vaišvilkas, as a Christian, reconciled with the Livonian Order and, without support from Lithuania, the rebellions among the Balts that had been fueled by Treniota began <b>to</b> <b>subside.</b> In 1267 he returned to a monastic life and transferred the Grand Duchy to Shvarn.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures <b>to</b> <b>subside</b> and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E
5|$|By mid-December, Eisenhower {{had been}} {{appointed}} Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and moved to England. As media attention surrounding the incident began <b>to</b> <b>subside,</b> McCloy told Patton he would indeed be eventually returning to combat command. Patton was briefly considered to lead the Seventh Army in Operation Dragoon, but Eisenhower felt his experience would be more useful in the Normandy campaign. Eisenhower and Marshall privately agreed that Patton would command a follow-on field army after Bradley's army conducted the initial invasion of Normandy; Bradley would then command the resulting army group. Patton was told on 1 January 1944 only {{that he would be}} relieved of command of the Seventh Army and moved to Europe. In his diary, he wrote that he would resign if he was not given command of a field army. On 26 January 1944, formally given command of a newly arrived unit, the Third United States Army, he went to the United Kingdom to prepare the unit's inexperienced soldiers for combat. This duty occupied Patton throughout early 1944.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{specific}} example, climate change will cause widespread thawing of permafrost in the discontinuous zone and {{significant changes in}} the continuous zone. [...] Thawing permafrost can lead to a landscape of irregular depressions (thermokarst) due <b>to</b> <b>subsiding</b> soils. [...] This can alter drainage patterns and even change the course of streams; whereas other areas could become swamp-like. [...] In addition, slope stability will decrease and permafrost degradation could lead to erosion of river banks resulting in an increase in sediment transport by the rivers. [...] These physical changes will impact nutrient cycling and biological processes within the basin as well.|$|R
50|$|An {{increase}} in seismic activity in March 2015 {{resulted in the}} alert level being raised to Level 1. The anomalous activity was deemed <b>to</b> have <b>subsided</b> after three weeks, and the alert level was lowered back to Level 0.|$|R
5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely <b>to</b> <b>subside</b> on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when the property owner, Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning <b>to</b> <b>subside.</b> He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh's party, {{which left}} the ship {{on the morning}} of 3 January, {{consisted}} of Mackintosh and three sailors, with a sledge containing supplies and a large mailbag. Two sailors quickly returned to the ship, while Mackintosh and one companion went forward. They camped on the ice that evening, only to find next day that the whole area around them had broken up. After a desperate dash over the moving floes, they managed to reach a small glacier tongue. They camped there, and waited for several days for their snow-blindness <b>to</b> <b>subside.</b> When their vision returned, they found that Cape Royds was in sight but inaccessible, as the sea-ice leading to it had gone, leaving a stretch of open water. They {{had little choice but to}} make for the hut by land, a dangerous undertaking without appropriate equipment and experience.|$|E

50|$|Successful rifting {{creates a}} {{spreading}} center like a mid-ocean ridge, which moves progressively further from coastlines as oceanic lithosphere is produced. Due to this initial phase of rifting, the crust in a passive margin is thinner than adjacent crust and <b>subsides</b> <b>to</b> create an accommodation space. Accumulation of non-marine sediment forms alluvial {{fans in the}} accommodation space. As rifting proceeds, listric fault systems form and further subsidence occurs, resulting {{in the creation of}} an ocean basin. After the cessation of rifting, cooling causes the crust <b>to</b> further <b>subside,</b> and loading with sediment will cause further tectonic subsidence.|$|R
25|$|Next, the Sassanids {{attacked}} Tower 14, {{the southernmost}} {{along the western}} wall. It overlooked a deep ravine {{to the south and}} it was from that direction that it was attacked. This time the mining operation was successful in that it caused the tower and adjacent walls <b>to</b> <b>subside.</b> However the Roman countermeasure which bolstered the wall prevented it from collapsing.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to {{the union}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>subside</b> {{somewhat}} for a time upon the publication of Tsar Nicholas II's congratulations to the king on his engagement and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding. The marriage duly took place in August 1900. Even so, the unpopularity of the union weakened the King's position {{in the eyes of}} the army and of the country at large.|$|E
25|$|For most women, PGP {{resolves}} {{in weeks}} after delivery {{but for some}} it can last for years resulting in a reduced tolerance for weight bearing activities. PGP can take from 11 weeks, 6 months or even up to 2 years postpartum <b>to</b> <b>subside.</b> However, some research supports that the average time to complete recovery is 6.25 years, and the more severe the case is, the longer recovery period.|$|E
