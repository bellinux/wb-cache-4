[...] She said, [...] "No." [...] I said, [...] "Well, who have I gotten to?" [...] "UCLA." [...] I said, [...] "Why didn't you say UCLA?" [...] "Oh," [...] she said, [...] "we're instructed to say University of California."

60|$|I {{have seen}} her at last. She is a hundred and seven years old, and remembers George Washington quite distinctly. It is {{somewhat}} confusing, however, that she also remembers a contemporaneous Josiah W. Perkins of Basking Ridge, N. J., and, I think, has the impression that Perkins was the better man.

All that was vain is vain. I forget it when I can. I have--not a great while left. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> even I can do before that time. One of them--the biggest to me--concerns you. You are in trouble. You have a boy who can be spared much unhappiness in life. If you were married--if the boy had my name--how different the future! Perhaps there can be some measure of happiness for you. For him there is every hope. You will leave Middleville. You will go far away somewhere. You are young. You have a good education. You can teach school, or help your parents while the boy is growing up. Time is kind. You will forget.... Marry me, Mel, for his sake." ...|$|E

I lay down the proposition, that Judge Douglas is not only the man that promises you in advance a hold upon the North, and support in the North, but he constantly moulds public opinion to your ends; that in every possible way he can he constantly moulds the public opinion of the North to your ends; and if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> in which he seems to be against you,--a few things which he says that appear to be against you, and a few that he forbears to say which you would like to have him say you ought to remember that the saying of the one, or the forbearing to say the other, would lose his hold upon the North, and, by consequence, would lose his capacity to serve you.|$|E
