5|$|On 15 April 1861, <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Sardinia was {{declared}} <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly formed Kingdom of Italy. This Italian tricolour, with the armorial bearings {{of the former}} Royal House of Savoy was the first national flag and lasted in that form for 85 years until {{the birth of the}} Italian Republic in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{flags of}} Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, can all trace their roots to <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation of Gran Colombia (1819–1830), the {{short-lived}} republic that encompassed the territories of all three. The Gran Colombian flag {{in turn was}} inspired by <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Republic of Venezuela, the first independent government of that nation. <b>The</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Venezuelan Republic was modeled on the one created earlier by General Francisco de Miranda during his attempts to gain Venezuelan independence and which first flew over the port of La Vela in Santa Ana de Coro, Venezuela, in 1806.|$|E

5|$|After the Nazi Party {{seized power}} on 30 January 1933, the black-red-gold flag was swiftly scrapped; a ruling on 12 March {{established}} two legal national flags: the reintroduced black-white-red imperial tricolour and <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazi Party.|$|E

5|$|In 1806, {{the village}} was visited by a Spanish {{expedition}} led by Lieutenant Facundo Melgares and, soon after, by an American expedition led by Lieutenant Zebulon Pike. At the village, Pike persuaded the Pawnee leaders to haul down a Spanish flag that they had received from Melgares, and to raise <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States in its stead.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of the Two Sicilies {{was again}} {{modified}} to the defaced Italian tricolour with the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies coat of arms.

5|$|In {{the same}} year, after Napoleon had crowned himself first French Emperor, the Italian Republic was {{transformed}} into the first Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, or Italico, under his direct rule. <b>The</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Italy {{was that of the}} Republic in rectangular form, charged with the golden Napoleonic eagle. This remained in use until the abdication of Napoleon in 1814.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{originally}} suggested the yellow, green and red, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was {{that as part of}} the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus, and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{two other}} {{national}} flags are hoisted on flagpoles {{one at a}} time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. In Moscow during the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott, the flag raised to represent the next games host was that of the City of Los Angeles instead of <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boycotting-United States. In Sydney and Athens, two Greek flags were raised because Greece was the next games host (in 2000) and in 2004, because Greece was hosting the games. Then, while the Olympic Hymn is played, the Olympic Flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremonies is lowered from the flagpole and carried from the stadium.|$|E

5|$|Other flags {{used in the}} People's Republic of China use a red {{background}} to symbolize the revolution {{in conjunction with other}} symbols. <b>The</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People's Liberation Army uses the gold star with the Chinese characters 8-1 (for 1 August, the date of the PLA's founding). <b>The</b> <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party of China replaces all of the stars with the party emblem. Due to government regulations, cities and provinces of China cannot have their own flags; the only sub-national flags that exist are those of the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions. Despite this, at least two cities have adopted flags after the law was passed. The cities of Kaifeng and Shangrao adopted their flags in March 2006 and March 2009 respectively. This implies that the law is either repealed or not enforced.|$|E
