The nurseries were run by local people. They managed to raise seedling of W.salutaris and S. guinense, but had problems with the germination of H.rubrostipulata.

50|$|The {{breeding}} corn crake {{population had}} begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe {{is the loss of}} nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit tight on the nest, with fatal results.Loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake. Apart from the reduced suitability of drained and fertilised silage fields compared to traditional hay meadows, in western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area.

40|$|Camera traps {{have proven}} very useful in ecological, {{conservation}} and behavioral research. Camera traps non-invasively record presence {{and behavior of}} animals in their natural environment. Since the introduction of digital cameras, large amounts of data can be stored.

However, a large number of recordings did not contain <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> but instead empty recordings or other species (together non-target recordings), making the removal of these recordings unacceptably time consuming. In this paper we propose a method to partially eliminate non-target recordings without having to watch the recordings, in order to reduce workload. Discrimination between recordings of <b>target</b> <b>species</b> and non-target recordings was based on detecting variation (changes in pixel values from frame to frame) in the recordings. Because of the size of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> we supposed that recordings with <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species</b> contain on average much more movements than non-target recordings. Two different filter methods were tested and compared. We show that a partial discrimination can be made between target and non-target recordings based on variation in pixel values and that environmental conditions and filter methods influence the amount of non-target recordings that can be identified and discarded.
