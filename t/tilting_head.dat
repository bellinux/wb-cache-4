40|$|Background: Compensatory ocular counter-torsion (COCT) is {{supposed}} to maintain the eyes aligned with the visual environment following <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> Because of some recent controversies the functional capacity of this phenomenon was defined according {{to the extent of}} induced astigmatic axis error following <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> Materials and Methods: Objective autorefractometry was performed on 70 eyes with a regular astigmatism of ≥ 2 D at vertical, right <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and left <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> positions of 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 °. Astigmatic axis error was calculated according to the difference between the defined axis at each <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> position and the defined axis at the vertical head position. A tiltometer was used for this purpose to show the angle of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> without disturbing the process of refractometry. Results: The mean astigmatic axis error was 3. 2 ° ± 1. 5 ° and 18. 4 ° ± 4. 2 ° at the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. The mean percentage of tilt angle compensation by COCT was 36 % and 26 % at the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angles of 5 ° and 25 ° respectively. There was a direct relation between the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> angle and the induced astigmatic axis error (ANOVA, P < 0. 001, 95 % of confidence interval [CI]). Astigmatic axis error values at right <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> were significantly lower than their corresponding values at left <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> (ANOVA, P = 0. 04 95 % CI). Conclusion: Any minimal angle of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> may cause erroneous measurement of astigmatic axis and should be avoided during refraction.

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to hypergravity {{in a human}} centrifuge can lead to post-rotary spatial disorientation and motion sickness. These symptoms are mainly provoked by <b>tilting</b> <b>head</b> movements and resemble the Space Adaptation Syndrome. We hypothesized that the occurrence of these post-rotary effects {{might be related to}} changes in the velocity storage (VS) mechanism, which is suggested {{to play an important role}} in spatial orientation. In particular, we investigated whether the re-orientation of the eye velocity vector (EVV) towards gravity during off-vertical optokinetic stimulation was affected by centrifugation. Twelve human subjects were exposed to a hypergravity load of 3 G (G-load directed along the naso-occipetal axis) for a duration of 90 min. Before and after centrifugation we recorded optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) elicited by a stimulus pattern moving about the subject’s yaw axis, with the head erect and tilted 45 ° to both sides. During OKN with the head erect, we observed a pitch-down component, reorienting the EVV on average 4. 5 ° (SD 3. 6, pretest values) away from the stimulus axis. Head tilt induced an additional shift of the EVV towards the spatial vertical of 6. 4 ° on average (SD 3. 2). This head-tilt induced reorientation was significantly decreased after centrifugation to 4. 7 ° (SD 2. 9), suggesting a reduction of VS-activity. By means of a vector model we estimated the reduction in VS-activity at 31. Such a decrease in VS-activity might reflect a deterioration of the ability to integrate sensory signals to obtain an estimate of gravity during <b>tilting</b> <b>head</b> movements, resulting in motion sickness in susceptible subjects...|$|E

40|$|Poisson-Boltzmann {{calculations}} {{of the distribution}} of electrostatic potentials around an actin filament in physiological-strength solutions show that negative isopotential surfaces protrude into the solvent. Each protrusion follows the actin two-start helix and is located on the sites implicated {{in the formation of the}} actomyosin complex. Molecular dynamic calculations on the S 1 portion of the myosin molecule indicate that in the presence of ATP the crystallographically invisible loops (comprising residues 624 - 649 and 564 - 579) remain on the surface, whereas in the absence of ATP they can move toward the actin-binding sites and experience electrostatic forces that range from 1 to 10 pN. The molecular dynamics calculations also suggest that during the ATP cycle there exist at least three states of electrostatic interactions between the loops and actin. Every time a new interaction is formed, the strain in the myosin head increases and the energy of the complex decreases by 2 kT to 5 kT. This can explain muscular contraction in terms of a Huxley-Simmons-type mechanism, while requiring only rearrangements of small mobile S 1 segments rather than the large shape changes in the myosin molecule postulated by the conventional <b>tilting</b> <b>head</b> model...|$|E
40|$|Accuracy of a five-axis CNC {{machine tool}} is {{affected}} by {{a vast number of}} error sources. This paper investigates volumetric error modeling and its compensation to the basis for creation of new tool path for improvement of work pieces accuracy. The volumetric error model of a five-axis machine tool with the configuration RTTTR (<b>tilting</b> <b>head</b> B-axis and rotary table in work piece side A΄) was set up taking into consideration rigid body kinematics and homogeneous transformation matrix, in which 43 error components are included. Volumetric error comprises 43 error components that can separately reduce geometrical and dimensional accuracy of work pieces. The machining accuracy of work piece is guaranteed due to the position of the cutting tool center point (TCP) relative to the work piece. The cutting tool is deviated from its ideal position relative to the work piece and machining error is experienced. For compensation process detection of the present tool path and analysis of the RTTTR five-axis CNC machine tools geometrical error, translating current position of component to compensated positions using the Kinematics error model, converting newly created component to new tool paths using the compensation algorithms and finally editing old G-codes using G-code generator algorithm have been employed...|$|E
40|$|Activation of {{the gravity}} sensors {{in the inner}} ear-the otoliths-generates {{reflexes}} that act to maintain posture and gaze. Ocular counter-rolling (OCR) {{is an example of}} such a reflex. When the head is tilted to the side, the eyes rotate around the line of sight in the opposite direction (i. e., counter-rolling). While turning comers, undergoing centrifugation, or making side-to-side <b>tilting</b> <b>head</b> movements, the OCR reflex orients the eyes towards the sum of the accelerations from body movements and gravity. Deconditioning of otolith-mediated reflexes following adaptation to microgravity has been proposed as the basis of many of the postural, locomotor, and gaze control problems experienced by returning astronauts. Evidence suggests that OCR is reduced postflight in about 75 % of astronauts tested; but the data are sparse, primarily due to difficulties in recording rotational eye movements. During the Neurolab mission, a short-arm human centrifuge was flown that generated sustained sideways accelerations of 0. 5 -G and one-G to the head and upper body. This produces OCR; and so for the first time, the responses to sustained centrifugation could be studied without the influence of Earth's gravity on the results. This allowed us to determine the relative importance of sideways and vertical acceleration in the generation of OCR. This also provided the first test of the effects of exposure to artificial gravity in space on postflight otolith-ocular reflexes. There was little difference between the responses to centrifugation in microgravity and on Earth. In both conditions, the induced OCR was roughly proportional to the applied acceleration, with the OCR magnitude during 0. 5 -G centrifugation approximately 60 % of that generated during one-G centrifugation. The overall mean OCR from the four payload crewmembers in response to one-G of sideways acceleration was 5. 7 plus or minus 1. 1 degree (mean and SD) on Earth. Inflight one-G centrifugation generated 5. 7 plus or minus 1. 1 degree of OCR, which was a small but significant decrease in OCR magnitude. The postflight OCR was 5. 9 plus or minus 1. 4 degree, which was not significantly different from preflight values. During both 0. 5 -G and one-G centrifugation in microgravity, where the head vertical gravitational component was absent, the OCR magnitude was not significantly different from that produced by an equivalent acceleration during static tilt on Earth. This suggests that the larger OCR magnitude observed during centrifugation on Earth was due to the larger body vertical linear acceleration component, which may have activated either the otoliths or the body tilt receptors. In contrast to previous studies, there was no decrease in OCR gain postflight. Our findings raise the possibility that inflight exposure to artificial gravity, in the form of intermittent one-G and 0. 5 -G centripetal acceleration, may have been a countermeasure to deconditioning of otolith-based orientation reflexes...|$|E
40|$|Shapes {{different}} from the traditional ones have been proposed for face worm gears and for conical and cylindrical worms that mesh with them. The proposed shapes {{are based on the}} concept of generating a face worm gear surface by use of a <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutter instead of by the traditional use of a hob. (As used here, head cutter is also meant to signify, alternatively, a head grinding tool.) The gear-surface-generation equipment would be similar to that used for generation of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In comparison with the corresponding traditional hob, a <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutter according to the proposal would be larger, could be fabricated with greater precision, and would enable the generation of gear surfaces with greater precision and greater productivity. A face worm gear would be generated (see figure) by use of a <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutter, the blades or grinding surfaces of which would have straight-line profiles. The <b>tilt</b> of the <b>head</b> cutter would prevent interference with teeth adjacent to the groove being cut or ground. A worm to mesh with the face worm gear would be generated by use of a <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutter mounted on the cradle of a generating machine. The blades or grinding surfaces of the head cutter would have a parabolic profile and would deviate from the straight-line profiles of the head cutter for the face worm gear. The shortest distance between the worm and the cradle would follow a parabolic function during the cycle of meshing in the generating process to provide a parabolic function of transmission errors to the gear drive. The small mismatch between the profiles of the face-worm-gear and worm head cutters would make it possible to localize the bearing contact in the worm gear drive. The parabolic function of transmission errors could absorb discontinuous linear functions of transmission errors caused by errors of alignment; this could afford a significant benefit, in that such errors are main sources of noise and vibration in gear drives. The main advantage of using <b>tilted</b> <b>head</b> cutters is that cutting speeds are independent of the shape-generation processes, making it possible to choose cutting speeds that are optimum with respect to requirements to minimize temperatures and deformations during fabrication and improve the quality of finished parts...|$|R

40|$|Earth's {{gravity is}} an omnipresent factor {{in human life}} and {{provides}} a strong reference for spatial orientation. Changes in the prevailing gravity level, like the transition to weightlessness during space flight, affect spatial orientation and require adaptation of many physiological processes involving the vestibular system (sensitive to linear acceleration and thus gravity). As long as adaptation is not complete, this adaptation process may be accompanied by nausea, visual or self-motion illusions, and disorientation, as experienced by roughly 50 % of all space travelers during {{the first days of}} spaceflight. Interestingly, the same symptoms can also be experienced on Earth, after sustained exposure to a higher gravitational load in a human centrifuge (i. e., > 60 minutes at a level of 3 times Earth's gravity, 3 G). And importantly, individual susceptibilities to these symptoms during space flight and following centrifugation are correlated. The finding that the transition from 3 to 1 G can evoke the same symptoms as a transition from 1 to 0 G indicates that it is not weightlessness per se that causes these symptoms, but that {{there seems to be a}} general mechanism for adaptation to an altered gravitational environment. In this thesis the paradigm of sustained centrifugation was used to study the vestibular effects of gravity transitions and the underlying adaptation mechanism. The experiments described in this thesis provided further evidence for a correlation between space motion sickness and sickness induced by sustained centrifugation: astronauts who were susceptible to space motion sickness during spaceflight also suffered from sickness after centrifugation. The role of gravity in the occurrence of the symptoms was underscored by the finding that, after centrifugation, dynamic head movements evoked nausea in susceptible subjects, but only when they changed the orientation of the head relative to gravity (i. e., pitch and roll when erect). In addition, nausea increased with the speed of the movements, the duration of the hypergravity exposure and the level of the applied G-load. Investigation of individual vestibular function parameters indicated that left-right differences within the vestibular system (i. e., differences in sensitivity) contributed to individual susceptibility. Investigation of various ocular responses depending on gravity learned that the eyes' spatial behaviour was less adequate after centrifugation. Furthermore, evidence was found supporting the hypothesis that the integration of sensory signals, required to obtain an adequate perception of gravity during dynamic head movements, was deteriorated. Because the perception of gravity is directly related to the occurrence of motion sickness, this can provide an explanation for the occurrence of these symptoms when <b>tilting</b> <b>head</b> movements are performed after centrifugation. The results of these studies therefore shed light on the mechanism underlying the consequences of gravity transitions. They have direct bearing on the application of artificial gravity during space flight, and can be relevant for astronaut training. Aerospace Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{facilities}} at the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source, meridional diffraction patterns of muscles at ca 8 °C were recorded {{with a time}} resolution of 2 or 4 ms. In isometric contractions tetanic peak tension (P 0) is reached in ca 400 ms. Under such conditions, following stimulation from rest, the timing {{of changes in the}} major reflections (the 38. 2 nm troponin reflection, and the 21. 5 and 14. 34 / 14. 58 nm myosin reflections) can be explained in terms of four types of time courses: K 1, K 2, K 3 and K 4. The onset of K 1 occurs immediately after stimulation, but that of K 2, K 3 and K 4 is delayed by a latent period of ca 16 ms. Relative to the end of their own latent periods the half-times for K 1, K 2, K 3 and K 4 are 14 – 16, 16, 32 and 52 ms, respectively. In half-times, K 1, K 2, K 3 lead tension rise by 52, 36 and 20 ms, respectively. K 4 parallels the time course of tension rise. From an analysis of the data we conclude that K 1 reflects thin filament activation which involves the troponin system; K 2 arises from an order-disorder transition during which the register between the filaments is lost; K 3 is due to the formation of an acto-myosin complex which (at P 0) causes 70 % or more of the heads to diffract with actin-based periodicities; and K 4 is caused by a change in the axial orientation of the myosin heads (relative to thin filament axis) which is estimated to be from 65 – 70 ° at rest to ca 90 ° at P 0. Isotonic contraction experiments showed that during shortening under a load of ca 0. 27 P 0, at least 85 % of the heads (relative to those forming an acto-myosin complex at P 0) diffract with actin-based periodicities, whilst their axial orientation does not change from that at rest. During shortening under a negligible load, at most 5 – 10 % of the heads (relative to those forming an acto-myosin complex at P 0) diffract with actin-based periodicities, and their axial orientation also remains the same as that at rest. This suggests that in isometric contractions the change in axial orientation is not the cause of active tension production, but rather the result of it. Analysis of the data reveals that independent of load, the extent of asynchronous axial motions executed by most of the cycling heads is no more than 0. 5 – 0. 65 nm greater than at rest. To account for the diffraction data in terms of the conventional <b>tilting</b> <b>head</b> model one would have to suppose that a few of the heads, and/or a small part of their mass perform the much larger motions demanded by that model. Therefore we conclude either that the required information is not available in our patterns or that an alternative hypothesis for contraction has to be developed...|$|E

40|$|When <b>tilting</b> the <b>head</b> {{towards the}} {{shoulder}} {{there are numerous}} mechanisms influencing on the generation and maintenance of ocular counter-roll. Each of these mechanisms has its own temporal and spatial characteristics which influences on the counter-rolled eye position. We described a fast transient anti-compensatory torsion movement (torsion peak) as the first response to the <b>head</b> <b>tilting</b> which most certainly has its origin in the vestibular organ and the utricular maculae. Superimposed on this torsion peak we described nystagmus beats with the fast phase directed {{in the same direction}} as the <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> movement suggesting a paralleled activation of the vertical semicircular canals. Synchronous with the torsion peak a fast vertical vergence eye movement was seen. The vertical vergence was always with left eye over right eye in the rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> and always with right eye over left eye the leftward <b>head</b> <b>tilts,</b> thus inducing a physiological skew deviation. The aetiology for this fast vertical vergence response is currently unknown but could probably be explained by a similar vestibular mechanism as for the torsion peak. A substantial amount of ocular counter-rolling (OCR) was a consistent finding in all subjects and test conditions during static <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> The OCR increased with <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> but the relative compensation to the amount of <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> decreased. For example, a 15 ° <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced 3 ° OCR which corresponds to a gain of 0. 20. A 30 ° <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced an even larger OCR (5 °) which corresponds to a gain of 0. 16. A consistent finding was an OCR disconjugacy of the right and left eye which increased with <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> For instance, a rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced a larger ex-cyclo of the left eye than incyclo of the right eye leading to an ex-cyclovergence. The underlying mechanism might be the increased saccular impact in extreme <b>head</b> <b>tilts.</b> Sacculus has been suggested to induce disconjugate OCR while utriculus is thought to induce conjugate OCR. The static <b>head</b> <b>tilt</b> induced a vertical disconjugacy (i. e. vertical vergence) that increased with the <b>head</b> <b>tilt.</b> The direction of the eye position was however not consistent. Some subjects demonstrated a right eye over left eye position in the rightward <b>head</b> <b>tilts</b> while others demonstrated the opposite outcome. This might be explained by a difference in the ocular visual and torsional axes. To maintain binocularity the eyes are forced into vergence and depending on the position of the axes the direction of the vergence movement will differ. When holding the <b>head</b> in a <b>tilted</b> position the torsional position is found to drift. Initially this drift was directed away from the reference position thus increasing the amount of OCR. After a minute the drift was found to change direction and heading towards the reference position, thus decreasing the OCR. The OCR increasing drift might be explained by a decline in the leftward utricular discharge, induced by macula inertia during the initial interaural translation, in favour of the rightward utricular gravitational discharge. The OCR decreasing drift might be explained by an adaptation of the utricular maculae. Other possible explanations might be a leaky neural integrator or a vestibular memory loss which could induce the OCR decreasing drift found during a sustained <b>head</b> <b>tilt...</b>|$|R
