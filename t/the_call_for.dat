5|$|The maindeck of Chesapeake {{was almost}} deserted, having been swept by Shannons gunfire; the {{surviving}} gun crews had either responded to <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> boarders or had taken refuge below.

5|$|There {{has also}} been a general feeling of a shift in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E
5|$|This {{position}} was contested by Andrés Nin {{and some other}} members of the League who did not support <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> a new International. This group prioritised regroupment with other communist oppositions, principally the International Communist Opposition (ICO), linked to the Right Opposition in the Soviet Party, a regroupment which eventually {{led to the formation of}} the International Bureau for Revolutionary Socialist Unity. Trotsky considered those organisations to be centrist. Despite Trotsky, the Spanish section merged with the Spanish section of ICO, forming the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). Trotsky claimed the merger was to be a capitulation to centrism. The Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, a left split from the Social Democratic Party of Germany founded in 1931, co-operated with the International Left Opposition briefly in 1933 but soon abandoned <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> a new International.|$|E
5|$|Abdulwahab Hussain {{was also}} a member of Al Wefaq who {{resigned}} in 2005. Unlike Mushaima and al-Singace, Hussain left politics in 2005. He returned in 2009 when he co-founded Al Wafa' opposition group and became its official spokesperson. He played a bigger role in the uprising; he was not arrested when the uprising began nor was he outside the country. Hussain led the first demonstration in the uprising {{in the early hours of}} 14 February. He is also credited with suggesting autonomous action and total decentralization of the protest movement which was adopted by February 14 Youth Coalition, the group behind <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> an uprising in order to avoid getting infiltrated by government.|$|E
50|$|Onek was one {{of those}} accused in 2011 of {{receiving}} bribes from foreign oil firms as kickbacks. Irish oil firm Tullow Oil reportedly paid bribes to Onek before another MP implicated her and others in <b>the</b> saga.

40|$|Some {{animals have}} the {{capacity}} to produce different alarm <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> terrestrial and aerial predators. However, {{it is not clear what}} cognitive processes are involved in generating these calls. One possibility is the position of the predator: Anything on the ground receives a terrestrial predator call, and anything in the air receives an aerial predator call. Another possibility is that animals are able to recognize the physical features of predators and incorporate those into their calls. As a way of elucidating which of these mechanisms plays a primary role in generating the structure of different calls, we performed two field experiments with Gunnison’s prairie dogs. First, we presented the prairie dogs with a circle, a triangle, and a square, each moving across the colony at the same height and speed. Second, we presented the prairie dogs with two squares of differing sizes. DFA statistics showed that 82. 6 percent of <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> circle and 79. 2 percent of <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> triangle were correctly classified, and 73. 3 percent of <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> square were classified as either square or circle. Also, 100 percent of <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> larger square and 90 percent of <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> smaller square were correctly classified. Because both squares and circles are features of terrestrial predators and triangles are features of aerial predators, our results suggest that prairie dogs might have a cognitive mechanism that labels the abstract shape and size of different predators, rather than the position of the predator [Current Zoology 58 (5) : 741 - 748, 2012]...|$|R
5|$|After {{his tenure}} in Congress, Rowan {{was elected to}} {{represent}} Nelson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1813 to 1817. In 1817, the House debated a resolution instructing Governor Gabriel Slaughter {{to negotiate with the}} governors of Indiana and Ohio to secure passage of legislation requiring citizens of those states to return fugitive slaves. Representative James G. Birney vigorously opposed the resolution, and it was defeated. The pro-slavery members of the House then rallied behind Rowan's leadership to pass a substitute resolution which softened the most objectionable language but retained <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> fugitive slave legislation in Indiana and Ohio.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. <b>The</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> such a {{register}} were, however, {{turned down by}} ministers and other politicians who claimed that it would raise practical as well as civil liberties issues.

5|$|Despite these {{assurances that}} change would be forthcoming, Holmlund came under {{considerable}} pressure from {{some members of}} parliament, particularly those in the Left Alliance, to resign for not acting sooner. Leading <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> her deposition was Anneli Lapintie; Tarja Filatov, parliamentary group {{leader of the opposition}} Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) also questioned the government over what it had done since the Jokela incident. Vanhanen launched a defence of the government by saying that iniquiries were ongoing, even into the Jokela case. A survey by pollster Taloustutkimus for YLE showed that dissension towards Holmlund was not widespread: only a quarter of members from smaller parties felt she should step down, only 10% of SDP members (with 80% supporting her to stay on), and 90% of the government's partners wanted her to hold onto her ministry. Amongst the population, 82% felt she should continue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{before the start of the}} special session, it became clear that a major battle was brewing between the {{moderate}} segregationists and the extreme segregationists. Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley plan as well as calls for even more radical legislation. Although most moderate segregationists had joined with the extremists in initially supporting the Gray Commission plan and <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> a constitutional convention, the moderates largely did not support interposition. The moderate segregationists also joined with many (such as leading educators, urban leaders from Northern Virginia, former state superintendent of public schools Dabney Lancaster, several General Assembly delegates, and Gray Commission vice chairman Harry B. Davis) who felt that the tuition voucher proposal would undermine public education.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{volatile}} issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone. The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E

50|$|The party's {{creation}} was {{spurred by}} the al-Husayni - Nashashibi rivalry, which had almost paralyzed the Palestinian national movement. Its founders, most of whom hailed from <b>the</b> Nablus area, <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> adoption of new methods of political action, including noncooperation with the British Mandate authorities and nonpayment of taxes. <b>The</b> party also <b>called</b> <b>for</b> total Arab independence, pan-Arab unity, the abrogation of the Mandate and the Balfour Declaration, {{and the establishment of}} Arab parliamentary rule in Palestine. <b>The</b> party <b>called</b> <b>for</b> mass resistance to the Zionist project and its British patron in Palestine.

The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply. Owing to worldwide deflation in the late 19th century, however, a strict gold standard had resulted in reduction of incomes without the equivalent reduction in debts, pushing debtors and the poor to call for silver coinage as an inflationary measure.|$|E
5|$|The saloon keepers, who {{received}} word that Hobbs {{was accompanied by}} law enforcement officers only shortly before her arrival, greeted her by dressing up the town with bunting, blue and pink ribbons, and flowers. A town meeting was arranged at 2:30 p.m. on January 3. Hobbs renewed <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the resignation of city officials, but the request was refused. Hobbs' escorts then arrested the city leaders and ordered Lawson to declare martial law. It {{was the first time}} in Oregon since the Civil War that martial law was put into effect.|$|E
5|$|To {{finance the}} scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, {{president}} of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more money than he had to attempt the squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers {{were able to find}} plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E
