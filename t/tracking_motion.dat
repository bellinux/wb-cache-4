50|$|Ward Leonard Control, {{also known}} as the Ward Leonard Drive System, was a widely used DC motor speed control system {{introduced}} by Harry Ward Leonard in 1891. In early 1900s, the control system of Ward Leonard was adopted by the U.S. Navy and also used in passenger lift of large mines. It also provided a solution to a moving sidewalk at the Paris Exposition of 1900, where many others had failed to operate properly. It was applied to railway locomotives used in World War I, and was used in anti-aircraft radars in World War II. Connected to automatic anti-aircraft gun directors, the <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> in two dimensions had to be extremely smooth and precise. The MIT Radiation Laboratory selected Ward-Leonard to equip the famous radar SCR-584 in 1942. The Ward Leonard control system was widely used for elevators until thyristor drives became available in the 1980s, because it offered smooth speed control and consistent torque. Many Ward Leonard control systems and variations on them remain in use.|$|E

5000|$|The swing-arm {{mechanism}} has {{a distinctive}} {{advantage over the}} other in {{that it does not}} [...] "skip" [...] when the rail becomes dirty. The swing arm mechanisms tend to have a much longer life than their radial counterparts. The main difference between the two mechanisms is the way they read the data from the disc. The swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a hard drive moves its head across the data tracks. It also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface. By operating the tracking or the focus actuators, the laser beam can be positioned on any part of the disc.This mechanism employs a single laser beam and a set of four photodiodes to read, focus and keep track of the data coming from the disc.The linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field. One set of two coils moves the lens closer to the disc surface, providing the focusing motion, and the other set of coils moves the lens radially, providing a finer <b>tracking</b> <b>motion.</b> This mechanism uses the three-beam tracking method in which a main laser beam is used to read and focus the data track of the disc using three or four photodiodes, depending on the focus method, and two smaller beams read the adjacent tracks at each side to help the servo keep the tracking using two more [...] "helper" [...] photodiodes.|$|E

Based on the six-axis wrist force sensor measuring, a robot model of surface <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> is proposed, and its force control algorithm and experiment are studied. The measurement principle of the six-axis wrist force sensor and the inadequacy of the sensor measuring the six-dimensional force online are introduced firstly. The surface <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> model and its coordinate system are established. On this basis, the relationship between the pose adjustment of surface <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> and the measuring results of the six-axis wrist force sensor is deduced. At last, the experimental study of the surface tracking robot system that applied the force control algorithm is conducted. The experiment shows that the robot can adjust the current position and orientation in real time according to the six-axis wrist force sensor measuring, which demonstrates the feasibility of the surface <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> model and the correctness of the force control algorithm...|$|E

40|$|False {{matching}} due to {{errors in}} feature extraction {{and changes in}} illumination between frames may occur in feature tracking in image sequences. False matching leads to outliers in feature motion trajectory. One way of reducing the effect of outliers is stochastic filtering using a state space model for motion trajectory. Hyper-parameters in the state space model, e. g., variances of noise distributions, must be determined appropriately to control <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> and outlier rejection properly. Likelihood {{can be used to}} estimate hyper-parameters, {{but it is difficult to}} apply online tracking due to computational cost. To estimate hyper-parameters online, we include hyper-parameters in state vector and estimate feature coordinates and hyper-parameters simultaneously. A Monte Carlo filter is used in state estimation, because adding hyper-parameters to state vector makes state space model nonlinear. Experimental results using synthetic and real data show that the proposed method can estimate appropriate hyper-parameters for <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> and reducing the effect of outliers...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the furrow {{illusion}} (Anstis, 2012), {{the perceived}} {{path of a}} moving target follows the veridical path orientation when viewed foveally, but follows {{the orientation of the}} texture when viewed peripherally. These radically different motion percepts depending on whether the stimulus is viewed foveally or peripherally has led Anstis to conclude that the furrow illusion reveals " profound differences {{in the way that the}} periphery and fovea process visual motion. " In the current study, we rather argue that the different percepts can be explained by reduced position acuity with eccentricity and therefore do not imply different ways of processing motion per se. If feature tracking, which is position-based, is involved in the perception of the veridical motion direction, then impairing the feature <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> system should strengthen the illusion. To reduce contribution of the feature <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> system, we used a crowding paradigm consisting in presenting many nearby targets. We found that under crowding conditions, the furrow illusion was stronger. We conclude that feature tracking was involved in the perception of the veridical motion direction, which is compatible with the hypothesis that the different motion percepts at fixation and in the periphery are due to a reduced position acuity with eccentricity affecting feature tracking, not to different ways of processing motion per se...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of a second-order motion system distinct from both the first-order and feature <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> systems remains controversial even though many consider it well established. In the present study, the texture contribution to motion was measured within and beyond the spatial acuity of attention by presenting the stimuli in the near periphery where the spatial resolution of attention is low. The logic was that when moving elements are too close one to another for attention to individually select them (i. e., crowding), {{it is not possible}} to track them. To test the {{existence of}} a dedicated second-order motion system, the texture contribution to motion was measured when neutralizing both the feature <b>tracking</b> <b>motion</b> system and the contribution of the first-order motion system due to preprocessing nonlinearities introducing residual distortion products. When the contribution of distortion products was not neutralized, texture substantially contributed to motion for spatial frequencies within and beyond the spatial acuity of attention. When neutralizing the contribution of distortion products, texture substantially contributed to motion for spatial frequencies within the spatial acuity of attention, but not for spatial frequencies beyond the spatial acuity of attention. We conclude that there is no dedicated second-order motion system; the texture contribution to motion is mediated solely by the first-order (due to residual distortion products) and feature tracking (at frequencies within spatiotemporal acuity of attention) motion systems...|$|E
