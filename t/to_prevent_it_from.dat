5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and money. They laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> falling back into British hands. The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2015, Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council {{purchased}} the stadium in order <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> being demolished and redeveloped. After a plea from fans to safeguard the stadium, an emergency council meeting was held and the stadium was purchased for £2 million. It is currently leased back to the football club.|$|E
5|$|The Boston Journal – in April 1917, on {{the advice}} of John Koren, Speyer had {{provided}} a loan to The Boston Journal newspaper <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> going out of business. The newspaper had printed some articles of a pro-German nature and the committee thought it imprudent but not disloyal of Speyer to have lent the money.|$|E
25|$|On {{the various}} aircraft, economy seats also have USB, iPod and power connections, a cup-holder and trinket tray, and a {{headrest}} {{designed to allow}} a special sleep pillow <b>to</b> attach <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>preventing</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> slipping downwards during sleep.|$|R

25|$|Latrunculin is a toxin {{produced}} by sponges, <b>it</b> binds <b>to</b> G-actin <b>preventing</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> binding with microfilaments.|$|R
5|$|When France {{surrendered}} on 22 June, {{two ships}} were in French Algeria, one was refitting in Toulon {{and the last}} ship was in England. During Operation Catapult in July, {{an attack on the}} Vichy Fleet intended <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> being turned over to the Germans, the British seized the ship in England, but failed to prevent the two in Mers-el-Kébir from escaping to Toulon when they attacked the port.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Odine is a {{scientist}} and magic researcher from Esthar. He discovered the GFs and junctioning and engineered {{a machine that}} mimics Ellone's power. Seventeen years before the game, he developed the necessary technology to allow Laguna to entomb Adel. As a researcher of the Lunatic Pandora, he also helps <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> reaching Tears' Point and initiating a Lunar Cry. Odine also {{plays a role in}} the plot to destroy Ultimecia, explaining how to survive time compression.|$|E
25|$|The right-side (usually {{the chain}} side) hole is {{right-hand}} threaded, and the left-side hole is left-hand (reverse) threaded <b>to</b> help <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> becoming unthreaded by an effect called precession.|$|R

5|$|Generally {{grown as}} a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, {{although}} it requires relatively low temperatures <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, {{as well as}} insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus. Although this trait {{can be a problem}} to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|$|E
5|$|In 1562 the château came briefly {{into the}} {{possession}} of the Huguenots and {{was turned into a}} state prison by Henry IV of France. Cardinal Richelieu was given the castle <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> coming under the control of unfriendly forces, though he allowed it to fall into ruin. Château de Chinon was abandoned until 1793 when, during the Reign of Terror, the castle was temporarily occupied by royalist Vendeans. Soon after, the castle lapsed back into decay.|$|E
5|$|König Wilhelm {{was also}} badly damaged in the collision, with severe {{flooding}} forward. König Wilhelms captain initially planned on beaching the ship <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> sinking, but {{determined that the}} ship's pumps could hold the flooding to an acceptable level. The ship made for Portsmouth, where temporary repairs could be effected to allow the ship to return to Germany. In {{the aftermath of the}} collision, the German navy held a court martial for Rear Admiral Batsch, the squadron commander, and Captains Monts and Kuehne, the commanders of the two ships, along with Lieutenant Clausa, the first officer aboard Grosser Kurfürst, to investigate the sinking.|$|E
50|$|Various heroes {{receive a}} warning, {{purporting}} {{to be from}} the heroine Void, several years in the future. She shows them a post-apocalyptic world, and asks them <b>to</b> help <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> coming about.|$|R

5|$|Michel Roux {{was born}} in Charolles, Saône-et-Loire, in a room above his grandfather's charcuterie (a {{delicatessen}} specializing in meat products). He moved to Paris with his family after the war, where his father Michel set up his own charcuterie, after not taking over the family business in Charolles. His father gambled away all of the family's money, and the shop was closed <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> going bankrupt. By the time Michel turned ten, his father had left the family and was not heard from again.|$|E
5|$|Most {{galaxies in}} the Universe are gravitationally bound {{to a number of}} other galaxies. These form a fractal-like {{hierarchical}} distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is {{the most common type of}} galactic cluster, and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies (as well as most of the baryonic mass) in the Universe. To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 1639, Covenanters {{captured}} Dumbarton Castle <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> {{being used}} as a Royalist base {{in the event of an}} invasion from Ireland. Once secured, the Earl of Argyll placed Walter MacAulay, Laird of Ardincaple, as keeper of the castle with a garrison of forty men. In 1648, the parish of Row (modern Rhu) was created at the instigation of Aulay MacAulay, Laird of Ardincaple, who wanted to separate from the parish of Rosneath on the opposite side of the Gare Loch. He built the first parish kirk a year later and provided land for the kirk, minster's manse, and garden.|$|E
50|$|The hunting {{breastplate}} is {{most commonly}} made of leather, {{and some have}} elastic inserts on the yoke <b>to</b> help <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> restricting the horse's shoulders.

5000|$|The pilot episode, [...] "Diamond Ray of Disappearance", has {{a minute}} or so of footage missing due to the master tapes being damaged. In the {{original}} version, after teleporting the King and Queen and Man-At-Arms away to another dimension, Skeletor turns the ray onto Orko, who gets stuck inside a vase which deflects the beam. Orko escapes to warn He-Man. This footage has not been lost; it is still existent on other media in circulation. However, complications over the rights <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>prevented</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> being inserted back into the DVD release.|$|R
5|$|The first {{discussion}} {{of improving the}} intersection and grade crossing was a study in 1898, since which there have been about three dozen more. The most recent, a 2009 study of the downtown area, examined the possibility of depressing Route 126 under the grade crossing and intersection {{as well as several}} other alternatives including bypasses. The Route 126 depression was deemed to create barriers to walkability downtown, and the recommended alternative was to depress Route 135 under the intersection <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> being affected by trains passing through the grade crossing. Funds have not yet become available for final design and construction.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{focuses on}} Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old {{photography}} student who discovers {{that she has}} the ability to rewind time at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. Fetch quests and making environmental changes represent the forms of puzzle solving in addition to using branching choices for conversation.|$|E
5|$|Although the RAF claimed six Italian {{aircraft}} {{destroyed and}} two probables, including Cullen's, on 20February, Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the 361a Squadriglia as shot down, killing the pilot, and the G.50 of Tenente Livio Bassi of 395a Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted forced landing at Berat. On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined floatplane {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> getting airborne but then, when it refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass. The result did not add to his official score, however, as the Italian plane was not in full flight {{at the time of}} its destruction.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2012, {{a vaccine}} became {{available}} for horses. The vaccine {{is to be}} used in horses only, since, according to CSIRO veterinary pathologist Dr Deborah Middleton, breaking the transmission cycle from flying foxes <b>to</b> horses <b>prevents</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> passing <b>to</b> humans, as well as, [...] "a vaccine for people would take many more years." ...|$|R
50|$|A TNF-α (tumor {{necrosis}} factor-alpha) binding {{protein is}} a monoclonal antibody or a circulating receptor such as infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), or adalimumab (Humira) that binds <b>to</b> TNF-α, <b>preventing</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> inducing {{the synthesis of}} IL-1 and IL-6 and the adhesion of lymphocyte-activating molecules. They {{are used in the}} treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis.|$|R
5000|$|A {{band brake}} {{is a primary}} or {{secondary}} brake, consisting of a band of friction material that tightens concentrically around a cylindrical piece of equipment <b>to</b> either <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> rotating (a static or [...] "holding" [...] brake), or to slow it (a dynamic brake). This application is common on winch drums and chain saws and is also used for some bicycle brakes.|$|R
5|$|Around 23:00 on 15 August, {{elements}} of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts {{set up by the}} invading Austro-Hungarian army on the slopes of Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven back away from the mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs were underway and chaos ensued in the darkness. By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divača Range and dislodged the Austro-Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro-Hungarians, who had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, the Serbs drove the 21st Infantry Division off the slopes of Cer <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> linking with the 2nd Army in Šabac.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Muslims divided their forces: {{the bulk}} of the army, under Abbas, {{remained}} at Kamacha to continue the siege, while the remainder (an obviously exaggerated force of 50,000 according to the Zuqnin chronicler) was sent to raid further into Byzantine territory and pillage. The siege continued through the autumn, and the Arabs, who customarily did not take along many provisions, began suffering from lack of supplies. To solve their supply problems, they established a market for merchants from Mesopotamia and elsewhere. In the end, with winter approaching, Abbas was forced to raise the siege and retreat south, burning the large market-place <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> falling into Byzantine hands.|$|E
5|$|Cristina is re-hired and Owen {{asks for}} a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the {{potential}} conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as {{he thought she was}} dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.|$|E
50|$|S6K {{also can}} phosphorylate {{programmed}} cell death 4 (PDCD4), which marks it for degradation by ubiquitin ligase Beta-TrCP (BTRC). PDCD4 is a tumor suppressor that binds <b>to</b> eIF4A and <b>prevents</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> being incorporated into the initiation complex.|$|R

50|$|Germany's {{military}} is principally structured to defend Eastern Europe and to supporting NATO {{operations in the}} Western European theatre of operations. Unlike UK and France, Germany not only {{does not have any}} sovereign territories in the Indo-Pacific region but is also incapable of power projection. Manpower limitations and armament restrictions imposed upon Germany through the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect <b>to</b> Germany <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> developing expeditionary forces and blue-water assets.|$|R
