5|$|The {{little brown}} bat can be {{distinguished}} from the Indiana bat {{by the absence of}} a keel on the caclar and long hairs on the hind feet <b>that</b> <b>stretch</b> longer than the toes. Compared to the long-legged bat, the brown bat has a shorter tibia and lesser amounts of ventral wing hair in addition to the lack of a keel on the caclar.|$|E
5|$|A {{veteran of}} the Spanish–American War, Neuer worked as a {{brakeman}} before taking up baseball professionally. He played for various minor league teams in 1905 and 1907 before making his debut for the New York Highlanders. With New York, he threw three shutouts in seven games, and was praised by manager Clark Griffith for his pitching ability during <b>that</b> <b>stretch.</b> However, his control deteriorated after that season, {{and over the next}} three years he played for various minor league teams. He retired after 1910 and became an umpire. He then worked at Bendix Aviation until his retirement in 1942.|$|E
5|$|As {{a form of}} Western esotericism, the New Age has antecedents <b>that</b> <b>stretch</b> back to {{southern}} Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age of Enlightenment in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed {{in response to the}} development of scientific rationality. This new esoteric trend is termed occultism by scholars, and it was this occultism which would be a key factor {{in the development of the}} worldview from which the New Age emerged.|$|E

5|$|MD 170 {{is a part}} of the National Highway System {{from its}} {{southern}} terminus in Odenton to I-695 in Linthicum. Within <b>that</b> <b>stretch,</b> there are two sections that serve as intermodal passenger transport links: from its southern terminus to MD 32 in Odenton, and from MD 176 to MD 162 along the perimeter of BWI Airport. The portions from MD 32 in Odenton to MD 176 in Severn and from MD 162 to I-695 within Linthicum are National Highway System principal arterials.|$|E

It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while the belly is yellowish, with wide ventral scales <b>that</b> <b>stretch</b> from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The tail of the snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E
5|$|The trade {{provided}} immediate dividends for the Flames, as Kiprusoff recorded 22 saves in a 2–1 {{victory over}} the Montreal Canadiens {{in his first game}} with Calgary on November 20. He won 12 of 17 starts between November 20 and December 29, giving up one goal or fewer 11 times in <b>that</b> <b>stretch.</b> He was named the defensive player of the month for December by the League, but suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his knee {{at the end of the}} month that forced him out of the lineup for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds <b>that</b> <b>stretch</b> across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E

5|$|Considering {{the age and}} {{location}} of the Golubac Fortress, it is both large and well-preserved. Its placement {{at the head of}} the Iron Gate gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic. It was the last military outpost on <b>that</b> <b>stretch</b> of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the winter}} break, Benzema endured a rough patch going {{scoreless}} {{the first three}} games before recording his 11th goal of the season against Nice in a 3–1 victory. Two weeks later, he scored his 12th goal against Nancy in a 2–0 victory. The next nine matches, both Benzema and Lyon's form dwindled losing four matches, drawing three and winning only two with Benzema scoring only two goals in <b>that</b> <b>stretch,</b> both of them against Le Mans in a 3–1 victory. The bad form resulted in Lyon losing their grip on first-place position and eventually {{falling out of the}} title race, thus ending their streak of seven consecutive Ligue 1 titles. Benzema was a part of four of those title runs.|$|E
5|$|In Week 3, Vick {{was brought}} into action against the St. Louis Rams when Ben Roethlisberger {{sustained}} a knee injury that sidelined him for 4–6 weeks. Vick played decently in <b>that</b> <b>stretch,</b> going 40–66 with 2 TDs and 1 INT, while also rushing for 104 yards on 15 carries (his other five carries were kneel downs). Vick suffered a hamstring injury in a win against the Arizona Cardinals, being replaced by Landry Jones, which led to him missing six games, and by then Roethlisberger was healthy enough to play. Despite continual injuries to Roethlisberger and the team not signing another quarterback throughout the season, Vick would be inactive {{the remainder of the}} season, leading some sports commentators to speculate that Vick's playing career may be over.|$|E

5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{surrounds}} Lake Phelps, North Carolina's {{second largest}} natural made lake. The lake, on a peninsula between Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico River, {{is one of}} a series of Carolina bay lakes <b>that</b> <b>stretch</b> from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Exactly how the lakes were formed remains a mystery. What is known is that Lake Phelps is not fed by any stream, but relies entirely upon rain and springs to maintain its water level. Since the lake is not fed by a stream that could carry pollutants from nearby farms and factories, the water is very clean. Lake Phelps is five miles (8km) across, with an average depth of just 4.5feet (1.5m). The lake is thought to be more than 38,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes <b>that</b> <b>stretch</b> from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} found {{that after a}} June 17 replacement of a track circuit component at what became {{the site of the}} June 22 collision, the track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when <b>that</b> <b>stretch</b> of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55mph. The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44mph.|$|E

5|$|Through {{their first}} nine {{games of the}} year, the Jets went 5–4 and earned Ryan some early Coach of the Year consideration. The team {{proceeded}} to lose their next three contests as the rookie Smith committed eight turnovers while failing to score during <b>that</b> <b>stretch.</b> This prompted speculation by analysts {{as to whether or}} not Ryan would be fired. The Jets broke their losing streak with a 37–27 win over the Raiders that kept them in playoff contention. The following week, the Jets played the Carolina Panthers and trailed by three points heading into the fourth quarter. In the span of five minutes, the Panthers scored twice and the Jets were unable to complete a comeback attempt, losing 20–30. The loss eliminated the Jets from playoff contention.|$|E
5|$|Christian Jones led {{the team}} in {{combined}} tackles with 87. Outside linebackers Lamarr Houston (8), Willie Young (6.5) and Pernell McPhee (6) recorded a combined 20.5 sacks, becoming one of only five defensive trios with at least six sacks per player in 2015. Houston, coming off a season-ending ACL injury in 2014, converted from defensive end to outside linebacker; he did not play much during the early portion of the season until Jared Allen was traded. He played only four snaps against the Vikings, but recorded 28 tackles, five sacks and six TFLs in from week nine to fourteen. In the final nine games, he had seven sacks, the sixth-most in <b>that</b> <b>stretch.</b> Young, who also switched from DE to OLB, recorded a sack in five consecutive games (weeks eleven to fifteen), the third player in franchise history to do so after Steve McMichael and Brian Urlacher. In the first seven games of 2015, McPhee recorded five sacks, 42 tackles and seven TFLs, while Sam Acho had 60 tackles, three TFLS, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Meanwhile, inside linebackers Christian Jones and Shea McClellin had the second- and third-most tackles for the Bears with 96 and 96, respectively. Rookie John Timu, {{who had been on}} special teams and the practice squad until becoming a starter for the final three games, recorded 25 tackles and two fumble recoveries.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{played the}} next four seasons with the Metropolitans, but {{failed to make the}} Stanley Cup final. Over <b>that</b> <b>stretch,</b> Holmes and the Metropolitans won about half the games each season. The Metropolitans missed the playoffs in only the 1922–23 season. In the 1920–21 season, Holmes {{appeared}} in 24games. He posted a 12–11–1 (win-loss-tie) record, with a 2.63goals-against average and no shutouts. In the playoffs, he lost both games he appeared in, and let in 13goals. The following season, he posted an identical win-loss-tie record in both the regular season. The only difference was a 2.60goals-against average in the regular season, with four shutouts, and the reduction of his playoffs goals-against by 11goals. In the 1922–23 season, Holmes appeared in 30games, posting a 15–15 record, with two shutouts and a 3.45goals-against average; however, the Metropolitans missed the playoffs that season. In the 1923–24, Holmes' last with the Metropolitans, he appeared in 30 regular-season games, posting a 14–16 record, with two shutouts and a 3.26goals-against average. Despite an extra loss, the Metropolitans made the playoffs that season. Holmes played two games, losing one and tying one, ending up with a 1.79goals-against average.|$|E
