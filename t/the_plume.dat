5|$|For {{the first}} two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E

5|$|To {{investigate}} the smoke cloud the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements, a research aircraft operated jointly by NERC and the Met Office, made two flights on 12 and 13 December. In {{the first flight}} the edge of <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> was followed along the south coast of England. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone concentrations {{were found to be}} low with soot particles being the major component in the cloud. The second flight went into the centre of <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> to obtain data to help forecasting and emergency teams.|$|E

5|$|Jovian Europa Orbiter was an ESA Cosmic Vision concept {{study from}} 2007.

5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in <b>the</b> <b>plume,</b> {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust. The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} volcano spends {{less time}} actively attached to <b>the</b> <b>plume.</b> The large {{difference between the}} youngest and oldest lavas between Emperor and Hawaiian volcanoes indicates that the hotspot's velocity is increasing. For example, Kohala, the oldest volcano on Hawaii island, is one million years old and last erupted 120,000 years ago, a period of just under 900,000 years; whereas one of the oldest, Detroit Seamount, experienced 18 million {{or more years of}} volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> activity.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of line <b>plumes</b> on <b>the</b> bottom plate in turbulent convection over six decades of Rayleigh number (10 ^ 5 <Ra_w< 10 ^ 11) and two decades of Prandtl number (0. 7 <Pr< 600). We qualitatively identify the main dynamics as motion along <b>the</b> <b>plumes,</b> lateral merging of <b>the</b> <b>plumes</b> and initiation of the plumes; various other minor types of motion also occur along with these main dynamics. The mean velocity {{along the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>plumes</b> scales as <b>the</b> large scale flow velocity, with the fraction of the length of <b>the</b> <b>plumes</b> affected by shear increasing with Ra_w as L_ps/L_p∼ Ra_w^ 0. 04 Pr^- 0. 1. In agreement with how, the mean time of initiation of <b>the</b> <b>plumes</b> t̅^̅*̅, scales as the diffusive time scale near the plate, Z_w^ 2 /α, where Z_w is the appropriate length scale near the plate. The fraction of the length of <b>the</b> <b>plumes</b> that undergoes merging decreases with increase in Ra_w as, L_pm/L_p ∼ Ra_w^- 0. 04 Pr^ 0. 1. <b>The</b> <b>plumes</b> merge with a constant velocity during their merging cycle, however, the values of these constant velocities depend on the location and the time of measurement. The merging velocities at all Ra_w and Pr have a common lognormal distribution, but their mean and variance increased with increasing Ra_w and decreasing Pr. V̅_̅m̅, which are an order lower than the large scale velocities, scale as the average entrainment velocity at the sides of <b>the</b> <b>plumes.</b> This implies that V̅_̅m̅ scales as the velocity scale near the plate ν/Z_w. Re_H, the Reynolds number interms of V̅_̅m̅ and the layer height H scales as Ra^ 1 / 3, {{in the same way as}} the Nusselt number Nu; therefore Re_H∼ Nu. These relations imply that Re_w=V̅_̅m̅Z_w/ν the Reynolds number near the plate is an invariant for a given fluid in turbulent convection.

40|$|Abstract A {{high-resolution}} {{model is}} used to characterize the dominant patterns of sea surface salinity (SSS) variability generated by the freshwater discharges of the Rio de la Plata (RdlP) and the Patos/Mirim Lagoon in the southwestern Atlantic region. We identify three dominant modes of SSS variability. The first two, which have been discussed in previous studies, represent the seasonal and the interannual variations of <b>the</b> fresh-water <b>plumes</b> over <b>the</b> continental shelf. The third mode of SSS variability, {{which has not been}} discussed hith-erto, represents the salinity exchanges between the shelf and the deep ocean. A diagnostic study using floats and passive tracers identifies the pathways taken by <b>the</b> freshwater <b>plumes.</b> During <b>the</b> austral winter (JJA), <b>the</b> <b>plumes</b> leave <b>the</b> shelf region north of the BMC. During the austral summer (DJF), <b>the</b> <b>plumes</b> are entrained more directly into the BMC. A sensitivity study indicates that the high-frequency component of the wind stress forcing controls the vertical structure of <b>the</b> <b>plumes</b> while <b>the</b> low-frequency component of the wind stress forcing and the interannual variations of the RdlP discharge controls the horizontal structure of <b>the</b> <b>plumes.</b> Dynamical analysis reveals that the cross-shelf flow has a dominant barotropic structure and, therefore, the SS...|$|R
40|$|Three polar plumes {{were studied}} using Skylab Mg X and O VI data. <b>The</b> <b>plumes</b> lie within <b>the</b> {{boundaries}} of a polar coronal hole.

Densities are determined and found consistent with white light analyses. The variation of density with height in <b>the</b> <b>plumes</b> is compared with that expected for hydrostatic equilibrium. As is the case for other coronal features, polar plumes will be a source of solar wind if the magnetic field lines are open.

5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so {{it is more likely that}} the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.

5|$|On April 13, 2017, NASA {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} possible hydrothermal activity on Enceladus' sub-surface ocean floor.

25|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> model, {{the source}} of Icelandic {{volcanism}} lies deep beneath {{the center of the}} island. The earliest volcanic rocks attributed to <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> are found {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. Their ages have been determined to lie between 58 and 64 million years. This coincides with the opening of the north Atlantic in the late Paleocene and early Eocene, which has led to suggestions that the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> was linked to, and has perhaps contributed to, the breakup of the North Atlantic continent. In the framework of <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> hypothesis, the volcanism was caused by the flow of hot plume material initially beneath thick continental lithosphere and then beneath the lithosphere of the growing ocean basin as rifting proceeded. The exact position of <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> at that time is a matter of disagreement between scientists, as is whether <b>the</b> <b>plume</b> is thought to have ascended from the deep mantle only at that time or whether it is much older and also responsible for the old volcanism in northern Greenland, on Ellesmere Island, and at Alpha Ridge in the Arctic.|$|E
