I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

Rewards differed depending on the mission - from cash, gems to esoteric hardware such as a cloaking device.|$|E
25|$|If {{any type}} of {{photographic}} evidence is involved, the expert witness has to request permission from the judge or attorney prior to the trial {{to make sure that}} the photographs that are to be presented aren’t prejudiced and have the ability to sway the jury. Finally, it is important that the expert witness realizes that replying “I don’t know” to a question is perfectly fine; it is preferable to say that you don’t have the expertise in that particular area than to claim <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> and make yourself look like a liar. Before leaving the witness stand, proper notification will be given to the expert witness to see if he is dismissed or if he will be recalled later.|$|E

500|$|Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art, {{described}} by Pabon as [...] "a form of self defense {{disguised as a}} dance." [...] Its influence on breaking is disputed and debated; one side believes that breaking came from capoeira, while the other side denies this. Capoeira is hundreds of years older than breaking, and uprock is similar in purpose to capoeira in that both translate aggressive combat movements into stylized dance. Both breaking and capoeira are performed to music and, since both art forms are acrobatic, some moves look similar to each other. However, capoeira is more rule-oriented. One rule in capoeira is that a capoeirista's back can never touch the ground. In contrast, a breaker's back is almost always on the ground, and the only rule in breaking is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not touch your opponent during a battle.|$|E
500|$|An assassin {{with perfect}} {{accuracy}} and deep-rooted pride of it who is hired by Kingpin to kill Nikolas and Elektra Natchios, but when Daredevil gets involved and causes him to miss his target, {{he makes it}} his own personal vendetta to take Daredevil down. Farrell {{was attached to the}} role in December 2001. Mark Steven Johnson credits Joe Quesada with talking him out of using the traditional Bullseye costume for the film, and Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent as this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. Farrell had to read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and just the way they move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm playing [...] he's so over-the-top <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> draw from that. But it's not exactly a character you can do method acting for... you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with YouTube about Teenage Dream in August 2010, Perry revealed that [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was the first song she wrote for the album after she finished her Hello Katy Tour (2009). Production and additional writing on the songs were done by Greg Wells, who previously worked with the singer on her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). Perry considers it {{to be like that}} of a two-part song because she had started working on [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] before she met Brand, and completed it after they began dating. She stated it is a [...] "really special" [...] song to her because, at {{the first part of the}} track, it is a story that she needed to let out, which was claiming to know something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not actually know. Perry later expressed relief at being able to put all of her feelings into [...] "Not Like the Movies".|$|E

500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} {{caused by a}} partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks {{of a man who}} faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why is it so different when we wake up? / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't you know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it just enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave you everything / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E
500|$|Because the {{population}} of Duttlenheim was short in numbers, it proved difficult to field a team of 11 players of equal ages; Wenger did not play for FC Duttlenheim {{until the age of}} 12. Claude Wenger, a teammate of Arsène's, noted his lack of pace as a player, which he made up for with his [...] "ability to guard the ball, [...] to have a complete vision of the pitch and having an influence among his team-mates", according to Marcel Brandner, the president of FC Duttlenheim. As a young teenager, he was called Petit; the nickname ceased when he had a growth spurt and broke into FC Duttlenheim's first team, aged 16. The team did not have a coach to prepare the players tactically, rather a person who supervised training sessions. Wenger took it upon himself to manage the side, with Claude stating [...] "Arsène wasn't the captain and yet he was. It was 'You do this, you do <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this, you do that.' He was the leader".|$|E

She concluded by stating that: [...] "In fact, it seems that Lopez goes {{out of her way}} to sing with a little-girl inflection to her 41-year-old pipes. But it comes off youthful, upbeat, and a little lighter than the single [...] and her island-inflected collaboration with Lil Wayne, 'I'm Into You'." [...] Amos Barshad of Vulture questioned Lopez' music, stating that [...] "with the other facets of her multimedia empire clicking [...] why does she insist on continuing to make music? Why not sit back, relax, and enjoy the fact that there is something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that people like? [...] Well, one can only assume, Jennifer Lopez keeps making music because Jennifer Lopez actually loves making music. And that's admirable".|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. spent $100million {{marketing}} the film. Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which {{is going to have a}} pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Farrell's {{supporting}} roles {{include an}} ambitious Justice Department agent opposite Tom Cruise, a potential criminal in Minority Report (2002), and the villain Bullseye in Daredevil (2003). Matt Damon was originally offered the Minority Report role, turning {{it down to}} appear in Ocean's Eleven. Farrell said [...] "he had no problem" [...] being the producer's fallback after Damon declined. Bullseye is an assassin, proud of his accuracy. Farrell was signed to the role in December 2001, although he was considered for the lead role of Matt Murdock (Daredevil) until Ben Affleck signed. Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent, since this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. He read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and {{just the way they}} move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm playing...he's so over-the-top <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> draw from that. But it's not exactly a character you can do method acting for...you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips". That year, he was voted sixth World's [...] "Sexiest Man" [...] by Company magazine.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{initially}} {{created the}} game Confusion in the 1970s, {{and had it}} in finished form by 1980. The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it. The rules {{were published in the}} Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008, but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine. The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they do {{at the beginning of the}} game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, in <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying [...] "In your game Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't you make a board game where you don't know how pieces move?" [...] This is what gave Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.|$|E
