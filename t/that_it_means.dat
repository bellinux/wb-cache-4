5|$|The {{artifact}} shows {{a number}} of idiosyncrasies that raise questions concerning its authenticity. The numbering systems used in the codex conflict. The Maya bar-and-dot system is used to mark units, but the central Mexican dot system is used to mark multiples of twenty (for example by using 11 dots instead of 2 bars and a dot, as {{would be the case}} in the bar-and-dot system where a bar indicates 5 and a dot indicates 1). Some bar-and-dot numbers are placed within a cartouche decorated with a knot at the top. The only other instance of such a cartouche being used with numbers is in the Dresden Codex, where the cartouche has a very specific function, indicating a negative date count from the zero year of the great cycle of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar (roughly equivalent to the function of BC in the Gregorian calendar). In the Grolier Codex, where the numbers mark intervals between stations of Venus, the use of this cartouche appears meaningless, although it is suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that the codex may be read both from the front and from the back.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{readings}} of i karþa. One interpretation is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> Garðaríki (Garðar), {{and another one}} {{that it may have}} referred to Kiev as Garðr.|$|E
25|$|The English name Acoma was {{borrowed}} from Spanish Ácoma (1583) or Acóma (1598). The Spanish name was {{borrowed from}} the Acoma word ʔáák’u̓u̓m̓é meaning 'person from Acoma Pueblo'. ʔáák’u̓u̓m̓é itself is derived from ʔáák’u (singular, plural: ʔaak’u̓u̓m̓e̓e̓ʈʂʰa). The name {{does not have any}} meaning in the modern Acoma language. Some tribal authorities connect it to the similar word háák’u 'preparedness, place of preparedness' and suggest that this might be the origin of the name. The name does not mean 'sky city'. Other tribal elders assert <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> 'place that always was' while outsiders say it means 'people of the white rock'.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Ross (Barry Jenner) informs Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) that Starfleet {{intends to}} go on the {{offensive}} in the war against the Dominion and intends to move to invade Cardassia. They evaluate the plans and decide to move against the Chin'toka star system. Meanwhile Lt Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn) and Lt Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) discuss their plans to have a baby with Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig). Both Bashir and Quark (Armin Shimerman) mourn the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that Worf and Dax's marriage is solid and neither have a chance with her. They both visit the holosuite to see Vic Fontaine (James Darren) who counsels them on their loss. Sisko meets with General Martok (J. G. Hertzler) and the Romulans to discuss the plans for Chin'toka and discover that they need to attack immediately as the Cardassian-Dominion are about to improve the defences. The night before the attack, Sisko receives a vision from the prophets, who warn him not to leave the station. Sisko tells Ross about the vision, who responds that he must decide between his duty to Starfleet and the prophets.|$|E

500|$|The Vedas {{mention the}} name Rishabha. However, {{the context in}} the Rigveda, Atharvaveda and the Upanishads {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> the bull, sometimes [...] "any male animal" [...] or [...] "most excellent of any kind", or [...] "a kind of medicinal plant". Elsewhere it is an epithet for the Hindu god Shiva (Rudra). Later Hindu mythical texts such as the Bhagavata Purana include Rishabha Jina as an avatar of Vishnu.|$|E

500|$|The name Milnrow {{is derived}} from Old English, but its meaning has not been deciphered with any certainty. The name may be a {{corruption}} of an old pronunciation of [...] "Millner Howe", a water driven corn mill {{at a place called}} Mill Hill on the River Beal that was mentioned in deeds dating from 1568. Another explanation is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> a [...] "mill with a row of houses", combining the Old English elements myne and raw. Others have suggested that the name [...] "Milnrow" [...] {{is derived from}} a local family with the surname Milne, who owned a row of houses in the locality. A map from 1292 shows [...] "Milnehouses" [...] at Milnrow's present location, other spellings have included [...] "Mylnerowe" [...] (1545) and [...] "Milneraw" [...] (1577).|$|E
500|$|Sigurd's domain {{included}} {{not just}} Orkney itself but also Shetland, which formed {{part of the}} earldom and also extensive lands on mainland Scotland. For the latter his overlords were the Kings of Scotland rather than of Norway. The extent of these mainland dominions is uncertain. According to the rather dubious source, Njal's Saga, they included Ross, Moray, Sutherland and the Dales. At the time Moray would have included districts {{on the west coast}} including Lochaber. Smyth (1984) notes the density of dalr placenames on Scotland's west coast and it has even been suggested that [...] "the Dales" [...] is a reference to Dalriada, although it is more likely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> Caithness. [...] During Sigurd's tenure the earldom approached its high point and his influence was perhaps only exceeded by that of his son Thorfinn.|$|E
500|$|McKinley was {{nominated}} for president on the first ballot. [...] Hobart described his subsequent first-ballot nomination for vice president as a tribute from his friends, but Hatfield noted, [...] "it came equally as a tribute from [...] wanted a ticket to satisfy the business interests of America, and Hobart, a corporate lawyer, fit that requirement perfectly". [...] Although a Hobart nomination had been talked about at least since Griggs' victory the previous November, Hobart expressed reluctance {{in a letter to}} his wife from the convention: [...] "It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice-President whether I want it or not, and as I get nearer to the point where I may, I am dismayed at the thought... If I want a nomination, everything is going my way. But when I realize all <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> in work, worry, and loss of home and bliss, I am overcome, so overcome I am simply miserable." [...] Despite Hobart's expressed hesitation, he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15,000 at the Paterson Armory. [...] City officials, feeling they had insufficient fireworks to properly honor Hobart, obtained more from New York City.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{her first}} studio album, Don't Forget, Lovato did not {{collaborate}} with the Jonas Brothers on Here We Go Again as {{she wanted to}} see what her sound would be like without their input. [...] "They were the only people I'd ever written with. Once I wrote with different people, I wanted to go with that", she told the New York Daily News. She said that her first album was [...] "very Jonas" [...] and that Here We Go Again is [...] "a little bit more like what's coming from my heart. It's more me." [...] However, Lovato did work with Nick Jonas on the song [...] "Stop the World". The majority of the album was produced by John Fields, who also handled production on Don't Forget. Other tracks were produced by SuperSpy, Gary Clark, Andy Dodd and Adam Watts. [...] "Catch Me" [...] is the only song on the album for which Lovato received sole writing credit. In an interview with The New York Times, she revealed that she wrote it in her room and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> more to her {{than the rest of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|During casting, fake names, occupations and {{scenes were}} {{temporarily}} assigned {{to limit the}} leak of spoilers.

[...] "Matthew" [...] and [...] "Abaddon" [...] were revealed as season 4 clue words in the alternate reality game Find 815. [...] The writers chose the character's surname after they read the Wikipedia article on Abaddon, which states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> [...] "place of destruction". [...] The writer-producers were originally interested in having Reddick play Mr. Eko during the second season, however, he was busy starring on HBO's The Wire. [...] Jeremy Davies was cast as Daniel because {{he is one of the}} writer-producers' favorite character actors, and they think that his [...] "transformative quality [...] the tremendous intelligence that seems to emanate from him... seemed perfect for [...] ", which was originally planned to be a recurring role. [...] When Davies met costume designer Roland Sanchez, he was wearing a thin black tie. [...] Sanchez merged this [...] "cool, edgy look" [...] with his idea for the character's clothes: a [...] "nerdy" [...] loosely woven dress shirt from J.Crew.|$|E
500|$|The team {{colors are}} red, black and white, {{and they can}} be seen on both the home and road jerseys. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until the NHL swapped home and road colors in 2003, is dominantly red in color. There are three black and white stripes, one across each arm and one across the waist. The road jersey (the team's former home jersey) is white in color with a similar design, except that the three stripes are black and red. The {{shoulders}} are draped with black on both uniforms. Before the 1992–93 season, the uniforms were green and red with slightly different striping, leading some fans to affectionately refer to them as [...] "Christmas colors." [...] The Devils have yet to introduce a third jersey and are one of only two NHL teams (Detroit is the other) never to have worn one. Lamoriello had stated that he did not ever intend to introduce a third jersey for the Devils, saying, [...] "I don't believe in it", Lamoriello said. [...] "I strongly believe {{that you have to have}} one identity as a team. We want to create a feeling that our home and away jerseys are special and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> something special to wear one."
