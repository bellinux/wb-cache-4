25|$|A fourth <b>facility,</b> <b>the</b> Term <b>Deposit</b> <b>Facility,</b> was {{announced}} December 9, 2009, and approved April 30, 2010, with an effective date of June 4, 2010. <b>The</b> Term <b>Deposit</b> <b>Facility</b> allows Reserve Banks to offer term deposits to {{institutions that are}} eligible to receive earnings on their balances at Reserve Banks. Term deposits are intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions. Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions {{for the life of}} <b>the</b> term <b>deposit</b> and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system.|$|R
50|$|Counterparties {{must have}} {{collateral}} for the funds they {{receive from the}} Marginal Lending Facility and will be charged the overnight rate set by the ECBS. Excess capital can be deposited with <b>the</b> <b>Deposit</b> <b>facility</b> and they will earn interest at the rate offered by the ECBS. The rates for these two facilities signal the central bank system’s outlook for commercial interest rates and sets {{the upper and lower}} limit for interest rates on the overnight market.|$|E
5000|$|Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress {{gave the}} Federal Reserve {{statutory}} {{authority to pay}} interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks' reserves, the Federal Reserve {{will be able to}} put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally....As an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and <b>the</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>facility</b> would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so.When these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.In sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates how {{declines in}} <b>the</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>facility</b> rate {{set by the}} European Central Bank (ECB) affect bank behavior. The ECB aims to reduce banks' {{incentives}} to hold reserves at the central bank and thus to encourage loan supply. However, given depressed margins in a low interest environment, banks might reallocate their liquidity toward more profitable liquid assets other than traditional loans. Our analysis {{is based on a}} sample of euro area banks for the period from 2009 to 2014. Three key findings arise. First, banks reduce their reserve holdings following declines in <b>the</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>facility</b> rate. Second, this effect is heterogeneous across banks depending on their business model. Banks with a more interest-sensitive business model are more responsive to changes in <b>the</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>facility</b> rate. Third, there is evidence of a reallocation of liquidity toward loans but not toward other liquid assets. This result is most pronounced for non-GIIPS countries of the euro area...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{depending}} {{on the distribution of}} banks' uncertain liquidity needs and on how monetary policy is implemented, frictions in the interbank market may reinforce the effectiveness of monetary policy.

The model also allows understanding the link between this difference (the width of the central bank standing facilities corridor) and the stance of monetary policy, and how this link changes during a financial crisis. It is shown how the narrowing of the standing facilities corridor can make more accommodating the stance of monetary policy in a financial crisis.

40|$|Monetary policy {{measures}} {{taken by the}} Federal Reserve {{as a response to}} the 2007 - 09 financial crisis and subsequent economic conditions led to a large increase in the level of outstanding reserves. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a range of tools to control short-term market rates in this situation. We study several of these tools, namely, interest on excess reserves (IOER), reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs), and <b>the</b> term <b>deposit</b> <b>facility</b> (TDF). We find that overnight RRPs (ON RRPs) may provide a better floor on rates than term RRPs because they are available to absorb daily liquidity shocks. Whether the TDF or RRPs best support equilibrium rates depends on the intensity of interbank monitoring costs versus balance sheet costs, respectively, that banks face. In our model, using the RRP and TDF concurrently may most effectively stabilize short-term rates close to the IOER rate when such costs are rapidly increasing...|$|R

40|$|While much {{attention}} has been paid to India’s economic growth, the extent of financial inclusion within the country is rarely examined. This paper assesses financial inclusion in India and provides pointers to what can be done to increase inclusion as an important component of India’s overall economic growth strategy. As India’s economy continues to grow and incomes rise, there is an increased need for financial services. There has been considerable improvement in the deepening of the financial system through growth in bank credit and <b>the</b> spread of <b>deposit</b> <b>facilities.</b> However, it is important to examine access to credit in both urban and rural areas and deposit services of small and medium enterprises to determine the true reach of the financial sector. The issue of financial inclusion is especially important today as India’s rural economy has shifted towards more commercialized agriculture and non-agricultural activities, both of which require banking facilities. The evidence on financial inclusion is mixed. The situation is not as poor as has been asserted in recent analyses. There appears to be relatively healthy access to secure formal facilities for savings, but access to credit in rural areas has not grown as might be expected. I...|$|R

The book consists of two parts. In the first we attempt to define the concept of “welfare space”, discussing the current state of the concept and its use within a new urban planning strategy. In the second instead, considering the central area of Veneto (comprising Venice, Padova, Treviso and the areas between) as a laboratory and assuming the exploratory nature of the project, we analyze the spatial results of the welfare policies that have been enacted here and at the same time, we develop some projects that, starting from the welfare spaces, try to re-imagine the contemporary city in greater totality, defining the conditions for new life cycles for the contemporary territory...|$|R
