25|$|In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. The {{first game}} was played in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). By the 1950s, {{basketball}} had become a major college sport, thus {{paving the way for}} a growth of interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly {{to the development of the}} game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976. Today <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> <b>is</b> the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.|$|E
25|$|Other {{mainstream}} {{sports such}} as basketball and volleyball are also popular. Turkey hosted the 2010 FIBA World Championship international basketball tournament and reached the final.

Turkish basketball players have also been successful in the NBA. In June 2004, Mehmet Okur won the 2004 NBA Championship with the Detroit Pistons, becoming the first Turkish player to win an NBA title. Okur was selected to the Western Conference All-Star Team for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, also becoming the first Turkish player to participate in this event. Another successful Turkish player in <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> <b>is</b> Hidayet Türkoğlu, who was given the NBA's Most Improved Player Award for the 20072008 season, on April 28, 2008.

5000|$|In 2009, 23 million American {{professional}} basketball fans, 92.3% of those fans were {{the audience of}} the National Basketball Association (<b>NBA)</b> and <b>the</b> remaining 7.7% attended WNBA games.

Perry found from the Center for Feminist Research of University of Southern California’s “Gender in Televised Sports” found that in 2009 the media coverage for <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> <b>was</b> 77.8% and WNBA was 22.2%. Although <b>the</b> coverage of <b>NBA</b> <b>is</b> {{more than three times}} greater than that of <b>the</b> WNBA, <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> <b>was</b> still “under-reported,” <b>the</b> proportionality between WNBA attendance and coverage is greater than that of <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> attendance and their coverage. While the WNBA is receiving a fair amount of media coverage, its fan base is much smaller than that of <b>the</b> <b>NBA.</b>|$|R
500|$|In {{his rookie}} season with the Houston Rockets White {{expressed}} concerns {{about the lack of}} mental health policy within the NBA. He publicly advocated for a comprehensive policy for all players. This stance led to White missing all of the 2012–13 NBA season for the Rockets despite being under contract. He did play for the developmental league affiliate for the Vipers. Kathy Behrens, NBA president of social responsibility and player programs, recently commented on White saying the league has “great respect for Royce speaking about his struggles.” She says <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> <b>is</b> not new to the issue but has “a growing understanding {{of the importance of the}} subject.” ...|$|E
500|$|Although Cherry {{points out}} that Chamberlain was an egotist, {{he added that he}} had good {{relationships}} with many contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect. He was especially lauded for his good rapport with his fans, often providing tickets and signing autographs. Dr. Jack Ramsay recalled that Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying all the attention. Jerry West called him a [...] "complex... very nice person", and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said: [...] "The best thing that happened to <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> <b>is</b> that God made Wilt a nice person... he could have killed us all with his left hand." [...] Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy even assumed that if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular, he would have been meaner and able to win more titles. During most of his NBA career, Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell. Chamberlain often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving, and at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains. But as the championship count became increasingly lopsided, the relationship got strained, and turned hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of [...] "copping out" [...] in the notorious Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals. The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years, until Russell apologized privately, then publicly in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas: [...] "There was a thing almost 30 years ago... I was wrong." [...] Still, Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness, regretted that he should have been [...] "more physical" [...] with Russell in their games and privately continued accusing his rival for [...] "intellectualizing" [...] basketball in a negative way.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Cuban's {{history with}} David Stern, he {{believed}} the NBA Commissioner would leave a lasting legacy [...] "of a focus on growth and recognizing that <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> <b>is</b> {{in the entertainment business}} and that it's a global product, not just a local product.
