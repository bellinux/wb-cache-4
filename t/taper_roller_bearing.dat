40|$|The {{main reason}} for such {{performance}} is the philosophy of six sigma, which are very much incorporated in the roots and culture of bearing manufacturing. From the customer’s view point, Six Sigma translates to higher quality products and services, delivered on time, at the lowest possible cost. In this sense, Six Sigma represents a tremendous value proposition. Through Six Sigma, a customer is better able to access the products and services they need, when they are needed, enjoy a significantly higher level of product and service utility, and pay less to receive such benefits.

50|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use conical <b>rollers</b> {{that run}} on conical races. Most <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> only take radial or axial loads, but <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and {{generally}} can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. <b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the <b>roller</b> in the <b>bearing</b> adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R

40|$|Fatigue {{life testing}} of large <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> for {{railroad}} applications is both expensive and time consuming. Accepted methods for testing bearings include full–size and scaled down testing. Currently, bearing test methods at Brenco {{take up to}} six months to complete, and scaled down testing requires additional resources for manufacturing prototypes and testing capabilities that are not economically ideal. The purpose of this project is the development of a <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> test rig to test bearings to their fatigue life as quickly as possible. The rig design can accommodate bearing sizes in the range of one half (½) to a maximum of four (4) Class K, 6 ½ x 9 inch double row <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> in line with an axial load. This Senior Design team developed an accelerated life test rig capable of testing up to four (4) full size bearings, which will cut the current analysis time in half. The development of this rig will allow Brenco to perform more efficient and effective testing of bearing life, which in turn will enhance research methods for determining better quality materials and suppliers.

50|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> were a {{breakthrough}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century because bearings used in wheel axles had not changed much since ancient times. They consisted of a cylindrical seat on the frame and part of the axle enclosed in a case or box that held a lubricant. These were called journal bearings and relied on the lubricant to form a fluid bearing. Without adequate lubrication, journal bearings would fail due to the excessive heat caused by friction. Timken was able to significantly reduce the friction on his axle bearings by adding tapered elements which actually rolled while transferring the load evenly from axle to frame through the hardened steel inner and outer rings and the <b>rollers</b> - his <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|R
