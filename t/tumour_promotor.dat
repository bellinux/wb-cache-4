40|$|We {{have shown}} that serum, {{fibroblast}} growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and the <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor,</b> 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), selectively induce the synthesis of certain secreted proteins {{in a variety of}} cell types. Similarly, a specific growth inhibitor protein selectively induces the synthesis of a secreted protein that is different from those induced by growth factors. In each case, the average increase in labeling by [3 %]methionine of these secreted proteins after their induction is 7 - to 10 -fold. No correspondingly large increase is detected for intracellular proteins...|$|E
40|$|Retinoic acid {{prevents}} {{the decrease in}} epidermal Langerhans' cell (LC) density which occurs upon application of the <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor</b> 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA) to murine skin. This occurred very rapidly, after only 1 week, and was still observed after 4 weeks of treatment. Retinoic acid alone increased the LC density, indicating that it could affect LC density independently of TPA. The induction of a contact sensitivity response which was inhibited by prior treatment with TPA due to the low LC density was also protected by retinoic acid. The anti-carcinogenic activity of retinoic acid is partially the result {{of its ability to}} inhibit tumour promotion. The loss of LC {{may be one of the}} important steps in tumour promotion as this would allow developing tumours to escape immune destruction. Our studies suggest that the ability of retinoic acid to suppress tumour promotion may be in part by protecting local antigen-presenting cells, thus allowing an immune response to be generated against tumours...|$|E
40|$|Epidermal {{growth factor}} (EGF) -induced {{receptor}} dimerization {{may provide a}} mechanism for activation of the receptor protein tyrosine kinase and for initiation of post-receptor signalling pathways. We have examined whether second messengers and agents that modulate EGF receptor function act {{at the level of}} receptor dimerization. Both the Ca 2 + ionophore ionomycin and the <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor</b> tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA), added shortly before EGF, inhibit EGF receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity in intact cells. In permeabilized cells, elevation of Ca 2 + similarly inhibits EGF receptor function. The inhibitory effect of Ca 2 +, unlike that of TPA, appears not to be dependent on protein kinase C activity. Neither ionomycin nor phorbol ester affects EGF-induced receptor dimerization, as shown by cross-linking and immunoblotting techniques, although the phosphotyrosine content of both monomeric and dimeric receptors is strongly decreased. Furthermore, we show that EGF receptor dimerization is not affected by increases in cyclic AMP or intracellular pH, nor by changes in transmembrane potential, medium osmolarity or the glycosylation state of the receptor. These result suggest that modulation of EGF receptor function occurs at a step other than receptor dimerization...|$|E

Human colorectal carcinoma cell lines, which are tumorigenic in athymic nude mice can be readily established in vitro (Fogh et al., 1977; Brattain et al., 1983), but the normal and pre-malignant epithelium of the human colon, from which the carcinomas develop has proved much harder to grow (Franks, 1976; Moyer, 1983; Paraskeva et al., 1984). This has considerably restricted studies into the complex multi-stage process of human colorectal epithelial cell transformation, with few reports of transformations i...|$|R
40|$|Background: Malignancies {{emerging}} in the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses are rare and accounts for 5 % of all head and neck malignancies and 0. 1 % of all malignancies in Sweden. The incidence of sinonasal malignancy (SNM), except sinonasal malignant melanoma (SNMM), {{has been reported to}} decrease since 1960 in Sweden. Despite similar improvement in the prognosis of other malignancies, treatment of SNM still yields a poor survival outcome. About 1 – 2 % of all malignant melanomas originate from mucosal membranes in the genitourinary, digestive and the respiratory regions, whereas mucosal melanomas are most frequently located in the nasal cavity, followed by sites in paranasal sinuses {{in the head and neck}} region. The incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) continues to increase in many parts of the world, possibly due mainly to the effects of sun-related behaviour; however, the incidence of mucosal melanomas such as vulvar and ano-rectal melanoma display a more complicated pattern with a stable or decreasing incidence rate. We now know that the incidence of SNMM is increasing in Sweden, as we have documented one of the largest consecutively studied SNMM groups in the world. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The treatment options for these patients have remained the same over the years; mainly radical surgery followed by radiotherapy. Alternatively, recent molecular-targeted therapy has become available for sub-groups of patients with malignant melanomas. Such therapeutic advances stress the importance of investigating the aetiology and molecular characteristics of SNMM, which are not yet well. Aims: Given the rarity of SNM and SNMM, relevant knowledge is limited. Therefore, the overall aim of this thesis was to examine the clinical characteristics and features of SNMM and SNM and to determine the occurrence of molecular alterations. They include KIT, NRAS and BRAF mutation frequencies and mutation frequency of the TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase) promotor gene in SNMM. Results: In the first project, we identified 3221 patients from the Swedish National Cancer Registry diagnosed with primary malignancies arising from the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, or both, during the period 1960 through 2011. The anatomical site, gender and age, incidence and survival were scrutinized. We found that the incidence of sinonasal malignancies decreased except for SNMM and adenoid cystic cancer during the study period. More than 50 % of these malignancies involved the nasal cavity. The five-year relative survival was highest for patients with adenoid cystic cancer followed by adenocarcinoma. Those with SNMM and undifferentiated carcinoma had the poorest prognosis. In the second project we identified 186 SNMM patients during the period 1960 through 2000 in Sweden from the National Swedish Cancer Registry (SCR). We investigated the incidence, gender, age, primary anatomical sites, geographic distribution, treatment and survival. In this population the incidence of SNMM increased during the study period. The incidence for females was higher than for males, and the incidence increased with age for both genders. We found that about 70 % of the tumours were clinically described as amelanotic. Surgery was the most common primary treatment. The five-year disease- specific survival rates were poor for both genders, but females had a better survival than males. The survival rate improved for both genders during the study period, regardless of therapeutic strategy. We conclude that the incidence of SNMM in Sweden increased significantly from 1960 through 2000 but not as rapidly as that of CMM. In the third project, we analysed 56 primary SNMMs, the largest number, as far as we know, for mutations in KIT (exons 11, 13 and 17), NRAS (exons 1 and 2) and BRAF (exon 15) identified by using direct sequencing. Twelve of the 56 (21 %) tumours contained mutations in these oncogenes, 2 tumours harboured KIT mutations, another 2 harboured BRAF mutation and 8 had NRAS mutations. We found a higher frequency of mutations in tumours originating from the paranasal sinuses compared to tumours from the nasal cavity (p= 0. 027). In the fourth project we analysed 49 SNMM <b>tumours</b> for TERT <b>promotor</b> gene mutations, since former investigators found only a few driver mutations for these patients, who were never previously examined for this mutation. Recent studies of CMM have shown a high frequency (> 70 %) of driver mutations in this gene.  TERT promoter mutations occur at a moderate frequency in SNMM. We suggest that SNMM tumours should be included in molecular characterization, since these alterations probably will be therapeutic targets in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The B {{oligomer}} of {{pertussis toxin}} {{serves as a}} weak mitogen in the T lymphocyte, an effect which is associated with an early rise in cytosolic free calcium concentrations, as monitored by Fura- 2 fluorescence. Upon co-administration of phorbol dibutyrate, a phorbol ester <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor</b> which activates protein kinase C, pertussis toxin-induced proliferation was synergistically enhanced, {{as measured by the}} increased uptake of [3 H]thymidine, into cellular DNA. Although phorbol ester co-administration has often been associated with an inhibition of Ca 2 +-mobilizing pathways, phorbol dibutyrate pretreatment had no inhibitory effect on the pertussis toxin-induced calcium flux and may actually have enhanced this response slightly. Flow cytometric analysis of cell populations expanded by the combined regimen did not provide evidence for the preferential expansion of cells bearing either CD 4 or CD 8, the T-cell determinants representative of the helper-inducer and cytotoxic-suppressor subsets, respectively. Pertussis toxin and phorbol dibutyrate appear, therefore, to elicit polyclonal stimulation, rather than the selective activation of a given lymphocyte subset. Expression of the transferrin receptor, a marker for nutrient uptake, and CD 25, the Tac component of the interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) receptor, was, however, synergistically enhanced in cells activated by the co-treatment procedure...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Basal and {{squamous}} cell carcinomas {{are the most}} common non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) in humans. Their prevalence is higher in immunocompromized patients. Results of some animal experiments have indicated that TNF acts both as a <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor</b> and an inductor of apoptosis. AREAS COVERED: Peer-reviewed articles about human skin cancers possibly related to TNF antagonists. The occurrence and growth kinetics of NMSC are possibly increased in some patients under TNF antagonist therapy. Other issues of such biological treatment suggested include the activation of other distinct skin malignancies, including malignant melanoma. Benign melanocytic tumours appear to be boosted as well. At present, most of the reported findings only represent anecdotal case reports. The influence of cumulative co-factors must not be neglected, particularly the effect of other therapies administered to the patients. The occurrence of antibodies to some TNF antagonists may decrease both the treatment efficacy and the risk of skin cancer progression. EXPERT OPINION: More research needs to be performed in order to firmly establish and understand the risk of anti-TNF biologicals in the area of human skin cancers. At present, NMSC progression appears to be boosted on areas of skin field cancerization. Benign melanocytic naevi may develop as well. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The ileal Peyer's patches (IPP) {{of sheep}} {{may be a}} primary lymphoid organ for b cells since they {{have a number of}} {{important}} features in common with the bursa of Fabricius of chickens. We have examined the surface phenotype of IPP cells. Approximately 90 % to 95 % of IPP cells are 'low sIgM+'; that is, they have surface IgM, but in much smaller amounts than peripheral B cells, which are 'high sIgM+'. IPP cells with sIgG or sIgA are very rare. Upon exposure to a <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor,</b> phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), in vitro, low sIgM+ cells differentiated into high sIgM+ cells. The amount of Ia-like antigens on the surface also increased after PMA treatment. Approximately 5 % of IPP cells bore no identifiable markers. However, these cells could also be induced into high sIgM+ cells upon exposure to PMA; this may indicate the presence of precursors of sIgM+ cells within the IPP. While PNA (peanut agglutinin) binds strongly to the vast majority of IPP cells, it binds very little, if at all, to B cells obtained from the periphery, unless they have been treated with neuraminidase; this suggests that cells in the B lineage retain their PNA receptors, but that these become masked by sialic acid on mature B cells...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorylated {{derivatives}} of {{the membrane}} lipid phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), known as phosphoinositides (PIs), regulate membrane-proximal cellular processes by recruiting specific protein effectors involved in cell signalling, membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. Two PIs that are generated through {{the activities of}} distinct PI 3 -kinases (PI 3 Ks) are of special interest in cancer research. PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3, generated by class I PI 3 Ks, functions as <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor</b> by recruiting effectors involved in cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility. Conversely, {{there is evidence that}} PtdIns 3 P, generated by class III PI 3 K, functions in tumour suppression. Three subunits of the class III PI 3 K complex (Beclin 1, UVRAG and BIF- 1) have been independently identified as tumour suppressors in mice and humans, and their mechanism of action in this context has been proposed to entail activation of autophagy, a catabolic pathway that is considered to mediate tumour suppression by scavenging damaged organelles that would otherwise cause DNA instability through the production of reactive oxygen species. Recent studies have revealed two additional functions of PtdIns 3 P that might contribute to its tumour suppressor activity. The first involves endosomal sorting and lysosomal downregulation of mitogenic receptors. The second involves regulation of cytokinesis, which is the final stage of cell division. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of tumour suppression mediated by class III PI 3 K and PtdIns 3 P will identify novel Achilles’ heels of the cell’s defence against tumourigenesis and will be useful in the search for prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in cancer...|$|E
40|$|Receptor-mediated Ca 2 + influx {{has been}} shown to exist in several cell types. Thyrotropin-releasing-hormone (TRH) -stimulated Ca 2 + entry has also been {{postulated}} to exist in rat anterior pituitary cells, but direct evidence has been lacking. We have measured the fluorescence quenching of indo- 1 caused by Mn 2 + at a Ca(2 +) -insensitive wavelength to investigate the actions of TRH on cation entry in dispersed perifused anterior pituitary cells. In indo- 1 -loaded cells perifused with Ca(2 +) -free medium, Mn 2 + caused fluorescence quenching in unstimulated cells; TRH caused further quenching. TRH-stimulated Mn 2 + entry was transient, and levelled off within a few minutes in the presence of continuous TRH infusion. TRH-stimulated Mn 2 + entry was dependent on the concentration of Mn 2 + (50 microM- 1 mM). TRH (1 microM) caused a larger effect than TRH (10 nM). La 3 + and Ni 2 + blocked the quenching stimulated by TRH. The rate of basal quenching was not blocked by dopamine, but TRH-stimulated Mn 2 + entry was partially blocked by 1 microM-dopamine and almost completely abolished by 10 microM-dopamine. Thapsigargin (1 - 5 microM), a <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor</b> which depleted intracellular Ca 2 + stores, had little effect on Mn 2 +. F- (20 mM), which activates G-proteins, also had little effect on Mn 2 + entry. We conclude that TRH can transiently stimulate Ca 2 + entry through a channel than can pass Mn 2 + and be inhibited by dopamine. Depleting Ca 2 + stores alone is not sufficient to stimulate Ca 2 + entry, and so TRH must do so by other mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Changes {{in levels}} of purine degradative enzymes {{have been shown to}} occur during T-cell {{maturation}} in both rats and humans with a fall in adenosine deaminase (ADA) and a rise in purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and 5 '-nucleotidase (5 'NT) activities. We have investigated the effects of four thymic factors: thymosin fraction 5 (TMS-F 5); thymosin alpha 1 (TMS-alpha 1); thymopoietin pentapeptide (TP- 5); and thymic conditioned medium (CM) on TdT activity, purine enzyme levels and the phenotypic markers OKT 3 (a marker for mature T cells) and NA 1 / 34 (which reacts with immature cortical thymocytes) in human thymocytes and in the lymphoid leukaemic cell lines RPMI- 8402 and JM 1 (derived from Thy-ALL). All four thymic factors caused one or more maturation change in human thymocytes, e. g. TMS-F 5 caused a significant increase in OKT 3 expression, TMS-alpha 1 a fall in TdT and ADA activities and a rise in OKT 3 -positive cells, TP- 5 an increase in PNP and CM a rise in 5 'NT activity. TMS-F 5 also caused a marked elevation of 5 'NT in both the T lymphoblastic lines (P less than 0. 001). On the other hand the non-physiological phorbol ester, 12 -O-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), a <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor</b> with potency of inducing differentiation in some leukaemic cell lines, induced changes in both normal thymocytes and in the leukaemic line JM 1 were inconsistent with maturation, e. g. a fall in the percentage of OKT 3 cells. These observations suggest that maturation of normal thymocytes might proceed stepwise, each step requiring {{at least one of the}} thymic hormones. Although thymosin also induces differentiation changes in a malignant lymphoid line, the pattern of these differs from that induced in their normal counterparts...|$|E
40|$|Cyanobacterial {{blooms in}} the Baltic Sea are {{dominated}} by diazotrophic cyanobacteria, i. e. Aphanizomenon sp. and Nodularia spumigena. The blooms coincide with a stable stratification and the organisms are concentrated to the surface water, exposed {{to high levels of}} both photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400 – 700 nm) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280 – 400 nm), in combination with low ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and inorganic phosphorus (DIN:DIP). The ability of nitrogen fixation, a high tolerance to phosphorus starvation and photo-protective strategies (production of mycosporine-like amino acids, MAAs) may explain their competitive advantage in the Baltic Sea. However, intraspecific variation in the response to environmental factors has been commonly overlooked. The seasonal succession with peaks of Aphanizomenon sp. in early summer followed by peaks of N. spumigena, has been related to their interspecific preferences and response to abiotic conditions. N. spumigena dominates in late summer forming extensive toxic blooms, and its toxin nodularin, a hepatotoxin lethal to wild and domestic animals, may act as a <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor.</b> It has been suggested that the accumulation of nodularin within the N. spumigena cells and its release from the cells are affected by environmental factors. Hence, the seasonal succession may be explained by an allelopathic effect of nodularin on Aphanizomenon sp. The aim of this thesis is to elucidate the factors controlling the cyanobacterial blooms, prevailing seasonal succession, intraspecific differences, toxin production and release. Moreover, to analyze the potential of future toxic blooms in a predicted climate change, e. g. increased UVR and stronger stratification due to increased precipitation and temperature. With a multi-factorial approach in the laboratory and in outdoor experiments, interactive effects of radiation (photosynthetic active radiation PAR and PAR + UV-A + UV-B), nutrients (nutrient replete, nitrogen limited, phosphorus limited) and species composition (monocultures of N. spumigena and Aphanizomenon sp. and mixed cultures with the respective species) were tested on these two species. Although strain-specific differences in UV-B radiation tolerance were observed, N. spumigena is a species that is not generally negatively affected by UV-B radiation corresponding to ambient sea surface intensities/doses. N. spumigena tolerates high ambient UVR also under nutrient-limiting conditions and maintains positive growth rates even under severe phosphorus limitation. Interestingly, the specific growth rate of N. spumigena was stimulated by the presence of Aphanizomenon sp. and in contrast to our hypothesis, Aphanizomenon sp. was not negatively affected by the presence of N. spumigena. Nodularin accumulation and release were dependent on environmental conditions, but the released nodularin did not affect the co-existing species Aphanizomenon sp. The highest intra- and extracellular nodularin concentrations were observed under nitrogen limitation when shielded from UVR. In conclusion, I suggest that the seasonal succession, with peaks of Aphanizomenon sp. followed by peaks of N. spumigena is a result from species-specific preferences of environmental conditions and/or stimulation by Aphanizomenon sp., rather than an allelopathic effect of N. spumigena. Moreover, a possible increased toxin content of the N. spumigena should be considered when planning sewage treatment, since nitrogen removal may cause problems on a recreational level and increased accumulation of nodularin higher up in the food web. The results from this thesis, together with a predicted stronger stratification and increased UVR due to effects of climate change in the Baltic Sea, reflect a scenario with a continuing future dominance of the toxic N. spumigena...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{xenobiotic}} compounds {{is known to}} induce characteristic changes in the livers of laboratory animals. These changes include enlargement of the liver, usually {{as a result of}} cell enlargement (hypertrophy) or Increased cell replication (hyperplasia), induction of drugmetabolizing enzymes and proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Such changes are usually not accompanied by evidence of liver damage and thus are reversible upon withdrawal and elimination of the compound. Consequently, most authors regard this phenomenon as an adaptive response of the organ to increased functional demands. However, chronic exposure of various strains of mice to dieldrin, phenobarbitone, DDT and the α-, β- and γ-stereoisomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, also known as benzenehexachloride, MC) may lead to the development of liver tumours. The tumorigenic effects of microsomal enzyme Inducers In mice may result from (A) a weak carcinogenic action of the xenobiotics themselves or (h) an enhancing (promoting) action of xenobiotics on a pre-existing oncogenic factor in mouse liver. The first objective {{of this study was to}} discriminate between these two possible types. Druckrey and his associates have established both theoretically and experimentally the dose-response characteristics of chemical carcinogens:D. T n= constant (1) where D = daily dose, T = the median tumour Induction period and n = an exponent, always> 1. Since the mechanisms by which enhancers or promotors of carcinogenesis operate is quite different from the one used by carcinogens, it is be conceivable that promotors also exhibit different dose-response characteristics. The dose-response characteristics of dieldrin-mediated enhancement of liver tumour formation in CF- 1 mice were analysed, using existing tumour data from chronic feeding studies at six exposure levels of dieldrin (a model compound for microsomal enzyme induction). It was found that the dose- response relationship can be expressed as:(d o + δx). t = constant (2) where d o stands for the background dose equivalent required for the induction of spontaneous liver tumours, δx represents the actual dieldrin dose (ppm in the diet) and t the median tumour induction period in the respective treatment groups. It was also established that the doseresponse characteristics of limited dieldrin exposures and those of de layed exposure were consistent with equation (2), which is a Druckrey relation where n = 1. From these findings it is concluded that dieldrin interacts reversibly with its receptors, resulting in an acceleration of tumour formation (which is essentially Irreversible); dieldrin may thus be regarded as a <b>tumour</b> <b>promotor.</b> The validity of equation (2) for both chronic and limited dieldrin exposure Indicates that (a) the velocity of liver tumour development is proportional to the daily dose level (δx), (b) the total tumorigenic dose is constant across all doses, (c) the effects of dieldrin on the neoplastic process In mouse liver are essentially irreversible and cumulative, and (d) there is no evidence for a threshold level. Tumour formation Is a dose- and time-dependent process. The induction of liver enlargement, microsomal enzyme systems and proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum by dieldrin are only dose-dependent. In contrast, polyploldization Is dose- and time-dependent. To establish apossible link between microsomal enzyme induction, nuclear polyploidization and liver tumour formation, nuclear polyploidization in livers of CF- 1 mice was studied at five different dieldrin dose levels from 1. 85 months up to tumour development. Nuclear polyploidization, expressed in the proportion of octaploid (8 c) nuclei, was found to be characterized by a linear increase with age in untreated control CF- 1 mice. Dieldrin treatment induced a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of 8 c-nuclei in the initial phases of treatment. In "steady-state" situations nuclear polyploidization (as expressed by the percentage of 8 c-nuclei) was maintained on a dose-dependent, higher level, and the percentage was was observed to increase with age, the velocity of which was the same as in untreated controls. Tumour formation was found to be associated with a constant degree of nuclear polyploidization In all treatment groups Including controls. The observed quantitative link between nuclear polyploidization and tumour formation leads to the question whether or not a causal relationship between the two exists. Assuming that polyploidization reflects the ageing process, the data suggest that liver tumour formation Is Imminent at a constant biological age and that dieldrin could operate by advancing the biological age of CF- 1 mouse liver. Further support for this hypothesis was obtained from the determination of cytoplasmic alanine amino transferase (AAT) isoenzymes. The expression of the isoenzyme decreases with age In untreated control CF- 1 mice. Dieldrin treatment was found to enhance (accelerate) this process in a dose-dependent manner. Although the nature of the development of "spontaneous" liver tumours in CF- 1 mice remains unknown, the decrease In the tetraplold(4 c) -diplold (2 c) ratio of liver nuclei, observed in the study of polyploidization, may be related to tumour formation. The decrease was observed in alltreatment groups, including controls, and its onset was dose-dependently advanced by dieldrin treatment, occurring approximately 4 months before the median liver tumour induction period in all cases. Two mechanisms are proposed that may explain the tumorigenic features of a decreasein the 4 c- 2 c ratio. 1. Tetraploid cells could be more sensitive to accumulative toxic stress. Thus, their turnover may be Increased. To replace one tetraploid cell a diploid cell has to divide twice; the loss of tetraploid cells would therefore result in a proliferative response of the diploidpopulation (resulting tumour formation). 2. A reduction in the 4 c- 2 c ratio could be induced by the occurrence of amitotic nuclear divisions in the tetraploid cells. Evidence for this possibility was obtained from experiments with 3 H-thymidine-labelled nuclei. Amitotic nuclear divisions could give rise to chromosomalre-arrangements, resulting in the expression of the intrinsic neoplastic potential of CF- 1 mouse liver. Both hypotheses imply that the diploid population is the source of livertumours. The determination of nuclear polyploidization in liver tumours confirmed that these tumours originate from the diploid liver cell population. ...|$|E
