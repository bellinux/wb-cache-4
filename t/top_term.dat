Type 1 with parallel <b>top</b> <b>term</b> characterises parallel mean curvature surfaces and, in codimension 1, type 1 characterises constant mean curvature surfaces. We show that this hierarchy is preserved under both spectral deformation and Baecklund transformation, for special choices of parameters, defining, in particular, transformations of constant mean curvature surfaces into new ones, with preservation of the mean curvature, in the latter case.

40|$|International audienceThree {{types of}} {{information}} categories are proposed in a learner‟s glossary entry: conceptual, lexical and pragmatic. The glossary is envisaged as a knowledge-oriented terminological collection which provides quick access to the conceptual structure of a narrow domain, the head terms functioning in it, their definitions, collocations, translations and contextual use. The conceptual information is identified by analyzing the conceptual relations using a classification scheme of the general aspects of the basic concept (<b>top</b> <b>term).</b> The top-down procedure continues with establishing the system-structuring characteristics with possible graphic representation of types. The lexical information refers to terminological collocations identified by a lexico-semantic analysis. The pragmatic information is provided by corpusextracted contexts and translation equivalents specified by a systematicity-based terminological contrastive analysis. A model is proposed for organizing the data obtained in a learner‟s glossary entry. It is concluded that the proposed model allows maximum concentration of terminological knowledge applicable in technical translation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} theory of sutured Floer {{homology}} developed by the author. We first prove an adjunction inequality, and then define a polytope P(M,g) in H^ 2 (M,∂ M; R) that is spanned by the Spin^c-structures which support non-zero Floer homology groups. If (M,g) [...] > (M',g') is a taut surface decomposition, then a natural map projects P(M',g') onto a face of P(M,g); moreover, if H_ 2 (M) = 0, then every face of P(M,g) can be obtained in this way for some surface decomposition. We show that if (M,g) is reduced, horizontally prime, and H_ 2 (M) = 0, then P(M,g) is maximal dimensional in H^ 2 (M,∂ M; R). This implies that if rk(SFH(M,g)) < 2 ^k+ 1 then (M,g) has depth at most 2 k. Moreover, SFH acts as a complexity for balanced sutured manifolds. In particular, the rank of the <b>top</b> <b>term</b> of knot Floer homology bounds the topological complexity of the knot complement, in addition to simply detecting fibred knots.

40|$|Modular graph {{functions}} {{associate to}} a graph an SL(2,Z) -invariant function {{on the upper}} half plane. We obtain the Fourier series of modular graph functions of arbitrary weight w and two-loop order. The motivation for this work {{is to develop a}} deeper understanding of the origin of the algebraic identities between modular graph functions which have been discovered recently, and of the relation between the existence of these identities and the occurrence of cusp forms. We show that the constant Fourier mode, as a function of the modulus τ, consists of a Laurent polynomial in y = π Im (τ) of degree (w, 1 -w), plus a contribution which decays exponentially as y →∞. The Laurent polynomial is a linear combination with rational coefficients of the <b>top</b> <b>term</b> y^w, and lower order terms ζ (2 k+ 1) y^w- 2 k- 1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ w- 1, as well as terms ζ (2 w- 2 ℓ- 3) ζ (2 ℓ+ 1) y^ 2 -w for 1 ≤ℓ≤ w- 3. The exponential contribution is a linear combination of exponentials of y and incomplete Γ-functions whose coefficients are Laurent polynomials in y with rational coefficients.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{introduce}} {{an approach}} of Riemann–Roch theorem to the boundedness problem of minimal log discrepancies in fixed dimension. After reducing {{it to the}} case of a Gorenstein terminal singularity, firstly we prove that its minimal log discrepancy is bounded if either multiplicity or embedding dimension is bounded. Secondly we recover the characterisation of a Gorenstein terminal three-fold singularity by Reid, and the precise boundary of its minimal log discrepancy by Markushevich, without explicit classification. Finally we provide the precise boundary for a special four-fold singularity, whose general hyperplane section has a terminal piece. A primary study in birational geometry is to find and analyse a good representative in each birational equivalence class, and the minimal model program has been formulated to find the representative by comparison of canonical divisors. It works at present with provision of termination of flips by the work [7] of Hacon and McKernan, {{or in the case of}} big boundaries by their following work [3] together with Birkar and Cascini, whereas the termination in the relatively projective case is reduced by Shokurov in [23] to two conjectures on minimal log discrepancy, a numerical invariant attached to a singularity. Although the two conjectures are believed very difficult, each of them leads as its corollary another related but more accessible conjecture, the boundedness (BDD), that there exists an upper bound of all minimal log discrepancies in fixed dimension. In fact Shokurov has conjectured its precise boundary in [20]. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an approach of Riemann–Roch theorem to this (BDD). It is standard to reduce (BDD) {{to the case of}} a Gorenstein terminal singularity, Proposition 2. 1. Then we derive (BDD), Theorem 2. 2, on the assumption of bounded multiplicity or embedding dimension by the basic property of Riemann– Roch formula that a kind of multiplicity appears in its <b>top</b> <b>term.</b> This theorem would be attractive from the perspective that the minimal log discrepancy measures how singular a variety is. It should be large only in the case of mild singularities, like those with small multiplicity or embedding dimension. This is supported also by the description [6] of minimal log discrepancies in terms of motivic integratio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The free-form tags {{available}} from social bookmarking {{sites such as}} Delicious 4 {{have been shown to}} be useful for a number of purposes and could serve as a cheap source of metadata about URLs on the web. Unfortunately recent years have seen a reduction in the popularity of such sites, however at the same time microblogging sites such as Twitter have exploded in popularity. On these sites users submit short messages (or “tweets”) about what they are currently reading, thinking and doing and often post URLs. In this work we look into the similarity between top tags drawn from Delicious and high-frequency terms from tweets to ascertain whether Twitter data could serve as a useful replacement for Delicious. We in-vestigate how these terms compare with web page content, whether or not <b>top</b> Twitter <b>terms</b> converge and determine if the terms are mostly descriptive (and therefore useful) or if they are mostly expressing sen-timent or emotion. We discover that provided a large number of tweets are available referring to a chosen URL then the <b>top</b> <b>terms</b> drawn from these tweets are similar to Delicious tags and could therefore be used for similar purposes. ...|$|R
40|$|Content-based {{full-text search}} still remains a {{particularly}} challenging problem in peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems. Traditionally, {{there have been}} two index partitioning structures [...] -partitioning based on the document space or partitioning based on keywords.

In this paper, we propose eSearch [...] -a P 2 P keyword search system based on a novel hybrid indexing structure. In eSearch, each node is responsible for certain terms. Given a document, eSearch uses a modern information retrieval algorithm to select a small number of <b>top</b> (important) <b>terms</b> in the document and publishes the complete term list for the document to nodes responsible for those <b>top</b> <b>terms.</b> This selective replication of term lists allows a multi-term query to proceed local to the nodes responsible for query terms.
