5|$|On April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago {{and joined}} the {{chemistry}} group at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where Enrico Fermi and his group would later convert uranium-238 to plutonium-239 in a controlled nuclear chain reaction. Seaborg's role was {{to figure out how}} to extract the <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> plutonium from the mass of uranium. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then entered full-scale production at the Hanford Engineer Works, in Richland, Washington.|$|E
25|$|In the Cairo museum may be {{seen the}} statue of {{a man from the}} period of the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{possibly}} 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of this or any other period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent rock crystal forms the iris, while a <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The IV., V. and VI. dynasties cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification (Maspero). As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these Ka statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.|$|E
500|$|B. edulis is {{considered}} one of the safest wild mushrooms to pick for the table, as no poisonous species closely resemble it. The most similar poisonous mushroom may be the devil's bolete (Rubroboletus satanas), which has a similar shape, but has a red stem and stains blue on bruising. It is often confused with the very bitter and unpalatable Tylopilus felleus, but can be distinguished by the reticulation on the stalk; in porcini, it is a whitish, net-like pattern on a brownish stalk, whereas it is a dark pattern on white in the latter. Porcini have whitish pores while the other has pink. If in doubt, tasting a <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> flesh will yield a bitter taste. It can also resemble the [...] "bolete-like" [...] Gyroporus castaneus, which is generally smaller, and has a browner stem.|$|E

500|$|These {{were ready}} in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then {{carried out a}} series of experiments. They {{demonstrated}} that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched. Pegram forwarded the results to Briggs on March 11, 1940; they were subsequently published to the Physical Reviews March 15 and April 15, 1940 issues. [...] Briggs reported to Watson on April 9 that it was doubtful that a chain reaction could be initiated in uranium without uranium enrichment, and therefore urged that research be undertaken into isotope separation technology. Nier, Booth, Dunning and von Grosse's [...] results were discussed by Jesse Beams, Ross Gunn, Fermi, Nier, Merle Tuve and Harold Urey at the spring meeting of the American Physical Society in Washington, D.C., in the last week of April 1940. The New York Times reported that conferees argued [...] "the probability of some scientist blowing up a sizable portion of the earth with a <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> uranium." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1980 Donen {{made the}} science fiction film Saturn 3, {{starring}} Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel. Donen first {{read the script}} when its writer (and Movie Movies set designer) John Barry showed it to him, prompting Donen to pass it along to Lew Grade. Donen was initially hired to produce, but Grade asked him to complete the film when first-time director Barry was unable to direct. According to Donen [...] "only a <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> what Barry shot {{ended up in the}} finished film." [...] It was a critical and financial disaster and initially Donen {{did not want to be}} credited as director. In the early 1980s Donen was attached to direct an adaptation of Stephen King's The Dead Zone and worked with writer Jeffrey Boam on the script. Donen eventually dropped out of the project and David Cronenberg directed the film a few years later. Boam stated that Donen was initially attracted to making the film because he wanted to [...] "connect with contemporary youthful audiences" [...] and that the script that they worked on together was [...] "very close to the script that David wound up making." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{morning after}} the November 2015 Paris attacks, German pianist Davide Martello brought a grand piano to the street {{out in front of}} the Bataclan, where 89 concertgoers had been shot dead the night before, and {{performed}} an instrumental version to honour the victims of the attacks; video of his performance went viral. This led Katy Waldman of Slate to ponder why [...] "Imagine" [...] had become so frequently performed as a response to tragedy. In addition to its general popularity, she noted its musical simplicity, its key of C major, [...] "the plainest and least complicated key, with no sharps or flats" [...] aside from one passage with [...] "a plaintive major seventh chord that allows a <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> E minor into the tonic". That piano part, [...] "gentle as a rocking chair", underpins lyrics that, Waldman says, [...] "belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth". This understanding is also compounded by the historical context of Lennon's own violent death, [...] "remind us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people". Ultimately, the song [...] "captures the fragility of our hope after a violent or destructive event ... t also reveals its tenacity".|$|E

500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic {{selected}} the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, noting that it has [...] "a wide theatrical scope akin to that of The-Dream's own 'Nikki, Pt. 2/Abyss.'" [...] He further analysed: [...] "Over a swelling and receding production with echoes of Kim Carnes' 'Bette Davis Eyes,' Rihanna mourns ("Felt like love struck me in the night/I pray that love don't strike twice"), then confesses ("Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change"), then surrenders ("I'm prepared to die in the moment"). Perhaps no one should read anything into it." [...] Christina Lee of Idolator observed that the song [...] "casts out the album’s most heartbreaking line — 'I’m prepared to die at the moment' — but puts it in a context that doesn’t explain enough." [...] Esquires Miles Raymer thought that Police would have been a better band if they would have had Rihanna as their lead singer instead of Sting; however, he described [...] "Mother Mary" [...] as something to skip. Alike Raymer, Bernard Perusse for The Montreal Gazette felt that only [...] "Love Without Tragedy" [...] was worth listening to and described it as demonstrating [...] "a <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> hope" [...] on the album. In a review of the album, Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "Rihanna sings a grim rhetorical: [...] "What's love without tragedy?" [...] However, according to her the real question that she and her songwriters is presenting on the record is [...] "Who is Rihanna without Chris Brown?" [...] "Nathan Slavick for DJ Booth was critical of the tracks theme, writing that [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary", along with [...] "Stay" [...] and [...] "No Love Allowed", all discuss the topic of Rihanna being a non-controversial person who is struggling to find love in a [...] "mad world". He further wrote that none of them are impressive." ...|$|E

He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: [...] "You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just know that as far as you are aware, you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even a <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway.

2500|$|Helmsley {{was known}} for [...] "tyrannizing her employees". According to Alan Dershowitz, while breakfasting with her {{at one of the}} Helmsley hotels, the waiter brought him a cup of tea with a <b>tiny</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> water spilled on the saucer. She grabbed the cup from him and smashed it on the floor, then demanded that the waiter get down {{on his hands and knees}} and beg for his job." [...] In another account of Helmsley's behavior, she had a {{barbecue}} pit constructed for her home. The work was performed by Eugene Brennan, a personal friend of Jeremiah McCarthy, the chief engineer of Helmsley-Spear. When the final bill came to $13,000, she refused to pay, citing shoddy workmanship. When McCarthy pleaded with her to honor the bill, citing the favor done on his behalf and informing her that Brennan had six children to support, Helmsley replied, [...] "Why didn't he keep his pants on? Then he wouldn't need the money".|$|E
