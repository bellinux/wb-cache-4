"On us who {{saw these}} {{phenomenon}} {{for the first}} time the impression will not easily be forgotten...We felt necessarily carried back to a time when the schistus on which we stood was yet at the bottom of the sea, and when the sandstone before us was only beginning to be deposited, in the shape of sand or mud, from the waters of the supercontinent ocean... The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far back into the abyss of time; and whilst we listened with earnestness and admiration to the philosopher who was now unfolding to us the order and series of <b>these</b> <b>wonderful</b> events, we became sensible how much further reason may sometimes go than imagination may venture to follow."

500|$|In an on-set {{interview}} with The Huffington Post, actor John Noble {{explained that the}} episode's primary storyline concerned the bridge between the two worlds. The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do you do? What do you do with this wonderful discovery? Do you keep it? What do you lose if you lose it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all <b>these</b> <b>wonderful</b> characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think we have to face that issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|E

500|$|The National Wildlife Federation {{described}} her as [...] "a passionate, articulate, and tireless {{voice for the}} environment". Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, [...] "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't {{give a lot of}} credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give <b>these</b> <b>wonderful,</b> curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me." [...] Her ashes were scattered over the [...] of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park.|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm <b>these</b> <b>wonderful</b> things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} Stockholm, Sweden in September 2010. Production mostly {{took place at}} multiple locations in the city's central business district, including at the Stockholm Court House. One challenge was realizing the Vanger estate. They picked an eighteenth-century French architecture mansion Hofsta located approximately [...] southwest of Stockholm. Filmmakers wanted to use a typical [...] "manor from Småland" [...] that was solemn, formal, and [...] "very Old Money". [...] "The Swedish {{are very good at}} the modern and the minimal but they also have <b>these</b> <b>wonderful</b> country homes that can be juxtaposed against the modern city—yet both speak to money." [...] Principal photography relocated in October to Uppsala. On Queen Street, the facade of the area was renovated to mimic the Hotel Alder, after an old photograph of a building obtained by Fincher. From December onward, production moved to Zurich, Switzerland, where locations were established at Dolder Grand Hotel and the Zurich Airport. Because of the [...] "beautiful" [...] environment of the city, Fincher found it difficult to film in the area. Principal photography concluded in Oslo, Norway, where production took place at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Recorded for over fifteen hours, twelve extras were sought for background roles. Filming also took place in the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 10 October 2010 in India. Most of the filming {{took place in}} the Indian state of Rajasthan, including the cities of Jaipur and Udaipur. In Jaipur, filming took place around the City Palace, the Marigold market, and on crowded buses. Other scenes were shot in Kishangarh, and on the outskirts of Jaipur, footage was shot at Kanota Fort, which stood in for the Viceroy Club. The place where Sonny and Sunaina meet in the film was shot nearby at the Step Well near Amer Fort, a 10th-century establishment noted for its [...] "ten stories of pale golden stone steps." [...] Ravla Khempur was chosen as the site for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel; it is an equestrian hotel that was originally the palace of a tribal chieftain, located {{about an hour and a}} half outside of Udaipur in the village of Khempur. Madden considered the building to have a magical quality and unmistakable charm, remarking that it had [...] "something special that could ultimately draw the characters in. It had <b>these</b> <b>wonderful</b> cool dark interiors, with glimpses of saturated light and the teeming life outside its walls." [...] Production designer Alan MacDonald, who won Best Art Direction in a Contemporary Film from the Art Directors Guild for his work, was brought in to embellish the interiors, intentionally making it clash with [...] "interesting furniture inspired by colonial India, mismatched local textiles, all mixed together with modern plastic bits and pieces, with everything distressed and weather beaten." [...] Footage was also shot at the Lake Palace Hotel at Lake Pichola.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} manager asked {{each of the}} Russian immigrant extras {{to bring to the}} location a gift-wrapped box to double for wedding presents. The manager figured if the extras did this, not only would the production save time and money, but the gifts would also look more authentic. Once the unit wrapped and the extras disappeared, the crew discovered to their amusement that the boxes weren't empty but filled with real presents, from china to silverware. [...] "Who got to keep all <b>these</b> <b>wonderful</b> offerings," [...] wrote Deeley [...] "is a mystery I never quite fathomed." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the ending}} of the film, Iliadis {{and the rest of the}} {{creative}} team chose to include the song [...] "Dirge", by psychedelic rock band Death in Vegas. Iliadis was hoping to find something that was both [...] "ironic" [...] and [...] "innocent" [...] at the same time, given the events in the film that would precede its usage. To the director, the choice helped to illuminate the fact that nothing will be the same for this family again. Craven comments on the choice to have John Collingwood return to finish off Krug at the end. Craven explains, [...] "I also found it interesting that the Dr., whose oath 'does no harm', intentionally [...] and that it kinda shows that when seeking revenge you can become something evil yourself if you don't stop once what's been necessary is done. So I also found it intriguing that we're just seeing <b>these</b> <b>wonderful,</b> perfect people but the father comes back and goes out of his way to do this." ...|$|E

Beholding <b>these</b> exceedingly <b>wonderful</b> things and this worship offered to Duryodhana by heavenly beings, the Pandavas headed by Lord Krishna became ashamed. Hearing the words of Devas and Siddhas that Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Duryodhana, and others were cheated to death, the Pandavas became afflicted with grief and wept in sorrow.|$|R

2500|$|While it {{has never}} been {{published}} or seen, Brodovitch did the design work for what would have been the very first publication of Truman Capote's novella Breakfast at Tiffany's in Harper's Bazaar. [...] The novella was to appear in the July, 1958 issue. It was to be illustrated with a series of photo montages by David Attie, who had been a student of Brodovitch's the previous year and was offered the job on the final night of the class. [...] Alice Morris, the fiction editor of Harper's, recalled that [...] "Brodovitch... had <b>these</b> <b>wonderful</b> photos taken {{that had nothing to do}} with the Breakfast story, but with Holly Golightly's cat. [...] A cat in a window, mysterious-looking, slightly shady and misty." [...] However, after the publication was scheduled, longtime Harper's editor Carmel Snow, who had wielded considerable influence, was ousted by the magazine's publisher, the Hearst Corporation, and replaced with her niece. Hearst executives then began asking for changes to the novella's tart language. By this time, Attie's montages and Brodovitch's design work had been completed, and Morris recounted that while Capote initially refused to make any changes, he relented [...] "partly because I showed him the layouts. We had about six pages with beautiful, atmospheric photographs." [...] Yet despite Capote's changes, Hearst ordered Harper's not to run the novella anyway. [...] Its language and subject matter were still deemed [...] "not suitable," [...] and there was concern that Tiffany's, a major advertiser, would react negatively. An outraged Capote soon took the work to Esquire, and it appeared in the November 1958 issue without Attie's or Brodovitch's contributions.|$|E
2500|$|Victorian critics {{praised the}} poem and some {{examined}} {{aspects of the}} poem's background. John Sheppard, {{in his analysis of}} dreams titled On Dreams (1847), lamented Coleridge's drug use as {{getting in the way of}} his poetry but argued: [...] "It is probable, since he writes of having taken an 'anodyne,' that the 'vision in a dream' arose under some excitement of that same narcotic; but this does not destroy, even as to his particular case, the evidence for a wonderfully inventive action of the mind in sleep; for, whatever were the exciting cause, the fact remains the same". T. Hall Caine, in 1883 survey of the original critical response to Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan", praised the poem and declared: [...] "It must surely be allowed that the adverse criticism on 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' which is here quoted is outside all tolerant treatment, whether of raillery or of banter. It is difficult to attribute such false verdict to pure and absolute ignorance. Even when we make all due allowance for the prejudices of critics whose only possible enthusiasm went out to 'the pointed and fine propriety of Poe,' we can hardly believe that the exquisite art which is among the most valued on our possessions could encounter so much garrulous abuse without the criminal intervention of personal malignancy." [...] In a review of H. D. Traill's analysis of Coleridge in the [...] "English Men of Letters", an anonymous reviewer wrote in 1885 Westminster Review: [...] "Of 'Kubla Khan,' Mr. Traill writes: 'As to the wild dream-poem 'Kubla Khan,' it is hardly more than a psychological curiosity, and only that perhaps in respect of the completeness of its metrical form.' Lovers of poetry think otherwise, and listen to <b>these</b> <b>wonderful</b> lines as the voice of Poesy itself." ...|$|E

"And {{also much}} cattle": God's mercy is over all his works; he preserveth man and beast (Psalm 36:6; Psalm 145:9), and as man is {{superior}} to other animals, so are cattle better than plants.
