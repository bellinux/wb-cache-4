[...] Since the employee is now directly paying {{for some of the}} costs, this reduces the income tax and GST benefits, but because FBT, equivalent to the highest marginal tax rate, is eliminated, the net cost to the employee of the arrangement is less. The employee contribution can take either the form of direct payment for expenses or can be paid to the employer. Since the maximum benefit is obtained by making a contribution of exactly the amount of the fringe benefit (eliminating all FBT), usually the latter is used. In this case, the employer must remit GST on the employee contribution to the ATO. Thus the reduction in employee salary becomes equal to the <b>total</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> paid by the employer, less GST on those costs, less the employee contribution, plus GST on the employee contribution.

40|$|From 2002 the Norwegian {{hospital}} {{sector is}} to be transferred from county to state ownership, organised through regional semiautonomous companies. A major motivation for the reform is to allow for more specialised hospital production. If there are economies or diseconomies of scope, the production of hospital services in a region could become more efficient by exploiting any cost savings that may stem from an optimal division of service production between units. While the theory of economics of scope is well developed, applications have chiefly been concerned with testing for natural monopoly, and few studies of hospital production have been concerned with scope.

40|$|AbstractMicro Gas Turbines (mGT) {{appear as}} a {{promising}} technology for small-scale (up to 500 kW) Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production. However, their rather low electric efficiency limits their profitability when the heat demand decreases. Hot liquid water injection in mGTs –particularly within the micro Humid Air Turbine (mHAT) cycle– allows increasing electric efficiency by making use of the flue gas residual heat in moments of low heat demand. Based on simulations performed on a Turbec T 100 mGT –modified to operate as an mHAT– installed at the VUB, this paper presents {{an analysis of the}} economic profitability of such facility running on real network conditions. The study is performed assuming typical electricity and heat demand profiles for a domestic consumer. 25 natural gas and electricity price combinations have been taken into consideration, along with two types of domestic customers –with higher and lower heat demands. Results show that the profitability of the mHAT with respect to the equivalent CHP facility increases with higher electricity and lower natural gas prices. In particular, given a certain number of CHP running hours and a natural gas price, there is a threshold for the electricity price above which the net income of the mHAT unit is always higher than that of the corresponding CHP unit. In addition, water-cleaning costs for the mHAT case appear to constitute only 1 to 2. 5 % of <b>total</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|E

The model is estimated for movements to Florida of carriers serving the Florida produce/ornamentals industry. The {{results indicate that}} carriers act rationally, basing their decisions {{on a wide range}} of factors. The findings also suggest that regulatory restrictions continue to result in unnecessary empty movements. Key words: exempt trucking, logit, regulations, search theory. Transportation rates playa crucial role in the determination of economic activity over time and space. Despite this fact, relatively little attention has been devoted to understanding transportation markets. Indeed, it is common in interregional trade modeling to treat trans-portation supply as perfectly elastic. This tangential treatment of transportation markets has been identified as a major reason for the failure of many, if not most, interregional trade models to reflect adequately the eco-nomic activity being depicted (Johnson, p. 63). This article describes a study which fo-cuses on understanding one aspect of these markets: the determinants of full/empty move-ment decisions. The results help to explain seasonal swings in rate levels, why some rates taper (i. e., increase at a decreasing rate) with distance, the impact of regulatory controls, and the role of expectations in carrier decision making. It is recognized that jointness in the produc-tion of transportation services favors full movements. If a vehicle goes from point ito pointj, the marginal cost of obtaining and car-rying a load is the cost of search, pickup, and delivery, and the increment in fuel and labor costs over those for running empty (Mohring, pp. 59 - 74).

40|$|Rates of pay in {{the hotel}} and {{catering}} industry are a contentious issue. The industry is traditionally labour intensive and labour costs form a significant proportion of the <b>total</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> of an organisation. On the other hand, the industry has a reputation for low pay, and evidence suggests that pay in the industry consistently falls behind many other industries. Information about pay in the industry is however limited. Existing sources do not provide detailed data on the rates of pay for a range of employees {{in the hotel}} and catering industry. The aim of this research therefore, is to develop a comprehensive study of pay in the industry for particular grades of staff, and also to examine the factors that influence pay in the industry. A survey was conducted throughout Great Britain into rates of pay in the hotel sector, the restaurant sector, the industrial catering sector and the contract catering sector. Rates were found to be generally higher in the industrial catering sector, while the hotel and restaurant sectors tended to have very similar rates of pay. The traditionally female occupations in the industry, such as the room maid and the housekeeper are shown to have some of the lowest rates of pay, and some average rates of pay were below the legal minimum laid down by the Wages Council, The examination of determinants of pay in the industry demonstrates that pay for the unskilled grades of staff is influenced by factors such as the regional and locational situation of the hotel restaurant or unit. As there are variations of demand for labour and alternative job opportunities in different regions and locations around Great Britain, the average rate of pay for unskilled workers fluctuates. The pay of the skilled grades of staff was affected to a greater extent by factors such as the size or the price level of a unit. These factors are mainly indicative of the style of the operation and perhaps the level of skill demanded...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} of livestock housing {{can affect the}} quality {{and the costs of}} the animal production. Many environmental parameters (e. g. indoor air temperature, indoor relative humidity) must be set up and controlled to maintain animal welfare, to prevent the incidence of certain diseases, and to raise productive performance of the animals. This control is generally carried out by mechanical system that entails an energy consumption for heating, cooling and ventilation, that for some livestock housing (e. g. pig and broiler buildings) may be {{an important part of the}} <b>total</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> of the structure. Those energy consumptions and costs may be reduced by improving the thermos-physical features of the building envelope or increasing the efficiency of the used mechanical systems. To understand the effectiveness of each action regarding the envelope and/or the mechanical system, it is necessary to assess the performance of the different livestock houses. While several investigations have been carried out for the assessment, certification and improvement of the energy performance of human-related buildings (e. g. residential and retail), in the livestock sector there was not a similar attention. For this reason, the EPAnHaus (Energy Performance of Livestock Houses) project aims at defining an energy certification scheme that considers all the energy uses related to the control of indoor environment: heating, ventilation (both for cooling and Indoor Air Quality) and cooling. This project was developed through three different steps. First, an inventory of the energy use for climate control of the animal houses across Europe was made for determining benchmark values. Then, a calculation method derived from ISO Standards on building energy performance was customized for being applied to the animal production buildings to assess the energy use for climate control. It was applied into different calculation tools (some developed in cooperation with industry). Their outputs were used for defining the energy certification scheme. Finally, measurement campaigns were carried out in some livestock houses for testing and refining the models referring to the different housing types. The use of the certificate will make available the possibility to know the actual amount of energy consumed for the climate control and information about retrofitting actions (e. g. simple payback period and energy savings).

40|$|Göteborg Energi is {{the sole}} {{provider}} of district heat in the Gothenburg region in Sweden. By the year 2030, the generation of heat in Gothenburg is planned {{to be free of}} fossil fuels. The plans include the construction of a biomass-fuelled combined heat and power plant and an increased use of bio gas. These plans are already set, but there are many possible additional measures that could be implemented in the district heating system that will help to meet the targets set for 2030. However, the future is hard to predict and {{it may be difficult to}} choose which measures to implement. In order to assess the possible measures to be implemented, an optimisation study through the software GAMS has been performed in this thesis: a model of the generation of district heating in Gothenburg has been created and 4 different scenarios where measures to decrease total system running costs have been implemented by the year 2032 have been studied. These measures are: seasonal thermal energy storage, thermal energy storage in buildings, thermal energy storage in a hot water accumulator tank and an increased use of exhaust air heat pumps in buildings. The district heating system is affected by the electric system in several ways through the price of electricity. In the future, when more electricity is generated from intermittent sources such as wind or solar, the price of electricity will be fluctuating and the district heating system must be able to handle these fluctuations. The optimisation is performed on an hourly basis and includes hourly prices for electricity that have been previously simulated for 2032. It was found that it is possible to achieve a fossil-free generation of heat in Gothenburg by 2032. The studied measures all give system cost savings in the form of reduced running costs. By introducing thermal energy storage in the district heating system, substantial savings in running costs can be achieved, as well as reduced heat load variations on both daily and seasonal levels. By using buildings as thermal energy storage, similar cost savings as for an accumulator tank can be achieved, but at much lower investment cost. A seasonal thermal energy storage will give large cost savings and heavily reduced heat load variations, but at a very high investment cost. With an increased amount of exhaust air heat pumps in buildings, the <b>total</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> of the heat generation system can be reduced.

Production of high quality mussels demands quality controls in pre- and post-harvesting phases. The main concerns with the mussel industry relate to the pre-harvest stages where monitoring of pollution and management of production. This present work deals with designing of a laboratory at the Finisterra’s aquaculture to control the environmental conditions on the production of mussels focusing on establishing of an efficient quality system. This quality system includes top management commitment, organizational structure and systematically extensive documentation system {{to comply with the}} management requirements of the international quality standards. Whilst, the technical part of our quality system covers the environmental conditions of the laboratory, traceability of the results through calibration and quality control activities, and investment in the laboratory personnel. Such quality system will allow the laboratory to be accredited according to ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005. This project has been designed with enough flexibility for the Finisterra’s management to invest progressively. The base of the laboratory is wet chemistry unit which includes the routine work and preparation for the advanced analysis. Later, Finisterra can complete the work plan by investing in microbiological and advanced analysis.

As a core {{component}} of the R 3 B experimental setup [1] in the future FAIR facility, a new neutron detector – NeuLAND – is currently under development at GSI. It is foreseen that NeuLAND {{will be based on}} a resistive plate chamber (RPC) concept. RPCs are gas detectors running on a gas mixture of approximately 85 % Reclin 134 a (1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane), 10 % SF 6 and 5 % Isobutane. Reclin 134 a and SF 6 are both greenhouse gases, whose emission will be subject to emerging legal constraints. Even though a detector system such as NeuLAND is a negligible emitter of such gases, a closed-circuit gas system also improves the long-term stability of the gas mixture inside the detector, and reduces the <b>total</b> <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> of the detector, since only a limited amount of fresh gas needs to be supplied to the system. The proposed closed-circuit gas system, as shown in fig. 1, would be located outside the experimental area, allowing maintenance even during an ongoing experiment. It consists of a main recirculation circuit (1), a condensation and storage sub-circuit (2), an analysis system (5) and an injection sub-circuit (6). Under normal operation (path: ABCDEF), the gas flow is driven by a circulation pump through a chemical filter (3) filled with activated charcoal and soda lime, removing gas contaminants produced by the RPCs. One of the central issues in this closed-circuit gas system is the continuous monitoring of the composition of the gas.

For the plan to be successful in reducing expenditure to a minimum it is essential that when the weedingand herbicide plans are done the grower walks through the field thoroughly, and quantifies accurately labour and other requirements. The weeding requirements are compiled by estimating the labour requirement for each field as indicated in Table 3...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} calibration of the Vehicle Routing {{and scheduling}} Problems with Time Windows-Probabilistic (VRPTW-P) model which {{takes into account}} the uncertainty of travel times. Probe vehicle data of travel times were obtained from usual operation of pickup-delivery trucks in South Osaka area. The optimal solution of the VRPTW-P model resulted in reducing <b>total</b> <b>cost,</b> <b>running</b> times and CO 2, NOx and Particle Materials (PM) emissions compared with the usual operation. This is attributed to better routing of VRPTW-P to choose more reliable roads. Therefore, VRPTW-P can contribute to establish efficient and environmentally friendly delivery systems in urban area.

30|$|Maintenance is {{becoming}} a critical functional area in most types of organizations and systems including construction, manufacturing, transportation, etc. This increasing role of maintenance is reflected in its high cost, which {{is estimated to be}} around 30 % of the <b>total</b> <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> of modern manufacturing and construction businesses. As such, planning for maintenance {{is becoming}} an essential part of planning for the whole organization (Al-Turky 2011). Therefore, common practices like repairing a system when there is a problem have to be substituted by monitoring the system condition and planning the maintenance intervals (Cavalcante and De Almedia 2007). Also, effective maintenance can extend the equipment life, improve equipment availability, and restore the equipment to a good condition (Swanson 2001). Well-defined maintenance system will ensure optimal performance of the machineries (Oberschmidt et al. 2010). Therefore, it can not only improve the quality of goods and services but also satisfy and rather exceed customers’ demands especially in service sectors (Oke and Charles-Owaba 2006).The importance of running proper maintenance policies in organizations has led researchers to define maintenance in several ways. For example, Tsarouhas (2011) defines maintenance as a tool whose objectives are to increase the time to failure and reduce the repair time of equipment. Al-Turky (2011) defines it as the activities related to maintaining a certain level of availability and reliability of the system and its components and the system ability to perform with a standard level of quality. Still, maintenance can be defined as the combination of all technical efforts which can retain an item or equipment, or restore it to an acceptable operating condition (Dhillon 2002; British Standards Institute Staff 1993). With regard to the critical role of maintenance in improving reliability, preventing unexpected system failures and reducing maintenance costs, maintenance and replacement problems have been widely studied from different perspectives in the literature, and several models have been proposed (Wang 2002). All of them seek to elaborate on different maintenance problems and propose more rational solutions. This paper proposes a multi-criterion decision-aided maintenance model with regard to three criteria important to selecting the best maintenance policy. They are maintenance costs, reliability, and maintenance downtime criteria. This model not only considers the various aspects of a maintenance problem but also attends to the preference of a decision maker. Furthermore, Bayesian approach has been applied to overcome failure data shortage. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been made to verify the robustness of certain parameters of the model.|$|R
50|$|This {{represented}} {{a shift from}} the prevailing thinking of the 1990s, when the affiliations were arranged. At that time, particularly during the early 1990s recession, many clubs' finances were tight, so operating costs drove many decisions. At that time, some Victorian AFL clubs favoured {{the establishment of a}} WAFL/SANFL style of affiliation, with reserves players scattered throughout the VFL, because it would result in minimum management costs for the AFL club. The desire for teams to re-establish stand-alone reserves teams came {{at a time when most}} clubs were in a much stronger financial position. The <b>total</b> licence and <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> for a stand-alone team were estimated to be $500,000 per year in 2011. Through the 2000s, the AFL preferred that its Victorian clubs retained VFL-affiliations, and offered a disincentive in the form of an inflated licence fee for fielding a stand-alone team; however, the AFL did not otherwise prevent teams from fielding stand-alone reserves teams if they are willing and able to pay the fee.|$|R
40|$|Search engines use {{inverted}} files as index data {{structures to}} speed up the solution of user queries. The index is distributed on a set of processors forming a cluster of computers and queries are received by a broker machine and scheduled for solution in the cluster. The broker must use a scheduling algorithm to assign queries to processors since the computations associated with the ranking of documents that form part of the solutions to queries can take a significant fraction of the <b>total</b> <b>running</b> time. The <b>cost</b> of this task can be highly variable and depends on the particular user preferences for words when formulating queries in a given period of time. Thus the scheduling algorithm must be able to cope efficiently with a highly dynamic and very large amount of jobs being assigned in an on-line manner to the processors. In this paper we evaluate a number of scheduling algorithms proposed in the literature in the context of scheduling queries on a search engine. ...|$|R
