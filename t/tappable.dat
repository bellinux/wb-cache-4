5000|$|Many guitarists mistakenly {{refer to}} humbucker coil splits as a coil taps, however, this is incorrect: a coil split is a humbucker with one coil {{removed from the}} wiring, leaving a single coil. Because of the ubiquity of this error, and the rareness of coil taps in general, it is {{difficult}} to find <b>tappable</b> single coil pickups. However, pickup manufacturer Seymour Duncan offers tapped versions of many of their Telecaster and Stratocaster pickups on their website at a slightly greater cost than a standard version.|$|E

5000|$|Coil splits {{are often}} wrongly {{referred}} to as a [...] "coil tap". Coil taps are most commonly found on single coil pickups, and involve an extra hook-up wire being included during the manufacture of the pickup so the guitarist can choose to have all the windings of the pickup included in the circuit, for a fatter, higher output sound with more midrange; or switch the output to [...] "Tap" [...] into the windings at a point that is less than the full coil for a brighter, lower output, cleaner sound. For example: a full pickup coil may be 10,000 turns of wire and the [...] "Tap" [...] may be at 8000 turns. Because of the confusion between coil splits and coil taps—and the rareness of coil taps in general—it is difficult to find <b>tappable</b> single coil pickups for sale. However, pickup manufacturer Seymour Duncan offers tapped versions of many of their Telecaster and Stratocaster pickups on their website at an increased cost.|$|E

40|$|The Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologyKitul is indigenous to Sri Lanka and widely distributed in home gardens and natural forests. It grows taller than 20 m, lifetime of 20 - 25 years and flowers at age 10 - 15 years. Kitul treacle and jaggery are made out of the sap obtained by tapping the inflorescence. Production of one treacle bottle needs 4 - 6 litres of sap and for production of 1 Kg of jaggery needs 6 - 8 litres of sap. Maple syrup is the world's desired sweetener other than sugar and kitul treacle is a substitute. Maple reaches its <b>tappable</b> size in 40 - 60 years and could be tapped for 150 years continuously. Maple could be tapped only for 3 months and 43 litres of sap is required to produce 1 litre of syrup. Maple plantations are available in Canada. This dissertation is on kitul products confined to two products viz. jaggery and treacle on a commercial scale. The methodology of collecting and analyzing data was captured at 4 layers, tappers, producers, exporters, industry experts and other stakeholders. MINITAB and Excel are the tools used for quantitative analysis and interactive sessions conduct with tappers on the field, collection centers, exporters are used for qualitative analysis. The salient points {{of the findings of}} the study are presented in chapter 6 and recommendations are given in chapter 7. During this study some interesting and important patterns surfaced. Sap is in scarce and the supply is very limited for kitul production due to tappers unwillingness of selling sap, declining trend in kitul tapping, inability of collecting sap from distant tappers due to rapid fermentation of sap etc. Quality control methods and in standards should be improved in order to get product consistency and reduce contamination and adulteration. Proper packing should also be introduced for kitul jaggery. Energy and waste management are in favor for technical feasibility. Low cost of production, non seasonality of kitul sap, less time taken to reach <b>tappable</b> size, anti diabetic property etc. are advantages of kitul treacle above maple syrup. Availability of untapped kitul trees, attractable sap yield which currently converted to toddy and 84 times higher yield per tree than maple when calculated to the total lifetime shows clear signs of potentiality of production. Unfamiliarity of taste for export market, less technology, no precise standards for kitul treacle and lack of proper quality checking equipments are the main drawbacks which could be overcome with proper strategies.

40|$|Smallholder rubber {{plantations}} in Indonesia, representing {{more than}} 80 % {{of the total}} rubber areas, are very unique in the world. Most smallholder rubber areas are multi-strata in nature. Rubber {{is not the only}} perennial crop in that area, but also mixed with timber trees (forest re-growth), fruit trees, and different annual crops. Scientists identified these multistrata systems or called “Jungle Rubber ” have multiple functions such as main income source for many farmers; keeping certain level of the forest biodiversity; Carbon sequestration; soil and water conservation. Many efforts have been done by the Indonesian Government to improve the productivity of jungle rubber through monocuture system such as Nucleolus Estate for Smallholding (NES); Project Management Unit (PMU); and Partial System. However, the rate of rubber replanting through those specific projects are too small compared to the total rubber areas in Indonesia. Taking into account the positive aspects of the Rubber Based Agroforestry Systems (RAS), ICRAF, CIRAD and IRRI worked jointly to implement various RAS systems in order to provide farmers better technological options for managing their farms. Results presented in this paper are collected from both on-station and on-farm research. At on-station, rubber planted at a double rows spacing (6 m x 2 m x 14 m) with and without perennial intercrops was monitored and compared to that of the normal spacing (6 mx 3 m).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} growth {{potential of the}} U. S. maple syrup industry from a vari ety of ecologic, socio-economic, and public policy perspectives. It outlines the number of <b>tappable</b> trees by state, {{taking into account the}} species- sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (Acer rubrum) - ownership category, and the density and accessibility of the trees. Vermont taps the highest percentage of its available trees (3 %) and thus leads the nation in syrup produ ction. States with the most significant growth potential include Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania. Production could also expand to fill local markets for syrup in states such as Illinois and Missouri. The extent to which the industry develops is based largely on l andowner attitudes, socio-economic factors, and supply/demand dynamics that dictate profitability. I performed multinomial logistic regression using survey data to explain the characteristic s that influence a landowners' desire to utilize their maple trees for syru p production- these include residing in New England, gender, and education. Since many large landowners are concerned about the effect of tapping maple trees on sawtimber value, I developed a Net Present Value (NPV) calculator that allows foresters and landowners to determine if it is more profitable to utilize maple trees for syrup or sawtimber production. The main determinants include tree size and growth, stumpage payments, lease payments, property taxes, discount rate, and the time horizon of the investment period. Our changing climate has caused much speculation that maples will migrate northward and be replaced with oaks and hickories {{by the end of the}} century. Thus, I utilized FIA data to explore recent trends in maple and oak/hickory abundance for 26 states over the past several decades and found that shade -tolerant sugar and red maples have been infiltrating the understories of oak/hickory forests throughout the eastern U. S. Finally, I examine the role of public policies in the development of the U. S. maple industry. In particular, I discuss differences in policies for tapping on public land, property taxation, government resources devoted to the maple industry in research, extension, and promotion, and the effect of the Quebec Federation's quota and pricing system on market expansion...|$|E
40|$|Natural rubber plays a {{key role}} in the economies of many of the nations that have the climate and {{resources}} for growing and processing this valuable commodity. Among these countries is Sri Lanka, where rubber exports are one of the highest foreign exchange earners. The rubber therefore is an important agricultural crop to Sri Lanka, having around 151, 000 Ha of rubber plantation in it. Sri Lanka is the world's leading supplier of solid rubber tires. But Sri Lanka's rubber production has shown a declining trend since 1996 though Sri Lanka is bestowed with rich resources of natural rubber and other process materials as well as the availability in comparatively cheap labour. So it is obvious that there is a burning problem in the raw rubber industry and Researcher therefore made a hypothesis that there can be a major component missing in the whole supply chain of this industry and that would have been the technology component, which is more advanced in other countries. Researcher therefore made an effort to do a detailed study to check whether Sri Lanka is technologically lagging with compared to the Natural rubber processing state of art country by assessing the Technology status of Sri Lankan raw rubber industry. Having assessing the technology status, research was targeted to check the significance of technology status to the industry productivity, i. e. annual yield per hectare. For that researcher has integrated the APCTT model, 1988 - increasing degrees of sophistication of Technology components, and the framework for technology based development, technology content assessment developed by Asian and Pacific Center for Transfer of Technology (APCTT) - UN-ESCAP (1988) to assess the technology status of this industry. According to the model analysis, it can be concluded that technologically Sri Lankan raw. rubber industry is lagging behind to the technology status of global industry leaders like Malaysia, Thailand and India and that has resulted in a lower productivity of this industry. According to die statistical analysis, especially lower status of technology factors like Inforware, Orgaware and Humanware as well as non-technology factors like lower number of <b>tappable</b> trees per hectare have affected the Sri Lankan raw rubber industry productivity i. e. actual annual yield per hectare though there are hardly any relationship with the industry productivity and the status of technoware component. Factors affected to lower the status of each technology component was evaluated with the qualitative techniques like, SWOT analysis, value chain analysis and the cause an effect diagrams and found out that lower consideration on workforce and their education background as well as training and retraining facilities, bad management practices due to the poor Managerial competence, rigid organizational structure has become major drawbacks of this industry...|$|E

At on-station, rubber planted at a double rows spacing (6 m x 2 m x 14 m) with and without perennial intercrops was monitored and compared to that of the normal spacing (6 mx 3 m). Rubber girth with double row spacing reached <b>tappable</b> size at five years after planting and similar to that planted with normal spacing. Rubber growth at the plot planted with Acacia mangium a very fast growing tree, at the same time with rubber, was very slow: a haft of that of the other treatments. If the fast growing trees are planted two years after rubber planting, then rubber growth {{is similar to that of}} normal spacing. Three types of RAS were tested at farmers' plots (RAS 1, RAS 2, and RAS 3). The total number of participants is about 150 farmers, in 100 ha plots, distributed in Jambi, West Kalimantan, West Sumatra and South Sumatra. Results of clone comparison in RAS 1 type of trial (maintenance only on rubber rows) showed that rubber growth variability was more due to the variability of farmers' plots and frequencies of weeding. Rubber clones such as PB 260; RRIC 100 and BPM 1 planted under RAS 1 can adapt the RAS conditions and can be tapped at 5 - 7 years after planting. These findings provide farmers alternatives to develop more environmentally friendly and divers systems in their farms, compared to that of monoculture system.
