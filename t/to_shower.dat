5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|When {{the outer}} walls {{were built in}} the 13thcentury the main {{entrance}} was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for , and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.|$|E
5|$|Apu and his {{new wife}} Manjula invite Homer and Marge to their house for dinner. However, Apu and Manjula get in a fight, after Marge {{mentions}} to Manjula that Apu {{does not need to}} work as much as he does. The week before Valentine's Day, Apu tells Homer that he is disappointed that Manjula does not love him, until Homer assures him that Manjula will not leave him before Valentine's Day, and Apu agrees. Apu decides <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> Manjula with many romantic surprises to regain her love. However, although many of Apu's surprises succeed in fixing his marriage, they ruin other people's relationships. The rest of Springfield's women become jealous from all the attention Manjula is receiving, and find their men to be cheapskates (including Maude Flanders). At Moe's Tavern, Homer encourages several of Springfield's men that they have to prevent Apu and Manjula from reconciling to save their own relationships and marriages.|$|E

Modularization of High Energy Particle Physics event generation is becoming increasingly useful as the complexity of Monte Carlo programs grows. To accommodate this trend, several authors of popular Monte Carlo and matrix element programs attending the Physics at TeV Colliders Workshop in Les Houches, 2001 have agreed on a generic format for the transfer of parton level event configurations from matrix element event generators (MEG) <b>to</b> <b>showering</b> and hadronization event generators (SHG) ...|$|R

Fathers taking their young daughters or mothers taking their young sons into the gender-separated changing rooms is mostly viewed as non-controversial, although some public baths have introduced family changing rooms. Some private gymnasiums have instituted rules specifically banning {{family members of}} opposite genders taking their children into single-sex locker rooms.|$|E
25|$|A {{window cleaner}} observes a company president's affair with his secretary, {{who is the}} cleaner's {{daughter}} Ruriko. When he sees her throwing up in their house, he strips her and forces her <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> while scrubbing her, causing her to move out. While cleaning again, he watches her have stomach pains. He is next shown watching a new affair by the president while carrying a baby on his back.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the IRA's {{assassination}} campaign against prison officers, relations between the prisoners and prison officers were tense. In March 1978 some prisoners refused to leave their cells <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> or use the lavatory because of attacks by prison officers, and were provided with wash-hand basins in their cells. The prisoners requested showers be installed in their cells and when this request was turned down they refused to use the wash-hand basins.|$|E

25|$|Manville, New Jersey was hit {{nearly as}} hard, with record-breaking floods {{coming from the}} Raritan River and the nearby Millstone River, which join in Manville. Manville's {{flooding}} was also exacerbated by the Delaware-Raritan Canal, a section of which runs parallel to the Millstone River and, for a stretch, are only separated by several feet (a runner's path). Princeton University in Princeton, NJ, for several days declared municipal tap water unsafe to drink, advised students in dorms not <b>to</b> <b>shower,</b> and provided bottled drinking water.|$|E
25|$|A small police squad {{was sent}} out {{to break up the}} fighting, but upon {{reaching}} Centre Street, the gangs turned against the police, who were forced to retreat after several officers were injured. They made a second attempt, this time fighting their way into the mob, and arrested two men believed to be the leaders. The gangsters responded by storming into the low houses lining The Bowery and Bayard Street, forcing residents out, and climbed to the rooftops, where they proceeded <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> the Metropolitan officers with stones and brick bats until they fled from the area.|$|E
25|$|Most nudists and naturist clubs {{consider}} it essential {{for reasons of}} hygiene {{to sit on a}} towel whenever sitting on a chair, bench, or any other place where others might sit (unless under water) and they {{consider it}} poor etiquette to do otherwise. Some clubs encourage members or guests to bring their own chairs. Likewise, sitting on someone else's towel is considered a breach of etiquette. Similar rules may also apply to clothing-optional bike rides. Often in situations involving shared use of pools or tubs people are asked <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> first to minimize contamination and prolong the amount of time the water can be used before further maintenance is needed. This practice is also common in non-nudist pools.|$|E

25|$|On board, multi-course meals were {{designed}} by Continental's Congress of Chefs, beverages were selected by Continental's Wine Masters, and service was provided by flight attendants from separate International crew bases at Newark and Houston. Most flights had at least two meal services. Entertainment was offered at each individual seat, and passengers on Boeing 777 and 757 aircraft had access to a new Audio-Video On Demand system with touch-screen controls. 767 aircraft featured older, looped-video multi-channel entertainment systems, generally with a wider programming selection than Economy Class. 767 aircraft were expected to receive AVOD in the near future. Customers also were provided headphones, a large pillow, wool blanket, and amenity kit prior to departure. Upon arrival, BusinessFirst customers have access <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> facilities and arrival lounges at most airports.|$|E
25|$|Habitat for Humanity runs {{a year-round}} {{alternative}} break program known as Collegiate Challenge for student groups age16 to 25. Although summer, fall, and winter break trips are available, most participants go during their spring break. Collegiate Challenge participants travel to host sites throughout the United States and spend one week working {{in partnership with}} the local Habitat affiliate, the local community, and partner families to help eliminate poverty housing in the area. Host affiliates provide housing for the groups, as well as a place <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> and cook meals for the week. More than 14,000volunteers took part in Collegiate Challenge in 2011, {{making it one of the}} world's largest alternative break programs. Since its inception in 1989, nearly 240,000 students have participated in Collegiate Challenge and have donated more than $25 million to Habitat for Humanity affiliates.|$|E
25|$|As seen on Hart's documentary, Hart {{proceeded}} to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who pleaded {{that he knew}} nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged. McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, known as The Undertaker, furious with McMahon, banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told he had to apologize to Hart. As recounted in Michaels' autobiography, he was told by McMahon not to say anything about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on Raw and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart. Hart {{proceeded to}} the dressing room <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Remus had locked themselves in McMahon's office. When McMahon went to Hart's dressing room and tried to explain himself, Hart angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched. An altercation ensued, with Hart giving McMahon a single punch, dropping him to the floor. Although Vince's son, Shane McMahon, and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences. Hart angrily asked McMahon {{if he was going to}} screw him on the pay he was still owed, to which a groggy McMahon replied in the negative. In the hallway outside the dressing rooms, Hart's then-wife Julie angrily confronted Triple H and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart. McMahon had a black eye and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince off the floor and Vince rolling his ankle once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on WWE Confidential that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince's foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet immediately sprained his ankle and sent him back to the floor, from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco's action as a 'comedy.' Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the mounting criticism, an AIADMK party official said the media was distorting events and attempting to smear the party before the upcoming assembly elections; however, he promised the party would take strict action against those obstructing relief work. CPI (Marxist) leader U Vasuki said, [...] "The whole state is in crisis. This {{is not the right}} time <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> praise. Moreover, the state [...] has not done anything commendable to [...] praise [...] relief efforts. The timing of such propaganda is shocking." ...|$|E
500|$|In some rare exceptions, {{the curse}} is dropped. In an {{instance}} in the Mahabharata, where {{details of the}} seduction are absent, an agitated Gautama orders his son Chirakari to behead his [...] "polluted" [...] mother and leaves the ashram. However, Chirakari is hesitant to follow the order and later concludes that Ahalya is innocent. Gautama returns and repents his hasty decision, realising that Indra is the guilty party. In the Bhil Ramayana, Gautama attacks and imprisons Indra, who is freed when he promises <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> rain on the crops as the rain god. He must also ensure that {{one quarter of the}} crops is dedicated to Gautama. Here, Ahalya is interpreted as dry and burnt land, eager for the rains sent by Indra, who is tamed by the wild cyclonic Gautama.|$|E

500|$|Popular {{with his}} men, Collins was {{respected}} for {{his faith in}} his team mates {{and his ability to}} relate to different personalities. The Test leg-spinner, Arthur Mailey noted, [...] "I learnt more of the psychology of cricket from Collins from all the hundreds of cricketers I met." [...] Bert Oldfield said of Collins, [...] "He studied every player's temperament and acted accordingly." [...] Collins was undemonstrative, expecting his fieldsmen to look at him every after every delivery and adjust their position in response to his slight hand movements or even a bent finger. He was last <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> {{at the end of a}} day's play, preferring to sit in a corner in silence. His team mates assumed that he was contemplating the day's action and pondering on the next day's possibilities. He was a successful Test captain, leading Australia to five wins and two losses; four matches finished in draws.|$|E
500|$|The {{rail traffic}} on Polish railway lines was {{extremely}} dense. An average of 420 German military trains were passing through every 24 hours {{on top of}} internal traffic already in 1941. The Holocaust trains were routinely delayed en route; some transports took many days to arrive. Hundreds of prisoners died from exhaustion, suffocation and thirst while in transit to the camp in the overcrowded wagons. In extreme cases such as the Biała Podlaska transport of 6,000 Jews travelling only a [...] distance, up to 90 per cent of people were already dead when the sealed doors flew open. From September 1942 on, both Polish and foreign Jews were greeted with a brief verbal announcement. An earlier signboard with directions was removed because it was clearly insufficient.

500|$|The CSI {{effect may}} alter how crimes are committed. In 2000, {{the year that}} CSI: Crime Scene Investigation debuted, 46.9 percent of all rape cases in the United States were {{resolved}} by police. By 2005, the rate had fallen to 41.3 percent. [...] Some investigators attributed this decline to the CSI effect, as crime shows often explain in detail how criminals can conceal or destroy evidence. Several rape victims have reported that their assailants forced them <b>to</b> <b>shower</b> or clean themselves with bleach after their assaults. In December 2005, Jermaine McKinney broke into a home in Trumbull County, Ohio, where he murdered two women. [...] A fan of CSI, McKinney went to unusual lengths to remove evidence of his crime: he cleaned his hands with bleach, burned the bodies and his clothing, and attempted {{to dispose of the}} murder weapon in a lake. McKinney was eventually apprehended. Ray Peavy, head of the Los Angeles County homicide division, commented that, in addition to teaching criminals how to conceal evidence, crime shows may even [...] "encourage them when they see how simple it is to get away with [...] on television." ...|$|E
