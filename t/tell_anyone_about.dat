5|$|Both the Human {{fleet and}} the rebel Cylons are disillusioned after finding Earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, which {{occurred}} at least 2,000 {{years prior to}} the events of the episode. After research on the bodies found in the soil, the Cylons and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) conclude the remains are not Human, but Cylon in origin. The rebel Cylons further state the mechanical Cylon remains resemble older Centurions of theirs, but are of a kind unknown to them. Following this, they postulate that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of a different kind of Cylon which existed over 2,000 years ago and moved out from Kobol to populate Earth. When addressing the fleet, Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) never states this fact, leaving the fleet in the belief that the Thirteenth Tribe was human. Meanwhile, Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) and Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) receive memories showing that they had lived and died on Earth 2,000 years ago.

Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked {{in the middle of}} the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible.

50|$|The SLU {{was also}} {{expected}} to keep the recipient commander from <b>telling</b> <b>anyone</b> else <b>about</b> {{the origins of the}} message or acting too obviously on its contents.

40|$|Objective: {{intimate}} partner {{violence is}} a significant health problem. Fear of retaliation and shame may prevent women from <b>telling</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>about</b> the violence. This study investigated the prevalence of disclosure and police reporting of intimate partner violence {{during the first year}} postpartum. Design: a prospective longitudinal Swedish cohort study based on information from 2563 women who answered a postal questionnaire in early pregnancy and 12 months postpartum. Findings: of 52 women who had been exposed to violence by their partner during the first year postpartum, four (8 %) had filed a police report while 19 (37 %) had not told <b>anyone</b> <b>about</b> the violence. All single women in the study had disclosed the violence to a friend, a relative or filed a police report. Key conclusions: few women file a police report when they are being hit by their partner during the year after childbirth. Many women do not <b>tell</b> <b>anyone</b> that they have been hit. Implications for practice: these data may encourage health professionals to undertake sensitive questioning about violence, giving an opening for support...|$|R
25|$|Mark {{returns to}} Albert Square, a changed man. He is more caring and stable, having {{grown out of}} his rebellious stage.

Mark initially turns on his male counsellor, relaying his bitterness at being a potential AIDS victim, but later feels the benefits of the counselling. Mark loves Diane for keeping his secret and he asks her to marry him but she gently refuses and leaves Walford to live in France.|$|E

In the Aphrodite cabin, Piper is horrified {{to discover that the}} head councilor, Drew, is abusing her position as well as the rare gift of charmspeaking (which Piper also possesses) {{to take advantage of the}} other Aphrodite campers. In the Hephaestus cabin, it {{is revealed}} that Leo has the rare ability to conjure fire (a power that has not been seen for centuries), but does not use nor <b>tell</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>about</b> it out of guilt about his mother's death seven years prior. Meanwhile, Jason finds out about his sister Thalia Grace, a demigod daughter of Zeus and a Hunter of Artemis. Shortly thereafter, the three are given a quest to rescue Hera from danger. In the woods, Leo discovers a mechanical bronze dragon (made by the Hephaestus campers long ago) that he names Festus (Happy) and starts to repair him.

500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she <b>tells</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>about</b> the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape {{was the first time he}} touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".|$|R

He decides {{to stay in}} the car by himself to {{continue}} listening after they reach home and accidentally hits the gear shift, causing the car to move forward. Thinking he can drive, Stewie takes the car for a ride and is thrilled by the experience. He hears on the car radio a contest to win Justin Bieber concert tickets. Stewie calls the radio station on his cell phone but loses control of the car and crashes into a lamppost. (Herbert is heard on the radio winning the tickets.) Stewie takes the car home with the front of the vehicle completely destroyed. Brian discovers the damage and immediately blames Stewie, who tries to deny his involvement, but Brian points out that Stewie left Rupert in the car. Brian says he'll tell Peter and Lois, and Stewie cries. Afraid of being punished, Stewie runs away. He leaves a CD-ROM for Brian that details his plans. Stewie takes the bus to the airport, but disembarks in the wrong neighborhood. Consuela, the Griffin family's former maid, finds him and takes him home. Brian finds Stewie, and tells him that he did not <b>tell</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>about</b> the accident. They attempt to leave Consuela's home, but she insists on keeping Stewie as her own baby. Stewie steals a gun and shoots her in the foot, but says that he didn't want to hurt her because she had shown kindness to him in the past. Brian and Stewie return home.|$|E
500|$|At 4:30 p.m., Marj Saint and Pete Fleming's wife, Olive, {{were waiting}} for the call from Saint. Not {{receiving}} word at 4:30p.m. immediately caused his wife Marj to worry, but Marj and Olive did not <b>tell</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>about</b> the lack of communication until that evening. (To avoid interference, the entire mission had been kept a secret from all those not directly involved at the time, [...] thus making the timing of this announcement more difficult.) The next morning, January 9, Johnny Keenan flew to the camp site, and at 9:30a.m. he reported via radio to the wives that the plane was stripped of its fabric, and that the men were not there. The Commander in Chief of the Caribbean Command, Lieutenant General William K. Harrison, was contacted, and Quito-based radio station HCJB released a news bulletin saying that five men were missing in Huaorani territory. Soon, aircraft from the United States Air Rescue Service in Panama were flying over the jungle, and a ground search party consisting of missionaries and military personnel was organized. The first two of the bodies were found on Wednesday, January 11, and on Thursday, Ed McCully's body was identified by a group of Quechuas. They took his watch as evidence of the finding but did not move his body from its location {{on the bank of the}} Curaray; it later washed away. [...] Two more bodies were found on January 12. The searchers hoped that one of the unidentified bodies would be McCully, thinking that perhaps one of the men had escaped. However, on January 13, all four of the bodies found were positively identified by watches and wedding rings, and McCully's body was not among them, confirming that all five were dead. In the midst of a tropical storm, they were buried in a common grave at Palm Beach on January 14 by members of the ground search party.|$|E
