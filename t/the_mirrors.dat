5|$|In fish {{such as the}} herring which live in {{shallower}} water, <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> must {{reflect a}} mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks {{with a range of}} different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The cephalopods, including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.|$|E
5|$|Roget and Yerchael {{join forces}} with Belgar, the Oracle of Shadows from the holy city of Wendel, who discovers that Anise is hoping to use the dark energy from <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> to turn herself into a goddess. Roget and his allies journey to the Mirage Castle to confront Anise, only for her to finish pulling the dark energy from <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> before they can stop her. The dark energy kills Inath and the Mirage Bishop, and Anise {{combines}} her form with a possessed Peddan general to create the Goddess of Doom. The allied forces fight and defeat the Goddess, ending the threat from Pedda, and return to their home countries.|$|E
5|$|An artist from Pennsylvania recreated {{the upper}} outside panels {{in the style}} of the carousels of the period around the time of World War I. The carvings on the panels were {{provided}} by Allen and Rita Orre of Ohio and the International Amusement Devices Company of Ohio; <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> were produced by an Indianapolis glass firm. The scenery panels were initially some discovered Dentzel company panels, and these were used in 1976 and 1977 while replica Mangels-Illions-style panels were built in the museum's shops.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>the</b> film <b>Mirror</b> <b>Mirror,</b> {{elements}} of <b>the</b> Magic <b>Mirror</b> are featured {{as a large}} mirror {{that serves as a}} portal to <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> House where Queen Clementianna consults with <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> Queen (played by Lisa Roberts Gillian). To access the portal to <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> House, Queen Clementianna would quote [...] "Mirror <b>Mirror</b> on <b>the</b> Wall." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> Queen would always advise Queen Clementianna not to use dark magic for her own gain.

2500|$|After <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is {{polished}} out it {{is placed}} vertically in a stand. The Foucault tester {{is set up}} at a distance close to <b>the</b> <b>mirror's</b> radius of curvature. The tester is adjusted so that the returning beam from the pinhole light source is interrupted by the knife edge. Viewing <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> from behind <b>the</b> knife edge shows a pattern on <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> surface. If <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> surface {{is part of a}} perfect sphere, <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> appears evenly lighted across the entire surface. If <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is spherical but with defects such as bumps or depressions, the defects appear greatly magnified in height. [...] If the surface is paraboloidal, <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> looks like a doughnut or lozenge. It is possible to calculate how closely <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> surface resembles a perfect paraboloid by placing a special mask over <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and taking a series of measurements with the tester. This data is then reduced and graphed against an ideal parabolic curve.|$|R

5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. <b>The</b> <b>mirrors</b> of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are {{coated with}} a layer of iridium 60nm thick. Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the rest}} of Italy, the finest and most {{decorated}} rooms were those on the piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery of Mirrors in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 17). This room with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
25|$|A {{plane mirror}} forms a virtual image {{positioned}} behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Although <b>the</b> rays of light {{seem to come}} from behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> light from <b>the</b> source only exists in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> image in a plane mirror is not magnified (that is, the image is {{the same size as}} the object) and appears to be as far behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as <b>the</b> object is in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|R
50|$|Looking {{through a}} mirror from {{different}} positions (but necessarily {{with the point}} of observation restricted to the halfspace {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>mirror)</b> is like looking at <b>the</b> 3D <b>mirror</b> image of space; without further <b>mirrors</b> only <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image of <b>the</b> halfspace before <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is relevant; if there is another <b>mirror,</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image of <b>the</b> other halfspace is too.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} about a girl name Nasrin who suffers disfiguring {{injuries}} in a car crash. Her mother discovers an antique <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mirror</b> is not an ordinary mirror; a spirit trapped inside it makes <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> able to reflect what Nasrin wants to see. Nasrin becomes obsessed with <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> On a quest to regain her past beauty, Nasrin submits herself to <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> spirit by satisfying <b>the</b> <b>mirror’s</b> need for blood and revenge.|$|R
5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between <b>the</b> <b>mirrors.</b> This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E
5|$|They soon {{learn that}} the king of Pedda and Roget's {{childhood}} friend, Inath, has been driven mad and is launching Operation Psi {{with the aim of}} taking over the world. Roget and Yerchael journey to the other nations in order to help stop the Peddan army. They join forces with the rulers and warriors of several countries, including the defeated Amazons of Laurent, the rebels of Nevarla, which has allied itself with Pedda, and the warriors of Valsena and Altena. As they fight the Peddan army, they discover that Inath is installing Black Mirrors in the conquered kingdoms, which are corrupting those around them. Roget and Yurchael are joined in their quest by the elemental spirits, which are concerned about <b>the</b> <b>mirrors.</b> After confronting Roget's twin brother, the Mirage Bishop, they discover that Inath and the Mirage Bishop have been corrupted by the ancient witch Anise, who is planting <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> in order to summon a dark energy for her own power.|$|E
5|$|Attached to {{the dome}} is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside the dome, {{which means the}} environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel {{large enough to accommodate}} <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> from any other telescope on the mountain. As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E
50|$|The {{woman is}} located offset {{to the left}} {{relative}} to the center line of the image, whereas <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is on <b>the</b> right. <b>The</b> oval <b>mirror</b> with <b>the</b> wooden frame <b>mirrors</b> so as to face viewed approximately {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mirror</b> has a size so that only the top portion of the woman's breasts seen.

50|$|In the 2013 SyFy film The Hunters, it is {{revealed}} that <b>the</b> Magic <b>Mirror</b> {{was inspired by}} a fabled mirror that is said to grant the wish of whoever looks into it; supposedly, <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> triggered <b>the</b> Dark Ages. <b>The</b> <b>mirror</b> was sought by an ancient army known as the Krugen before the hunters- a group of scientist knights dedicated to protecting fairy-tale artefacts- acquired <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> breaking off four shards from <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and hiding them and <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> away when destroying it completely proved impossible. The film focuses on a family of hunters, the Flynns, with the parents being experienced hunters seeking the shards to keep them away from the Krugen and their sons being forced to take up the hunt when their parents go missing. <b>The</b> <b>mirror</b> is eventually reassembled by the film's antagonist, but he is tricked into making a wish that caused <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> to destroy him, with the protagonists subsequently wishing for <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> to destroy itself.|$|R

5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E
5|$|The marine hatchetfish is {{extremely}} flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, {{and the body}} is so silvery as to resemble aluminium foil. <b>The</b> <b>mirrors</b> consist of microscopic structures {{similar to those used}} to provide structural coloration: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of guanine spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> of <b>the</b> Month, {{better known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Mirror,</b> was a popular Pakistani social {{magazine}} which ran from 1951 to 1972.

50|$|In contrast, the {{dew point}} {{measurement}} is considerably more complex. The original dew point sensor deployed on ASOS systems utilized a chilled mirror that is cooled {{to the point where}} a fine film of condensation forms on <b>the</b> <b>mirror's</b> surface. <b>The</b> temperature of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> at this condition is equal to {{the dew point}} temperature. The hygrometer measures the dew point by directing a light beam from a small infrared diode to the surface of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> at an angle of 45 degrees. Two photo transistors are mounted so they measure a high degree of reflected light when <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is clear (direct) and scattered light when <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is clouded with visible condensation (indirect). With the formation of condensation on <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> <b>the</b> degree of cloudiness of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> surface increases with the direct transistor receiving less light and the indirect transistor more light. The output from these photo transistors controls <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> cooling module which is an electronic heat pump that operates much like a thermocouple in reverse, producing a heating or cooling effect. When the sensor is first activated, <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is clear. As <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> surface temperature is cooled to the dew point temperature, condensations forms on <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> electronics continuously tries to stabilize the signal levels to the power amplifier to maintain <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> temperature at <b>the</b> dew point. If the dew point of the air changes or if the circuit is disturbed by noise, the loop makes the necessary corrections to restabilize at the dew point and maintaining continuous operation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> 16 is a {{class of}} sailing dinghy which was {{sponsored}} by <b>the</b> Daily <b>Mirror</b> newspaper in 1963 and the design project was headed by Jack Holt.

The concept was a relatively light dinghy with a large sail area that could easily be reefed. The main sail was designed for slab reefing and the large genoa had roller reefing. <b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> 16, like <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> 11, was produced with distinctive red sails. <b>The</b> <b>Mirror</b> 16 was faster than the Proctor-designed Wayfarer.|$|R
25|$|A polychoric {{group is}} one of five {{symmetry}} groups of the 4-dimensional regular polytopes. There are also three polyhedral prismatic groups, and an infinite set of duoprismatic groups. Each group defined by a Goursat tetrahedron fundamental domain bounded by mirror planes. The dihedral angles between <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> determine order of dihedral symmetry. The Coxeter–Dynkin diagram is a graph where nodes represent mirror planes, and edges are called branches, and labeled by their dihedral angle order between <b>the</b> <b>mirrors.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} dark matter {{candidates}} in a visible heavy QCD axion model. There, a mirror copied {{sector of the}} Standard Model with mass scales larger than the Standard Model is introduced. By larger mass scales of <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> sector, <b>the</b> QCD axion is made heavy via the axial anomaly in <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> sector without spoiling the Peccei-Quinn mechanism to solve the strong $CP$-problem. Since <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> copied sector possesses the same symmetry structure with the Standard Model sector, the model predicts multiple stable particles. As we will show, <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> charged pion and <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> electron can be viable candidates for dark matter. They serve as self-interacting dark matter with a long range force. We also show that <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> neutron can be lighter than <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> proton in a certain parameter region. There, <b>the</b> <b>mirrored</b> neutron {{can also be a}} viable dark matter candidate when its mass is around $ 100 $ TeV.

50|$|Current {{crowding}} near <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> {{area can}} be avoided by prevention of injecting charge carriers near <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> region. This is achieved by depositing the electrodes away from <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> at least several carrier diffusion distances.|$|R
50|$|If {{we look at}} {{an object}} that is {{effectively}} two-dimensional (such as writing) and then turn it towards a <b>mirror,</b> <b>the</b> object turns through an angle of 180º and we see a left-right reversal in <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> In this example, it is the change in orientation rather than <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> itself that causes the observed reversal. Another example is when we stand with our backs to <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and face an object that's in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Then we compare the object with its reflection by turning ourselves 180º, towards <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Again we perceive a left-right reversal due {{to a change in}} orientation. So, in these examples <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> does not actually cause the observed reversals.|$|R
25|$|There exist both continuous-wave and pulsed OPOs. The {{latter are}} easier to build, since the high {{intensity}} lasts only for {{a tiny fraction of}} a second, which damages the nonlinear optical material and <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> less than a continuous high intensity.|$|E
25|$|Solar Reserve (Tonopah, Nevada) 2014 {{features}} a simulated landscape showing computer-generated {{images of a}} solar thermal power plant in Nevada, whose central tower is surrounded by 10,000 mirrors which reflect sunlight onto it to heat salt to high temperatures, forming a thermal battery {{which is used to}} generate electricity. Over the course of a 365-day year, the work replicates the movements of the sun, moon, and stars across the sky as they would appear at the Nevada site. <b>The</b> <b>mirrors</b> adjust their positions in real time according to the position of the sun. Over a 24-hour period the virtual camera view of the tower shifts, following the movement of <b>the</b> <b>mirrors,</b> from ground level to an overhead satellite view.|$|E
25|$|During {{the day the}} sun has {{different}} positions. For low concentration systems (and low temperatures) tracking can be avoided (or limited to a few positions per year) if nonimaging optics are used. For higher concentrations, however, if <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> or lenses do not move, then the focus of <b>the</b> <b>mirrors</b> or lenses changes (but also in these cases nonimaging optics provides the widest acceptance angles for a given concentration). Therefore, it seems unavoidable {{that there needs to}} be a tracking system that follows the position of the sun (for solar photovoltaic a solar tracker is only optional). The tracking system increases the cost and complexity. With this in mind, different designs can be distinguished in how they concentrate the light and track the position of the sun.|$|E
50|$|A mirror {{does not}} just produce {{an image of}} what would be there without it; it also changes the light {{distribution}} in the halfspace in front of and behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> A <b>mirror</b> hanging on <b>the</b> wall makes the room brighter because additional light sources appear in <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image. However, <b>the</b> appearance of additional light does not violate the conservation of energy principle, because some light no longer reaches behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> simply re-directs <b>the</b> light energy. In terms of the light distribution, <b>the</b> virtual <b>mirror</b> image has <b>the</b> same appearance and the same effect as a real, symmetrically arranged half-space behind a window (instead of <b>the</b> <b>mirror).</b> Shadows may extend from <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> into <b>the</b> halfspace before it, and vice versa.|$|R
