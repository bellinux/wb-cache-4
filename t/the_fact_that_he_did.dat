5|$|His first post upon {{returning}} to his home country was an advisory position with the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) in Ottawa, where he battled Canada's private broadcasters, especially CTV, over new Canadian content regulations. This lasted {{for only a few}} months, before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner, the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada, returning to the same institution for which he had worked in the 1940s. In this role, he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not speak French, {{at a time when the}} NFB's French Program branch was attracting young Quebec nationalist filmmakers. Some staff members also felt that he had been away from the NFB for too long, while the filmmaker Denys Arcand felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E

By 1930 Taylor had experienced severe financial difficulties from bad investments (including self-publishing his autobiography), the stock market crash, and businesses that proved unsuccessful.

25|$|The {{question}} whether William {{had a hand}} in the murder of the De-Witt brothers will always remain unanswered, like his exact role in the later Massacre of Glencoe. The fact that he ordered the withdrawal of a federal cavalry detachment, that otherwise might have prevented the lynching, has always raised eyebrows, however, like <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not prosecute the well-known ringleaders like Cornelis Tromp and his relative, Johan Kievit, the Buat conspirator, who now was appointed pensionary of Rotterdam, and even advanced their careers. But maybe firm measures against the conspirators were not feasible in the political climate of those fraught days in the Fall of 1672.|$|E

25|$|Yonge soon was at sea again. During {{this period}} he {{undertook}} several voyages with the Newfoundland fisheries. The first was in May 1663 when aged 16, he took {{passage in the}} ship Reformation. Yonge spent time on land and used to walk between settlements, making sketches and observations on the industry. In January 1666, during the Second Dutch War, his ship, the Bonaventure was captured by the Dutch and he was shackled together with other prisoners, for fifty one days. (The biography of the Victorian writer Charlotte Yonge by Christabel Coleridge refers to Yonge being a galley slave of the Moors, possibly conflating {{the time he was}} a Dutch prisoner with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> serve off Algiers whilst in the Navy.) In September 1666 he was exchanged for a relative of the secretary of the Dutch Admiralty, who was a prisoner at Harwich.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his record}} of reforms, Democratic party leaders were largely displeased with Blackburn and his administration. They decried his {{record number of}} pardons and resented <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not give more {{consideration}} to party service and loyalty when appointing individuals to state jobs. Further, state newspapers noted a lack of eloquence by the governor, and this provided additional fodder for Blackburn's critics. Having announced {{at the beginning of}} his term that he would seek no further political office, Blackburn nonetheless attempted to defend his record in a speech at the 1883 Democratic nominating convention, but boos and shouts for him to sit down almost drowned out the address. Finally, Blackburn responded to the heckling by saying he expected to be criticized for his reforms, but that anyone who charged his administration with corruption was a [...] "liar—a base and infamous liar". At this, the clamor from the crowd became deafening, and Blackburn was forced to end his address and take his seat.|$|E
500|$|Brandon Teena was a trans {{man who was}} gang {{raped and}} murdered by two male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, {{at the time a}} Columbia University film student, became {{interested}} in the case after reading a 1994 Village Voice article by Donna Minkowitz. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon's life and death; she said, [...] "the minute I read about Brandon, I fell in love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it with no role models. The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me." [...] The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon's life as part of what eventually causes his death. [...] She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.|$|E
500|$|On March 4, 2008, Favre {{formally}} {{announced his}} retirement. Although Favre {{stated that he}} had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another Super Bowl victory. He added the chances for a Super Bowl win were small, and that he was not up for the challenge. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, {{had nothing to do with}} what the Packers did or didn't do. Seeming to contradict statements made by his agent, Bus Cook, Favre said that his decision to retire was based on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to play anymore.

500|$|At the film's release at the Sundance Film Festival, {{film critic}} Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News {{compared}} {{the effect of}} Reservoir Dogs {{to that of the}} 1895 film L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat, whereby audiences supposedly saw a moving train approaching the camera and ducked. Bernard said that Reservoir Dogs had a similar effect and people were not ready for it. Vincent Canby of The New York Times enjoyed the cast and the usage of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino's directing and liked <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not often use close-ups in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times also enjoyed the film and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said [...] "Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect." [...] Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino's dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the film on its [...] "deadpan sense of humor".|$|E
500|$|Kiprusoff again {{declined}} {{an invitation}} {{to play at the}} 2006 Winter Olympics, citing the need to rest a hip injury. His announcement generated considerable controversy in Finland, where <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not miss a game with the Flames due to the injury led some to question if he was injured at all. [...] Country-mate Teemu Selänne questioned the goaltender's lack of interest in playing for the national team, a comment that stung Kiprusoff. When considered to play for the Finns at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Kiprusoff said he would join the team, but only if he felt healthy and if he was named the starting goaltender for the team. Kiprusoff was named the starter and allowed only four goals in his team's first four games, leading the Finns to a semifinal game against the United States. The Americans blitzed Kiprusoff early in the game, as he gave up four goals on just seven shots in the first minutes of the game before being replaced in net by Niklas Bäckström. He returned to the net for the bronze medal game, however, leading Finland to a 5–3 victory.|$|E
500|$|In June 1942, the US Army {{established}} the Manhattan Engineer District to handle its {{part in the}} atom bomb project, beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the Office of Scientific Research and Development to the military. In September, Groves was appointed director of {{what became known as}} the Manhattan Project. Groves selected Oppenheimer to head the project's secret weapons laboratory, a choice which surprised many, as Oppenheimer had left-wing political views, and no record as a leader of large projects. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have a Nobel Prize, and might not have the prestige to direct fellow scientists, did concern Groves. However, he was impressed by Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of designing and constructing an atomic bomb, and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a military engineer, Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics, but chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance and engineering. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an [...] "overweening ambition" [...] that Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion. Isidor Rabi considered the appointment [...] "a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to be a genius".|$|E

500|$|Zack did {{not exist}} in the {{original}} scenario of Final Fantasy VII, but was created only when scenario writer Kazushige Nojima decided to add some mystery to the plot, most notably in relation to Cloud Strife's background. Nojima had always planned for Cloud Strife's memories of his life to be proven false as the game went on, but he had not decided on how to implement this until he hit on the character of Zack. Nojima also used Zack to link Cloud and Aerith Gainsborough, as Aerith had seen something of Zack in Cloud. Zack was Aerith's first boyfriend, thus creating an emotional connection between herself and Cloud, because he reminds her of him. Originally, the role of her first boyfriend was to have been fulfilled by the game's antagonist Sephiroth. As the game continued in its development, Nojima worked out the mysteries regarding Zack and Cloud, which led to some of the scenes in the game needing revision. Director Yoshinori Kitase was surprised by the revelation of Cloud's and Zack's connection, as until the later stages of development, even he did not know about Zack. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura got the request to design Zack when Final Fantasy VII was reaching the end of development. Prior to the late addition of Zack, Nojima had asked the staff to add details to some scenes so as to give clues about him, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not reveal to the staff Zack's existence until later.|$|E

He {{also noted that}} parts of the episode were [...] "surprising", and that [...] "the show embraced some final insanity before the end, it’s more the illusion of depth than actual depth". Handlen wrote that [...] "it’s hard to ask for more from an hour of television", despite noting that he was [...] "glad the series got cancelled". Handlen noted that he would [...] "look forward to their next projects". Handlen concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of [...] "B". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a positive review and claimed {{that there were some}} [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] scenes in the episode. Fowler also opined that the episode was [...] "thrilling", [...] "frustrating", [...] "fascinating", and [...] "terrible" [...] to see Hannah [...] "crying over an arrested Britten". Fowler wrote that he [...] "love the open ending". Noting that Awake was [...] "one of the good ones", Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9.5 out of 10" [...] classifying it as [...] "amazing". Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic gave the episode a positive review. He opined that Michael [...] "has a unique ability to dream in a way that feels real, why not recreate what was once lost". McHatton found it [...] "fitting that the show ended with Michael closing his eyes. Despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know what the phrase [...] "turtles all the way down" [...] meant, he concluded his review by giving the episode a score [...] "5.0 out of 5.0".|$|E
500|$|Hechicero was one {{of sixteen}} wrestlers {{given a chance to}} compete in the 2014 En Busca de un Ídolo ("In search of an idol") tournament. The En Busca de un Ídolo tournament {{featured}} younger wrestlers, mostly low-to-mid-card wrestlers where they were given an opportunity to showcase their wrestling skills on a national scale. As part of the tournament each wrestler would earn points from the outcome of their matches, feedback from a panel of judges and a weekly online poll. Hechicero was one eight wrestlers to qualify as he survived a Torneo cibernetico elimination match along with Cavernario, Chachorro, Dragon Lee Guerrero Negro, Jr., Soberano, Jr., Star Jr., and Super Halcón, Jr. Hechicero ended up on the team being coached by Virus each week, with coaching focusing not just on the actual wrestling but also how to play their characters in the ring, interact with the fans and so on. During the weekly judging Hechicero received praise for his in-ring skills but also got several comments on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not wrestle a very rudo style and needed to be more aggressive in the ring, something he tried to incorporate from week to week. After the first round Hechicero won almost every single weekly online poll, propelling him {{to the top of the}} ranking at the end with a total of 565 points, 114 more than the second place Cavernario. In the week between the first and the second round Hechicero teamed up with Virus and Cachorro to defeat Negro Casas, Cavernario and Dragon Lee on the May 23 Super Viernes show. In the second round Hechicero lost to Cavernario but defeated both Dragon Lee and Cachorro to earn a total of 250 points, including the majority of the online poll votes. The point score qualified Hechicero for the finals against Cavernario. In the final Cavernario defeated Hechicero two falls to one to win the tournament. The following week all eight [...] "Busca" [...] competitors two trainers faced off in a torneo cibernetico elimination match that saw Negro Casas eliminate Virus as the last man to win the match, Hechicero was eliminated as the sixth man by as he and Cavernario pinned each other at the same time. In the weeks following the En Busca de un Ídolo finals Hechicero began teaming with Mephisto and Ephesto for a couple of shows, possibly signaling that CMLL had plans to make them a trio after Mephisto and Ephesto's regular partner Averno had left CMLL. Later when Mephisto and Ephesto were announced as teaming with El Hombre Sin Nombre ("The Man with No Name") there was initial confusion if that meant Hechicero was being given a new ring identify, but once El Hombre Sin Nombre made his debut, it was obvious that the physical appearance and wrestling style did not match Hechicero. On the October 10, 2014 Super Viernes show Hechicero debuted a new look, including a new mask design and trunks in black with gold or red embellishment. As part of his image makeover Hechicero began carrying a bowl that burned with red flames as part of his entrance rituals. At ringside Hechicero often touches and sometimes scoops out the flames from the bowl without hurting his hands.|$|E
