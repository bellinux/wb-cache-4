5|$|Responsibility for the {{shooting}} in Maribor was never conclusively established. Austrian sources attributed blame to Rudolf Maister, and referenced {{him in some}} accounts as <b>the</b> <b>Butcher</b> of Maribor. In Slovenia, by contrast, Maister remains well-regarded; numerous societies institutions and streets are named in his honour and he is commemorated in several monuments.|$|E

She competed with Mexican children for the preferred pieces of meat while <b>the</b> <b>butchers</b> laughed at them. At one point, she told her father that she didn't want to continue going because they were making fun of her but her father told her to be grateful that <b>the</b> <b>butchers</b> threw out <b>the</b> meat, or else they would starve.|$|R
5|$|Also {{introduced}} {{in this volume}} were Cutts <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> (originally Sanzot from the French sans os ("without bones")) and the Bordurian chief of secret police Colonel Sponsz, whose name {{is derived from the}} Brussels dialect term for a sponge (éponge in French). Hergé used his brother, Paul Remi, as the model for Sponsz, although he was also influenced by the image of the Austrian American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim.|$|E
5|$|Although {{cartoonist}} Danny Antonucci {{began his}} career by working as an animator on various children's series for Hanna-Barbera, his later solo works were edgy and aimed at adult audiences. He gained notoriety with the 1987 short film Lupo <b>the</b> <b>Butcher</b> and then, after founding his own production studio, a.k.a. Cartoon in 1994, created the series The Brothers Grunt for MTV. It was quickly cancelled, however, upon being met with generally poor reviews.|$|E
5|$|Danny Antonucci, a {{cartoonist}} {{known for}} his edgy adult work such as Lupo <b>the</b> <b>Butcher</b> and The Brothers Grunt, was dared by someone to prouduce a children's cartoon. In 1996, Antonucci pitched Ed, Edd n Eddy, which he conceived while designing a commercial, to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. After Cartoon Network agreed to give Antonucci creative control over the show, the series went into production and premiered its first season on January 4, 1999.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Peggy was romantically paired {{on-screen}} {{with the}} character Frank Butcher. Their coupling was part of producer Matthew Robinson's plan to place {{the focus of the}} soap back on to <b>the</b> <b>Butcher</b> and Mitchell families, while various other long-running characters were axed following a decline in ratings. The soap was attracting 15.74 million viewers in May 1998, as opposed to rival soap Coronation Street's 16 million.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recurring}} characters include Nestor the butler, Chang {{the loyal}} Chinese boy, Rastapopoulos the criminal mastermind, Jolyon Wagg the infuriating (to Haddock) insurance salesman, General Alcazar the South American freedom fighter and President of San Theodoros, Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab the Arab emir, Abdullah his mischievous son, Dr. Müller the evil German psychiatrist, Oliveira da Figueira the friendly Portuguese salesman, Cutts <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> whose {{phone number is}} repeatedly confused with Haddock's, and Allan the henchman of Rastapopoulos and formerly Haddock's first mate.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>butcher</b> Allen of Mayfair {{was founded}} in a shop on Mount Street in 1830. It {{was one of the}} most {{well-known}} butchers in London and held a Royal warrant of appointment to supply meat to the Queen, as well as supplying several high-profile restaurants in the area. Following spiralling debts, it was sold to Rare Butchers of Distinction in 2006. The Mayfair premises closed in 2015, but the company retains an online presence.|$|E
40|$|Zoonotic {{diseases}} {{present an}} ongoing public health concern. Most human infections with zoonoses come from livestock, including pigs, chickens, cattle, goats, sheep and camels. <b>Butchers</b> constitute <b>the</b> high risk {{group in the}} transmission of zoonotic diseases. The educational status and awareness regarding the information, identification and transmission of zoonotic diseases among this high risk group, is critical in controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases. Hence, a study {{has been designed to}} evaluate the educational status, awareness among <b>the</b> <b>butchers</b> regarding <b>the</b> various zoonotic diseases and their modes of transmission and the effluent treatment methods followed by <b>the</b> <b>butchers</b> in and around Proddatur, Andhra Pradesh. The survey revealed that 86 percent of <b>the</b> <b>butchers</b> had high school education and most of them acquired this profession from their ancestors. 60 percent of <b>the</b> <b>butchers</b> were having awareness regarding the commonly occurring zoonotic diseases, 81 percent of <b>butchers</b> identified <b>the</b> disease by observing the lesions and were familiar with their control. Some of <b>the</b> <b>butchers</b> follow <b>the</b> hygienic practices and majority of them (81. 4 %) were interested in attending training programmes pertaining to zoonotic diseases...|$|R

5|$|Driving past Silent Hill as a shortcut, Travis swerves {{his truck}} to avoid hitting a spirit manifestation of Alessa. While {{following}} the spirit manifestation, he stumbles upon a burning house and rescues the real Alessa, who was immolated in a ritual to impregnate {{her with the}} cult's god. Losing consciousness outside the house, he awakens in the town and resolves to learn if she survived. During his journey, Travis unlocks his repressed childhood memories and defeats monstrous forms of his parents: {{his mother had been}} committed to a local mental institution after attempting to kill him, and his father had killed himself, unable to live with the guilt of having his wife condemned. Additionally, Travis kills <b>the</b> <b>Butcher,</b> a monster that has been slaughtering other monsters.|$|E
5|$|As an {{animator}} {{of various}} Hanna-Barbera children's cartoons, Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci was bothered {{by people who}} thought that animation was only for children, prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as Lupo <b>the</b> <b>Butcher</b> and The Brothers Grunt. Antonucci was later dared to produce a children's cartoon and accepted the challenge. Antonucci drew the Eds while designing a commercial. Impressed, he spent months designing the show and then faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network (CN) and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both responded quickly with high interest, but demanded creative control, to which Antonucci refused. After CN agreed to let Antonucci have creative control, a deal was made that his studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce the series. The show entered production in 1997, making it Cartoon Network's first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Hanna-Barbera, {{as well as the}} first to by-pass a seven-minute short.|$|E
5|$|Enemies of the Association soon fought back. George Henderson, {{the range}} detective who had pinned Ella Watson, {{was murdered by}} rustlers near Sweetwater Creek in October 1890, an obvious taunt to the Association. The cattle barons soon {{tightened}} their control and hunted down those who tried to oppose them. The double lynching of the Averells {{was followed by the}} lynching of Tom Waggoner, a horse trader from Newcastle, in June 1891. A friend of Waggoner named Jimmy <b>the</b> <b>Butcher,</b> who was once arrested for rustling the Standard Cattle Company, was also murdered. Range detective Tom Smith killed a suspected rustler, and when he was indicted for murder, political connections of the Association secured his release. These killings would precipitate more hostilities and violence in the years to come.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{previous}} volume, Explorers on the Moon, The Calculus Affair was created {{with the aid}} of the Hergé's team of artists at Studios Hergé. The story reflected the Cold War tensions that Europe was experiencing during the 1950s, and introduced three recurring characters into the series: Jolyon Wagg, Cutts <b>the</b> <b>Butcher,</b> and Colonel Sponsz. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Red Sea Sharks, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Calculus Affair was critically well-received, with various commentators having described it {{as one of the best}} Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

The village metalsmith, Horst, equips his sons along with Roran with equipment. Roran takes a hammer and attacks the soldiers. The Ra'zac {{and most of the}} soldiers escape, saying that they want information from Roran. The entire village then sets up defenses, and during a second invasion, the Ra'zac escape again.

Taunting the boy, Joffrey draws his sword and demands a duel, under pretext of punishing him for accidentally hitting Arya, {{a member of the}} nobility. Mycah and Arya desperately explain that she asked him to spar with her so she could practice. As Joffrey savors <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> boy's pain and fear, Arya hits Joffrey while her friend flees. Enraged, Joffrey turns on Arya and is about to strike her with his sword when her direwolf Nymeria bites his wrist.

5|$|The {{population}} of Imerina was governed through {{a mixture of}} traditional practices and innovative measures. While all land technically belonged to the sovereign, its administration {{was carried out by}} andriana who were assigned a menakely (subdivision of land) to govern. These administrators were themselves overseen by roving royal advisers. The land was cultivated by commoners, who were given a parcel to farm based {{on the size of the}} family it was meant to feed, and each family paid taxes to the king in return. Andrianampoinimerina passed laws giving children the right to claim meat from <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> that had not been sold by the day's end, and allowing the poor to eat cassava from others' fields, provided they took only what they could cook and consume on the spot. In this way, the basic nutritional needs of most citizens were met.|$|E
5|$|Wesley {{attacks the}} base using {{explosive}} rats (a tactic {{he learned from}} the Exterminator), killing surviving Fraternity assassins,including The Repairman and <b>the</b> <b>Butcher</b> (who he kills in a knife fight) in a massive shootout. Entering Sloan's office, he is surrounded by Fox, Gunsmith and the remaining assassins. Wesley discloses Sloan's deception, to which Sloan reveals that {{the names of those}} present had legitimately come up in the Loom, and that he had acted to protect them. He gives the members a choice: kill themselves, per the code, or kill Wesley and use their skills to control the world. As the others choose the latter, Fox curves a bullet around the room, choosing to follow the code and kill everyone, including herself, but not before throwing her gun to Wesley. Sloan escapes in the mayhem.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, Rickard and Australian wrestling {{promoter}} Jim Barnett {{managed to}} attract foreign stars back to the Pacific. American wrestlers frequently toured New Zealand as well and were well received by the public. In 1972, Big Bad John, Bulldog Brower, Les Wolff, King Curtis Iaukea, Spiros Arion, Mark Lewin, Thunderbolt Patterson, Sweet Daddy Siki, Tarzan Tyler, Dewey Robertson and Haystacks Calhoun all toured New Zealand. Calhoun and his wife in particular made numerous television appearances, press interviews and visited schools. The debut of Rickard's On the Mat during this period, a counterpart of Britain's World of Sport, replaced the once popular radio broadcasts and showcased many New Zealand and international stars including Pat Barrett, The Destroyer, Man Mountain Link, Les Thornton, Leo Burke, Ripper Collins, Rick Martel, Tiger Jeet Singh, Ali Vizeri, Abdullah <b>the</b> <b>Butcher,</b> and Siva Afi. Afi's tournament victory over John DaSilva in 1978 marked the first time a Samoan wrestler won a New Zealand championship on New Zealand television, and the first to hold the national title since 1964; An official member of the NWA since 1972, the NWA World title was also defended in Rickard's promotion. Peter Maivia nearly won the NWA World title from then-champion Harley Race in 1979. This title changed hands between Ric Flair and Harley Race in Wellington, New Zealand and Geylang, Singapore in 1984 but these would not be acknowledged by the NWA for several years.|$|E
