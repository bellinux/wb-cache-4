25|$|For geographical, {{historical}} and economic reasons, differences exist internationally regarding use {{and extent of}} public transport. While countries in the Old World tend to have extensive and frequent systems serving their old and dense cities, many cities of the New World have more sprawl and much less comprehensive public transport. The International Association of Public Transport (UITP) is the international network for public transport authorities and operators, policy decision-makers, scientific institutes and the public <b>transport</b> <b>supply</b> and service industry. It has 3,400 members from 92 countries.|$|E

During the assault on Anzio in January 1944, it patrolled the beaches and protected convoys. It aided the Allied offensive in Italy during May 1944, receiving another DUC during the Battle of Monte Cassino for action from 12 to 14 May when the group bombed an enemy position on Monastery Hill, attacked troops massing on the hill for counterattack, and hit a nearby stronghold to force the surrender of an enemy garrison.|$|E
500|$|Hardman was {{promoted}} temporary air commodore on 1October 1944, and substantive group captain on 1December. He {{was assigned to}} Air Command South East Asia (ACSEA) as the deputy commander—and RAF component commander—of the Combat Cargo Task Force (CCTF). Comprising RAF, Royal Canadian Air Force, and United States Army Air Forces elements, CCTF was responsible for supplying the Fourteenth Army in Burma. Hardman's final wartime posting, commencing in February 1945, was as Air Officer Commanding No.232 (Transport) Group in Comilla, India (now Bangladesh). The group comprised the squadrons that formerly made up the RAF component of CCTF. Hardman described the Burma campaign as [...] "a striking illustration of a fact new in warfare—namely that air power {{can be used to}} <b>transport,</b> <b>supply</b> and support ground troops entirely independent of ground channels. This has been South-East Asia's contribution to the art of war." [...] He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 5July 1945 for [...] "gallant and distinguished services in connection with the operations in Burma". The US government awarded him the Bronze Star; permission to wear the decoration was gazetted on 15March 1946.|$|E

2500|$|RAF {{training}} {{in conjunction with}} RAF Locking continued after the World War II, but also civilian flights resumed. In 1955, the old Beaufighter factory at Oldmixon was converted {{for use by the}} Bristol Aeroplane Company Helicopter Division, headed by helicopter pioneer Raoul Hafner, that transferred there from Filton. Production at the site included the Sycamore, that was the first British-designed helicopter to fly and serve with the Royal Air Force, that used it for search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare. The Belvedere followed, a twin-engine, tandem rotor military helicopter. [...] It was designed for a variety of transport roles including troop <b>transport,</b> <b>supply</b> dropping and casualty evacuation. [...] It was operated by the Royal Air Force from 1961 to 1969. In 1960, the factory was taken over by Westland, and served as a logistics supply station, until closure in 1987.|$|E

British air reconnaissance revealed much ground movement at Bardia, Sidi Azeiz, Gabr Saleh and towards Sidi Omar from the west, which was interpreted as the beginning of the Italian invasion. The forward move of the 10th Army showed the limitations of Italian mobility and navigation, when the Maletti Group got lost moving up to Sidi Omar, on the Frontier wire. On 10 September, the armoured cars of the 11th Hussars spotted the Maletti Group and heavy mist shielded the British as they shadowed the slow Italian build-up. As the mist cleared, the hussars were attacked by Italian aircraft, tanks and artillery.|$|E
