5|$|According to his autobiography, it {{was while}} he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's idea of {{positive}} checks on human population growth and {{came up with the idea}} of natural selection. Wallace said in his autobiography <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E
5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety. He had in fact abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 standing order that Captains had to be last to abandon ship, and though his account insinuates <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> a boat close to Vengeur when she foundered, he was actually dining in the mess of Culloden {{at the moment of}} the sinking. In 1795, Loutherbourg depicted the rescue of Vengeurs crew by British ships in his large canvas of the battle, Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E

5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost {{in the area to}} fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E

On 11 January 2012, Zürich {{officials}} announced that the club had accepted a bid for Rodríguez by German side Wolfsburg and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the verge of completing the transfer, subject to a medical. Despite being sold midway through the season, Rodríguez was voted as the Fans' Player of the Season on 4 June 2012, ahead of Oliver Buff and Pedro Henrique.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} weekend, some 1,000 volunteers were sworn-in {{as part of}} the Citizens' Defence Brigade, a force of special constables raised at Leane's request to augment the police in dealing with the waterfront dispute. The brigade was based at Fort Largs and was equipped with service rifles and bayonets. The men were quickly posted at the wharves to maintain law and order. During the dispute, Leane slept in an office at the port so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> hand to deal with any emergencies. Leane's decision to arm the mostly inexperienced volunteers with bayonets was later criticised in Parliament. The dispute continued on, with major disturbances at Port Adelaide on 14 January 1929 which resulted in many injuries, and another on 17 January. A significant police presence was required at the wharves into 1930 to deal with disturbances and assaults on non-union workers, and Leane personally supervised police operations there on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|Returning for a {{third season}} with Hamilton in 1962–63, Henderson led the Ontario Hockey Association in scoring with 49 goals in 48 games. He added 27 assists to finish the season with 76 points. A bout of strep throat {{resulted}} in his missing Hamilton's playoff games, but he was called up to the Detroit Red Wings late in their season when they were short of players. Henderson played his first two NHL games against the Toronto Maple Leafs, with only one shift in each game. In his first game, Henderson elbowed Dick Duff in the head, sparking a fight. He {{spent the rest of}} the game on the bench after several Toronto players threatened retaliation against him. In his second, he incurred a slashing penalty during his only time on the ice. Henderson estimated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the ice for only 20 seconds over the two games, but drew nine penalties in minutes.|$|E

5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E
5|$|In Heart of the Swarm, Valerian helps Raynor and his Raiders {{escape into}} the Umojan Protectorate, where Kerrigan {{undergoes}} extensive testing {{in a research}} lab. The lab is discovered and attacked by a Dominion task force, and Valerian and Kerrigan escape on board the Hyperion, the Raiders' flagship. Valerian is nearly psionically strangled by Kerrigan for leaving Raynor behind on the base. Valerian knew that his father {{would be willing to}} sacrifice him to destroy Kerrigan, even in spite of Hyperion captain Matt Horner warning the Dominion fleet <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> board, and so he aided Kerrigan and the Raiders in searching for him. During the final assault against Korhal, Valerian recognized that Arcturus was beyond redemption, and asked only that Kerrigan minimize civilian casualties; Kerrigan thus elected to attend his request, recognizing him as a different man from his father. Kerrigan killed Arcturus shortly thereafter. Following {{the death of his father}} and the departure of the Zerg, Valerian assumed the throne and became the new Emperor of the Dominion. He immediately went to work rebuilding the Dominion, and enacted new laws to eliminate the corruption and abuse of power that had occurred during his father's reign. These reforms included abolishing forced military conscription and slave labor. He also reorganized a number of his father's secret projects, such as Project Blackstone.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} {{game of the}} 1979 season, Richard set the modern-day record for {{throwing}} six wild pitches in a single game against the Dodgers. Despite this, he finished {{the game with a}} 13-strikeout performance in a 2–1 Astros victory. He won his first four decisions that season but those victories were followed by four losses. He continued to accumulate strikeouts and finally began to walk fewer batters on average, exhibiting greater control over his pitching. Richard evened out his record at seven wins and seven losses by pitching a complete game three-hit shutout against the Padres on June 30. By the All-Star break, Richard had 7wins, 10losses, a 3.52 earned run average and 158strikeouts in just a bit over 157innings of work. By July 25, his record stood at eight wins and 11 losses, but after he pitched nine straight complete games (including two-hit and three-hit shutouts on August 27 and September 6, respectively) through September 6 and worked 86 consecutive innings without the need of a relief pitcher, which set an Astros club record, it was clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> a winning streak. On September 21, in a game against the Reds, he pitched 11innings and matched a career high of 15strikeouts, which he also reached earlier in the season on August 3 in a game against the Braves. He closed out the season against the Dodgers by winning his 11th straight game against the team, with his last loss coming on June 23, 1976. He was honored as the National League Pitcher of the Month for September after going 4–1 with a 1.24ERA, four complete games, two shutouts and 69strikeouts in 53innings pitched during the stretch.|$|E

Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it.
