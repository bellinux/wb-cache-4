5|$|American Cocker Spaniels {{have had}} several {{links to the}} United States Presidency. In 1952, an American Cocker Spaniel became a {{household}} name when United States Senator Richard Nixon made his Checkers speech on 23 September. A parti-colored American Cocker Spaniel named Dot {{was one of several}} dogs owned by Rutherford B. Hayes; and a buff colored dog named Feller caused a scandal for Harry S. Truman when the dog was received as an unwanted gift with the President subsequently giving it away <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>White</b> House physician. More recently, a Cocker named Zeke lived with Bill Clinton while he was Arkansas Governor.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} coating able {{to change}} color was tested on Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide {{was applied to the}} hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea water would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{enhancements}} {{are specific}} treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which {{are designed to}} better the gemological characteristics of the stone {{in one or more}} ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> diamond.|$|E
5|$|In March 1955, Claudette Colvin, a black fifteen-year-old schoolgirl in Montgomery, {{refused to}} give up her bus seat <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> man in {{compliance}} with Jim Crow laws, which were local regulations in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; because Colvin was pregnant and unmarried, E. D. Nixon and Clifford Durr decided to wait for a better case to pursue.|$|E
5|$|One dodo was {{reportedly}} sent {{as far as}} Nagasaki, Japan in 1647, but it was long unknown whether it arrived. Contemporary documents first published in 2014 proved the story, and showed that it had arrived alive. It was meant as a gift, and, despite its rarity, was considered of equal value <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> deer and a bezoar stone. It is the last recorded live dodo in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E

Seiderman said the head of the union received a call from the Labor Department the next day, and in November 1941 he was a full union member.|$|E
5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{was born}} on August 4, 1961, at Kapiʻolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the first President {{to have been born}} in Hawaii, making him the first President born outside of the {{contiguous}} 48 states. He was born <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> mother and a black father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, of mostly English descent, with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry. His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982), was a married Luo Kenyan man from Nyang'oma Kogelo. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on scholarship. The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The spine also changed from a colored spine with pale lettering, which was similar to the spine style used by Other Worlds, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> spine with red or blue lettering.|$|E
