5|$|Creating {{a native}} pet {{industry}} in Australia related to quolls could aid in their conservation. However, concerns exist about this methodology {{in regards to}} animal husbandry, conservation benefits, and other issues.

5|$|Einstein {{argued that}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for {{fundamental}} reasons, because the gravitational field {{could be made}} to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid's {{association}} with Cædwalla may have benefited him in other ways: the Life of Wilfrid {{asserts that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, expressed a wish that Wilfrid succeed him in that role, and if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> {{it may be a}} reflection of Wilfrid's {{association with}} Cædwalla's southern overlordship.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the United States Mint began {{releasing}} {{a set of}} half-ounce $10 gold coins under the First Spouse Program with engravings of portraits of the First Ladies on the obverse. When a President served without a spouse, a gold coin is issued that bears an obverse image emblematic of Liberty as depicted on a circulating coin of that era and a reverse image emblematic of themes of that President's life. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for the coins for Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and James Buchanan's First Ladies, but not the coin for Chester A. Arthur's First Lady, which will instead depict suffragette Alice Paul.|$|E
5|$|Let g = gcd(a,b). Since a and b {{are both}} {{multiples}} of g, {{they can be}} written a=mg and b=ng, {{and there is no}} larger number G>g for which <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> The natural numbers m and n must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of m and n to make g greater. Thus, any other number c that divides both a and b must also divide g. The greatest common divisor g of a and b is the unique (positive) common divisor of a and b that is divisible by any other common divisor c.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs diverged {{from their}} archosaur {{ancestors}} {{during the middle}} to late Triassic period, roughly 20million years after the Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago, as evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and caesium {{in the body}} mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency. Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications while <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in only 50% {{of people with}} focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E
5|$|Peter drowned while {{crossing}} the English Channel {{on the way}} to Gaul, at a place called Ambleteuse, near Boulogne. At first he was buried hastily nearby, but Bede reports that after a light illuminated the grave every night, the locals realised Peter was a saint and exhumed him and re-interred him in Boulogne. The actual date of death is unknown, and since his feast day was celebrated on two different days, 30 December or 6 January, that information does not clear up the mystery. The date of his death is reported to have been 1 year, 7 months and 3 weeks after Augustine's, by Thomas of Elmham, a 15th-century chronicler. If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> this would give a year of death between 605 and 611. This information, however, is contradicted by the fact that Peter was present at the Council of Paris in 614, convened by Chlothar II. It is possible that he died during his return from the Council of Paris.|$|E
