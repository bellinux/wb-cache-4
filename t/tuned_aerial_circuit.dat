500|$|It was {{notified}} {{that the road}} forming the eastern boundary of the airfield was to be marked {{by a series of}} posts [...] high, surmounted by vertical white discs [...] in diameter, in January 1921, and the following month, a Notice to Airmen issued in the United Kingdom stated that radio communication with Saint-Inglevert was to be in French. As part of a series of trials to assess the viability of civil aviation in France, a Farman F.60 Goliath flew a [...] test flight carrying [...] of cargo on 1 May. Three laps of a circuit Paris – Orléans – Rouen – Saint-Inglevert – Metz – Dijon – Paris were flown. Saint-Inglevert was one of the designated landing places for the 1921 Coupe Michelin, an <b>aerial</b> <b>circuit</b> of France with a ₣20,000 prize. In November, a Compagnie des Messageries Aériennes aircraft called at Saint-Inglevert to collect a cargo of six 18-pounder and three 4.5–inch live shells for onward transmission to Croydon Airport in Surrey, United Kingdom. In a paper read to the Royal Aeronautical Society on 17 November, Colonel Frank Searle, managing director of Daimler Airway, criticized the organization of Saint-Inglevert and Le Bourget.|$|R
25|$|Early Autodyne {{receivers}} {{typically used}} IFs of only 150nbsp&kHz or so, {{as it was}} difficult to maintain reliable oscillation if higher frequencies were used. As a consequence, most Autodyne receivers needed quite elaborate antenna tuning networks, often involving double-tuned coils, to avoid image interference. Later superhets used tubes especially designed for oscillator/mixer use, which were able to work reliably with much higher IFs, reducing the problem of image interference and so allowing simpler and cheaper <b>aerial</b> <b>tuning</b> circuitry.|$|R
5000|$|A BAC One-Eleven 320L (registration: G-AVBX) {{operating}} a charter flight from Klagenfurt, Austria, to Berlin Tegel, Germany, {{under contract to}} West Berlin package holiday company Flug-Union Berlin. The aircraft made an emergency landing at Hanover Airport because of an electrical fire in an <b>aerial</b> <b>tuning</b> unit in the forward cabin area behind the flight deck. The fire started when the aircraft was 30 nmi km from Hanover, filling the cabin with fumes. This reduced visibility on the flight deck to 18 in. Forward vision was nil.|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} issue of of Amateur Radio, I {{described}} a superheterodyne receiver for the VLF-LF bands, This {{was followed by}} a series of articles on front end <b>tuning</b> and loop <b>aerials</b> for these bands. Now I will describe a more basic form of VLF-LF receiver. In earlier days of radio, quite successful reception of low frequency radio waves was achieved with a single valve stage as a regenerative amplifier-detector and a valve audio amplifier. At low frequencies, a modest value of Q factor in a single tuned circui...|$|R

Hollowlands, stranded limbos, aftermath zones, desert shores: Tricky's songs are the mindscapes of a generation that has lost the capacity to dream of 'a better place.' His music's nowhere vastness externalizes the inner void left when the utopian imagination withers and dies. And yet Maxinquayes last song, the unspeakably beautiful 'Feed Me,' seems to hold out a cruel glimmer of hope - a dream of the promised land, or lost motherland (Maxinquaye itself?), a place 'where we're taught to grow strong/Strongly sensitive.' The song is tentative, almost taunting - like a mirage. 'Unreal, yeah,' Tricky mutters." [...] —Simon Reynolds ...|$|R
50|$|On August 9, 1910, Moisant flew {{his third}} flight {{as a pilot}} in his first {{recently}} purchased Blériot XI from Étampes to Issy-les-Moulineaux over Paris, landing the aircraft at the starting line of the Le <b>Circuit</b> de l'Est <b>aerial</b> time trial <b>circuit.</b> Accompanying Moisant as a passenger on the flight was his mechanic, making the trip the first passenger flight over a city in the world. At the time Moisant was still considered a novice pilot and had been previously denied entry into Le Circuit de l'Est competition by the Aéro-Club de France. That same day, he followed this performance with an encore, flying over Paris again with Roland Garros, who would become a future member of the Moisant International Aviators flying circus, as his passenger.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{variation}} of the third-generation Sovereign called the RP75 Super Sovereign. This took the basic RP72 Sovereign and added two short wave bands - the only Hacker set to include both FM and SW. Coverage was 10.9 to 33 metres and 27.5 to 89 metres. Electronic fine-tuning (band-spread) was provided, and switchable ISM returned to the FM band; separate switches are provided for ISM and AFC, unlike the Sovereign II where these functions were combined on one switch. A signal-strength (and battery test) meter was provided. Echoing the development of the RP72, a mains power supply was added (the RP75MB), then the FM coverage was extended to 104 MHz. With the MB models, an ATU (<b>aerial</b> <b>tuning</b> unit) was included to improve short-wave reception. The speaker fitted to the RP75 and RP75MB was the same as the RP72, but with a larger magnet.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, FFW {{configurations}} {{were produced}} for the Jeep, Austin Champ and Land Rover. In these smaller vehicles, {{it was necessary}} to construct racking to hold the sets and often to remove the rear seats. Owing to the small capacity of the Jeep and early Landrover charging systems, the 300W charging set was still required, although there was little space for it and was sometimes even mounted between the front seats. The Austin Champ. however, was built in a dedicated FFW version from 1954 and was provided with dedicated radio supply connections and a high-output generator for the role. Single-set installations were produced for the Jeep during World War II The introduction of the post-war and smaller C42 & C45 sets allowed a dual-set installation, even in these small 5cwt or ¼-ton vehicles. Whip aerials for the VHF set(s) were installed on the front wings of these vehicles, together with their base-mounted <b>Aerial</b> <b>Tuning</b> Units to obtain maximum separation from any HF antenna. This practice became a distinctive feature of British Army vehicles in later years.|$|R
40|$|The work {{covers the}} arrays with feeder power supply circuit {{spreaded}} widely {{in the radio}} communication and broadcasting operating in short-wave (SW) and middle-wave (MW) ranges. The aim is to develop the effective methods for constructive synthesis and optimization of the arrays with feeder power supply circuit and to create the concrete original methods on the modernization of the acting arrays on base of the obtained results and also recommendations {{on the construction of}} the new arrays with feeder power supply circuit. To solve the formulated problem the generalized method of the induced EDF, matrix analysis, methods for analysis and synthesis of the microwave devices and numerical modelling and optimization methods are used. The strong method for solution of the constructive synthesis of the arrays with feeder power supply circuit has been developed. The successful criterion for optimization of the amplitude-phase distribution possessing the increased directional characteristic enabling to synthesize the practical-realized distributions has been found. The obtained theoretical results have been brought up to the practical application; the methods on the <b>tuning</b> of MW <b>aerial</b> "Zarya" for the condition with increased directivity factor or decreased UBL in comparison with corresponding characteristics of the acting aerials have been createdAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
