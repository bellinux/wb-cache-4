5|$|A 2014 Cochrane review found <b>that</b> <b>using</b> heparin {{in medical}} {{patients}} {{did not change}} {{the risk of death}} or pulmonary embolism. While its use decreased people's risks of DVTs, it also increased people's risks of major bleeding. The review thus recommended the need to balance risks and benefits.|$|E
5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting <b>that</b> <b>using</b> age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court was right to reverse. Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort <b>that</b> <b>using</b> psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E

5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as having two major {{advantages}} over analogue radio broadcasting in <b>that</b> <b>using</b> MPEG-1 Audio Layer II lossy audio compression technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as multiplexing technology, allows a number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|For {{her role}} in the film Sophie's Choice (1982), Streep spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In The Iron Lady, she {{reproduced}} the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before Thatcher became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation, and delivery. Streep has commented <b>that</b> <b>using</b> accents as part of her acting is a technique she views as an obvious requirement in her portrayal of a character.|$|E
5|$|In 1585 the Flemish {{mathematician}} Simon Stevin {{published a}} small pamphlet called De Theinde ("the tenth").

5|$|Lord God, {{the resurrection}} and life {{of all who}} believe in thee, who art always worthy to be praised by both {{the living and the}} dead, we give thee thanks for Edward the Second, our Founder, for Adam de Brome, our {{principal}} benefactor and for all our other benefactors, by whose benefits we are here maintained in godliness and learning; and we beseech thee <b>that</b> <b>using</b> these thy gifts rightly we may be led to the immortal glory of resurrection, through Jesus Christ our Lord.|$|E
5|$|Proponents {{of the use}} of {{leverage}} argue <b>that</b> <b>using</b> leverage can be risk-reducing rather than risk-increasing provided four conditions are met: (i) enough unencumbered cash is kept to meet any margin calls (ii) leverage is applied to a well-diversified portfolio (iii) assets can be rebalanced frequently and (iv) counterparty risk is minimized.|$|E

5|$|The greater honeyguide guides {{people in}} some parts of Africa to the nests of wild bees. A guiding bird attracts a person's {{attention}} with a chattering call, and flies in short bounds towards a bees' nest. When the human honey-hunter has taken their honey, the honeyguide eats what is left. The Boran people of East Africa use a specific whistle, which doubles the encounter rate with honeyguides; they find <b>that</b> <b>using</b> a honeyguide reduces the time to find honey by two-thirds. The Bushmen of the Kalahari thank the honeyguide with a gift of honey.|$|E
5|$|Twitter {{has been}} adopted as a {{communication}} and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities.

5|$|Agents raid Modell's apartment, {{but find}} it empty. They find cans of protein drinks in the {{refrigerator}} and medicine for epilepsy. Mulder suspects that a brain tumor has given Modell his psychokinetic ability, but <b>that</b> <b>using</b> his power is physically exhausting, forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks. Mulder believes that he is dying and wants {{to go out in}} a blaze of glory. Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes him to have a fatal heart attack while they try to trace him. The agents track Modell down to a hospital, where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself. Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started by}} {{focusing}} on the game's hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black and white or color. They reasoned <b>that</b> <b>using</b> advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16colors. At the time, the designers believed that was more than they would ever need for a game. The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.|$|E
5|$|Executives from Endemol, the {{production}} company for Big Brother worldwide, defended the format which is transmitted in 41 territories and noted the season {{premiere of the}} 11th season in America won its timeslot with year-to-year growth. Other comparisons noted was the finale of ninth season of Italy's Grande Fratello pulled 7.9 million viewers with a 36% audience share and how in Argentina the show has been rested {{for a few years}} and returns with stronger ratings. Paul Jonson, global head of marketing and brand partnerships for Endemol Group, noted <b>that</b> <b>using</b> audience averages to figure out how the show performs wouldn't work since the audience builds up until the finale. Jonson also noted that the series continued to rate very well when compared to the timeslot average for Channel 4.|$|E

40|$|Constraints are a {{valuable}} tool for managing information across multiple databases, {{as well as for}} general purposes of assuring data integrity. However, efficient implementation of constraint checking is difficult. In this paper we explore techniques for assuring constraint satisfaction without performing a complete evaluation of the constraints.

5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} April 2009. Before it began, production designer Anthony Ainsworth partly reconstructed the Grid set {{to give it}} more of a concrete, underground bunker, feel. Though more television series in the UK are adopting high-definition cameras, the Spooks producers decided to continue using hand held standard-definition ones, which were more compact and flexible; the producers felt <b>that</b> <b>using</b> high-definition cameras would sacrifice the filming style of the series. For instance, a hand held camera would allow the crew to film one long take following cast members through tight spaces, like an average London flat. High-definition cameras would lose that ability.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after leaving}} TSR, Gygax was {{approached}} by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984. Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply looking for some way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed <b>that,</b> <b>using</b> Gygax's name, {{he would be able}} to bring in one to two million dollars of investment. Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI) was publicly announced. To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and Dragon magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Patton faced Republican Eugene Goss.

Goss insisted {{that he would not}} seek the governorship if elected, and maintained <b>that</b> <b>using</b> the lieutenant governor's post as a stepping stone to the governor's office was a betrayal of the office and its authority. Goss ran an unorthodox campaign, limiting individual contributions to his campaign to $300 and refusing to run television commercials. Patton went on to a lopsided victory in the general election, winning 514,023votes to Goss's 250,857.|$|E
