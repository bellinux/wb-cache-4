5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and <b>temperament</b> concepts. Generally, <b>temperament</b> and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of <b>temperament</b> may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|Since the mid-1990s, Limousin breeders {{have worked}} {{extensively}} on improving disposition issues in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. This has been {{aided by the}} high heritability of <b>temperament</b> and {{by the development of}} genetic measures of docility (among many other traits) predicted from field measurements and subsequent analysis using BLUP techniques to produce docility EBVs and EPDs. Significant improvement has been recorded in the <b>temperament</b> of Limousins, as can be observed from trait trends published by various international breed associations.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{any relationship}} between <b>temperaments</b> of medicinal plants referred to traditional Iranian manuscripts and their major chemical compounds. MethodsPlants used in traditional Iranian medicine were categorized {{based on their}} major chemical compounds including alkaloids, phenolic compounds, and essential oils. Their <b>temperaments</b> were extracted from traditional herbal pharmacopeias of Iran. The possible relationship between major chemical compounds and <b>temperaments</b> of each group were evaluated. ResultsPlants containing phenolic compounds as their major constituents are hot and dry <b>temperaments</b> except those contain tannins with cold and dry <b>temperaments.</b> Plants containing essential oils have hot and dry <b>temperaments</b> except those whose major essential oils with alcoholic structure which have cold and dry <b>temperaments.</b> Alkaloid-containing plants have cold and dry or hot and dry <b>temperaments</b> based on their alkaloidal structures. ConclusionsThere is a close relationship between major chemical compounds of medicinal plants and their <b>temperaments</b> mentioned in traditional Iranian manuscripts...|$|R

5|$|Accounts {{of their}} {{marriage}} diverge widely. Frances's congenital hip dislocation left her in constant pain, and often irritable.

5|$|Around 1924, Prokofiev was {{introduced}} to Christian Science. He began to practice its teachings, which he believed to be beneficial to his health and to his fiery <b>temperament</b> and to which he remained faithful {{for the rest of}} his life, according to biographer Simon Morrison.|$|E
5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on <b>temperament</b> of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult <b>temperament</b> would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's <b>temperament.</b> Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E

5|$|The breed {{is popular}} for {{recreational}} and competitive driving, {{to which it}} is well suited in <b>temperament.</b> In 1997, the rules of driving events in France were modified {{to take into account the}} speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm <b>temperament</b> and willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, more than a third of the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events at the international level.|$|E

5|$|Van Grunsven {{first met}} Bonfire {{when he was}} {{two and a half}} years old, having been under saddle for only a week. He was later {{purchased}} by Van Grunsven's father. At first it appeared that the young horse would be a poor prospect, as his hot <b>temperament</b> led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His <b>temperament</b> continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E

5|$|Mathematics {{were also}} used in musical tuning and music theory. The 2nd-century-BCE Huainanzi, {{compiled}} by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve tones on a musical scale. Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones. While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves. By calculating the difference at 177147⁄176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal <b>temperament</b> duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620–1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's comma). Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536–1611 CE) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548–1620 CE) of the Flemish Region in Europe would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal <b>temperament.</b>|$|E
