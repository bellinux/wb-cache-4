Warmer climates produce higher relative densities among populations, and habitat desirability also influences density. Rivers and large lakes have lower densities because only the shore is desirable habitat; the central, deep waters skew the surface-based estimates. Also, lake and river turtles have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>longer</b> linear trips to access equivalent amounts of foraging space.|$|E

When a cast weight exceeds the specifications lightly, a rod becomes slower, slightly reducing the distance. When a cast weight is slightly less than the specified casting weight the distance is slightly reduced as well, as the rod action is only used partially.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Sadkovich {{wrote that}} Operation Pedestal was a {{tactical}} {{disaster for the}} British, of a magnitude comparable to the German attack on Convoy PQ-17. In 2002, Giorgerini wrote that the operation was an Italian success, the Italian submarines had adopted more offensive tactics and sank a cruiser and two merchantmen, damaged two cruisers and the Ohio. In 2000, Woodman called Operation Pedestal a strategic victory, raising {{the morale of the}} people and garrison of Malta, averting famine and an inevitable surrender. In 2002, Greene and Massignani called the convoy operation the last Axis victory in the Mediterranean but that this had been tactical. The arrival of Ohio was a great Allied success that justified the convoy despite the loss of nine of the merchant ships (one in Valletta harbour). Axis shipping had been suspended during the operation, partly because the transport Ogaden had been sunk off Derna on 12 August, by [...] and after Ohio arrived, Axis ships had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>longer</b> journeys.

2500|$|Loos {{returned}} to California just as Griffith, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>longer</b> films, was leaving Triangle, and she joined director and future husband John Emerson for {{a string of}} successful Douglas Fairbanks films. Loos and company realized that Douglas Fairbanks' acrobatics were an extension of his effervescent personality and parlayed his natural athletic ability into swashbuckling adventure roles. His Picture in the Papers (1916) was noted for its wry style of discursive and witty subtitles: [...] "My most popular subtitle introduced {{the name of a}} new character. The name was something like this: 'Count Xxerkzsxxv.' Then there was a note, 'To those of you who read titles aloud, you can't pronounce the Count's name. You can only think it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{records were}} the [...] "standard" [...] 3minute version until Tom Moulton {{came up with}} a way to make songs longer. Moulton wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>longer</b> songs, so that he could take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer. He found that was {{impossible}} to make the 45-RPM vinyl discs of the time longer, as they could usually hold no more than 5minutes of good-quality music. With the help of Jos√© Rodriguez, his remasterer/mastering engineer, he pressed a single on a 10" [...] disc instead of 7". They cut the next single on a 12" [...] disc, the same format as a standard album. Moulton and Rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes. Twelve-inch records, even for singles, fast became the standard format for all DJs of the disco genre.|$|E
