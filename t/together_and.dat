5|$|In {{communal}} defence, prey groups actively {{defend themselves}} by grouping <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing {{themselves to be}} passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, red colobus monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group <b>together</b> <b>and</b> place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump <b>together</b> <b>and</b> actively bite the chimpanzees. Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.|$|E
