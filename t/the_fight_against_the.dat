5|$|In the 1260s, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in the European perception of the Mongols, and they became regarded less as enemies, and more as potential allies in <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Muslims. As recently as 1259, Pope Alexander IV had been encouraging a new crusade against the Mongols, and had been extremely disappointed in hearing that the monarchs of Antioch and Cilician Armenia had submitted to Mongol overlordship. Alexander had put the monarchs' cases {{on the agenda of}} his upcoming council, but died in 1261 just months before the Council could be convened, and before the new crusade could be launched. For a new pope, the choice fell to Pantaléon, the same Patriarch of Jerusalem who had earlier been warning of the Mongol threat.

During the occupation, many Filipino soldiers and guerrillas never lost hope of the United States. Their objective was to both continue <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Japanese and prepare {{for the return of}} the Americans.

5|$|The {{signature}} {{issue of}} the session, however, was Fields' request for the bond issue.

Ultimately, the issue was approved by the General Assembly, which was considered a major victory for Fields. Still, the bond issue had to be approved by the state's electorate. The Courier-Journal continued <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> issue, while Desha Breckinridge's Lexington Herald came out in favor of it. Fields spent ten weeks criss-crossing the state speaking in favor of the bond issue, but on election day, it was rejected by a margin of 90,000 votes.|$|E

In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. <b>The</b> <b>fight</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of peacekeeping operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international ‘responsibility to protect’ populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.|$|E
