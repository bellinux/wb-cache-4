5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, <b>this</b> <b>better</b> future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E

His portrait of Disney's favorite mouse occupies an entire wall of the gallery; rendered from an oblique angle, his jaunty, ingenuous visage looks somehow sneaky and suspicious.

25|$|There is now (~2014) a retro {{movement}} {{which is}} {{resulting in a}} slow increase in internet connected BBS and nodes. Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH are being used between systems. This means you can telnet to many BBS worldwide as cheaply as ones next door.

25|$|Almost all {{primitive}} cultures had {{a type of}} fipple flute and is {{most likely}} the first pitched flute type instrument in existence. A possible Neanderthal fipple flute from Slovenia dates from 81,000-53,000 B.C., a German flute from 35,000 years ago, and flute made from sheep's bone in West Yorkshire dating to the Iron Age. Written sources that describe a fipple-type flute include the Roman and Greek aulos and tibia. In the early Middle Ages peoples of northern Europe were playing the instrument as seen in 3rd-century British bone flutes, and Irish Brehon Law describes flute like instrument. By the 12th century Italian flutes came {{in a variety of}} sizes, and fragments of 12th-century Norman bone whistles have been found in Ireland, and an intact 14cm Tusculum clay whistle from the 14th century in Scotland. In the 17th century whistles were called flageolets; a term to describe a whistle with a French made fipple headpiece (common to the modern penny whistle) and such instruments are linked {{to the development of the}} English flageolet, French flageolet and recorders of the renaissance and baroque period. The term flageolet is still preferred by some modern tin whistle who feel <b>this</b> <b>better</b> describes the instrument, as this characterises a wide variety of fipple flutes, including penny whistles.|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote: [...] "Though her Cowgirl image is easily her least significant incarnation to date, Drowned World proves that Madonna is still unmatched in her ability to lift cultural iconography into the mainstream. [...] Those who thought Madonna hung up her handcuffs along with the notorious Sex book should look again closely. With its themes of chaos, dominance, and, ultimately, celebration, Madonna's Drowned World explores her ever-fervid intrigue with both imposed and pious restraint." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1964, the Royal Navy {{withdrew from}} the P.1154 project, and moved to procure a new fleet air defence interceptor. It {{eventually}} selected the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, then in service with the US Navy as its primary air defence aircraft, intended to be operated from both existing and planned aircraft carriers. <b>This</b> <b>better</b> suited the Royal Navy, as the Phantom had two engines (providing redundancy {{in the event of}} an engine failure), was cheaper than the P.1154, and was immediately available. The P.1154 was thus left as a wholly RAF project. Later the same year, a general election brought the Labour Party back into power. The new government undertook a defence review, which led to the 1966 Defence White Paper that cancelled several projects, including both the P.1154 and TSR-2. As a consequence, the government was forced to order new aircraft to replace the Canberra and Hunter for the RAF, and eventually chose two types. To replace the Canberra in the long-range role (which was intended for TSR-2), the F-111 was selected, with plans for a redesigned variant, while the roles undertaken by the Hunter (for which P.1154 was to be procured) would be undertaken by a further purchase of F-4 Phantoms. As the Phantom had been developed primarily for fleet air defence, the Royal Navy was happy with the choice of the aircraft as its Sea Vixen replacement, given that the type had been operational in that role with the US Navy since 1961, whilst US aircraft had successfully undertaken touch-and-go landings on both [...] and [...] The RAF was less enthusiastic, as the Phantom was primarily designed to operate in the air defence rather than the close air support role, and had been selected as its Hunter replacement more as a way of decreasing the per-unit cost of the overall UK order.|$|E

No exact formula for the calculation of the country specific MTO was presented in 2005, but it was emphasized the upper limit for the MTO should be at a level [...] "providing a safety margin towards continuously respecting the government's 3% deficit limit, while ensuring fiscal sustainability in the long run". In addition it was enforced by the EU regulation, that the upper MTO limit for eurozone states or ERM II Member States should be: Max. 1.0% of GDP in structural deficit if the state had a combination of low debt and high potential growth, and if the opposite was the case - or if the state suffered from increased age-related sustainability risks in the long term, then the upper MTO limit should move up to be in [...] "balance or in surplus". Finally it was emphasized, that each Member State has the task to select its MTO when submitting its yearly convergence/stability programme report, and always allowed to select its MTO at a more ambitious level compared to the upper MTO limit, if <b>this</b> <b>better</b> suited its medium-term fiscal policy.|$|E
