25|$|After reports had {{surfaced}} {{that both}} parties had agreed to all terms, Golden Boy Promotions released a press release on December 22, 2009, revealing that Pacquiao was unwilling {{to comply with the}} Olympic-style drug testing requested by Team Mayweather. The following day, Bob Arum, Top Rank founder and CEO, declared the fight was off and Pacquiao would be facing a different opponent: We appeased Mayweather by agreeing to a urine analysis at any time, and blood testing before the press conference and after the fight. Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets freaked out when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment and, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>just</b> signaled that he didn't want the fight. Arum told David Mayo of the Grand Rapids Press.|$|E

[...] "My film 10 {{is a couple of}} years old now," [...] explains Kiarostami to film students, [...] "and today I'm not so fascinated by digital technology.

Wrenching George's arm up and down with a pumping motion that might have drawn oil from a dry Texas well, Johnson congratulated him on the briefing, and on his {{services}} to the country and its voters. As he released George, he said, 'Anytime you want to talk <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>just</b> pick up the phone and come over.' It was a vintage LBJ performance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carothers {{hated the}} public {{speaking}} {{that was necessary}} to maintain his high-profile. In a letter to Frances Spencer in January 1932, he related, [...] "I did go up to New Haven during the holidays and made {{a speech at the}} organic symposium. It was pretty well received but the prospect of having to make it ruined the preceding weeks and it was necessary to resort to considerable amounts of alcohol to quiet my nerves for the occasion. … My nervousness, moroseness and vacillation get worse as time goes on, and the frequent resort to drinking doesn't bring about any permanent improvement. 1932 looks pretty black <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schneider {{continued}} to work in France during the 1970s, most notably with director Claude Sautet on five films. Their first collaboration, The Things of Life (Les choses de la vie, 1970) with Michel Piccoli, was a great success and made Schneider an icon in France. The three colleagues teamed up again for the noir thriller Max et les ferrailleurs (Max and the Junkmen, 1971), and she appeared with Yves Montand in Sautet's César et Rosalie (1972). Schneider portrayed Elisabeth of Austria again in Ludwig (1972), Visconti's film {{about the life of}} King Ludwig II of Bavaria. This time she played the Empress as a much more complex, mature, even bitter woman. [...] "Sissi sticks <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> like oatmeal", Schneider once said.|$|E

2500|$|In a January 5, 1995, {{interview}} with Kathleen Gingrich, mother of Republican politician Newt Gingrich, on Eye to Eye, Mrs. Gingrich {{said she could}} not say what her son thought about First Lady Hillary Clinton on the air. Chung asked Mrs. Gingrich to [...] "just whisper it <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>just</b> between you and me," [...] and Mrs. Gingrich replied that her son thought of Clinton as a [...] "bitch". Many people interpreted Chung's suggestion that if Mrs. Gingrich would whisper this statement it would be promised that the statement would be off the record. Bill Carter for The New York Times reported, [...] "Ms. Chung had become the object {{of some of the}} most ferocious criticism, justified or not, ever directed at any network anchor as a result of her now infamous {{interview with}} Speaker Newt Gingrich's mother, Kathleen." [...] The interview was also parodied on Saturday Night Live.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding [...] "Black Hole Sun", Cornell stated, [...] "It's {{just sort}} of a surreal dreamscape, a weird, play-with-the-title kind of song." [...] He also said that [...] "lyrically it's {{probably}} the closest <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> playing with words for words' sake, of anything I've written. I guess it worked {{for a lot of}} people who heard it, but I have no idea how you'd begin to take that one literally." [...] In another interview he elaborated further, stating, [...] "It's funny because hits are usually sort of congruent, sort of an identifiable lyric idea, and that song pretty much had none. The chorus lyric is kind of beautiful and easy to remember. Other than that, I sure didn't have an understanding of it after I wrote it. I was just sucked in by the music and I was painting a picture with the lyrics. There was no real idea to get across." [...] Commenting upon how the song was misinterpreted as being positive, Cornell said, [...] "No one seems to get this, but 'Black Hole Sun' is sad. But because the melody is really pretty, everyone thinks it's almost chipper, which is ridiculous." [...] When asked about the line, [...] "Times are gone for honest men", Cornell said: ...|$|E

[...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
