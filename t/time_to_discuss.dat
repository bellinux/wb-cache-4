5|$|Henry, to Thomas Cromwell's annoyance, {{insisted on}} {{parliamentary}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> questions of faith, which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk. This {{led to the}} passing of the Act of Six Articles, whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy, thus restraining the reform movement in England. It was followed by the beginnings of a reformed liturgy and of the Book of Common Prayer, which would take until 1549 to complete. The victory won by religious conservatives did not convert into much change in personnel, however, and Cranmer remained in his position. Overall, the rest of Henry's reign saw a subtle movement away from religious orthodoxy, helped in part by the deaths of prominent figures from before the break with Rome, especially the executions of Thomas More and John Fisher in 1535 for refusing to renounce papal authority. Henry established a new political theology of obedience to the crown that was continued for the next decade. It reflected Martin Luther's new interpretation of the fourth commandment ("Honour thy father and mother"), brought to England by William Tyndale. The founding of royal authority on the Ten Commandments was another important shift: reformers within the Church used the Commandments' emphasis on faith and the word of God, while conservatives emphasised the need for dedication to God and doing good. The reformers' efforts lay behind the publication of the Great Bible in 1539 in English. Protestant Reformers still faced persecution, particularly over objections to Henry's annulment. Many fled abroad, including the influential Tyndale, who was eventually executed and his body burned at Henry's behest.|$|E

25|$|The BCCI {{announced}} that on 27 October it would decide {{the fate of}} the Kochi team and the BCCI insisted that the two cases of the Kochi Tuskers Kerala andChennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals which were expelled are different. The IPL Governing council decided to give them a 30-day termination notice which meant that the franchise would have to reply to the notice within 30 days and if the IPL accepted their agreement then the franchise would no longer face the prospect of being terminated The Kochi promoters submitted a letter to the BCCI officials with regard to the revised structure of agreement hammered out between them. The BCCI governing council meeting was held on 28 Nov 2010 at Nagpur to decide the fate of Kochi franchisee. BCCI president Shashank Manohar said the board needed more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the issue and to take legal opinion and that the final decision on Kochi Tuskers Kerala will be taken on the BCCI governing council meeting at Mumbai on 5 December 2010. After much speculation it was finally announced by the BCCI that it was satisfied with the agreements signed by the franchise owners and the team would participate in the 2011 IPL Season.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} first {{announced}} in late March 2012 by Fuji TV at its Noitamina press conference. In March 2013, Shiotani stated {{there could be}} a second season if the show received enough support. Once development of the second season started, Shiotani said the new episodes are more difficult to make than those in the first season. He said, [...] "it's more about the show's inflexibility" [...] because the staff have to maintain consistency. For the second season Tow Ubukata replaced Urobuchi as main writer. Ubukata mentions he was given the idea of expanding the setting {{in the form of a}} sequel. As a result of being given the scenario of the TV series and the film, Ubukata had to write the characters' personalities. Although time of the production was short, he had the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> with the first series' staff. Shiotani aided the team for the final episode which Ubukata was satisfied with.|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green praised the episode, {{saying it was}} an {{improvement}} on [...] "Borderland" [...] and that Spiner was even better. But she found {{the murder of the}} doctor shocking and felt that it had gone too far. She said that themes raised in [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] mirrored those which could have appeared on The Original Series but that this episode didn't take the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> them. She hoped that the final episode of the trilogy would cover that ground. The mini-arc featuring the episodes [...] "Borderland", [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] and [...] "The Augments" [...] were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt. Viewing of [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] was included alongside the Doctor Who episode [...] "The Beast Below" [...] in the course [...] "Captain Picard Meets Dr. Who" [...] at the University of Dubuque to demonstrate the idea of sacrificing one person to save many.|$|E

500|$|Welles usually worked 16 to 18 {{hours a day}} on the film. He often {{began work}} at 4 a.m. since the special effects make-up used to age him for certain scenes took up to four hours to apply. Welles used this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the day's {{shooting}} with Toland and other crew members. The special contact lenses used to make Welles look elderly proved very painful, and a doctor was employed to place them into Welles's eyes. Welles had difficulty seeing clearly while wearing them, which caused him to badly cut his wrist when shooting the scene in which Kane breaks up the furniture in Susan's bedroom. While shooting the scene in which Kane shouts at Gettys on the stairs of Susan Alexander's apartment building, Welles fell ten feet; an X-ray revealed two bone chips in his ankle. The injury required him to direct the film from a wheelchair for two weeks. He eventually wore a steel brace to resume performing on camera; it is visible in the low-angle scene between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. For the final scene, a stage at the Selznick studio was equipped with a working furnace, and multiple takes were required to show the sled being put into the fire and the word [...] "Rosebud" [...] consumed. Paul Stewart recalled that on the ninth take the Culver City Fire Department arrived in full gear because the furnace had grown so hot the flue caught fire. [...] "Orson was delighted with the commotion", he said.|$|E

Mayor Jim Kenney was open to the possibility, stating that [...] "it is <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the future" [...] of the monument.

However, this backfired when she told reporters at a Rideau Hall event that it was unlikely that the deficit or unemployment would be much reduced before the [...] "end of the century".

2500|$|Cameron determinedly {{attempted}} {{to increase his}} public visibility, offering quotations on matters of public controversy.

However, he was passed over for a front-bench promotion in July 2002; Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith did invite Cameron and his ally George Osborne to coach him on Prime Minister's Questions in November 2002. The next week, Cameron deliberately abstained in a vote on allowing same-sex and unmarried couples to adopt children jointly, against a whip to oppose; his abstention was noted. The wide scale of abstentions and rebellious votes destabilised the Duncan Smith leadership.|$|E
2500|$|The {{favorable}} {{sense of}} otium in Ciceronian Latin reflects the Greek term [...] (skholē, [...] "leisure", a meaning retained in Modern Greek as σχόλη, schólē); [...] "leisure" [...] having a complex history in Greek philosophy before {{being used in}} Latin (through Latin the word became the root of many education-related English terms, such as school, scholar and scholastic). In Athens, leisure {{was one of the}} marks of the Athenian gentleman: the time to do things right, unhurried time, <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> in. From there it became [...] "discussion", and from there, philosophical and educational schools, which were both conducted by discussion. Four major Greek philosophical schools influenced the Roman gentlemen of Cicero's time. Plato (and his contemporaries, if the Greater Hippias be not authentic) brought schole into philosophy; as often, Plato can be quoted {{on both sides of the}} question whether leisure is better than the business of a citizen. In the Greater Hippias, it is one weakness of the title character that, although he has the education and manners of a gentleman, he has no leisure; but Socrates, in the [...] Apology, has no leisure either; he is too busy as a gad-fly, keeping his fellow Athenians awake to virtue. However, by the time the Romans encountered Plato's school, the Academy, they had largely ceased to discuss anything so practical as the good life; the New Academy of Carneades practiced verbal agility and boundless skepticism.|$|E

[...] The Germans were adamant that they could not supply immediate help for the IRA in its S-Plan campaign in Britain.
