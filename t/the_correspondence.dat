5|$|Adams and <b>the</b> <b>correspondence</b> {{committees}} promoted {{opposition to}} the Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support.|$|E

He {{travelled}} with a personal valet and later had a cashier. But all his letters were written by him; it is recorded that on one occasion after {{the rest of his}} party had gone to bed, 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight. Although he won a large number of contracts, his bids were not always successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six others had been unsuccessful.|$|E
30|$|Stereovision {{refers to}} the ability to infer {{information}} on the 3 D structure and distance of a scene from two images taken from different viewpoints, assuming that the relationship between the 3 D objective world and the acquired 2 D images (see Figure 5), namely the projection matrix, is known. Two main problems have to be solved: finding <b>the</b> <b>correspondences</b> and <b>the</b> reconstruction itself. Determining <b>the</b> <b>correspondences</b> leads to find which parts in the left and right images are projections of the same scene element, whereas the reconstruction problem determines the 3 D structure from <b>the</b> <b>correspondences,</b> using additional information such as the calibration parameters if a metric reconstruction is desired.|$|R
40|$|Olivier Danvy {{and others}} have shown <b>the</b> {{syntactic}} <b>correspondence</b> between reduction semantics (a small-step semantics) and abstract machines, as well as <b>the</b> functional <b>correspondence</b> between reduction-free normalisers (a big-step semantics) and abstract machines. <b>The</b> <b>correspondences</b> are established by program transformation (so-called interderivation) techniques. A reduction semantics and a reduction-free normaliser are interderivable when the abstract machine obtained from them is the same. However, <b>the</b> <b>correspondences</b> fail when <b>the</b> underlying reduction strategy is hybrid, i. e., relies on another sub-strategy. Hybridisation is an essential structural property of full-reducing and complete strategies. Hybridisation is unproblematic in <b>the</b> functional <b>correspondence.</b> But in <b>the</b> syntactic <b>correspondence</b> <b>the</b> refocusing and inlining-of-iterate-function steps become context sensitive, preventing the refunctionalisation of the abstract machine. We show how {{to solve the problem}} and showcase the interderivation of normalisers for normal order, the standard, full-reducing and complete strategy of the pure lambda calculus. Our solution makes it possible to interderive, rather than contrive, full-reducing abstract machines. As expected, the machine we obtain is a variant of Pierre Crégut s full Krivine machine KN...|$|R

5|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, the anti-de Sitter/conformal {{field theory}} correspondence, sometimes called Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between {{two kinds of}} physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On {{the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>correspondence</b> are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills theories that describe elementary particles.|$|E

5|$|Leopold's {{priority}} was to rest his leg. Wolfgang passed {{the time by}} composing a short minuet, K.122/73t, and a Miserere in A minor, K.85/73s. Meanwhile, the libretto for the Milan opera arrived; Leopold had been expecting Metastasio's La Nitteti, but it was Mitridate, re di Ponto, by Vittorio Cigna-Santi. According to <b>the</b> <b>correspondence</b> of Leopold, the composer Josef Mysliveček was a frequent visitor to the Mozart household while they were staying in Bologna. The musicologist Daniel E. Freeman believes that Mozart's approach to the composition of arias changed fundamentally at this time, bringing his style into closer alignment with that of Mysliveček.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} the Allies, Austria agreed to send a force to the Kingdom of Naples to depose Murat in February 1815, when it became {{apparent}} that Murat corresponded with Napoleon I, which was explicitly forbidden by a recent treaty.

5|$|San Martín {{requested}} {{help from}} British Admiral William Bowles. He wrote from Chile {{and expected to}} find him in Buenos Aires, but Bowles had embarked for Río de Janeiro.

He returned to Chile; his wife Remedios stayed in Buenos Aires with her daughter Mercedes because of her health problems. Unable to get help from either Buenos Aires or foreign powers, San Martín promoted a more decisive commitment from Chile to finance the navy.|$|E
