5|$|The North Carolina Tar Heels {{began the}} 1997 college {{football}} season having gone 102 in 1996, {{a year that}} ended with a 2013 win over West Virginia in the 1997 Gator Bowl. Hopes were high for the Tar Heels heading into the 1997 season, with some writers and fans picking North Carolina <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> compete for the national championship. The Tar Heels bore out those hopes {{in the first game}} of the season, beating Big Ten opponent Indiana, 236.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E
5|$|Qatar is {{required}} to have a broadcaster which has at least associate membership of the EBU in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> take part, as Qatar Radio is only a radio station and Qatar lies outside the European Broadcasting Area and cannot apply for Council of Europe membership with Australia being the only exception after being an associate member for over 30 years. The broadcaster would most likely be Qatar Television (QTV) also owned and run by the Qatar General Broadcasting and Television Corporation (QGBTC). If Qatar Radio gets accepted too, then {{they would be able}} to air the contest alongside the television broadcast.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt {{fall of the}} Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may {{reflect the fact that}} the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years {{after the fall of the}} Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 {{remaining}} in the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly and get a defensive stop in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards {{until late in the}} drive, forcing Virginia Tech to use up valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes {{remaining in the}} game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} Miami's post-score kickoff {{needing to}} score quickly in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{have a second}} opportunity on offense — needed because Tech was now two scores behind. Tech returned the kickoff to the 24-yard line but were penalized 12 yards for an illegal block. Casey passed for an eight-yard gain and ran for three yards for a first down. After that gain, things went against the Hokies. Casey was penalized 15 yards for intentional grounding, and Tech was unable to gain another first down. The Hokies punted, and Miami took over on offense at its 46-yard line. In possession of the lead, Miami began to run out the clock, executing multiple rushing plays in succession in order to force the game clock to continue to count down. Tech's defense forced a stop, but because Miami punted the ball with just 2:20 remaining in the game, there was little chance that Tech {{would be able to}} make up the needed two scores.|$|E

5|$|The kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 27-yard line, and the Hokies began the final drive of the second quarter. Antonio Freeman caught a six-yard pass from DeShazo, then DeShazo completed a five-yard pass to Shawn Scales. DeShazo completed a four-yard pass, then Ken Oxendine had a seven-yard catch from DeShazo at the Tech 49-yard line. On the next play, Oxendine caught a short pass that pushed the Hokies to the Tennessee 45-yard line, then DeShazo threw his first incomplete pass of the drive. The incompletion stopped the clock with 37 seconds remaining, allowing time for DeShazo to complete a 26-yard pass to Bryan Still on the next play. Now inside the Tennessee red zone, the Hokies continued to move the ball via short passes. Tech gained a first down at the Tennessee six-yard line, and used a timeout to stop the clock in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> earn a touchdown before halftime. On a subsequent play, however, Tech committed a five-yard penalty, and Tech head coach Frank Beamer ordered kicker Ryan Williams into the game. Williams' 27-yard field goal attempt was good, and Tech cut Tennessee's lead to 3510 {{at the end of}} the first half.|$|E

His eldest son was eager <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> take on Razadarit who held both his mother and sister in his harem. Over the next five years, Minkhaung would call on Minye Kyawswa to wage war against his enemies on multiple fronts: against Hanthawaddy in both Lower Burma and Arakan, and against Ming China and its vassal states in the north. His son proved a gifted commander, and Ava would come closest to reassembling the Pagan Empire.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created Mickey Mouse {{to act as}} a {{replacement}} to his previous star Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. But Mickey could not fill the void alone. Among the few consistent character traits Oswald had developed before moving on to Universal Studios was his near-constant pursuit of potential sweethearts. So for Mickey <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> emulate his predecessor at flirting, someone had to replace Oswald's many love interests. This replacement to Miss Rabbit, Miss Cottontail, Fanny and an uncertain number of unnamed nurses and dancers was to become Minnie Mouse.|$|E
25|$|Humiliated by her loss, Anna seeks revenge at Nina, who {{has already}} gone into hiding. Anna hears rumors she has become Jin's new bodyguard, thus being {{involved}} with the Mishima Zaibatsu. In another attempt <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> battle Nina, she offers herself as a personal bodyguard to the CEO of G Corporation, Kazuya Mishima, knowing that his plan to confront Jin would eventually lead her to her sister. She enters The King of Iron Fist Tournament 6 at Kazuya's request. In Scenario Campaign, Anna leads the defense of G Corporation against Mishima Zaibatsu and Lars Alexandersson's rebel army, and during a confrontation with the rebel army, she sends troops that results in Lars' friend, Tougou's death. She also accompanies Kazuya {{when he comes to}} Azazel's Temple in the desert. Upon the latter's stalemate battle with Lars, Anna escapes with Kazuya after he is let go by Lars.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} round of the 2015 playoffs, the Stingrays {{defeated}} the Reading Royals in seven games. After dispatching the Florida Everblades in six games in the second round, the Stingrays faced the regular season champion Toledo Walleye in the Eastern Conference Finals. South Carolina won the first three games, but Toledo won the next three games to force a seventh game. Toledo was on the verge of becoming the sixth team in the history of North American sports to come back from an 0-3 deficit to win a playoff series, but South Carolina won the seventh game in the third overtime period to advance to the Kelly Cup Finals. In the championship series, the Stingrays faced the Allen Americans. Both teams split the first four games of the series, but the Americans won the fifth game <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> clinch the Kelly Cup in South Carolina. In response, the Stingrays won the sixth game on home ice to force a seventh game back in Allen. However, they lost the seventh game of the series to the Americans, who subsequently won their first championship title since coming from the Central Hockey League before the 2014-15 season.|$|E

The actress initially declined, not wanting to yet jump to Hollywood filmmaking, but accepted after reading the script. Page said part of her motivation was having a new experience: [...] "I thought, well, when else am I going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> wear a leather suit and run through exploding things?

In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E

500|$|In {{previous}} seasons, UConn {{had been}} largely dependent on running the ball; the team developed more balance in 2009, ranking 41st of 120 Division I FBS teams nationally in rushing offense and 46th in passing. Marcus Easley's emergence as a productive wide receiver was key {{to the development of}} the Huskies' passing attack. [...] A former walk-on who entered the season with only five career receptions, he led Connecticut in receiving in 2009 with 44 catches for 853 yards and eight touchdowns. [...] Quarterback Zach Frazer was inconsistent in the early season. He was injured in the game against North Carolina, but regained his starting role after backup Cody Endres was hurt in the Rutgers game later in the season. [...] In UConn's four games before the bowl, Frazer performed well; he threw six touchdown passes against only two interceptions and helped the Huskies score an average of 41 points per game. [...] Experts felt Frazer would need to have a good performance for Connecticut <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win.|$|E
