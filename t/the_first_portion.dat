5|$|WMATA broke {{ground for}} its train system in 1969. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of the Metrorail system opened March 27, 1976, {{connecting}} Farragut North to Rhode Island Avenue on the Red Line. The 103 miles (166km) {{of the original}} 83-station system was completed on January 13, 2001, {{with the opening of}} Green Line's segment from Anacostia to Branch Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Construction on I-270 {{began in}} 1965. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> cost about $2.7million. It opened in 1968, {{connecting}} I-70 to Vasquez Boulevard. Two years later, another two-mile (3.2km) segment connected the portion already {{in service to}} I-80S. I-80S became I-76 in 1976. Construction began on the section between I-76 and I-25 in April 1993 and was finished in September 1999, costing $11.4million. The mileposts were already established when construction took place, so the route was not assigned new mileposts. Completion of this portion largely decreased traffic problems in the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{construction}} began {{on a new}} arterial highway—known as the North–South Arterial—through downtown Utica. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of the highway to open was the segment between River Road and Trenton Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964; however, NY8 was not initially realigned to follow the highway. In the mid-1960s, plans were made to construct a new limited-access highway along the NY8 corridor from Clayville north to New Hartford, where it would connect with the North–South Arterial.|$|E

5|$|Farther east in Utica, {{construction}} {{began in}} the early 1950s on a new arterial highway—known as the North–South Arterial—through the city center. The new roadway bypassed NY5, which was initially routed on Genesee Street and Herkimer Road through Utica. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of the highway to open was the segment north of River Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964, at which time it became part of a rerouted NY5 and NY12. Two portions of Genesee Street, from NY12 in New Hartford to the Utica city line and from NY5S to Herkimer Road in Utica, remain state maintained to this day as unsigned NY921E and NY921C, respectively.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1921, the north–south {{section of}} modern NY251 near Scottsville {{was part of}} Route15, an {{unsigned}} legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> {{of what is now}} NY251 to receive a posted designation was the segment east of NY64 in Mendon, which was part of the signed NY15 from 1924 to 1930. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY251 was assigned to an alignment extending from Gates to Victor via Scottsville, utilizing modern NY386 north of Scottsville and its current alignment east of the village. NY251 was truncated to begin at NY383 in Scottsville on July 1, 1977, at which time the former routing of NY251 between Scottsville and Gates became part of an extended NY386.|$|E
5|$|SR40 was {{assigned}} to the Folkston–St. Marys highway in the early 1920s. The highway was first improved in the mid-1920s and paved in the mid-1930s from Kingsland to St. Marys. SR40 was paved from Folkston east to the Charlton–Camden county line in the late 1930s and from the county line to Kingsland in the early 1940s. The highway was extensively relocated between Folkston and Kingsland in the mid-1960s. SR40 was expanded to four lanes, much of it divided highway, east of Kingsland in the 1980s. The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) has long-term plans to expand the state highway to a four-lane divided highway from Folkston to Kingsland. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of this project was completed east of Folkston in the mid-2000s.|$|E

5|$|The book is {{structured}} into two sections. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> {{of the book}} is critical of the aviation industry and the U.S. government agencies tasked with inspecting it. The second portion of the book addresses consumers and potential airline passengers. The book became successful shortly after publication. It reached number 10 on the New York Times Best Seller list and number 9 on a Chicago Tribune list of bestsellers in early April 1997. Most reviews of the book in media publications were positive. Some individuals within the airline industry claimed the book contained factual inaccuracies, and this was investigated as part of a class project at George Washington University.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of I-97 {{proper to}} be {{constructed}} was the section south of Millersville, which was placed {{under construction in}} three sections in March 1985. The first section of the highway, from US 50 and US 301 to Millersville Road west of the MD 178 interchange, opened in December 1987. Construction of I-97 from Millersville Road to the intersection of MD 3 and MD 178 at Dorrs Corner started in July 1987. The Interstate through Millersville opened in April 1989. The interchange at I-97's southern terminus was originally constructed as a partial interchange, with I-97 tying into what are now the collector-distributor lanes of US 50 and US 301. The ramps from eastbound US 50 and US 301 to I-97 and from I-97 to the westbound U.S. Highways were added during the reconstruction of US 50 and US 301 in 1992 and 1993.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of the 827th to be {{deployed}} for combat was a single company {{in support of the}} 714th Tank Battalion of the 12th Armored Division, on 20 December 1944. Failing to see action, the company was withdrawn to reserve after three days on the line. Discipline proved to be a problem during this period, with men abandoning their guns to collect firewood, despite assistance and advice from the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion (an experienced and well-regarded black unit operating in the same area). A second company was used for screening purposes {{in the first week of}} January, also not seeing combat, while the remainder of the battalion narrowly avoided being assigned to an indirect-fire role it was completely unprepared for.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{only two}} lanes, now the {{eastbound}} lanes, through the swell were constructed. The official highway map for Utah noted the new freeway, but qualified its existence {{with the words}} [...] "two lanes open". <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portions</b> of I-70 to be constructed to Interstate Highway standards were along the non-disputed portion of the route east of Green River.|$|R

25|$|A second notable {{hotel on}} the street, the Hotel Chelsea, was built between 1883 and 1885, with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>portions</b> opening in 1884. It was New York's tallest {{building}} until 1902. Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen lived in the Hotel Chelsea from August 1978. The building has been a designated New York City landmark since 1966, and on the National Register of Historic Places since 1977.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of {{the book}} is a {{critique}} of deficiencies in safety practices by the Federal Aviation Administration and United States Department of Transportation, and the inherent problems with the closeness between these agencies and the airline industry. The book is an exposé of what Schiavo saw as fraud, corruption, waste, mismanagement, and dangerous negligence in the aviation industry and the FAA as a crusader for flight safety. Her primary criticisms in the book focus on the FAA's reluctance to address its many shortcomings, while expressing her concern that there was a fundamental conflict of interest between the FAA job of oversight and the FAA job of promoting aviation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of {{the present-day}} Route 495, at the {{entrance}} to the Lincoln Tunnel, was constructed in 1937 when the Lincoln Tunnel opened. In 1939, it was extended west to Route 3 and it became an eastern extension of that route. In 1952, the portion of the route west of Route 3 was opened when the New Jersey Turnpike was completed. In 1959, the road was incorporated into the Interstate Highway System and was designated as part of Interstate 495 (I-495). Since the Mid-Manhattan Expressway that would have connected the route to New York's I-495 (Long Island Expressway) was canceled, I-495 officially became New Jersey Route 495 in 1979, and the signs were changed in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of current-day Route31 began around1916, when {{a portion of}} the highway, along the community of Hampton was taken over by the state and was repaired to state standards for $300 (1916USD). In1923, the state of New Jersey passed the Good Roads Act, which greatly expanded the state highway system in New Jersey. This act took over pre-existing highways and rebuilt them to a standard mandated by the state. Construction began on Route31 in1926, when the State Highway Department began work at the southern terminus in Trenton. A total of11 bridges were constructed along the highway during this time, signifying the route's construction northward. The oldest ones, dating back to1926, were located in Ewing Township and Oxford Township. The one in Ewing Township was along <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of the highway to be constructed.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} {{constructed}} in two main portions by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, a private operator. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion,</b> north of 42nd Street, was opened between 1904 and 1908, and {{is part of the}} first subway line in the city. The line ran from City Hall, up the Lexington Avenue Line, across 42nd Street, and up Seventh Avenue and Broadway, before splitting into the Broadway Branch and the Lenox Avenue Line. The second portion of the line, that south of 42nd Street, was constructed as part of the Dual Contracts, which were signed between the IRT, the New York Municipal Railway (a subsidiary of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), and the City of New York. Among the various subway lines that were to be constructed as part of the contracts, the West Side Line was to be extended south along Seventh Avenue to serve Manhattan's West Side.|$|E
5|$|What is now Route55 was {{originally}} {{proposed in the}} 1950s as a toll road called the Cape May Expressway that was to run from the Walt Whitman Bridge to Cape May. In 1962, the New Jersey Expressway Authority was created to build the Cape May Expressway and the Atlantic City Expressway. However, by 1965, the road to Cape May {{was turned over to}} the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and designated as Route55, which was to run from Westville to Cape May Court House. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of the route opened around Millville in 1969 while the section bypassing Vineland was completed in the 1970s. Route55 was completed north to Deptford in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began in}} the 1940s on new super two {{alignments}} for US104 in Wayne, Cayuga, and Oswego counties. The new highway was built on a routing parallel to that of Ridge Road {{and served as a}} bypass of the communities along Ridge Road. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of the super two, extending from the Monroe–Wayne county line at Union Hill to west of Sodus, was built in the mid-1940s and completed by 1947. An extension of the highway around Sodus to NY414 in Huron was constructed in the mid-1960s and opened by 1968. In between the end of the super two and Ridge Road, US104 was routed on Lake Bluff Road. The remainder of the super two between Huron and Red Creek was finished by 1974. East of the super two, a bypass was constructed around the village of Hannibal during the early 1960s and opened to traffic by 1964.|$|E
50|$|The Glass Palace Chronicle of {{the kings}} of Burma is the only English {{language}} translation of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>portions</b> of Hmannan Yazawin, the standard chronicle of Konbaung Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar). Hmannan was translated into English by Pe Maung Tin and Gordon H Luce in 1923, who gave it its English name.

50|$|The {{original}} Erie-Lackawanna right-of-way was {{an important}} freight route through Lake County; although, with the decline of railroad traffic in the United States, the line was abandoned in 1986 by Conrail. After it was abandoned, plans were made by Hammond's Parks and Recreation Department to develop the former right-of-way into a trail system. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portions</b> of <b>the</b> Erie Lakawanna Trail were created in the mid-1990s, having been continually extended since then.|$|R

5|$|A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. The {{primary reason for}} constructing the bypass was to relieve traffic heading through the community {{brought on by the}} construction of numerous shopping centers in the area, and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center. The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80. The bypass was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, maintenance of the bypass of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony was}} held in Placentia on January 30, 1967, to begin construction of the Orange Freeway. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> was dedicated on May 16, 1969, and opened soon after, extending north from the Riverside Freeway (SR 91) to Nutwood Avenue in Fullerton. Over the next few years, the freeway was completed from SR 91 north to I-10, and I-210 was built north to the present end of SR57; the Pomona Freeway (SR 60), which overlaps it through Diamond Bar, was constructed at the same time. The last pieces of that portion were the freeway through Brea Canyon, which opened March 13, 1972, and the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange at I-10, which was dedicated May 1, 1972, and opened soon thereafter. Finally, the Orange Freeway was extended south from SR91 to I-5 in the mid-1970s, allowing Route250 to be turned back to local governments, though the subsequent deletion from the Streets and Highways Code {{did not take place}} until 1981. With the extension of SR 210 around San Bernardino in 1998, the former easternmost piece of I-210 to the Kellogg Hill Interchange instead became a northerly extension of SR57, though it remains officially part of the Interstate Highway System.|$|E
5|$|According to Dekema, {{planning}} for I-805 began in 1956. The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July1958. It {{was added to}} the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route241. I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US101 between Los Angeles and San Diego, when the former was opened. Route241 was renumbered to Route805 in the 1964 state highway renumbering, and I-5 was designated along the route from Los Angeles to San Diego. Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route built by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline. This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal was to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, houses along the route in the North Park area were being sold, as the land was needed for the first stretch of the freeway to be constructed. The next year, Dekema confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>portion</b> of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues.|$|E
