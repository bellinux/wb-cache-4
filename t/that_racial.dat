5|$|Racial-Morphological Examinations of the Anterior Portion of the Lower Jaw in Four Racial Groups. This dissertation, {{completed}} in 1935 and {{first published in}} 1937, earned him a PhD in anthropology from Munich University. In this work Mengele sought to demonstrate that there were structural differences in the lower jaws of individuals from different ethnic groups, and <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> distinctions could be made based on these differences.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E
5|$|The defections to the Mexican {{league and}} the threat of a strike by the Pirates {{prompted}} owners to form an advisory committee, chaired by Larry MacPhail, to suggest needed changes that would calm the discontent among the players. On August 27, 1946, the committee presented a draft a document outlining the changes. Language in the original draft admitted that baseball was operating as a monopoly and <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> bias was the sole reason for segregation in baseball. Baseball's attorneys stripped this controversial language from the version eventually adopted by the owners.|$|E

In addition, he went to the Bristol Omnibus Company's parent, the Transport Holding Company, and persuaded them to send officials to talk with the union. The company chairman told Constantine <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> discrimination was not company policy.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{writes that}} along with the ongoing social {{evolution}} that occurred after humans left Africa, the human physical form also continued to evolve. This {{is the subject of}} chapter nine, Race; because humans were spread across different continents, and distance and tribal hostility limited gene flow between them, they followed different evolutionary paths. Race is not well understood, he says, because its historical implications cause it to be avoided in modern academic studies. Wade states, however, that there are reasons to reconsider the study of it; the genetic differences between races may give evidence of the different evolutionary pressures they faced, and the differences may be medically relevant. Citing Neil Risch, Wade puts forth that there are five continental races – Africans, Caucasians, Asians, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans – which are made up of smaller subdivisions called ethnicities. He explicitly avoids discussing the cause of IQ differences between races, but hypothesises <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> differences may have an influence on sporting achievement. Chapter ten, Language, concerns the spread and division of languages. Wade believes that all languages ultimately came from an ancestral language, and that many of its descendants – such as Proto-Indo-European – possibly spread through agriculture. By citing linguists such as Joseph Greenberg, Wade shows that almost all of today's languages belong to families, which in turn may belong to superfamilies such as Eurasiatic.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} that some of the reason that churches remain segregated is because that society and communities at large are very segregated, and that churches are merely a reflection of this.

25|$|It was Phillips's {{contention}} <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> injustice was {{the source}} of all of society's ills. Like Garrison, Phillips denounced the Constitution for tolerating slavery.

25|$|From 1925 to 1967 the {{university}} had a White-only race admission policy. Twelve {{years after the}} US Supreme Court decision in Brown v.

25|$|The {{existence}} of races is {{a token of}} change in the human species, and suggests there is some significance in geographical separation. Lawrence noted <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> characteristics were inherited, not caused by the direct effect of, for instance, climate. As an example, he considered the way skin colour was inherited by children of African origin when born in temperate climates: how their colour developed without exposure to the sun, and how this continued through generations. This was evidence against the direct effect of climate.|$|E

25|$|In many states, {{officials}} {{were reluctant to}} use black militia against the Klan out of fear <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> tensions would be raised. Republican Governor of North Carolina William Woods Holden called out the militia against the Klan in 1870, adding to his unpopularity. This and extensive violence and fraud at the polls caused the Republicans to lose their majority in the state legislature. Disaffection with Holden's actions led to white Democratic legislators' impeaching him and removing him from office, but their reasons were numerous.|$|E
25|$|Critics also claim <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> {{profiling}} {{could occur}} {{on account of}} familial DNA testing. In the United States, the conviction rates of racial minorities are much {{higher than that of}} the overall population. It is unclear whether this is due to discrimination from police officers and the courts, as opposed to a simple higher rate of offence among minorities. Arrest-based databases, which are found in the majority of the United States, lead to an even greater level of racial discrimination. An arrest, as opposed to conviction, relies much more heavily on police discretion.|$|E
25|$|Stereotypes can be {{a source}} of {{heuristic}} attributes. In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a stereotype about the relative intelligence of whites, blacks, and Asians, <b>that</b> <b>racial</b> attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.|$|E
