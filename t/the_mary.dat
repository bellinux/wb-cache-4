5|$|As one of {{the most}} ambitious and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology, <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming {{one of the}} first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.|$|E

By consequence, modern research is based mostly on interpretations of the concrete physical evidence of this version of <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose. The construction of the original design from 1509 is less known.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose began in 1510 in Portsmouth {{and she was}} launched in July 1511. She was then towed to London and fitted with rigging and decking, and supplied with armaments. Other than the structural details needed to sail, stock and arm <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose, she was also equipped with flags, banners and streamers (extremely elongated flags that were flown {{from the top of}} the masts) that were either painted or gilded.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose was rediscovered in 1971. It {{was raised in}} 1982 by <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose Trust, {{in one of the}} most complex and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology. The surviving section of the ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of immeasurable value as a Tudor-era time capsule. The excavation and raising of <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and cost only to the raising of the Swedish 17th-century warship Vasa in 1961.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E

5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a tankard, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E

5|$|Dominic Fontana, a {{geographer}} at the University of Portsmouth, has voiced {{support for}} du Bellay's {{version of the}} sinking based on the battle as it is depicted in the Cowdray Engraving, and modern GIS analysis of the modern scene of the battle. By plotting the fleets and calculating the conjectured final manoeuvres of <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose, Fontana reached {{the conclusion that the}} ship had been hit low in the hull by the galleys and was destabilised after taking in water. He has interpreted the final heading of the ship straight due north as a failed attempt to reach the shallows at Spitbank only a few hundred metres away. This theory has been given partial support by Alexzandra Hildred, one of the experts who has worked with <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose, though she has suggested that the close proximity to Spitbank could also indicate that the sinking occurred while trying to make a hard turn to avoid running aground.|$|E

5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef.

Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Celestes demise.|$|E

5|$|Mary Celeste was not {{the first}} {{reported}} case of a ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas. Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of these stories, it is <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Celeste that is remembered; the ship's name, or the misspelt Marie Celeste, has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose {{first saw}} battle in 1512, {{in a joint}} naval {{operation}} with the Spanish against the French. The English were to meet the French and Breton fleets in the English Channel while the Spanish attacked them in the Bay of Biscay and then attack Gascony. The 35-year-old Sir Edward Howard was appointed Lord High Admiral in April and chose <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose as his flagship. His first mission was to clear the seas of French naval forces between England to the northern coast of Spain {{to allow for the}} landing of supporting troops near the French border at Fuenterrabia. The fleet consisted of 18 ships, among them the large ships the Regent and the Peter Pomegranate, carrying over 5,000 men. Howard's expedition led to the capture of twelve Breton ships and a four-day raiding tour of Brittany where English forces successfully fought against local forces and burned numerous settlements.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose {{was one of}} {{the largest}} ships in the English navy through more than three decades of {{intermittent}} war and {{was one of the}} earliest examples of a purpose-built sailing warship. She was armed with new types of heavy guns that could fire through the recently invented gun-ports. After being substantially rebuilt in 1536, she was also one of the earliest ships that could fire a broadside, although the line of battle tactics that employed it had not yet been developed. Several theories have sought to explain the demise of <b>the</b> <b>Mary</b> Rose, based on historical records, knowledge of 16th-century shipbuilding, and modern experiments. The precise cause of her sinking is still unclear, because of conflicting testimonies and a lack of conclusive physical evidence.|$|E

40|$|In the Moravian Karst {{there are}} three big churches consecrated to <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary.</b> These are visited by many pilgrims and have their own {{calendar}} of pilgrimages. They are Vranov, Křtiny and Sloup. Churches in these towns are consecrated to The Virgin Mary: Vranov commemorates the birth of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary,</b> Křtiny commemorates <b>the</b> name of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary</b> and Sloup commemorates the sufferings of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary.</b> So {{we talk about the}} triangle of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary.</b> This term is the main point of my thesis. After detailed preoccupation of this topic I found that very near these three churches is situated the church of St. Barbora in the town of Adamov. Its ancient gothic altar is carved from wood and we can find it in the church since 1857. It displays the assumption of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary.</b> This altar is called "Světelský" and the origin of the title is in the monastry in Austrian town Zwetter (Světlá) where this altar was made. In February 2010 the altar was placed in the group of the National cultural landmarks. The altar supplements the main feasts of The Virgin Mary: the birth of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary</b> in Vranov, <b>the</b> name of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary</b> in Křtiny, <b>the</b> sufferings of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary</b> in Sloup and in Adamov the altar that displays the assumption of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary.</b> <b>The</b> altar also supplements the main mysteries of the Rosary: the Exhilarating one in Vranov, the Glorious one in Křtiny, the Dolorous one in Sloup and the rosary of the Light in Adamov. In my opinion the deep-seated term triangle of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary</b> should be extended to the quadrangle of <b>The</b> Virgin <b>Mary...</b>|$|R
