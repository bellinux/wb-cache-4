50|$|<b>The</b> maximum <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> for a {{passband}} {{for common}} modulation {{methods such as}} QAM, PSK and OFDM is approximately equal to the passband bandwidth.|$|R
50|$|In many cases, <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> of {{the optical}} {{interface}} does not equal <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> of the electrical interface. In these cases, a gearbox is used within the module to convert {{between the two}} rates. For example if the module supports 4 x 25 Gb/s electrical inputs and 2 wavelengths of 50 Gb/s optical interface, then a gearbox must convert between 25 and 50 GBaud.|$|E
50|$|The dual-pulse {{start and}} stop bit times permit a {{receiver}} to synchronize with the beginnings of bytes, and also measure <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> of a sender. Synchronizing on 8-bit bytes permits a 9600 baud internet-0 connection to easily translate to a standard, low-speed 19,200 baud TCP/IP serial port. <b>The</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> measurement permits senders and receivers to use inexpensive low-precision oscillators such as ceramic resonators or resistor-capacitor oscillators.|$|E
50|$|Being {{a digital}} protocol, Olivia transmits {{a stream of}} ASCII (7-bit) {{characters}}. The characters are sent in blocks of 5. Each block takes 2 seconds to transmit, thus the effective data rate is 2.5 character/second or 150 characters/minute. The most common transmission bandwidth is 1000 Hz and <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> is 31.25 MFSK tones/second. To accommodate for different conditions and {{for the purpose of}} experimentation the bandwidth and <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> can be changed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> maximum <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> or {{pulse rate}} for a base band channel {{is called the}} Nyquist rate, and is double the {{bandwidth}} (double the cut-off frequency).|$|R
5000|$|For its {{modulation}} TETRA, uses [...] differential quadrature phase-shift keying. <b>The</b> symbol (<b>baud)</b> <b>rate</b> is 18,000 symbols per second, {{and each}} symbol maps to 2 bits, thus resulting in 36,000 bit/s gross.|$|R
5000|$|POKEY {{is a sort}} of UART. Usually one of the doubled audio {{channels}} is used as <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> generator. <b>The</b> standard <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> is 19.2 kbit/s, <b>the</b> maximum possible <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> is 127 kbit/s. A byte {{put into}} the SEROUT register is automatically sent over the serial bus. The data frame contains 10 bits: 1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit. The voltage levels are 0 V (logical 0) and +4 V (logical 1). It is possible to connect the Atari serial port with an RS-232 port by means of a simple voltage converter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{speed or}} {{bits per second}} of the line (often {{incorrectly}} referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Baud</b> <b>rate).</b> Some systems use automatic speed detection.|$|E
50|$|For example, with an {{alphabet}} {{consisting of}} 16 alternative symbols, each symbol represents 4 bits. Thus, the data rate is four times <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{ratio is}} not {{necessarily}} even an integer; in 4B3T coding, the bit rate is 4/3 of <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate.</b> (A typical basic rate interface with a 160 kbit/s raw data rate operates at 120 kBd.) ...|$|E
50|$|MDC, {{also known}} as MDC-1200 and MDC-600, is a {{low-speed}} Motorola data system using audio frequency shift keying, (AFSK).

5000|$|If the {{alphabet}} consists of [...] alternative symbols, each symbol represents a message consisting of N bits. If the symbol rate (also known as <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate)</b> is [...] symbols/second (or baud), the data rate is [...] bit/second.|$|E
5000|$|Data rate {{limiting}} {{of the application}} data stream to provide the performance expected for <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> currently in effect on the virtual COM port, which is slower than the maximum speed of the network connection to the server.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{upstream}} direction, {{a maximum}} of 30 sub-carriers can be used, again each frame modulated with up to 15 bits. Taken with <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> of 4,000 per second per subcarrier, the maximum throughput is just over 1.5 Mbit/s.|$|E
50|$|The February 1976 {{issue of}} Byte had {{a report on}} the {{symposium}} and the March issue featured two hardware examples by Don Lancaster and Harold Mauch. <b>The</b> 300 <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> was reliable but slow. (The typical 8-kilobyte BASIC program took five minutes to load.) Most audio cassette circuits would support higher speeds.|$|R
50|$|SYNC:The SYNC is a {{standard}} data format byte with a value of hexadecimal 0x55. LIN slaves running on RC oscillator will use the distance between a fixed amount of rising and falling edges to measure the current bit time on the bus (the master's time normal) and to recalculate <b>the</b> internal <b>baud</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
30|$|The RS- 485 bus [10] is an {{extremely}} well-consolidated and widespread standard for medium-range communication between industrial devices (up to about 1 km) over a simple twisted-pair cable [11]. Unfortunately, traditional systems communicating over RS- 485 face a trade-off between cable length, which constitutes {{one of the most}} important factors that determine bus loading, and <b>the</b> employed <b>baud</b> <b>rate,</b> to ensure end-to-end signal integrity.|$|R
50|$|In {{case of a}} {{baseband}} channel such as a telegraph line, {{a serial}} cable or a Local Area Network twisted pair cable, data is transferred using line codes; i.e., pulses rather than sinewave tones. In this case <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> is synonymous to the pulse rate in pulses/second.|$|E
50|$|When start bit {{length is}} used to {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate,</b> it requires that character should be odd since UART sends LSB bit first. Often symbols 'a' or 'A' (0x61 or 0x41) are used. For example, the MPC8270 SCC try to detect length of UART start bit for autobaud.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that if the {{communication}} channel is bandlimited to W Hz one can transmit at most 2 W independent symbols per second. Generalized sampling theorems, nevertheless, do not restrict such a signaling to be uniform [1], [2], [3]. That is, it is theoretically possible to distribute the data symbols non-uniformly in time as long as the average signaling rate does not exceed 2 W. Since <b>the</b> average <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> remains <b>the</b> same, non-uniform signaling techniques are rarely used in normal communication scenarios. Recently, based on the observation that almost all of the public telephone network is digital, it has been proposed that 56 kb/s transmission is theoretically possible over voice band channels [7]. The proposed signaling is a nonuniform one which makes it possible to receive independent data symbols using available 8 kHz PCM samplers while <b>the</b> average <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> is kept limited to 7 kbaud (W= 3500 Hz).

In this paper, we face the problem of carrier phase synchronization for these modulation and coding schemes. I...|$|R
5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain <b>the</b> correct <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.|$|R
5000|$|During the autobaud process, <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> of {{received}} character {{stream is}} determined byexamining the received pattern and its timing, {{and the length}} of a start bit. These type of baud rate detection mechanism are supported by many hardware chips including processors such as MPC8280, MPC8360, and so on.|$|E
50|$|The {{synchronization}} information, transmitted at {{the start}} of each video channel, allows the receiving software to align its sampling with <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> of the signal, which can vary slightly over time. The minute markers are four lines of alternating black then white lines which repeat every 60 seconds (120 lines).|$|E
50|$|One {{frame is}} sent at the desired sample rate, {{for a bit}} rate of 256×48 kHz = 12.288 Mbit/s. This is twice <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b> used by S/PDIF (3.072 Mbit/s, doubled by biphase coding to 6.144 Mbaud), but still within the {{specified}} 15 Mbaud capacity of the popular TOTX147 http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Toshiba%20PDFs/TOTX147_F_T.pdf/TORX147 http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Toshiba%20PDFs/TORX147(F,T).pdf TOSLINK transceivers.|$|E

Details on how to flash the ESP 8266 with esp-link along with the precompiled binaries themselves {{can be found at}} the esp-link github (JeeLabs, 2017) Because the ESP 8266 requires 3.3  V input voltage to function it was connected to the Matrice 100 battery through a 5  V buck regulator and properly configured linear regulator that were readily available.|$|R
40|$|Low-cost, {{high-capacity}} {{optical transmission}} systems {{are required for}} metropolitan area networks. Direct-detected multi-carrier systems are attractive candidates, but polarization mode dispersion (PMD) {{is one of the}} major impairments that limits their performance. In this paper, we report the first experimental analysis of the PMD tolerance of a 288 Gbit/s NRZ-OOK Coherent Wavelength Division Multiplexing system. The results show that this impairment is determined primarily by <b>the</b> subcarrier <b>baud</b> <b>rate.</b> We confirm <b>the</b> robustness of the system to PMD by demonstrating error-free performance over an unrepeatered 124 km field-installed single-mode fiber with a negligible penalty of 0. 3 dB compared to the back-to-back measurements.
