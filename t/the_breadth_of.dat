Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content.

Groves was impressed with <b>the</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> Oppenheimer's knowledge. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and his deputy Kenneth Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area. These were features that Groves found lacking in other scientists, and he knew that broad knowledge would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics, but chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance and engineering.|$|E

5|$|The Origin of Birds is {{an early}} {{synopsis}} of bird evolution written in 1926 by Gerhard Heilmann, a Danish artist and amateur zoologist. The book was born {{from a series of}} articles published between 1913 and 1916 in Danish, and although republished as a book it received mainly criticism from established scientists and got little attention within Denmark. The English edition of 1926, however, became highly influential at the time due to <b>the</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> evidence synthesized as well as the artwork used to support its arguments. It was considered the last word on the subject of bird evolution for several decades after its publication.|$|E
5|$|There are {{symmetrical}} {{differences between}} the left- and right-hand sides of the painting.

In addition, <b>the</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the buttress contradicts the spatial depth of the much tighter space inhabited by the Virgin and Child. This is a technical issue with foreshortening Campin also struggled with, but which van der Weyden resolves in his mature work.|$|E

Co-director Hill accompanied Wales during 2007, filming him as he journeyed around the globe. Hill took a two-person film crew and traveled to China, Indonesia, India, South Africa, Australia and Europe, interviewing editors and contributors. Hill is himself an editor of Wikipedia, starting an article about a graffiti artist. Gibson and Hill required expertise in the creative and funding aspects of film-making and invited Scott Glosserman to join the venture.

5|$|Heinrich Tønnies (1825–1903) {{remains to}} date {{one of the}} premier CDV photographers of Denmark. In June 1856 he began his {{photographic}} career as a partner under C. Fritsche in Aalborg and by December of the same year he bought his partner's share of the business and struck out with a studio under his own name. By 1861, Tönnies' business boomed requiring a larger studio and the hiring of assistants, and by 1870 he became a Danish citizen. Ultimately, his family business spanned three-generations and 75 years. <b>The</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> his photographic products included: Daguerreotypes, calotypes, pannotypes, photo-lithography, stereoscopy, ambrotypes, CDVs, and medallions. It is believed that he produced no less than 75,000 CDVs, many ordered in relation to a large wave of emigration from Nordjylland to North America. Owing to the poverty of Denmark's Vendsyssel region, local demands for inexpensive CDVs persisted in Aalborg right up until World War I, making Tönnies' studio one of the last to produce CDVs in Denmark.|$|E
5|$|These revelations {{make the}} {{painting}} difficult to date. Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its {{strong emphasis on}} colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period. The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's last visit to Italy. If this is the case, then <b>the</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> handling and the dissolution of form {{can be seen to}} mark the beginning of the artist's final period. The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier work are here replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece, Las Meninas.|$|E

5|$|This line — {{with many}} non-hamburger sandwiches, {{including}} chicken and fish — significantly expanded <b>the</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> the Burger King menu. The amount of new additions, several new sandwiches made with disparate ingredients {{was made possible}} due the design of Burger King's kitchen. The chain's kitchen is modeled around a more flexible concept that allows for a multiple work-flow operations where preparation stations can be re-tasked more easily. In comparison, McDonald's kitchen {{at the time was}} a more rigidly designed assembly line concept intended to quickly produce a more uniform product and was not easily adapted to new products. This more rigid system prevented McDonald's from broadening its menu to effectively competing with Burger King and other similar chains that were more flexible and were better positioned to expand their menu.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of <b>the</b> <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E

This paper summarizes previously recorded information on <b>the</b> diet <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> natural enemies released to control insect pests worldwide. It also summarizes <b>the</b> diet <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> native parasitic hymenoptera in North America to determine whether <b>the</b> diet <b>breadths</b> <b>of</b> native and exotic parasitoids differ. Of released biocontrol agents, 48 % were recorded as generalists (attacking more than one genus of host) and another 29. 2 % attacked more than one species in a genus. Only 22. 5 % were recorded as specialists on the target pests. This suggests that many natural enemies released in biocontrol programs against insect pests have broad diets and that non-target effects are likely. Data from native hymenoptera in North America also show that many species attack multiple host genera and species, {{with an average of}} 5. 8 genera and 7. 3 species attacked, indicating broad agreement with data from biological control releases...|$|R
