40|$|AbstractThis paper deals {{about the}} {{problematic}} of target costing implementation into the managerial decisions. These decisions make value analysis principles for increasing in competitiveness by the setting off limits for maximum allowable costs which should not exceeded by company manufacturing. By {{this approach is}} possible to improve product quality, service, shortening {{the research and development}} period and continual effort to lower costs. Target costing as a modern method of calculation uses the principles of value analysis, by using instruments of functional cost analysis and quantitative-function deployment can provide a functional differentiation of the product. This approach has a high importance for quality assurance in pre-production phase and it's increasing. Application of target costing is growing in praxis still. Target costing calculation introduce system approach to quantify costs of product in the phase of constructive and development activities of production. Comparison target costing calculation and traditional calculation show target gap. Target costing calculation is new modern instrument that it facilitates to manage price of product by the customers’ requirements. The price is determined by market and customer's needs. In this phase is possible <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>costs</b> of product. In praxis we often meet with situation where the price of product is very high and customer is not ready to pay so much. Target costing calculation limits cost of production...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{empirical}} investigation of recent trends and changes in companies' production relocation and backshoring behaviour against the background of the global economic crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical research is based on a large data set of 1, 484 German manufacturing companies as part of the European Manufacturing Survey (EMS). The paper employs a structured set of probit analyses to identify the differences of production relocation and backshoring determinants before and within the crisis. Findings - Against common belief the paper finds that not only the relocation of production to emerging countries, but also the backshoring of once offshored manufacturing capacities to the home base is a relevant phenomenon. Since the emergence of the global economic crisis, relocation activities declined significantly, whereas the level of backshoring activities has remained stable. Far-shore destinations in Asia gain in attractiveness over near-shore locations in Eastern Europe. Particularly export-intensive companies tended recently towards (re-) concentrating of their production capacities, trying to exploit the benefits of higher capacity utilisation and a superior relation of variable costs <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>costs</b> at their existing locations. Research limitations/implications - Although covering a significant range of industrial sectors in Germany, more empirical evidence is needed from other branches and countries. Looking forward it is proposed to systemically integrate scenarios on the future development of the most influential environmental factors in future research frameworks for global production decisions and value chains. Practical implications - The findings strongly recommend a revision of established decision-making schemes for production relocations based on pure cost efficiency considerations. Decision-making should integrate qualitative environmental factors and dynamic considerations using scenario-based tools. Companies need to understand and prepare for dynamic developments at different locations which can strategically necessitate backshoring after a certain time. Originality/value - The research considerably widens the empirical knowledge on recent trends in relocation activities and their inherent risks, which in a dynamic perspective are sometimes forcing backshoring activities...|$|E

50|$|Another way {{to state}} the rule is that a firm should compare the profits from {{operating}} to those realized if it shutdown and select the option that produces the greater profit. A firm that is shutdown is generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs. However, the firm still has <b>to</b> pay <b>fixed</b> <b>cost.</b> So the firm's profit equals <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> or −FC. An operating firm is generating revenue, incurring variable <b>costs</b> and paying <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b> The operating firm's profit is R − VC − FC. The firm should continue to operate if R − VC − FC ≥ −FC, which simplified is R ≥ VC. The difference between revenue, R, and variable costs, VC, is the contribution <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> and any contribution is better than none. Thus, if R ≥ VC then firm should operate.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of firm survival in export markets. Our theoretical framework includes a geometric Brownian motion for firm profitability, market-specific sunk and <b>fixed</b> exporting <b>costs</b> that are common across firms, and firm- and market-specific profitability shifters that are constant over time. We derive the probability of survival upon entry in an export market. We show that this probability increases with the ratio of sunk <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> and is insensitive to the profitability shifters. Also, we show that the survival probability is unaffected by <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> if sunk costs are zero. Combining our theoretical results with observed patterns of survival among Argentine exporters, we infer the impact of distance and experience on the magnitude of sunk and <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b> In our data set, survival rates upon entry decrease with distance and increase with experience. Hence, we infer that <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> increase more with distance than sunk <b>cost</b> while <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> fall with experience sufficiently strongly to dominate the fall in sunk costs. These results carry implications on parametrizations of theoretical models of export dynamics {{and serve as a}} benchmark to assess structural estimates of <b>fixed</b> and sunk <b>costs...</b>|$|R

50|$|Efficiency-based {{absorption}} costing (EBAC) is {{the discipline}} of accounting, which is concerned with establishing methods or techniques <b>to</b> allocate <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> <b>to</b> each product or service an organization produces.

The single standard absorption rate was used for simplicity purposes (Steve R. and Ken 1994; Gunasekaran et al. 1999). However, it ignores the different level of efficiency of each product or service in incurring the <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> and as a result, a high degree of cross subsidization occurs between more efficient and less efficient products and services. In a nutshell, EBAC focuses on the efficiency aspect by identifying the products’ different level of overhead utilization efficiency.|$|R
