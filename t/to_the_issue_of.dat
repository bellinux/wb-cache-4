5|$|After D-Day, a {{new role}} was found for Hargest. Now that the Allies were on {{mainland}} Europe, thought was turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> dealing with the expected arrival of newly released New Zealanders from liberated prisoner of war camps. The 2NZEF Reception Group {{was set up to}} help repatriate them. Hargest was appointed the commander of the group but on 12 August 1944, was killed by shell fire during the Battle of Normandy, when he was making a farewell visit to the British 50th Division. Hargest is buried at the Hottot-les-Bagues War Cemetery in France.|$|E
5|$|Although Sandra Panem in {{the journal}} Science praised Shilts' efforts and the {{attention}} the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> homophobia hampering attention on the disease, but remarks that even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor's Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Chad {{reported}} that school attendance of children aged 5 to 14 was {{as low as}} 39%. This can also be related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> child labor as the report also stated that 53% of children aged 5 to 14 were working children, and that 30% of children aged 7 to 14 combined work and school. A more recent DOL report listed cattle herding as a major agricultural activity that employed underage children.|$|E
5|$|Plants convert {{carbon dioxide}} into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere. By {{approximately}} 350 {{million years ago}} (the end of the Devonian period), photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above 17%, which allowed combustion to occur. Fire releases CO2 and converts fuel into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression. While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time, Charles Cooper brought attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> forest fires {{in relation to the}} ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Soedjatmoko later {{attended}} the Surabaya HBS (secondary school) and graduated in 1940. The school {{introduced him to}} Latin and Greek, {{and one of his}} teachers introduced him to European art; he later recalled that this introduction had allowed him to see Europeans as more than colonists. He then continued to medical school in Batavia (modern day Jakarta). Upon seeing the slums of Jakarta, he was drawn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> poverty; this later became an academic interest of his. However, during the Japanese occupation, in 1943, he was expelled from the city due to his relationship with Sutan Sjahrir– who had married Soedjatmoko's sister Siti Wahyunah– and participation in protests against the occupation.|$|E

5|$|Yugoslav war plans saw the 4th Army {{organised}} and mobilised on {{a geographic}} basis from the peacetime 4th Army District, which {{was divided into}} three divisional districts, each of which was subdivided into regimental regions. Zagreb, Dugo Selo and Sisak were key centres for the mobilisation and concentration of the 4th Army due to their good rail infrastructure. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> mobilisation orders for the 4th Army, the 4th Army District headquarters {{had been involved in}} planning border defences and conducting exercises for border troops, including demolition plans for bridges and other infrastructure in the event of war.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in the trade union movement was an inevitable corollary of this and {{during the war years}} there was a considerable {{increase in}} the membership of the various unions. Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to maintain wages largely as they were. Although the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8–12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers, to the extent that industrial action followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and {{it has been estimated that}} between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and £4,785,607 in lost wages.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, {{the year}} that the War of Independence broke out, nine issues {{appeared}} between January and May. There is a special appendix <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> April 1, 1821, containing a Greek translation of an article dated March 29, taken from the Wiener Zeitung, which reports on the uprising of Alexandros Ypsilantis and Tudor Vladimirescu in the Danubian Principalities, that {{marked the beginning of}} the Greek War of Independence, and also states the official Austrian standpoint. In the issue of May 1, while Ypsilantis’ campaign was in full swing, the Austrian authorities required the editors to publish the excommunication issued by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Gregory V, against the architects of this uprising. This was the last issue of Hermes o Logios which then was closed down by the local authorities and Kokkinakis was arrested as a member of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia.|$|E
