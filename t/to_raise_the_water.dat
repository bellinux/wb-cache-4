During {{the retreat}} down the Red River, Neosho was trapped above the falls at Alexandria, Louisiana, {{along with most}} of the other ironclads of the Mississippi Squadron, when the river's water level {{unexpectedly}} began to fall. Two temporary dams, known as Bailey's Dam, had to be built in April–May <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level high enough to allow the ironclads to proceed downstream. During the Franklin-Nashville Campaign in December 1864 Neosho, accompanied by the casemate ironclad , bombarded Confederate artillery batteries on the Cumberland River, near Bell's Mills, Tennessee, on 6 December. Despite being hit over 100 times, she was not seriously damaged. The monitor bombarded the Confederate right wing during the Battle of Nashville on 15–16 December.|$|E

25|$|Using Figure 3 and {{knowledge}} of the upstream and downstream conditions and the depth values {{on either side of the}} gate, a general estimate of the profiles upstream and downstream of the gate can be generated. Upstream, the water surface must rise from a normal depth of 0.97 m to 9.21 m at the gate. The only way to do this on a mild reach is to follow an M1 profile. The same logic applies downstream to determine that the water surface follows an M3 profile from the gate until the depth reaches the conjugate depth of the normal depth at which point a hydraulic jump forms <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface to the normal depth.|$|E
25|$|The {{events that}} led to the {{building}} of the bridge started in August 1826 when the Lord Mayor of London made a ceremonial progress down the Thames from Oxford to London. The Mayoral barge grounded on the rocky outcrops in the shallows at Clifton Ferry and was stuck for several hours whilst the weirs further upstream were opened <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level. This episode led to the building of Clifton Lock and weirs in 1835 which allowed better water management on the reach. Whilst the deeper channel was welcomed by river traffic it prevented the fording of the river by herds of cattle and thus prompted demands for a bridged crossing.|$|E

25|$|The intercepting sewers, {{constructed}} between 1859 and 1865, {{were fed}} by 450 miles (720km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed {{the contents of}} some 13,000 miles (21,000km) of smaller local sewers. Construction of the interceptor system required 318 million bricks, 2.7 million cubic metres of excavated earth and 670,000 cubic metres of concrete. Gravity allowed the sewage to flow eastwards, but {{in places such as}} Chelsea, Deptford and Abbey Mills, pumping stations were built <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and provide sufficient flow. Sewers north of the Thames feed into the Northern Outfall Sewer, which fed into a major treatment works at Beckton. South of the river, the Southern Outfall Sewer extended to a similar facility at Crossness. With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of taking}} the waters from the carrs in the north to a new outlet near Marfleet on the Humber was {{suggested}} by Mr Snow in 1671. He was a Commissioner of Sewers, and proposed a new drain from Forthdike to Marfleet, passing {{to the east of}} Sutton, whose inhabitants had resisted previous attempts at a solution. Snow offered to cut the drain in return for use of the drained land for a period of 21 years, but he failed to obtain the consent of the landowners or an Act of Parliament to authorise it. Sir Joseph Ashe made some improvements to his Wawne estate, which included cutting the Engine Drain, {{at the end of which}} he built two windmills <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> into the Hull. Others followed suit, and there were around a dozen drainage windmills in the area by the early eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that the Lode was navigable beyond Soham. Lighters brought cargoes of corn to a water mill at Soham, and later brought coal when steam engines replaced the water wheel. Barley and timber were other important cargoes. Railways did not reach Soham until 1879, and resulted in the rapid demise of water-borne transport. Commercial traffic ceased about 1900, and the lode was described as un-navigable in a report by H. Dunn in 1906. There was a sluice at the entrance to the lode, with two sets of mitre gates, pointing in opposite directions, one to prevent flood waters from the Great Ouse entering the lode, and the other <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level in the lode to make navigation easier. When the Anglian Water Authority was created by Act of Parliament in 1977, the lode was not listed as a navigation, and their successors, the Environment Agency, have taken this to mean that there is no right of navigation.|$|E

[...] In 1908, Adams River Logging constructed a [...] "splash dam" [...] at the outlet of the Lower Adams. [...] This dam allowed operators <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level of Adams Lake.

2500|$|Roman Lincoln {{had a very}} {{sophisticated}} water supply. It was fed by the ‘‘Roaring Meg’’ spring to the North East {{of the city and}} then ran parallel with the Nettleham Road towards the N.E corner of the Upper Colonia. The ceramic pipes were encased in concrete that provided a waterproof seal and allowed the water to pass through the pipes under pressure. The course of the aqueduct had been well known {{from the start of the}} 18th century. William Stukeley had shown the line of the aqueduct on his plan of Lincoln in 1722. The Lincoln antiquary Thomas Sympson had written in the mid 18th century [...] "There must have been some contrivance for raising the water a good deal above its natural level before it would run to Lindum; the spring being evidently lower than the Town: and indeed there are some traces of a Tower, or some such building at the end of the Aquaeduct by the Spring, which one may suppose would have had a reservoir on its Top." [...] In 1782 the artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm drew sections of the sheathed pipe and also where it emerged from the ground at the spring. Over the years further lengths of the aqueduct have been uncovered and the base for a watertank fed by the aqueduct discovered just inside the Roman Wall to the east of the Newport Arch. This is just to the north of Cottesford Place, where excavations in the 1960s revealed a probable Roma Bathhouse, which could have been supplied with water from this source. [...] Another pipeline, encased in concrete was found in 1857 by the Greestone Stairs, to the east of the wall, and this pipeline had presumably branched off from the aqueduct and supplied water to the Lower Colonia. Thompson calculated that it would be necessary <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> about 70 feet at the source at the ‘‘Roaring Meg’’ for there to be sufficient pressure for the water to reach the tank at the East Bight by the Newport Arch. This may imply that there was some form of water tower and the Romans may either have used some form of pump <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> or a revolving bucket and chain system.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the opening}} of the Mississippi that {{followed}} the capture of Vicksburg, Mound City had mostly small-scale operations to perform. The only exception was the Red River Expedition, described by one historian as the [...] "largest combined [...] operation to that point in U.S. military history, it {{was also one of the}} war's major military fiascoes." [...] Most of the Mississippi River Squadron were involved, but little naval action transpired. The most memorable incident concerning the Navy was the near-stranding of several of the ironclads owing to low water in the Red River. The operation had already been canceled and the fleet was in retreat down the river when Mound City, two of her sisters, three other ironclads, and two tugs were almost trapped at rapids above Alexandria, Louisiana. They were saved only by an impressive engineering feat, the construction of wing dams <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level high enough that the vessels could pass through.
