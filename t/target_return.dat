40|$|Contrary to past literature, {{ownership}} {{defined as}} "all officers and directors" {{of the target}} firm has no association with <b>target</b> <b>returns.</b> Rather, we find that inside (managerial) ownership has a positive relation with <b>target</b> <b>returns,</b> whereas active-outside (non-managing director) ownership has a negative relation with <b>target</b> <b>returns.</b> Using accounting-based versus market-based performance measures, {{we find that the}} relation between inside ownership and <b>target</b> <b>returns</b> is best explained by takeover anticipation. Using bidder and synergy returns we find that the relation between outside ownership and <b>target</b> <b>returns</b> is best explained by outsiders' willingness to share gains with the bidder.

50|$|In {{addition}} to any possible clutter {{there will also}} always be noise. The total signal competing with the <b>target</b> <b>return</b> is thus clutter plus noise. In practice there is often either no clutter or clutter dominates and the noise can be ignored. In the first case the radar {{is said to be}} Noise Limited, in the second it is Clutter Limited.|$|E

A larger ratio indicates that the asset provides more gains relative to losses for some threshold r and so would be preferred by an investor. When r is set to zero the Gain-Loss-Ratio by Bernardo and Ledoit arises as a special case.|$|E

50|$|The <b>target</b> <b>returns</b> Busy if it cannot {{complete}} a command at that time, {{for example if}} it is in the contingent allegiance condition.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the command}} sequence, the <b>target</b> <b>returns</b> a status code byte, such as 00h for success, 02h for an error (called a Check Condition), or 08h for busy. When the <b>target</b> <b>returns</b> a Check Condition in {{response}} to a command, the initiator usually then issues a SCSI Request Sense command in order to obtain a key code qualifier (KCQ) from the target. The Check Condition and Request Sense sequence involves a special SCSI protocol called a Contingent Allegiance Condition.|$|R
50|$|The Sortino {{ratio is}} used to score a portfolio's {{risk-adjusted}} returns relative to an investment target using downside risk. This {{is analogous to the}} Sharpe ratio, which scores risk-adjusted returns relative to the risk-free rate using standard deviation. When return distributions are near symmetrical and the <b>target</b> <b>return</b> is close to the distribution median, these two measure will produce similar results. As skewness increases and targets vary from the median, results can be expected to show dramatic differences.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} with the original AI radars was that the transmissions spread out over the entire front hemisphere of the aircraft. Shorter wavelengths, like those used in AI, tended to scatter from the ground, sending {{a portion of the}} signal back towards the aircraft, the ground reflection. For the simple reason that the ground is much larger than a target aircraft, the scattered signal overwhelmed any <b>target</b> <b>return,</b> and made it impossible to see any target further away than the aircraft's current altitude.|$|E
50|$|Integrated {{sidelobe}} return: ISAR {{image quality}} is degraded by range and azimuth compression side lobes. The sidelobes {{are due to}} data truncation and can be reduced by the application of appropriate window functions. The sidelobes can cause significant image degradation. First, the peaks of the stronger sidelobes may cause a string of progressively weaker targets to appear {{on either side of}} a strong target. Second, the combined power of all sidelobes tends to fog or washout detail in low RCS areas. The integrated sidelobe level can under poor conditions reach a level 10 dB below the peak <b>target</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E

5000|$|However, after {{launch the}} <b>target</b> <b>return</b> is at a minimum. While the launch {{platform}} {{may have no}} trouble picking up the signal from a distant target, the much smaller antenna in the missile may not be receiving enough of a signal to properly track. In these cases, some other form of guidance is used to get the missile into the range where the signal is stronger. Examples would be radio control (command guidance) or inertial guidance systems, which fly the missile closer to the target. In this role, these are known as [...] "midcourse guidance" [...] systems.|$|E
50|$|If the {{background}} against which targets {{are to be}} detected is constant with time and space, then a fixed threshold level can be chosen that provides a specified probability of false alarm, governed by the probability density function of the noise, which is usually assumed to be Gaussian. The probability of detection is then {{a function of the}} signal-to-noise ratio of the <b>target</b> <b>return.</b> However, in most fielded systems, unwanted clutter and interference sources mean that the noise level changes both spatially and temporally. In this case, a changing threshold can be used, where the threshold level is raised and lowered to maintain a constant probability of false alarm. This is known as constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection.|$|E

[...] Investment management robo-advice is considered a breakthrough in formerly exclusive wealth management services, bringing them to a broader audience with lower cost compared to traditional human advice. Robo-advisors typically allocate the customer property {{on the basis of}} their individual investment, risk preferences, and desired <b>target</b> <b>return.</b> While robo-advisors have the capability of allocating client assets in many investment products such as stocks, bonds, futures, commodities, real estate, the funds are often directed towards ETF portfolios. Clients can choose between offerings with passive asset allocation techniques or active asset management styles.|$|E

Results show that atmospheric-turbulence fluctuations can effectively be frozen for pulse separation times on the order of 1 - 3 msec or less. The diffuse <b>target</b> <b>returns,</b> however, yielded a much lower correlation than that obtained with the specular targets; this being due to uncorrelated system noise effects and different statistics for the two types of <b>target</b> <b>returns...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{second type}} of OTH radar uses much lower {{frequencies}}, in the longwave bands. Radio waves at these frequencies can diffract around obstacles and follow the curving contour of the Earth, traveling beyond the horizon. Echos reflected off the <b>target</b> <b>return</b> to the transmitter location by the same path. These ground waves have the longest range over the sea. Like the ionospheric high-frequency systems, the received signal from these ground wave systems is very low, and demands extremely sensitive electronics. Because these signals travel close to the surface, and lower frequencies produce lower resolutions, low-frequency systems are generally used for tracking ships, rather than aircraft. However, the use of bistatic techniques and computer processing can produce higher resolutions, and {{has been used as}} of 1990s.|$|E
50|$|A {{surplus of}} {{liabilities}} over assets creates {{the need to}} find efficient uses for those funds, i.e. a positive mismatch {{that is not a}} wrong signal (generally a rare scenario in a bank as the bank always has a <b>target</b> <b>return</b> on capital to achieve and so requires funds to be put to work by acquiring assets) but only means that the bank is sacrificing profits unnecessarily to achieve a liquidity position that is too liquid. This excess of liquidity can be deployed in money market instruments or risk-free assets such as government T-bills or bank certificate of deposit (CDs) if this liability excess belongs to bank's capital (the ALM desk will not take the risk of putting capital in a credit-risk investment).|$|E
50|$|When {{the object}} of the search is large enough and of {{suitable}} form to snag a dragged line, a snag-line may be used to speed up the process. The snag-line may be used with a pair of fixed jackstays or as a distance line for a circular search. It is often a weighted line, though there may be times when this is not required. The snag-line is held taut by the diver or divers, who will then drag it along the bottom as they either follow the jackstays or swim the arc until it hooks on something. When this happens the divers fasten their snag-line ends in position by tying them to the jackstays or pegging to the ground and swim along the snag-line to identify the target, If it is {{the object of}} the search, they will mark it, otherwise they free the line, move it over the <b>target,</b> <b>return</b> to their ends and continue the sweep.|$|E
