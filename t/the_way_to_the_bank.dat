500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} I was on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I {{was involved in this}} relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> and my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
500|$|The New Yorker Anthony Lane {{criticized the}} plot, saying [...] "toss {{everything}} you can find, starting with roughly diced plots, into the blender: such {{appears to be the}} method behind Tower Heist." [...] Lane called the characters [...] "unlikable people" [...] but offered praise to Broderick, saying he [...] "underplays [...] so well." [...] Lane lamented that [...] "the notion of a theft from the thieves from those who are lapped in lofty, screw-you wealth is a tempting one right now, but Tower Heist passes the buck." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge was also critical, saying the film [...] "goes wonky on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy their paychecks – namely, laughs." [...] Debruge felt that the opening 40 minutes were [...] "a dull blue-collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes," [...] and while the film [...] "picks up some much-needed momentum" [...] with the actual heist, the [...] "resolution feels rushed." [...] However, Debruge echoed praise for Murphy, calling his performance [...] "a welcome return to the comic's irreverent, '80s-era persona," [...] and lamenting his limited screen-time.|$|E
500|$|However, several {{critics were}} more {{positive}} towards the show. A number of publications welcomed {{the show as}} [...] "guilty pleasure", including The Huffington Post, The Atlantic, and The Week. Tim Stack, writing for Entertainment Weekly, described the reality series as: [...] "my favorite little slice of reality TV spongecake." [...] Lauren Le Vine of Refinery29 appreciated {{the success of the}} family which [...] "achieved the American dream of making something out of nothing," [...] using the given platform. Libby Hill of The A.V. Club also acknowledged the show's success and said: [...] "Keeping Up With The Kardashians gives us real, joyous, ugly, unsavory, hilarious life, with all the polished sitcom trappings. And though the latter may have launched a multimedia empire, the former has made it last". Maura Kelly of The Guardian evaluated the aftermath of the failed wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, which was documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and subsequently caused public outrage, including an online protest petition to cancel the show. [...] "Since Kim doesn't exactly seem to be an exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible that she really believed she and Humphries would live happily ever after," [...] Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a publicity stunt. [...] "But more likely, she and E! are laughing all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> [...] 10.5 million viewers tuned into [...] "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event", after all," [...] Kelly summarized the controversy. Josh Duboff, writing for Vanity Fair, commented on the show's long run and said that [...] "it is near impossible to argue that their continued relevance, 10 years later, is anything other than awe-inspiring and remarkable".|$|E

2500|$|The critics had a {{field day}} with his gimmicky act, his showy but careful piano playing, his {{non-stop}} promotions, and his gaudy display of success, but he remained largely unaffected, as preserved by the famous quotation, first recorded in a letter to a critic, [...] "Thank you for your very amusing review. After reading it, in fact, my brother George and I laughed {{all the way to the}} bank." [...] He used a similar response to subsequent poor reviews, famously modifying it to [...] "I cried all the way to the bank." [...] In an appearance on The Tonight Show some years later, Liberace reran the anecdote to Johnny Carson, and finished it by saying, [...] "I don't cry all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> any more – I [...] the bank!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Liberace sent a {{telegram}} that read: [...] "What you said hurt me very much. I cried {{all the way}} to the bank." [...] He sued the newspaper for libel, testifying in a London court that he was not homosexual and that he had never taken part in homosexual acts. He was represented in court by one of the great barristers of the period, 75 year old Gilbert Beyfus, QC, who displayed all his old flair despite being unwell. [...] They won the suit, partly on the basis of Connor's use of the derogatory expression [...] "fruit-flavoured". The case partly hinged on whether Connor knew that 'fruit' was American slang implying that an individual is a homosexual. After a three-week civil trial, a jury ruled in Liberace's favor on June 16, 1959 and awarded him £8,000 (around $22,400) in damages (worth about £ or $ today) which led Liberace to repeat the catchphrase to reporters: [...] "I cried {{all the way to}} the bank!" [...] Liberace's popularization of the phrase inspired the title of Crying All <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank,</b> a detailed report of the trial based on transcripts, court reports, and interviews, by the former Daily Mirror journalist Revel Barker.|$|E

The argument is that anyone can sniff the traffic applies to wired networks too, where system administrators and possible hackers have access to the links and can read the traffic. Also, anyone knowing the keys for an encrypted wireless network can gain access to the data being transferred over the network.|$|E
