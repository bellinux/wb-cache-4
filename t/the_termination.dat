5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that <b>the</b> <b>Termination</b> Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were not protected by <b>the</b> <b>Termination</b> Act, so they were lost. Stewart did note that this would have also made the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it or not. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E

40|$|Empiric {{analysis}} of the sector of non-financial corporations in the Czech Republic shows history of their <b>terminations</b> during <b>the</b> period 1995 – 2011. The purpose was to observe, what differences in <b>the</b> evolution of <b>terminations</b> (bankruptcies) of companies are connected with the predominant form of their ownership (only legal persons were analysed). Therefore, selected methods of <b>the</b> companies´ <b>terminations</b> were monitored according {{to a group of}} legal persons with prevailing domestic private capital and also group with predominance of the public capital. Also, the firms under foreign control were analysed. The companies with prevailing private domestic capital have dominated due to their largest number. However, the foreign-controlled companies have showed faster pace of <b>the</b> <b>terminations</b> during <b>the</b> analysed period and also their greater sensitivity to the economic cycle has been demonstrated. Liquidation was the most common method of <b>the</b> companies´ <b>termination</b> (roughly two-thirds {{of the total number of}} terminations in 2011).

40|$|The {{multi-port}} {{method for}} {{the measurement of}} the scattering parameters of multi-ports {{with the help of}} a vector network analyzer (VNA) with only two measurement ports is presented. For the measurements only two ports of the N-port device can be connected to the two ports of the VNA at a time. The remaining N - 2 ports of the device under test (DUT) are connected to external terminations. As these external terminations might be mismatched, the measured scattering parameters depend on the reflective characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>terminations.</b> An error correction becomes necessary in order to calculate the effective scattering parameters of the DUT (Tippet and Speciale, 1982; Lu and Chu, 2003). In contrast to the correction method of Tippet and Speciale (1982), the multi-port method has the advantage, that <b>the</b> external <b>terminations</b> can be chosen arbitrarily. Thus, a realization as an open or short circuit is possible as well. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>terminations</b> can be unknown except for one, similar to self-calibration procedures of VNAs. This helps to improve the accuracy of the measurements, because the inconsistency problem due to a slightly erroneous knowledge of the frequency characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>terminations</b> can be eliminated...|$|R
