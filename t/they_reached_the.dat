5|$|Ajax {{had little}} success in European {{competition}} {{prior to their}} meeting with Liverpool. They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup twice during the 1960–61 and 1961–62 seasons, but did not progress past the first round either time. Liverpool had only participated in European competition during the previous two season, but they had more success than Ajax. Their first season of competition in 1964–65 <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> semi-finals of the European Cup, losing to eventual winners Internazionale. The following season <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> final of the European Cup Winners' Cup, however, they lost 2–1 against German team Borussia Dortmund.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams had}} to pass through five rounds before <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> final. They both entered in the third {{qualifying}} round and won their respective groups before <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> knockout stage, where matches were contested over two legs, with a match at each team's home ground. Milan's victories varied from close affairs to comfortable victories. They defeated Celtic by a single goal over two legs, while they beat Manchester United 5–3 on aggregate in the semi-final. Liverpool's matches were mainly all close affairs; they beat defending champions Barcelona on the away goals rule in the first knockout round and beat Chelsea in a penalty shootout in the semi-finals, although they did record a 4–0 aggregate win over PSV Eindhoven in the quarter-finals.|$|E

The club joined the Birmingham & District Football Association in 1881 and became eligible for their first competition, the Birmingham Cup. <b>They</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way. In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the Staffordshire Cup. Albion joined the Football Association in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} the 1883–84 season. In 1885 the club turned professional, and in 1886 <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> FA Cup final for the first time, losing 2–0 to Blackburn Rovers in a replay. <b>They</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> final again in 1887, but lost 2–0 to Aston Villa.

They {{would go on to}} win the European Cup three consecutive times in the early 1970s. The match represents Liverpool's record defeat in European competition.|$|E
