5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed <b>toward</b> <b>more</b> tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century, René Descartes' {{mechanical}} philosophy encouraged the use of the metaphor of the universe as a machine, a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution. Between 1650 and 1800, some naturalists, such as Benoît de Maillet, produced theories that maintained that the universe, the Earth, and life, had developed mechanically, without divine guidance. In contrast, most contemporary theories of evolution, such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried Herder, regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered <b>toward</b> <b>more</b> materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species, a description that anticipated in general terms the concept of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the floods, the {{government}} of Yemen sought help from the International Development Association to prevent future floods from being as damaging. The government created an Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project that was geared <b>toward</b> <b>more</b> long term solutions. Thousands of farmers benefited from the improved irrigation and from the employment opportunities. Roads and bridges were rebuilt to a higher construction standard using local builders and contractors, the first such occurrence in the country using competitive bidding. The project was completed in December 2001 {{at a cost of}} US$31.59million; the International Development Association paid US$27.44million, and Yemen's government provided the rest of the funding.|$|E
5|$|Magnapop {{have been}} defined genre-wise as power pop by {{multiple}} rock critics, and their performances have drawn comparisons with punk, new wave, and surf rock. Reviewers have {{commented on the}} band's pop-influenced songwriting, specifically their employment of guitar hooks and simple chord structure. To that end, they have been compared to Mould's previous work {{as a member of}} Sugar and Hüsker Dü, as well as fellow Georgia-based rock acts such as Guadalcanal Diary and Let's Active and alternative rock pioneers Pixies and The Replacements. The album Rubbing Doesn't Help represented a stylistic shift for the band away from their more pop-inspired material <b>toward</b> <b>more</b> guitar-oriented rock, but their comeback with Mouthfeel returned to the more pop-inspired sound of Hot Boxing.|$|E

5|$|On September28, 1898, island {{stations}} in the Lesser Antilles indicated {{the presence of a}} tropical cyclone, which was confirmed by the next day. Modern researchers determined that the system developed on September25 about 220miles (350km) east of Guadeloupe. For most of its duration, the system maintained a northwest track, reaching hurricane status on September27. Later that day, a barometric pressure of 977mbar, suggesting winds of 90mph (150km/h). Its intensification rate slowed on September28, before strengthening continued on October1. The winds reached 115mph (185km/h), which is the equivalent of a major hurricane, or Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Around that time, the hurricane turned <b>toward</b> <b>more</b> to the west-northwest, due to a large ridge across the western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the GameCube {{failed to}} reinvigorate {{flagging}} support from third parties, a trend continued from the Nintendo 64 through its successor, the Wii. The Wii had mostly relied on first-party titles to sell systems until 2009 when in-house development {{could not keep}} up with demand for new material. This caused sales to drop and prompted a shift <b>toward</b> <b>more</b> aggressive courting of third-party developers. Despite this, the Wii would go on {{to become one of the}} most commercially successful home video game consoles of all time. For the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo has attempted to recruit outside developers early on to avoid a repeat of what happened to the Wii and reclaim the third-party support it enjoyed in the NES and SNES eras, though its success in this regard has been mixed.|$|E
