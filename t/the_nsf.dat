5|$|The National Science Foundation awarded Florida State University {{the right}} in 1990 to host the new National High Magnetic Field Laboratory rather than improve the {{existing}} Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory controlled by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) together with a consortium of other universities. The award of the laboratory was contested by MIT in an unprecedented request to <b>the</b> <b>NSF</b> {{for a review of}} the award. <b>The</b> <b>NSF</b> denied the appeal, explaining that the superior enthusiasm for and commitment to the project demonstrated by Florida State led to the decision to relocate the lab.|$|E

25|$|To tie-in {{with the}} {{establishment}} of the National Safety Agency, the NPR was restructured as <b>the</b> <b>NSF,</b> with Hayashi becoming Chief of the 1st (Ground) Staff (later became known as Chief of Staff, Ground Self-Defense Force) to head the First Staff Office, which was the top decision making body of <b>the</b> <b>NSF.</b> In September 1952, he was appointed to a newly formed high-level planning committee in the capacity of Chief of the 1st Staff. Other members of the committee included Chief of the 2nd Staff (later became known as Chief of Staff, Maritime Self-Defense Force) and other senior officials of the National Safety Agency. The objective of the committee was to formulate long-term military planning for Japan. Besides, units and formations in NSF expanded considerably under the command of Hayashi. New units, such as the Northern Army, were formed, while the National Safety Academy and <b>the</b> <b>NSF</b> Aviation School were both founded in 1952.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} recoup its {{position}} {{as an active}} force in science education, <b>the</b> <b>NSF</b> prepared a report in 1980 entitled Science and Engineering Education for the 1980s and Beyond to the Carter administration. Unfortunately (for NSF) Carter was defeated, and the new president, Ronald Reagan rejected the reports recommendations, and tried to eliminate the science education section of NSF, and during the early 80s, the influence of NSF in science education was limited to college faculty improvement and graduate student fellowships in the basic sciences.|$|E
25|$|There were {{setbacks}} in {{the growth}} of the university. In 1967, the Rutgers Physics Department had a Centers of Excellence Grant from <b>the</b> <b>NSF</b> which allowed the Physics Department to hire several faculty each year and become a more prominent institution. These faculty were to be paid by the grant for three years, but after that time any faculty hired with the Associate or Full Professor designation would become tenured.

50|$|Since Independence, Vanuatu has {{participate}}d in all editions of the Pacific Games from 1983 in Samoa and Pacific Mini-Games since 1981 in Solomon Islands. However the Government ordered VASF and VNOC {{not participate in the}} 1987 Games in New Caledonia in protest over the territory’s independence from France. The government-funded VASF which made up most of <b>the</b> <b>NSFs</b> abided by <b>the</b> government decision. However, the newly formed VNOC saw this as political interference and led by the then VNOC (and also VFF) President, Mr Kalman Kiri, defied the decision and sent the football team to compete. This team was tagged “rebel team” by the government. This not only resulted in the government withdrawing funds for Inter-District Games and for <b>the</b> <b>NSFs</b> in VASF but also resulted in <b>the</b> need for <b>NSFs</b> to merge both VASF and VNOC into one main national sports body. In 1990 {{and with the help of}} IOC and ONOC, VASANOC was formed. At the first AGM in March 1991 the VASANOC Constitution was officially approved and adopted and recognized by the IOC, Government and ONOC. Only 10 NSFs were affiliated to VASANOC when it was formed even though during the years of the Pacific Games, membership increases. Now VERSION has over 25 National Federations in its membership. <b>The</b> 8 <b>NSFs</b> that are organized into Associations, Leagues and Clubs in the rural areas are Athletics, Basketball, Boxing, Football, Handball, Karate, Netball and Volleyball even though the frequency of activities in the provinces differs greatly for each sport. <b>The</b> <b>NSFs</b> operate under their own Constitutions and abide by the Rules and Regulations established by their ISFs and or OSFs.|$|R

25|$|After the 1989 revolution, the National Salvation Front (NSF), led by Ion Iliescu, took partial multi-party {{democratic}} and free market measures. In April 1990, a sit-in protest contesting {{the results of}} the elections and accusing <b>the</b> <b>NSF,</b> including Iliescu, of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate — rapidly grew to become what was called the Golaniad. The peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence, prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by Iliescu. This episode has been documented widely by both local and foreign media, and is remembered as the June 1990 Mineriad.|$|E
