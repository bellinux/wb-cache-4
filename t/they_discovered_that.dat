5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{psychological}} profile, the Garda broadcast an appeal for information on the RTÉ television programme Crimeline with a request for people whose houses had been broken into in the Grangegorman area to contact them. After interviewing a number of people involved in burglary, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Dean Lyons had been talking about the killings. Lyons matched the facial composite released by the gardaí and he was questioned on 26 July 1997.|$|E
5|$|By 1998, Meredith's team {{realized}} that Plavac Mali was not Zinfandel {{but rather that}} one was the parent of the other. In 2000 <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Primitivo/Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali. The other parent of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Pejić and Edi Maletić (University of Zagreb) to be Dobričić, an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of Šolta.|$|E
5|$|Investigators' suspicions {{began to}} turn to Stella Nickell when <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> she claimed that the two {{contaminated}} Excedrin bottles that she had turned over to police had been purchased at different times and different locations. A total of five bottles had {{been found to be}} contaminated in the entire country, and it was regarded as suspicious that Nickell would happen to have acquired two of them purely by chance.|$|E

5|$|The French {{authorities}} {{suspected that}} there was a conspiracy to murder Shaftesbury, when <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Mme M'Barek transferred €150,000 into her brother's bank account the week following her husband's disappearance. The prosecution viewed this as payment for services rendered, although Mme M'Barek testified that she had given her brother the money in order for him to buy a house for their ailing mother.|$|E
5|$|Weakened {{from breast}} cancer and her {{treatment}} regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964. Her condition worsened, and in February, doctors found that she had severe anemia from her radiation treatments and in March <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the cancer had reached her liver. She {{died of a heart}} attack on April 14, 1964, in her home in Silver Spring, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|While in Washington, Lead Belly {{encountered}} {{several other}} incidents of segregation that {{are believed to}} have contributed to the impetus of the song. For instance, when Lead Belly, Lomax, and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead Belly was told that if he returned later without Lomax, he would be served.|$|E

50|$|However, {{they have}} greater problems- there are Nazis after them. After {{escaping}} three Nazi planes, <b>they</b> <b>discover</b> several Nazis {{and a dog}} are chasing them. They hide in a barn, and Annie gently strokes the dog, a German Shepherd named Fritz- which calms down and does not betray their location. <b>They</b> <b>discover</b> {{two members of the}} French Resistance-Gaston and Suzette, and share a meal with them. <b>They</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> the couple's sons- Tom and Theo- were captured in Paris by the Nazis.

5|$|After {{spending}} {{several days}} sight seeing around Paris, the All Blacks returned to London. Instead {{of returning to}} New Zealand directly, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> New Zealand Prime Minister Richard Seddon had organised for the team to travel home via the United States. Although the team wanted to return home immediately, Seddon insisted. The All Blacks had two weeks before they departed. Many of them stayed with friends of relatives, while Stead and Gallaher wrote The Complete Rugby Footballer. The team reassembled on 19 January and were farewelled by a dinner with the London New Zealand Society before departing Southampton on the SS New York the next day.|$|E
5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> {{the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its {{communist}} allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed {{to indicate that the}} enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before the launching of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E
5|$|Barbera and {{his wife}} briefly {{separated}} {{when he went to}} California. They reunited but {{were on the verge of}} another separation when <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Dorothy was pregnant with their first child. They had 4 children: two sons (Neal and an infant boy who died two days after his birth) and two daughters (Lynn and Jayne). The marriage officially ended in 1963. Shortly after his divorce, Barbera met his second wife, Sheila Holden, at Musso & Frank's restaurant, where she worked as bookkeeper and cashier. Unlike Dorothy, who had preferred to stay at home with the children, Sheila enjoyed the Hollywood social scene that Barbera often frequented.|$|E

50|$|The balloon carries them westwards {{across the}} U.S., and it isn't long before <b>they</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are over the Pacific Ocean. A storm arises; the balloon tears open and leaks a {{significant}} amount of gas, forcing it into descending and eventually running aground near the shore of an unknown island. The following morning the men reunite and begin to explore the strange island they find themselves on. <b>They</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> the island has lush tropical jungles, harsh plains, and many volcanoes which frequently erupt.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. <b>They</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. <b>They</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. <b>They</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E
25|$|Their {{conversation}} {{is interrupted by}} the sound of a gunshot from the chief judge's office. Racing to the scene, <b>they</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> Volt has shot himself dead.|$|R

5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found {{that a combination of}} pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after this}} incident, {{the family moved}} from the Ardennes to Brussels after a message from their father that the {{financial}} problems had ended. When they reached Brussels {{they found that the}} situation was actually worse than previously, and the family moved between cheap hotels, each one worse than the one before. Desperate for a job, Hastings accepted the offer of an apprenticeship with an English engineer who claimed to have made a machine to extract gold in North Wales. After {{about a year and a}} half of work <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> there was no gold to be found in that part of Wales, and Hastings was informed that his services would no longer be needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to call}} the album Abracadabra, until <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> another band had already used it. When discussing possible alternatives, during their German tour, Lennon opted for Four Sides to the Circle in response to McCartney's Magic Circle, and Starr jokingly suggested After Geography, a play on {{the title of the}} Rolling Stones' recently released Aftermath LP. Other suggestions included Bubble and Squeak, Beatles on Safari and Pendulum before the band settled on Revolver. They confirmed their choice in a telegram to EMI, sent from the Tokyo Hilton on 2 July.|$|E

After visiting the local {{elementary}} school a few times, they share their worries for their child. Fran and Kal know that their baby will face discrimination because of society's views on lesbian families, but hope that their {{love for each other}} and their child will be enough. After three attempts to get pregnant, they go to a doctor to help them conceive. Shortly afterwards <b>they</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> Fran is pregnant.|$|R

5|$|The mission's only Extra-Vehicular Activity, or spacewalk, {{took place}} on May 12, between 10:44 and 15:36 UTC. The primary {{objectives}} of the spacewalk were to repair damage to Mir's exterior components and record panoramas of the station's hull in order for experts on Earth to analyze the effects of space on the station itself. The cosmonauts inspected a malfunctioning solar array on the Kvant-1 module of the station. <b>They</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> a burnt-through wire connecting the array with its steering system was preventing its proper rotation. The array was subsequently deemed a loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} sent to Prince who agreed to voice the {{character}} and sent back a page of notes about what he would be wearing in various scenes. The writers were confused when the notes did not correspond to the script and <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Prince was referring to a script that had been written by someone else. Prince disliked the Simpsons writers' script and demanded the other one be made into an episode, but the writers refused. The episode eventually fell through and never made it past written form. It {{became one of the}} few completed scripts never to be produced.|$|E
5|$|Bowie and {{his brother}} John were {{involved}} in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, <b>they</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case.|$|E
