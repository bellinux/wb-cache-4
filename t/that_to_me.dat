5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? <b>That</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is the basic issue.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. <b>That</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at <b>that.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> it was never something that happened to those other people." ...|$|E

500|$|A self-confessed 'dreamer' with {{a romantic}} sensibility, Skirth was {{very fond of}} literature, and in {{particular}} poetry; he took {{with him to the}} Western Front a much-annotated copy of Francis Turner Palgrave's Golden Treasury. His favourite poets were John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. He had an intense love of beauty, which he found all around him in music, architecture and the natural world. [...] On the Western Front, he wrote, he was [...] "deprived of the one thing <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was as precious as life itself, my love of beauty".|$|E

Then the push truck pushed me around and to see them all the way down (the frontstretch) doing that, I was like, ‘I don't know if I've ever experienced something like that.’ And <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> made it all worth it right there to have that feeling," [...] said Gordon of his triumph.|$|E
500|$|Hand is also {{remembered as}} a pioneer of modern {{approaches}} to statutory interpretation. His decisions in specialist fields, such as patents, torts, admiralty law, and antitrust law, set lasting standards for craftsmanship and clarity. On constitutional matters, he was both a political progressive and an advocate of judicial restraint. He believed in the protection of free speech and in bold legislation to address social and economic problems. He argued, however, that the United States Constitution does not empower courts to overrule the legislation of elected bodies, except in extreme circumstances. Instead, he advocated the [...] "combination of toleration and imagination <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{is the epitome of}} all good government".|$|E
500|$|He {{said that}} his {{performance}} in [...] "I, Borg" [...] was driven by the memories of watching a childhood friend die, and the innocence that he felt given to his friends memory over time; [...] "When I first read the script.

[...] Following his appearance in the episode, he later pitched a couple of story ideas to the producers to feature the return of Hugh. He was happy when the character later returned in the [...] finale/ opener [...] "", which he felt was similar to his previous ideas.|$|E

[...] Along with Westfeldt, Hamm has appeared in Gap-related campaign advertisements. During April 2009, Hamm and Westfeldt formed their own production company, Points West Pictures. Hamm and Westfeldt are advocates of animal rescue and have adopted a mixed breed dog named Cora from the Much Love Animal Shelter in California.|$|E

Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E

It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered Poltergeist. There's not an ounce of my own personal feeling in Temple of Doom." [...] He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, [...] "Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, 'Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw.'

500|$|Quesada sees Peter's {{making a}} [...] "deal with the Devil" [...] as a villain (Mephisto) taking {{advantage}} of someone at his weakest moment. This, he feels, is a better resolution than Peter and Mary Jane getting divorced, which would indicate [...] "they gave up on their love, that their life in love together was so awful, so stressful, so unfulfilling {{that they had to}} raise a red flag and walk away from it. They quit on their marriage and even more tragic, (they) quit on each other. Instead, we had them make a deal with the devil. [...] 'Cause that isn't as bad." [...] Quesada went on to say, [...] "Peter and MJ didn't quit on their love, they sacrificed it to save a life, <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is a pretty heroic story." ...|$|E

In that scene, Tim Canterbury proclaims his love for Dawn Tinsley in a meeting room, but Tim turns off his microphone first so the cameras pick up only their reactions and no sound. Celotta said of the scene, [...] "We are all big fans of the moment that Tim takes off his mic and tells Dawn how he feels.

500|$|In June 2013, Clark Gregg {{explained}} how the series would tie into the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: [...] "...the exciting part {{is going to}} be seeing the way that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in , and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show." [...] Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from The Avengers, saying [...] "It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think." [...] He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, explaining [...] "It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent ... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> is that they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [...] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2014, PewDiePie updated {{his video}} {{production}} output, announcing {{he would be}} scaling down the frequency of uploads. In August 2014, Maker Studios released an official PewDiePie app for the iPhone, allowing audiences to view his videos, create custom favourite video feeds and share videos with others. Later in the month, PewDiePie uploaded a video, announcing he would permanently disable comments on his YouTube videos. On his decision, PewDiePie stated [...] "I go to the comments and it's mainly spam, it's people self advertising, it's people trying to provoke... just all this stuff <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> it doesn't mean anything.

[...] In Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach. According to a famous story now believed to be fictional, after seeing a telegram from a magazine editor to his agent asking, [...] "How old Cary Grant?", Grant reportedly responded, [...] "Old Cary Grant fine. How you?" [...] Despite his strong comedic qualities, Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles, with a mysterious, dangerous quality, remarking that [...] "there is a frightening side to Cary {{that no one can}} quite put their finger on". Wansell notes that this darker, mysterious side extended to his personal life, which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image.|$|E
