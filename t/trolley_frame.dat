50|$|In {{electric}} trainsets released in 1965 N. E. Galakhov's amortizers are changed by cylindrical springs. The same time hydraulic amortizers are installed between <b>trolley</b> <b>frame</b> edges, and upper beam above the amortizer. The static deformation of amortizing system is increased from 95 mm up to 120 mm. The body weight is transmitted to improved trolleys through edge sliders, while ______ serves only for transmitting horizontal forces.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} model {{predictive}} control principally Based Predictive Control (MPC). The first part describes {{the principle of}} predictive control, cost function, {{the choice of a}} constraints in regulation and the choice of weights. In the next section is an analysis system: a system with non-minimal phase (control water turbine), oscillating systems (<b>trolley</b> <b>frame</b> control) and system with a time-delay. In all of these systems is performed classical feedback control using PID control and concurrently regulation with the MPC. MPC is selected as the solution fy Mathworks Model Predictive Control Toolbox and Simulink. The results are then analyzed using the criteria of quality control...|$|E
5000|$|Electric {{traction}} {{engines are}} installed on bogie frames, as in ER2 motor cars. The engine's shaft {{is connected with}} the minor gear train using a jaw clutch. The speed reduction couple's body is anchored {{on a pair of}} wheels through friction reducer made of rolls. From the side of minor gear train, the speed reduction couple is suspended from the <b>trolley's</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
50|$|He began custom {{fabrication}} in the 1960s {{and built}} the Mantaray (from Bikini Beach; 1963), Black Beauty (from the The Green Hornet), the Monkeemobile, the Landmaster from Damnation Alley; (1977), the moon buggy (that James Bond steals in Diamonds Are Forever), the <b>trolley</b> (from Who <b>Framed</b> Roger Rabbit). Jeffries is also an expert on dune buggies, produced his own models, and has contributed to books about them. He did all of the custom fabrication work on the movie Convoy in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he rented the shop from Burns Truck & Parts.|$|R
50|$|The {{souvenir}} shop is in {{the entrance}} / exit area to the museum itself and is accessed via Station Road {{at the foot of}} the platform. The shop has a small range of memorabilia including books, postcards, stationery, ephemera, replica nameplates and generic souvenirs. The stock of the shop is now a fraction of what was available in the boom of the centenary seasons beginning with the Year of Railways in 1993 and extending to Steam 125 in 1998. A nominal admission price is charged for entry and the opening times tie in with the operational dates of the railway itself. The shop {{is in the}} old goods shed and features a station-type building as a staff/store room as well as old luggage <b>trolleys</b> and <b>framed</b> displays before entering the museum proper. The museum is open daily throughout the summer months, at the same time as the railway which is usually between March and the beginning of November each year. A small admission price is charged for entry for those not in possession of a valid railway ticket.|$|R
5000|$|The {{equipment}} {{first used}} by the Maryborough Fire Brigade Board was very basic. They used a two-wheeled <b>trolley</b> on a <b>frame,</b> which they had to pull {{to the site of}} the fire themselves. The trolley contained a hand pump, a water barrel and a large hose and reel. By 1885 the Maryborough Fire Brigade Board had purchased the best fire-fighting equipment available. It included a horse-drawn vehicle which carried men, hoses, axes and other equipment and an expensive horse-drawn steam-powered pump that had been built in England. This machine was named [...] "Progress" [...] because it was the most modern machine of its type in Australia at that time.|$|R
5000|$|The zip-line <b>trolley</b> is the <b>frame</b> or {{assembly}} {{together with}} the pulley(s) also known as sheave(s) inside that run along the cable. (The term [...] "trolley" [...] is more often used when this assembly consists {{of more than a}} single pulley with simple hanger and bearing.) Often more than one pulley is used to spread the load over more than one spot on the cable, to reduce cable bending stresses that may lead to metal fatigue and cable breakage. This also reduces any tendency of a pulley to twist sideways and run off the cable, with disastrous results. In addition, the trolley is usually shaped with guards to hold the cable in the groove(s) of the pulley(s).|$|R
40|$|This paper studies a new {{automated}} {{container terminal}} (ACT) system which utilizes multistory frame bridges and rail-mounted trolleys to transport containers between the quay and the yard. Beside typical ACT systems use trucks or automated guided vehicles for transporting containers between quay cranes and yard cranes, {{the new design}} uses three types of handling machines, namely, ground trolleys (GTs), transfer platforms (TPs), and <b>frame</b> <b>trolleys</b> (FTs). These three types of handling machines collaborate with one another to transport containers. This study decomposes the system into several subsystems. Each subsystem has one TP and several FTs and GTs dedicated to this TP. Then, a Markov chain model is developed to analyze the throughput of TPs. At last, {{the performance of the}} new ACT system is estimated. Sensitivity analyzes the numbers, and the processing rates of trolleys are conducted through the numeric experiments...|$|R
