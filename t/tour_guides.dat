5|$|Carabane {{has many}} {{historic}} sites, {{such as the}} Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since {{been turned into a}} hotel, a Brittany-style church building which is no longer in use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing {{up in front of the}} sea, according to his last wishes. Some <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> falsely claim that this was Auguste Léopold Protet, the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Tour</b> <b>guide</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role for achieving the overall service quality of a tourism supply chain. The service quality of <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> can be improved by promoting service effort & service ability that are asymmetric information to travel agency. Two types of incentive contracts are commonly used by travel agency to motivate <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> improving the service quality. These are a pooling contract distinguishing service efforts and a menu contract distinguishing service efforts and service abilities. The results of analyzing and simulating show that the menu contract dominates the pooling contract. The menu contract can not only screen service abilities of <b>tour</b> <b>guide,</b> but also motivate <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> to improve service efforts. Moreover, in menu contract, the utilities of travel agency are increased, the employment of <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> can be improved, the relation between travel agency and <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> is strengthened and the service quality of tourism is enhanced.

The museum features role playing <b>tour</b> <b>guides,</b> as well as a large crafts center. The Nye Barn, a replica of a 1627 farming homestead in Plymouth, is also part of the museum. The farm features several animals that would have been found in Plymouth Colony, but are very rare in modern times.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{commenced}} in Toraja in the 1970s, {{and accelerated}} in the 1980s and 1990s. Between 1984 and 1997, {{a significant number}} of Torajans obtained their incomes from tourism, working in and owning hotels, as <b>tour</b> <b>guides,</b> drivers, or selling souvenirs. With the rise of political and economic instability in Indonesia in the late 1990s—including religious conflicts elsewhere on Sulawesi—tourism in Tana Toraja has declined dramatically. Toraja continues to be a well known origin for Indonesian coffee, grown by both smallholders and plantation estates, although migration, remittances and off-farm income is considered far more important to most households, even those in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga {{received}} 97,847 {{visitors in}} 2011. Visitors to the World Heritage Site are charged a fee (10,000 ariary for foreigners and 400 ariary for locals), which is largely {{used to pay}} for the preservation of the site. The commune of Ambohimanga Rova is a small but thriving rural village that lives on agriculture and services provided to tourists and pilgrims who visit the royal city. Multilingual <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been negatively affected at the site {{as a consequence of the}} 2009 Malagasy political crisis; management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the tombs}} are {{not open to}} the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in the tombs.|$|E
5|$|Neither Burch nor Smith {{had owned}} the cave or {{the land around}} it, which belonged to the public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal {{government}} began regulating {{the use of public}} lands like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated millions of acres of forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as <b>tour</b> <b>guides.</b>|$|E

40|$|Fifty {{years since}} the first {{publication}} on <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> it is timely to assess the state-of-the-art of theoretical and empirical {{research in this field}} to identify research strengths and opportunities. Based on a bibliometric and content analysis of 280 published scholarly works, a number of trends, patterns and gaps in <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> research were uncovered. About half were journal papers with the majority of authors based in either Australia or the US. Key themes were identified including the role of the guide as communicator/interpreter, the guide’s contribution to sustainability, visitors’ expectations of and satisfaction with their guide, and the use of <b>tour</b> <b>guide</b> training and other mechanisms for fostering quality. Most studies were located in Australia, China/Hong Kong/Taiwan, the US and Europe. In addition to highlighting the need for more theory when investigating <b>tour</b> <b>guiding,</b> many avenues for future research were identified that can underpin quality <b>tour</b> <b>guiding</b> practice...|$|R

5|$|Tourism to Costa Rica {{was down}} sharply {{during the first}} half of June 2013. Jorge Molina, {{president}} of The Southern Caribbean Tourism Chamber, said Mora's death was affecting reservations and would likely continue to do so for several months. Aurora Gámez, who owns an Manzanillo Beach hotel, said her occupancy rate normally runs at 50% in June, but was at just 10% in the weeks after Mora's death. She said she had received cancellations that specifically cited Mora's death as a factor. Cahuita hotel owner Eddie Ryan echoed Gámez, saying he had two patrons cite Mora's death when cancelling. Restaurants, bars, <b>tour</b> <b>guides,</b> and transportation companies were also affected. Some entrepreneurs blamed WIDECAST for the lost business saying the organization was aware of the risks but continued to patrol anyway.|$|E
5|$|Palau's {{interaction}} with Japan was {{kept to a}} minimal level during the post-war years, although Okinawan fishermen occasionally visited Palau for catches from the 1960s onwards. A few Japanese nationals resettled in Palau in the 1970s, and married local Palauans. In the 1980s, Japanese businessmen set up businesses in Palau, and by 1995 there were 218 Japanese nationals residing in Palau. Of these, {{about half of them}} expressed a desire for permanent residency in Palau and a few married Palauan or Filipino women. However, the majority brought their families from Japan along, and maintained frequent contacts with Japan. Some settlers from the 1980s also consisted of former Japanese settlers who were repatriated back to Japan after World War II. Former settlers who returned to Palau usually consisted of individuals over 60 years of age, and often worked as <b>tour</b> <b>guides</b> or restaurateurs in Palau.|$|E
