5|$|At this point, Lenin {{and many}} other Bolsheviks were expecting proletarian {{revolution}} <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> across Europe, either {{in the coming days}} or, at most, in the coming months.|$|E
5|$|By 11 February, the Jurong-Kranji Defence Line {{was left}} undefended which allowed the Japanese forces <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> through the Line to attack Bukit Timah. On the same day, Percival finally moved his Combined Operations Headquarters in Sime Road to the {{underground}} bunker, The Battle Box at Fort Canning.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard {{represented}} Team USA in the 1998 World Lacrosse Championship. Hubbard {{also played}} in the National Lacrosse League for the Baltimore Thunder (1999), Pittsburgh CrosseFire (2000) and Washington Power (2001). In 1999, he was named NLL Rookie of the Year. In the 1999 World Cup, Hubbard scored a goal to give Team USA and 87 lead over Team Canada in a 2010 victory <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the event.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} found a strong {{correlation}} between pitch discrimination ability and neural synchrony <b>to</b> tonal <b>sweeps</b> for normal-hearing people. Pitch discrimination was measured by a behavioral JND paradigm for FMDL, and the neural synchrony was indexed by the fidelity of scalp-recorded FFRs <b>to</b> rising <b>sweeps.</b> These results indicated that the two objective indices of FFRs <b>to</b> tonal <b>sweep</b> could be used to predict listener’s subjective FMDL. The proposed method of this study is worthy to apply on hearing-impaired listeners to testify its feasibility for clinical diagnosis studies in future.|$|R
5000|$|In Muay Thai, the {{stand-up}} clinch {{is effectively}} utilized. However, its grappling attacks are limited <b>to</b> <b>sweeps,</b> as the clinch is mainly used {{for setting up}} uppercuts and strikes from the knees and elbows. The primary clinch in this art {{is known as the}} Thai Plum or the Collar Tie.|$|R
30|$|Asymptotic trends were {{observed}} for both indices (PS and MI). The fidelity of FFRs <b>to</b> <b>sweeps</b> nearly reached saturation {{when the number}} of running-sweeps exceeded 600 (300 for each polarities), indicating the efficiency of using these two metrics as real-time monitors of the neural encoding for tonal sweeps, and the potential for clinical application.|$|R
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{backlash}} against the external environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic movement. Famines continued <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the globe through the 20th century. Through the effects of climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the 1920s and the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Operation Camargue {{was one of}} {{the largest}} {{operations}} by the French Far East Expeditionary Corps and Vietnamese National Army in the First Indochina War. It took place from 28 July until 10 August 1953. French armored platoons, airborne units and troops delivered by landing craft to the coast of central Annam, modern-day Vietnam, attempted <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> forces of the communist Viet Minh from the critical Route One.|$|E
5|$|When the Vipers {{began the}} playoffs {{on the road}} against the Maine Red Claws on April 11, White did not travel with the team. The Vipers went on <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> all three playoff series, but White did not play with the team. Over {{the course of the}} season, White {{traveled}} using a bus provided by the Rockets for 15 road games.|$|E
5000|$|Forward swept: {{the wing}} angles {{forward from the}} root. Benefits are similar <b>to</b> {{backwards}} <b>sweep,</b> also it avoids the stall problems and has reduced tip losses allowing a smaller wing, but requires even greater stiffness to avoid aeroelastic flutter as on the Sukhoi Su-47. The HFB-320 Hansa Jet used forward <b>sweep</b> <b>to</b> prevent the wing spar passing through the cabin. Small shoulder-wing aircraft may use forward <b>sweep</b> <b>to</b> maintain a correct CoG.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{became the}} only nation <b>to</b> ever <b>sweep</b> the ladies' podium at a World Championships.|$|R
30|$|Polymer {{makes the}} alkaline-polymer {{solution}} more viscous <b>to</b> improve <b>sweep</b> efficiency. Thus, polymer “brings” alkaline {{solution to the}} oil zone where the alkali cannot go without polymer. More oil can be displaced by lowered IFT owing to alkali-generated soap. In other words, alkali and polymer work together <b>to</b> improve both <b>sweep</b> efficiency and displacement efficiency.|$|R
5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder guns <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area {{was used as a}} bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|After the Gas Boom began <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> {{the state}} in the 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{started the}} first game of the 2007 American League Championship Series (ALCS) and pitched six innings for the win and in game five he struck out 11 in eight innings. Beckett's 2–0 record and 1.93 ERA against the Cleveland Indians earned him the 2007 ALCS MVP Award. He then started and won {{the first game}} of the 2007 World Series against the Colorado Rockies, {{pitching}} seven innings, allowing one run on six hits, and striking out nine batters. Boston would go on <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the Rockies in the series.|$|E
25|$|Captain Robert Corbet of Bittern {{detached}} two boats, one {{for each}} of the brig, and set off in pursuit of Hirondelle. After a chase of 36 hours, in perfect calm, Bittern was able to capture Hirondelle. To catch her, Corbett had converted the smaller spars he carried <b>to</b> <b>sweeps</b> (large oars). His crew rowed all 36 hours without a break, not even for meals, and covered some 60 miles without the assistance of any wind.|$|R
25|$|On one of {{her first}} cruises, Indian {{encountered}} four French frigates that surrounded her. A providential sudden calm enabled her <b>to</b> use her <b>sweeps</b> <b>to</b> push between them and get far enough away to escape when the breeze returned.|$|R
5000|$|A {{slow down}} stroke (bass <b>to</b> treble) <b>sweep</b> with the thumb. This is a sforzando or {{emphatic}} way of playing a chord.|$|R
5|$|Bryan {{had hoped}} <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the rural vote and make inroads on urban labor, {{but he was}} not successful. McKinley became the first Republican {{candidate}} to win in New York City, and won in its rival city of Brooklyn as well. He lost only one city with a population of over 45,000 in the Midwest, and won many rural counties in crucial states. Although Bryan won all states south of Kentucky and from Texas east, McKinley won most urban centers there.|$|E
5|$|In the club's {{first season}} in Denver, the Avalanche won the Pacific Division {{and went on}} <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the Florida Panthers in the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals, {{becoming}} the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup in the season following a relocation. Among teams in the major North American professional sports leagues, only the National Football League (NFL)'s Washington Redskins have also accomplished the feat. This {{was the first major}} professional sports championship a Denver-based team would bring to the city.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 2012, Zito {{pitched in}} the first World Series of his career. As the Game 1 starter, Zito earned the win, outpitching Detroit's Justin Verlander by tossing 5 2/3 innings of one-run ball. Zito also added an RBI single en route to an 8–3 Giants win. The Giants went on <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the Tigers in the World Series, and Zito went 2–0 with a 1.69 earned run average in the postseason.|$|E
50|$|The Dudok's {{building}} was, {{before the}} war, the first building in Rotterdam that had escalators and an electric mat <b>to</b> automatically <b>sweep</b> shoes.|$|R
50|$|Viewing {{through a}} single line of holes/slots does not work, since the holes/slots appear <b>to</b> just <b>sweep</b> across the object without a strobe effect.|$|R
30|$|SmartPaint {{employs a}} {{paintbrush}} paradigm. The user <b>to</b> <b>sweeps</b> over the liver parenchyma and the algorithm selectively sticks to certain regions, while avoiding others. This identifies the underlying voxels {{as belonging to}} either the object (i.e. liver) or its background. The segmentation is updated in real-time to provide immediate user feedback updating the segmentation. Like with assisted contour techniques, once all of the voxels belonging to the liver are accounted for, {{the volume of the}} organ may be calculated [33].|$|R
5|$|Some turbellarians have {{a simple}} pharynx lined with cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually {{in the middle of}} their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.|$|E
5|$|The NHL {{doubled in}} size to 12 teams in 1967–68 and {{organized}} itself into two divisions: the East Division, with the original six teams, and the West Division, which contained the six expansion franchises. The playoff format was constructed so that an established team would face an expansion team in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Canadiens recovered from their loss in 1967 <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> the St. Louis Blues four games to none in both 1968 and 1969 for their 15th and 16th championships.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} crippled infrastructure, blocking roads {{throughout the}} area and destroying a hydroelectricity plant in Jacmel. The town was left without power and drinking water. In Jérémie, the flooding was so severe as <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> away a large metal bridge. Hundreds of poorly constructed native houses were destroyed on the Tiburon Peninsula, leaving thousands of survivors without homes. Property damage in Haiti amounted to over $1 million. Meanwhile, thousands of livestock were killed and crops were completely destroyed, prompting fears of impending famine.|$|E

5|$|The king of {{one country}} {{threatened}} by the imminent arrival of the stoor worm sought {{the advice of a}} wise man or spaeman, who suggests that the beast might be appeased if it is fed seven virgins every week. In line with the wise man's advice, every Saturday the islanders provide a sacrificial offering of seven virgins, who were tied up and placed on the beach for the serpent <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> into its mouth as it reared its head from the sea.|$|E
5|$|Their home stand {{continued}} with a three-game {{series against the}} Marlins. Batting second (a career first) in the first game, Cody Asche hit his first career walk-off hit: a {{home run in the}} tenth inning for a 3–1 victory. In the next game, possibly Kyle Kendrick's final start with the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park (since his contract expired {{at the end of the}} season), he pitched 6 innings and allowed one run in the Phillies' 2–1 win. They failed <b>to</b> <b>sweep,</b> however, when Papelbon's blown save gave the Marlins a 5–4 win in the series' final game.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-two nations—the {{largest number}} of {{participating}} Winter Olympic countries to that point—competed in the four sports and twenty-four events. The Soviet Union made its Winter Olympics debut and won more medals than any nation. Austrian Toni Sailer became the first person <b>to</b> <b>sweep</b> all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics. The figure skating competition was held outdoors {{for the last time}} at these Games. Logistically, the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events. To remedy this, the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered.|$|E
5000|$|Forward {{accumulation}} is {{more efficient}} than reverse accumulation for functions [...] with [...] as only [...] sweeps are necessary, compared <b>to</b> [...] <b>sweeps</b> for reverse accumulation.|$|R
25|$|The French ground forces, now alone after Dunkirk, had {{virtually}} no air cover, {{and as a result}} the Luftwaffe was able to allow large formations of its Stukas and bombers to operate without escorts, and fighters were free <b>to</b> conduct <b>sweeps</b> <b>to</b> eliminate any air opposition that remained. It is estimated the French forces lost 1,274 aircraft destroyed during the campaign, the British suffered losses of 959 (477 fighters).|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} {{to determine the effects of}} the location of the wing pivot and geometry of the forewing on the static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at subsonic speeds of a model representing a variable-sweep supersonic fighter airplane. Results indicate that as the wing-pivot location moves aft and outboard, the change in static margin due <b>to</b> wing <b>sweep</b> is reduced. Increasing the forewing area resulted in a forward shift of the aerodynamic center as well as a slight reduction in the aerodynamic-center variation due <b>to</b> wing <b>sweep...</b>|$|R
