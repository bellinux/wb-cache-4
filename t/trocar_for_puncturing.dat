30|$|Our study {{included}} 26 {{patients with a}} diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral dermoid cysts. Cases were recruited among 384 operative laparoscopies conducted during the period May 1999 to February 2002. All patients had a preoperative evaluation, including transvaginal sonography and Doppler studies, to confirm {{the nature of the}} cysts. Conclusive confirmation for the cysts was confirmed by the pathological examination for the specimens removed in all cases. Patient charts were revised for demographic data, chief complaint, obstetric history, preoperative investigations, details of operative technique, method of cyst removal, cyst incidence of spillage, blood loss, operative time, postoperative complications, duration of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and pathology reports. All patients were counseled for the procedure, and informed consent was obtained to do laparoscopic management. All operations were conducted under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. We utilized the Karl Storz operative endoscope and camera (Tuttlingen, Germany). We used an infraumbilical 10 -mm <b>trocar</b> <b>for</b> the telescope and two 5 -mm <b>trocars</b> <b>for</b> secondary <b>punctures</b> and operative instrumentation. Pneumoperitoneum was achieved using Storz laparoflator, and the bowels were retracted to the upper abdomen using a fan retractor. Then, diagnostic laparoscopic inspection was conducted thoroughly to evaluate the pelvis and upper abdomen. We strongly recommend against steep Trendelenburg’s position to avoid any chance for migration of spilled material to the upper abdomen during surgery. This might be little awkward during surgery, but we compensate for this by proper bowel retraction and positioning of bowels to the upper abdomen using the fan retractor.|$|R

30|$|As {{previously}} noted, {{the use of}} blunt trocars {{compared to}} cutting <b>trocars</b> <b>for</b> secondary port entry possibly leads to fewer TSHs. This is explained through the stretching and separating of tissues by blunt trocars rather than cutting through tissue layers by cutting trocars. This could be a reason for not closing a fascial defect with a diameter ≤ 12  mm, where a blunt trocar has been used.|$|R
40|$|Nonarthritic, trochanteric pain is a {{commonly}} encountered orthopaedic condition. Although most patients respond to conservative treatment, those with recalcitrant symptoms may require Surgical intervention.

30|$|Material and Methods After {{failure of}} {{conservative}} management, {{we performed a}} laparoscopy using the closed-entry technique (Veress), and 4 <b>trocars</b> <b>for</b> instrumentation. Dense adhesions {{were found between the}} bladder and uterine segment, where the ectopic pregnancy was located. Careful dissection using blunt-dissection and scissors was made to separate the bladder from the uterine segment, cervix and vagina. Hemostasis was controlled by monopolar/bipolar coagulation. The entire mass was successfully excised leaving a small defect on the anterior uterine wall.|$|R

This paper discusses {{a simple way to}} derive the exact state diagram and transfer function of a punctured convolutional code. The key is to represent the punctured code in an equivalent closedform form. It is shown that such a representation is always possible and that the new code typically has the same or fewer number of states.

30|$|The {{meaning of}} the correct trocar {{placement}} is to avoid collision of {{the arms of the}} patient cart and to expand maximally the limits of instruments and endoscope movement. Seamon et al. use six ports—four robotic ports and two accessory ports. They place the 5 -mm port for assistance beneath the costal margin, at least 5  cm above and between the camera and robotic port 1 [1]. Different placements of two of the ports are found in the protocol of Marchal et al. They use four ports, placing a 12 -mm <b>trocar</b> <b>for</b> the endoscope and the camera at the umbilical level and a 10 -mm <b>trocar</b> <b>for</b> the assistant's hand—several centimeters above the connecting line between the ports of the camera and the left working robotic arm [8]. We place six ports in the robotically assisted radical hysterectomies (four working and two accessory), while in the robotically assisted total hysterectomies we place four ports (three working and one 10 -mm accessory). The different placement of the accessory ports in our protocol is consistent with the recommendations of Intuitive Surgical and under the specific conditions in the operating room type OR 1, allows optimal operation with the da Vinci S robotic system.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{our case}} series {{in order to}} evaluate the evolution of our laparoscopic technique in ergonomic and cosmetic terms, leading to the right compromise between these aspects. We retrospectively analyzed 136 diagnostic laparoscopies for suspected appendicitis, using scheme A in the first 98 cases (one 10 / 12 -mm umbilical <b>trocar</b> <b>for</b> the optics and two 5 -mm operative trocars placed above the pubis {{on the right and}} left side) and scheme B in the other 38 cases (one 10 / 12 -mm umbilical <b>trocar</b> <b>for</b> the optics and two 5 -mm operative trocars, one placed over the pubis and the other one on the right hip, just on the umbilical line). The diagnosis of appendicitis was confirmed in 117 patients, while other diseases were present in 19 patients. There were no {{differences between the two groups}} in mean operative time (45 min), postoperative complications (0. 7 %) and clinical course (hospital stay: 36 hours on average). We believe that the right compromise between ergonomic and cosmetic considerations is the one shown in scheme B. In this way it is possible to perform all diagnostic and therapeutic manoeuvres such as pulling the appendix out through the umbilical trocar and using suprapubic trocars as an access route for a possible drainage...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: Mullerian duct {{remnants}} (MDRs) {{are present}} in a male pseudohermaphroditic form characterized by failure of the mullerian duct to regress due to insufficient production or peripheral action of mullerian inhibiting substance. The MDR can be asymptomatic but it often results in infections, stones and voiding troubles. Furthermore, it may develop into a neoplasm. Therefore, surgery is mandatory for large MDRs and symptomatic patients. Laparoscopic removal is described. Materials and Methods: Six males were treated from February 1998 to February 2003. Age at surgery was between 3 and 18 years (mean 8. 6). All patients showed severe hypospadias and 2 had mixed gonadal dysgenesis with ambiguous genitalia. Three patients presented with urogenital infections and all had a large MDR. Laparoscopic procedures, which were preceded by cystoscopy, were performed using a 10 mm umbilical <b>trocar</b> <b>for</b> the camera and 3, 5 mm <b>trocars</b> <b>for</b> instruments placed in the suprapubic region and iliac fossa bilaterally. The remnants were ligated with endoscopic loops or an endoscopic GIA stapler and cut. Results: Mean operative time was 2 hours. We noted no complications. In 2 cases there was deferential ectopia and in another of mixed gonadal dysgenesis bilateral gonadectomy was performed {{because of the risk}} of degeneration. Feeding started on postoperative day I and the patients were discharged home on day 5. After a followup of 8 months to 4 years all boys were healthy. Conclusions: Multiple approaches are used in traditional surgery, often leading to complications. Laparoscopy improves the view, decreases surgical risk and operative time, avoids large scars and allows more rapid hospital discharge...|$|R
