5|$|Before the Georgian era, the Treasury of England {{was led by}} the Lord High <b>Treasurer.</b> By {{the late}} Tudor period, the Lord High <b>Treasurer</b> was {{regarded}} as one of the Great Officers of State and tended to be the dominant figure in government: the Duke of Somerset, Lord High <b>Treasurer</b> (1547–1549), served as Lord Protector to his nephew King Edward VI; Lord Burghley, Lord High <b>Treasurer</b> (1572–1598), was the dominant minister among Queen Elizabeth I's ministers; Burghley's son Lord Salisbury succeeded his father as chief minister to Elizabeth I (1598–1603) and later served King James I as Lord High <b>Treasurer</b> (1608–1612).|$|E
5|$|The formal {{head of the}} Exchequer {{for much}} of its {{existence}} was the Lord High <b>Treasurer,</b> who was tasked with collecting royal revenues. Originally a clerk, he was supervised by the Chief Justiciar, and only became head of the court after this position was abolished {{during the reign of}} Henry III. During the reign of Elizabeth I the Treasurer's other duties began to increase, and he played less of a role in the Exchequer's affairs. By the 17th century, the Lord High <b>Treasurer</b> had been replaced by a dedicated <b>Treasurer</b> of the Exchequer (although earlier writs show that the Lord High <b>Treasurer</b> had been independently given this title), who was ceremoniously presented with a white staff by the monarch. The <b>Treasurer,</b> while active in the revenue side of the Exchequer, played little or no active role in the Exchequer of Pleas.|$|E

5|$|After being mustered out {{of service}} in 1865, Twombly {{attended}} business school and entered {{into a number of}} business ventures. In 1880, he entered politics upon being selected to be the <b>treasurer</b> of Van Buren County, Iowa. He served as the mayor of Keosauqua, Iowa from 1884 to early 1885, and as the <b>treasurer</b> of Iowa from 1885 to 1891.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Stuart period, the Treasury was often run {{not by a}} single {{individual}} such as a Lord High <b>Treasurer</b> but by a committee of Lords of the Treasury, led by the First Lord of the Treasury. The last Lords High <b>Treasurer,</b> Lord Godolphin (1702–1710) and Lord Oxford (1711–1714), ran the government of Queen Anne.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry I's successor, King Stephen, Nigel {{remained as}} <b>treasurer</b> only briefly before {{his family was}} ousted from political office by the new king. Nigel rebelled and deserted to Stephen's rival Matilda, but eventually reconciled with Stephen. Although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts, he never regained high office under Stephen. On the king's death, Nigel was returned to the treasurership by the new king, Henry II. Nigel's second tenure as <b>treasurer</b> saw him return the administration to the practices of Henry I. He withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. He was succeeded as <b>treasurer</b> by his son, Richard fitzNeal, whom he had trained in {{the operations of the}} Exchequer, or Treasury of England. Most historians, then and now, have felt that Nigel's administrative abilities were excellent; he is considered to have been more talented as an administrator than as a religious figure.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{afterwards}} became archdeacon of York and <b>treasurer</b> of York, {{sometime around}} 1143, probably through the patronage of William FitzHerbert {{while he was}} serving his first term as Archbishop of York. While <b>treasurer,</b> {{he was a member}} of the party at York that wanted to elect Hilary as archbishop after William FitzHerbert's deposition in 1147. The successful candidate was Henry Murdac, the Abbot of Fountains, who was supported by the bishops of Durham and Carlisle, William of St. Barbara and Æthelwold respectively. Murdac excommunicated Hugh, who returned the gesture.|$|E
5|$|In 1305, Edward and {{his father}} quarrelled, {{probably}} {{over the issue of}} money.

Edward I defended his <b>treasurer,</b> and banished his son and his companions from his court, cutting off their financial support. After some negotiations involving family members and friends, the two men were reconciled.|$|E
