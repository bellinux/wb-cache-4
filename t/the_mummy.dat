5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mummy</b> is a 1911 American short silent film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film details the story of Jack Thornton, a businessman, who {{is in love with}} Professor Dix's daughter. Jack purchases a mummy and plans to win his respect as an Egyptologist, but <b>the</b> <b>mummy</b> is reanimated in Jack's room by a live electrical wire. <b>The</b> <b>mummy</b> takes immediate interest in Jack, but is rejected and mummifies him. Before Professor Dix can cut up the now-mummified Jack, she returns and saves him. Jack explains everything and the film concludes with Professor Dix marrying <b>the</b> <b>mummy.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mummy</b> {{opened on}} May 7, 1999, and grossed $43million in 3,210 theaters during its opening {{weekend in the}} United States; a {{surprise}} hit, the film went on to gross $416 million worldwide. The box-office success led to a 2001 sequel, <b>The</b> <b>Mummy</b> Returns, as well as , and the prequel/spin-off film The Scorpion King. Seven years later, the third installment, , opened on August 1, 2008. Universal Pictures also opened a roller coaster, Revenge of <b>the</b> <b>Mummy,</b> in 2004. Novelizations of the film and its sequels were written by Max Allan Collins.|$|E
5|$|The {{body was}} 1.63m in height. <b>The</b> <b>mummy</b> {{had a small}} face with no {{defining}} features, though he had slightly prominent front teeth; {{this may have been}} an inherited family trait, as this feature can be seen in some female mummies of the same family, as well as <b>the</b> <b>mummy</b> of his descendant, Thutmose II.|$|E
5|$|Other archeological objects found {{along with}} <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> included: headdresses with feathers, pottery, statues {{made out of}} gold and silver and textiles. A total of 145 objects were found {{together}} with <b>the</b> <b>mummies.</b> <b>The</b> hairs found with <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> and as offerings accompanying <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> have been subject of research to establish {{the background of the}} victims.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} Kharis film, <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Hand (1940), <b>the</b> {{character}} was played by Western-film actor Tom Tyler, while the three subsequent films, <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Tomb (1942), <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Ghost (1944), and <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Curse (also 1944), starred Lon Chaney, Jr. in the role. Although the iconic image of <b>the</b> <b>mummy's</b> face is usually Karloff's, the Kharis films {{are responsible for}} the enduring stereotype of the lumbering, foot-dragging monster, as Karloff's bandaged creation is seen only briefly while Kharis is a major on-screen character in all four follow-up films. The Kharis movies also introduce the notion of tana leaves as integral to <b>the</b> <b>mummy's</b> survival.|$|R
50|$|A major {{display in}} the museum {{contains}} <b>the</b> Qilakitsoq <b>mummies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mummies</b> consist of three women and a six-month-old child, half of <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> found at Qilakitsoq.|$|R
5|$|What {{has been}} {{thought to be}} his mummy can be viewed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. However, in 2007, Dr. Zahi Hawass {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>mummy</b> which was previously thought to be Thutmose I {{is that of a}} thirty-year-old man who had {{died as a result of}} an arrow wound to the chest. Because of the young age of <b>the</b> <b>mummy</b> and the cause of death, it was determined that <b>the</b> <b>mummy</b> was probably not that of King Thutmose I himself.|$|E
5|$|Two {{video game}} adaptations of <b>The</b> <b>Mummy</b> were {{published}} by Konami and Universal Interactive in 2000: an Action Adventure for the PlayStation and PC developed by Rebellion Developments, {{as well as}} a Game Boy Color puzzle game developed by Konami Nagoya. The film also inspired a roller coaster, Revenge of <b>the</b> <b>Mummy</b> in three Universal Studios Theme Parks: Hollywood, California; Orlando, Florida; and Sentosa, Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{motion picture}} debut {{was a brief}} {{appearance}} as The Scorpion King in the opening sequence of <b>The</b> <b>Mummy</b> Returns. The character appears in the movie's climax in CGI form. The movie's financial success led to Johnson's first leading role, in the spin-off The Scorpion King. He received US$5.5 million for the role and was listed in the 2007 Guinness World Records as the highest-paid actor in his first starring role. <b>The</b> <b>Mummy</b> Returns, featuring The Rock, shattered a two-year record by earning $28,594,667, the highest-grossing single day for any film in history.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Tomb is <b>the</b> 1942 American {{film noir}} horror film sequel to <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Hand (1940).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Curse is <b>the</b> 1944 horror film {{follow-up}} to <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Ghost. This film marks Lon Chaney, Jr.'s final appearance as Kharis, <b>the</b> Egyptian <b>mummy.</b> Although <b>the</b> previous two {{films in the}} series take place in Massachusetts, <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Curse moves <b>the</b> action to Louisiana with no explanation being given for the change.|$|R
5000|$|Once the coffins/mummies {{and items}} {{made it back}} to Cairo they were examined. It was found that not only were the tombs plundered but so were <b>the</b> <b>mummies,</b> and that some of <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> were found in the wrong coffins. Some of <b>the</b> <b>mummy’s</b> heads and limbs had been removed by tomb robbers {{to be able to get}} to amulets found under the wrappings of <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> in {{addition}} to other precious ornaments found on <b>the</b> <b>mummies.</b> A few of <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> found in TT 320 were found in the wrong coffins. It is speculated that this could be because royal mummies were buried in multiple coffins so one or more of their coffins could be used by others as their coffins.11 ...|$|R
5|$|On April 4, 2012, Universal {{announced}} {{their plans to}} reboot the franchise. The film {{is intended to be}} the first installment in the Dark Universe, simply titled <b>The</b> <b>Mummy,</b> and was released in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mummy</b> is a 1999 American action fantasy film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Kevin J.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} {{as a part}} of the preliminary study on the mass culture of Pseudaphycus malinus Gahan, an important parasite of Pseudococcus comstocki (Kuwana). The author dealt with the low temperature storage of <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> in which <b>the</b> parasites were either in the prepupal or pupal stage. The experiments were carried out for the purpose of examining the developmental stage of the parasite most suitable to the low temperature storage, the period of <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> without lasting <b>the</b> ability to emerge, the period from the exposure of <b>the</b> stored <b>mummies</b> to <b>the</b> higher temperature of 25 ℃ to the emergence of the parasites from them and the stage of the parasite having high mortality in <b>the</b> <b>mummies.</b> In <b>the</b> first experiment, <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> which were formed at the temperature of 25 ℃ were transferred to the lower temperatures and stored at 8, 10 and 12 ℃ (± 1 ℃), separately. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> stored at these temperatures were separated by the developmental stage of the parasite into the following three stages. First stage was 1 day after <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> were formed; most of the parasites in <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> were in <b>the</b> prepupal stage. Second stage was 3 to 4 days after <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> were formed; <b>the</b> parasites were either in the prepupal or pupal stage. Third stage was 8 to 9 days after <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> were formed; all parasites were in the pupal stage. In the second experiment, <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> which were 1 to 4 days after they were formed were stored at 8, 10 and 12 ℃, separately. The method of this experiment after the exposure of <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> from <b>the</b> low temperature to 25 ℃ were similar to that mentioned in the first experiment. As the result of the first experiment, the per cent of the emergence of the parasites from <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> decreased with <b>the</b> length of the storage and also varied with the developmental stage of the parasites when the exposure of <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> at <b>the</b> low temperature was started. The highest per cent of the emergence of the parasites from <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> stored for 90 days was gained especially in <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> which were stored at 10 ℃ 1 day after they were formed. In the second experiment, the last emergence of the parasites was confirmed in <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> stored for 160 days at 10 ℃. The period from the exposure of <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> stored to 25 ℃ to the emergence of the parasites was between 11 and 16 days, However, even in <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> stored at 12 ℃, some parasites had emerged during the low temperature storage and the period mentioned above was 4 to 11 days. The facts that the parasites emerged from <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> stored for a long period were very few seem to be attributed to the prompt temperature change from the cold storage chamber of about 10 ℃ to the emergence room of 25 ℃ and the low humidity in the cold storage chamber. 天敵の大量生産および野外における放飼において,天敵の発育速度の調整は重要な仕事である. 25 ℃において形成されたクワコナカイガラヤドリバチのマミーをその中のハチの発育段階別に 8, 10, 12 ℃(± 1 ℃) の温度に保存して所定の時間後再び 25 ℃に取り出してハチを羽化させる場合,マミー形成後 1 - 2 日目のものを 10 ℃に保存することが適当であると考えられた. この場合,ハチの羽化は 160 日間保存したマミーまでみられた. しかし, 50 %の羽化率は約 60 日の保存期間のところにあつた. 保存したマミーにおいて加温中に死亡したハチが多かつたことから,今後の実験操作に改良の余地のあることが認められた...|$|R
5000|$|The {{population}} revered the mummmies of the Inca emperors. This reverence seemed idolatry to the Roman Catholic Spanish and in 1550 they confiscated <b>the</b> <b>mummies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mummies</b> {{were taken}} to Lima where they were displayed in the San Andres Hospital. <b>The</b> <b>mummies</b> deteriorated in <b>the</b> humid climate of Lima and eventually they were either buried or destroyed by the Spanish.|$|R
50|$|In {{the temples}} and places {{reserved}} for <b>the</b> <b>mummies,</b> <b>the</b> bodies {{were put on}} a platform of reed, as an elevated bed, called barbacoas. Other mummies were placed on small wooden stools. <b>The</b> <b>mummies</b> were left there without being buried. All <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> found were in a similar sitting position with the arms and legs folded towards the torso. Ezequiel Uricoechea described in 1854 that the fingers of the mummified persons were strapped together with cotton cords. Some of <b>the</b> <b>mummies,</b> probably those of the warriors, were found with golden arms in their hands.

5|$|While early explorers {{reported}} various traditions {{associated with}} Guanche mummification, {{there are three}} methods identified in modern times through scientific analysis: evisceration, preservation, and stuffing.

5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for <b>the</b> <b>mummy</b> through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for <b>the</b> <b>mummy</b> and capturing her.|$|E

50|$|Though {{the title}} {{suggests}} Universal Pictures' 1932 {{film of the}} same name, the film actually derives its plot and characters entirely from two 1940s Universal films, <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Hand and <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Tomb, with <b>the</b> climax borrowed directly from <b>The</b> <b>Mummy's</b> Ghost. <b>The</b> character name Joseph Whemple, {{the use of a}} sacred scroll, and a few minor plot elements are the only connections with the 1932 version.|$|R

5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and <b>the</b> <b>mummy.</b> The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment.

5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of <b>the</b> <b>mummy,</b> which was decorated.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} coffin of Thutmose I {{was taken}} over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. <b>The</b> <b>mummy</b> of Thutmose I {{was thought to be}} lost, but Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III, believed he had found his mummy in the otherwise unlabelled mummy #5283. This identification has been supported by subsequent examinations, revealing that the embalming techniques used came from the appropriate period of time, almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made {{during the course of the}} Eighteenth dynasty.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the museum display, <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> had been safeguarded by the Catholic University of Salta. Developing a way to show <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> to <b>the</b> public while keeping them perfectly preserved took eight years of research.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>mummies</b> were in {{exceptional}} condition when found. Dr. Reinhard {{said that}} <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> [...] "appear {{to be the}} best preserved Inca mummies ever found", additionally saying that the arms were perfectly preserved, even down to the individual hairs. The internal organs were still intact, and one of the hearts still contained frozen blood. Because <b>the</b> <b>mummies</b> froze before dehydration could occur, the desiccation and shrivelling of the organs that is typical to exposed human remains never took place.|$|R
5000|$|Keeping {{with their}} total disdain for modern technology, <b>the</b> <b>Mummies</b> refused to publish their music on compact disc, and often brandished their vinyl covers with the slogan, [...] "Fuck CDs". Several singles {{followed}} in the early 1990s on different record labels, most notably Estrus Records, which also distributed a compilation album of the Mummies' singles, <b>The</b> <b>Mummies</b> Play Their Own Records!, in 1992. In 1991 <b>the</b> <b>Mummies</b> recorded an album's worth of material for Crypt Records; however, the band felt {{the results of the}} recording sessions did not appropriately capture their lo-fi sound, and discarded the material. Nonetheless, the songs were later featured on the bootleg album Fuck <b>the</b> <b>Mummies,</b> and <b>the</b> band re-recorded the material. After extensive West Coast gigging, a tour of the Northwest with Thee Headcoats, and some engagements on the East Coast, <b>the</b> <b>Mummies</b> disbanded in January 1992, shortly before their first and only studio album, Never Been Caught, was released.|$|R
