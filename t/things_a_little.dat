5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
25|$|To make <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more interesting, each team, {{no matter}} what type of {{exchange}} they are doing, has to perform their exchange in the distance of two pits. The action of slowing {{is not part of}} the exchange, but the first rider is not allowed to begin getting off the bike until one pit ahead of their team's and the second rider must have complete control of the bike by the end of the team's pit. For bike-to-bike exchanges, the second person CANNOT move until tagged by the first person and the first person MUST stop before end of her team's pit. Failure to do either of these things will result in a penalty for the team.|$|E
25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on <b>things,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E
25|$|Valerie Arem of PCB Productions was {{the voice}} {{director}} for dubbing. Rather than recording as a team, each actor recorded their lines separately. Baker, Bailey and Willingham, the respective voices of Vincent, Catherine and Johnny, described the voice recording period as a positive experience, reinforced {{by the fact that}} they were all old friends. Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting. Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff. In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances. For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.|$|E
500|$|It took Levi {{approximately}} {{one year to}} record all of his dialogue {{due in part to}} his busy schedule. Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time, recording each of his lines at least twice. The actor's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn's character. Howard explained, [...] "He's so smart and clever, and his adlibs are so great, and you like him straight away ... he brings that to Flynn." [...] On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's [...] "voice was really just a slight variation of [...] own". Wanting to sound [...] "more appropriate" [...] for the film's medieval setting, Levi [...] "cleaned up [...] own diction and made <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more polished", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a [...] "very family friendly" [...] version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, [...] "I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up," [...] likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on an answering machine.|$|E

500|$|... 1UP.com graded it A-, {{praising the}} {{gameplay}} and [...] "predictably slick" [...] looks, but criticized the [...] "divisive industrial hard-rock nonsense.... that sullied DMC3 [...] returns here" [...] and the game's [...] "overly frugal approach to level design". GameTrailers rated it an 8.6/10, and praised the voice acting while criticizing the corny dialogue. IGN gave it an 8.7 saying, [...] "Whether it's on the PS3 or the 360, action fans {{are going to}} get one incredible experience with this game, and if you own either system, you'll have a great time." [...] However, the review also noted that, contrary to Kobayashi's claim, [...] "Dante simply doesn't have nearly as many weapons as he did in DMC3" [...] and found that [...] "the amount of backtracking and repetition makes the game feel somewhat half-heartedly finished in the design department." [...] GameSpy gave it 4 stars out of 5, stating that [...] "DMC4 succeeds on many levels because it fuses fan service with entertaining gameplay", finding that [...] "visually, DMC4 is a dynamo." [...] The review also praised Nero for [...] " [...] something fresh to the franchise" [...] and being [...] "as diverse as DMC3 SE's Vergil"; however, they also claim that [...] "it cheapens <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to see that the team has opted to recycle assets in lieu of showing us more of this rich world" [...] and call out the [...] "annoying industrial-meets-butt-rock soundtrack". Hypers Dirk Watch commends the game for [...] "looking great, combos galore and being more fun than Devil May Cry 3". However, he criticized it for [...] "still playing like Devil May Cry 2 as well as choppy pacing and level design".|$|E

On November 13, 2012, Cole released a promotional single for the album, titled [...] "Miss America." [...] Cole stated that he hoped [...] "Miss America" [...] would shift music in a different direction, adding that he knew it wouldn't be a big radio hit. He elaborated further, saying, [...] "To me, 'Miss America' shifts <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit, it changes the conversation, it takes it in a more aggressive direction, more raw, more social commentary... Any type of commentary is good compared to what a normal single is these days. That's my aim, is to shift culture slightly, change the conversation. Nobody expects that for your first single." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 67 BC Pompey {{was given}} the task of {{defeating}} Mithridates and Tigranes. Pompey first concentrated on [...] attacking Mithridates while distracting [...] Tigranes by engineering a Parthian attack on Gordyeyne. Phraates III, the Parthian king, was soon persuaded to take <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further than an annexation of [...] Gordyeyne when a son of [...] Tigranes (also named Tigranes) went to join the Parthians and persuaded Phraates to invade Armenia {{in an attempt to}} replace the elder Tigranes with the younger. Tigranes decided not to meet the invasion in the field but instead ensured that his capital, Artaxata, was well defended and withdrew to the hill country. Phraates soon realized that Artaxata would not fall without a protracted siege, the time for which he could not spare due to his fear of plots at home. Once Phraates left Tigranes came back down from the hills and drove his son from Armenia. The son then fled to Pompey.|$|E

2500|$|In late May 2011, {{sociologist}} Manuel Castells congratulated Spanish occupiers for {{the fact}} that not a single violent incident had been reported after 11 days of camping all over Spain. Castells said that nonviolence was of fundamental importance, and was echoed by various other sociologists and social historians including Lester Kurtz, Prof. Maurice Isserman and Prof. Tom Juravich. Juravich and others have, however, said that conflict can be important in attracting attention, with much to be gained if occupiers are seen as victims of the violence, providing occupiers keep their own aggression strictly within limits. In the words of one occupier, it can help them gain media coverage if they [...] "make <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sexy and badass" [...] [...] The Direct Action Working Group of Occupy Wall Street endorsed diversity of tactics from the earliest days of the encampment. Not all occupiers have upheld the commitment to nonviolence, with aggressive tactics being used in Spain from as early as 15 June, and with some journalists saying the New York branch of the movement did initially accept protestors who had not signed up to nonviolence.|$|E
2500|$|While Garbage had lyrical {{input from}} all band members, Manson was {{responsible}} for all the lyrics in Version 2.0.. Consequently, it was described by Manson as [...] "more direct and more personal than the first. I was able to verbalize <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> clearer this time—I mean, I'm no Nick Cave, I'm never gonna be Bob Dylan. I do what I can to express myself." [...] The singer [...] "tried to let the darker undercurrents come through to offset some of the pop melodies", adding that [...] "like human beings, songs shouldn't be one-dimensional". The singer declared that the introspective nature of Version 2.0 served to [...] "reassure myself while I'm going crazy" [...] due to her experiences during production, as she was [...] "living by myself in a hotel, and I {{had no one to}} really talk to" [...] and every day coming back by herself really late after working on the studio. Manson added that only [...] "The Trick Is to Keep Breathing" [...] had something that was out of her life, being inspired by her friend Ruthie Trouble. [...] "Medication" [...] came about from a frightful, isolating experience with the US medical system. The song, Manson explained, is [...] "a reflection on past ills in a way ... about taking blame on yourself for things that you had no control of at the time, and finally pushing off and realizing that this was not my fault. It wasn't all my fault. There's a huge relief and release that comes from that".|$|E
2500|$|Cardinal Pierre-Marie Gerlier of Lyon, {{a staunch}} anti-Semite who {{supported}} Vichy's efforts {{to solve the}} [...] "Jewish question" [...] in France thus far, opposed the rafles of Jews, arguing in a sermon that the [...] "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" [...] was taking <b>things</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too far (his [...] "solution" [...] to the [...] "Jewish question" [...] was conversion of the Jews to Roman Catholicism). Archbishop Jules-Géraud Saliège of Toulouse in a pastoral letter of 23 August 1942 declared about the deportations: [...] "You cannot do whatever you wish against these men, against these women, against these fathers and mothers. They are part of mankind. They are our brothers". Pastor Marc Boegner, president of the National Protestant Federation, denounced the rafles in a sermon in September 1942, asking Calvinists to hide Jews. A number of Catholic and Calvinist schools and organizations such as Jesuit Père Pierre Chaillet's l'Amitié Chrétienne began to take in Jewish children and passed them off as Christian. Many Protestant families, influenced by memories of persecution, {{had already begun to}} hide Jews, and after the summer of 1942, the Catholic Church, which until then had been broadly supportive of Vichy's anti-Semitic laws, began to condemn racial anti-Semitism and organized efforts to hide Jews. The official story was that the Jews were being [...] "resettled in the East", being moved to a [...] "Jewish homeland" [...] said to exist somewhere in Eastern Europe, but right from the start, there were disturbing rumors that the Jews were actually being killed. As 1942 went on, the fact that no one knew precisely where this [...] "Jewish homeland in the East" [...] was or had seen it together with the fact that those sent to be [...] "resettled in the East" [...] were never seen or heard from again led more and more people to the correct conclusion that the horrific rumors of the Jews were in fact being all exterminated were true.|$|E
