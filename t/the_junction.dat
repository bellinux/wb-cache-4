40|$|We have {{fabricate}} {{and studied}} {{a variety of}} devices based on stacked YBa 2 Cu 3 Ox bicrystal Josephson junctions in a multilayer structure. The proximity of <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> in <b>the</b> two layers produces {{a large number of}} effects based on interactions between <b>the</b> <b>junctions.</b> Voltage locking and current locking were observed in <b>the</b> stacked <b>junctions.</b> <b>The</b> voltage locking is due to the ac path provided by a SrTiO 3 layer between <b>the</b> stacked <b>junctions.</b> <b>The</b> current locking is likely the result of a Josephson vortex interaction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In Urban area {{congestion}} mostly {{occurs at}} <b>the</b> <b>junctions.</b> <b>Junctions</b> are <b>the</b> intersection of roads, where {{the flow of}} the vehicles is controlled by traffic police or traffic lights. When the flow of vehicles increases at <b>the</b> <b>junctions,</b> it causes traffic jams and stream of vehicles incur longer waiting time. When there is a crossing at a junction, a stream of vehicle has to wait for others. Sometimes, the longer stream of waiting vehicles at <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> causes stalemate situation. Design of an uninterrupted traffic flow system at <b>the</b> traffic <b>junctions</b> without have to wait for others will lead to minimize severe traffic congestion. We have proposed a traffic flow system at <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> to make <b>the</b> flow of traffic streams an uninterrupted flow system. This will also lead to design of a traffic light and traffic police free system at <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> of urban traffic roads...|$|R
30|$|We {{calculated}} the theoretical (predicted) ESR signal intensity of quartz in the fine-silt {{fraction of the}} sediments in the mainstream immediately below junctions with major tributaries by applying a simple mixing ratio approach, to examine whether ESR signal intensity values of sediments reflect mixing ratios of sediments discharged from the mainstream and tributary immediately above <b>the</b> <b>junctions.</b> We used <b>the</b> sediment (SPM) budget at <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> as determined from modern (post-TGD) observational data (Fig.  4), {{in addition to the}} analyzed ESR signal intensities of quartz in the fine-silt fraction of the sediments from each tributary and from sites along the mainstream immediately above <b>the</b> <b>junctions,</b> as end-members for determining mixing ratios and for calculating the predicted ESR signal intensities of quartz downstream from <b>the</b> <b>junctions.</b> <b>The</b> results are compared with the analyzed ESR signal intensities for the fine-silt fraction of samples collected from mainstream sites immediately below <b>the</b> <b>junctions.</b>|$|R
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to <b>the</b> <b>junction.</b> Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E

First, utilizing surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra, we provide experimental and theoretical evidence that DMAB can be produced from PATP by surface photochemistry reaction in <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> of a Ag nanoparticle-molecule-Ag film. Second, we investigate the SERS spectra utilizing both experimental and theoretical approaches, ultimately revealing that DMAB cannot be produced from PATP in <b>the</b> <b>junctions</b> of a Ag nanoparticle-molecule-Au film.

5|$|In 1895, the Fitchburg and B {{demolished}} the 1848-built union station.

In 1897, <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> of the P was relocated slightly to the west to eliminate angled grade crossings of Main Street and Park Street. An island platform was constructed around that time between the two Fitchburg main tracks east of the diamond crossing to serve commuters to Boston. In 1906, East Main Street was rerouted onto a bridge east of the station, eliminating traffic problems caused when trains blocked the grade crossing. The old Stony Brook freight house and engine house were removed as part of the construction. Two signal bridges built at right angles over <b>the</b> <b>junction</b> in the 1910s and an interlocking tower built in 1929 controlled the various train movements across the complex junction.|$|E
