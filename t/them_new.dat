5|$|A rugged, sparsely {{populated}} area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among <b>them</b> <b>New</b> Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.|$|E

5|$|Andjar {{was one of}} {{the first}} native Indonesian film directors, with Bachtiar Effendi, Soeska, and Inoe Perbatasari. Said writes that Andjar was forced to follow the whims of the ethnic Chinese film moguls, which {{resulted}} in the films' shift toward commercial orientation, rather than the prioritisation of artistic merit. The film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that Andjar and his fellow journalists, upon joining JIF, brought with <b>them</b> <b>new</b> ideas that helped the company flourish until it closed after the arrival of the Japanese; the company and its subsidiaries released fifteen films in two years.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{were the}} {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of the}} land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany, and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with <b>them</b> <b>new</b> styles and instruments. African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot.|$|E
5|$|Adventure 2 has {{the health}} system found in many other Sonic games. The player {{collects}} rings scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all, while being hit without rings causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled by collecting rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant <b>them</b> <b>new</b> abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully enough to break certain containers. Chaos Drives {{can be used with}} the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).|$|E

Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E
5|$|Demons can {{be talked}} with in battle and {{recruited}} {{if the right}} conversation is initiated. Once {{a part of the}} player's party, they will fight alongside them. In addition to standard demons, the player can ally with one human companion, with three being available on the first playthrough and a fourth unlocking during the second. When the player or their human partner dies in battle, they are granted a Guardian Spirit, who revives them at the last save point and teaches <b>them</b> <b>new</b> skills and alter the player's stats. The Guardian's specialties affect how stats are changed: a higher power ranking will raise the player's strength, but lower magic will decrease their Magic Point meter. The Guardian changes each time the player dies.|$|E

25|$|World War I brought Fairfield {{out of its}} agrarian past by {{triggering}} {{an unprecedented}} economic boom in Bridgeport, which {{was the center of}} a large munitions industry at the time. The prosperity created a housing shortage in the city, and many of the workers looked to Fairfield to build their homes.
