40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of adaptation {{performance of the}} tribe Triticeae L. representatives were studied according to biochemical markers. It is shown that drought-tolerant tribe representatives are at the subcellular level characterized by presence of alleles of Dreb 1 genes of drought resistance, Glu-D 1 of glutenin, Glі- 1 B 1, Gli- 6 D 2, Gli- 6 D 3, Gli- 6 B 2 of gliadin, and high protein content in grain (14. 2 – 18. 0 %). Plants with low drought resistance exhibit heightened superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase activity in leaves. It is established that the criteria of frost and winter hardiness of plants are: accumulation of high total sugar content in the <b>tillering</b> <b>node</b> (26 – 38 mg/g) as cryoprotectants and energy sources, and economical consumption of them during the autumn-winter period. Exogenously, high levels of plant organism’s adaptability to various stress conditions in winter are expressed as high photoperiodic sensitivity manifesting as weak differentiation of growth points {{in the fall and}} late spring vegetation restoration. Adaptive changes at the subcellular level are consistent with drought resistance indices (high leaf index, glossy cover, lingering green color of the leaf, presence of awns, significant growth in dry weight in dry conditions) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of soft winter wheat lectin activity in caryopsis and at {{the early stages of}} ontogenesis of varieties developed by Poltava State Agrarian Academy as well as investigate varietal differences depending on dynamic pH medium. Methods. Laboratory analysis, method of hema­gglutination reaction, analytical approach, statistical evaluation. Results. A change in lectin activity was determined in samples of 14 soft winter wheat varieties in caryopsis and at the early stages of ontogenesis (on the third, seventh, tenth and twelfth day of seedlings emergence). High lectin activity was observed in samples of seven and ten days seedlings. This could be evidence of active participation of proteins in physio­logical and biochemical processes at the time of emerging wheat <b>tillering</b> <b>node</b> that can be important in forming adaptive reactions to stress. Wheat lectin activity variation for рН ranging between 4, 0 and 8, 0 that depended on a variety was defined for the first time. Conclusions. According to hema­gglutination ability of wheat lectins, all varieties were divided into three groups: of high ability – 4 varieties, middle – 9 varieties, low – 1 variety. Varietal variability for the investigated trait can be used in breeding programs as marker trait. In most varieties variation of hemagglutination was observed at dilutions ranging between 1 : 2 and 1 : 256.

And then a labor saving and high efficiency cultivation system of rice seedling broadcasting was developed which is suitable for multiple cropping systems and rural economic conditions in China. The system is composed of 6 parts which are showed as follows. (1) The process of seedling standing and establishing was studied {{and it could be}} divided into three successive phases including physical, physiological and morphological standing. (2) Spatial distribution of seedlings in field and its eco-physiological effects were also analyzed. Compared with manual transplanting, the broadcasted seedlings inserted into soil shallowly in the vertical and were distributed quasi-even randomly on the horizon. Therefore, the environment conditions around <b>tiller</b> <b>nodes</b> and rice canopy were both improved.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{underlying}} physiological mechanism of gibberellic acid (GA) in cold tolerance, {{the effects of}} exogenous GA 3 on malondialdehyde (MDA), osmoregulation substances and endogenous hormones levels in the <b>tiller</b> <b>nodes</b> of two wheat cultivars, namely, Dongnongdongmai 1 (a cold insensitive cultivar) and Jimai 22 (a cold sensitive cultivar), were investigated at three periods of cold winter (0,- 10,- 25 °C). The results showed that low concentrations of GA 3 (0. 1 and 1 µM) decreased the endogenous GA concentration in both cultivars, but only increased the abscisic acid (ABA) /GA ratio in Dongnongdongmai 1. High concentrations of GA 3 (10 and 100 µM) increased the MDA level, retarded the accumulation of soluble protein and sugar in both cultivars, but decreased the content of ABA and the ratio of ABA/GA only in Dongnongdongmai 1 and had no influence on those in Jimai 22. The re-greening rate of Dongnongdongmai 1 decreased as the concentration of exogenous GA 3 increased. Correlation analyses showed that MDA was negatively correlated with re-greening rate, while soluble protein, sugar ABA content, and ABA/GA ratio were positively correlated with re-greening rate. In conclusion, low exogenous GA 3 level could decrease endogenous GA content and elevate ABA/GA ratio and soluble protein content, which help to improve cold tolerance. However, high exogenous GA 3 level decreased the ABA content and ABA/GA ratio, resulting in lower soluble sugar and protein content and aggravated oxidative damage, and finally weakened cold tolerance. The endogenous GA metabolism and ABA/GA balance play central roles in exogenous GA 3 mediated cold tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) is {{a member}} of the grass family Poaceae (Gramineae), {{together}} with many other important agricultural crops. The wild species commonly known as teosintes are the closest relatives of maize. Teosintes are wild grasses with a native distribution area from Mexico to Nicaragua and are an important genetic resource for maize improvement. Teosinte from Nicaragua (Zea nicaraguensis) is to a large extent an unutilized genetic resource and its properties in terms of desirable traits, such as water-lodging adaptation and disease resistance have to be phenotypically and genetically characterized. The aims of this thesis were to verify the chromosome number and characterize the genetic diversity of Nicaraguan teosinte populations and to determine genetic structure, gene flow, morphological variation and phylogenetic relationships among Meso-American teosintes. The thesis includes results from cytological, genetic, morphological and phylogenetic studies. Cytogenetic studies were based on C-banding techniques. Microsatellite (SSR) markers and DNA sequences of cpDNA regions were used for genetic diversity and phylogenetic studies respectively, whereas morphological studies involved various quantitative morphological traits. The C-banding pattern revealed that Z. nicaraguensis is more similar to Z. luxurians than other teosintes and cultivated maize. Among the Meso-American teosintes, Z. diploperennis, Z. perennis and Z. nicaraguensis showed the highest values in the number of rare and unique alleles and the data also indicated that the gene flow between Z. nicaraguensis and Z. luxurians has been more frequent than between other teosintes. The morphological characterization revealed that the traits of the number of lateral branch nodes bearing ears, the glume width, the number of <b>tiller</b> <b>nodes</b> bearing ears and the number of tillers per plant were the most important in discriminating between taxa and the principal component analysis grouped many traits around the Z. nicaraguensis, Z. luxurians and Z. mays subsp. huehuetenangensis. Finally, the variation among cpDNA sequences was not enough to give a definitive phylogenetic resolution among the five Zea species, but even so our results support the idea that Z. nicaraguensis could be treated as a separate species distinct from Z. luxurians...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Biofertilizers {{have been}} {{identified}} as alternative to chemical fertilizers to increase soil fertility and crop production in sustainable farming systems. One of the most useful kind of biofertilizers include plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Azospirillum is an associative rhizobacteria which can be very useful for plants such as wheat. It can help plant by fixing nitrogen through biological way, causing root development, plant strength improvement in primary phases, causing germination percent increment, improving plant tolerance in stress situations (drought, salinity, soil compaction and pathogens), secreting plant promoting hormones like cytokinin, Oxin and finally yield increment will be observable. Modern agriculture largely relies on the extensive application of agrochemicals, including inorganic fertilizers and pesticides. Although pesticides are important, their effects on nontarget organisms are of great concern because this poses a risk to the entire ecological system. The fungicides may also adversely affect the soil microflora, especially the types of microorganisms that can applied to seeds as bacterial inoculants. Considering useful effects of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria especially Azospirillum on Wheat, this study was done in order to survey interaction effects between fungicide and available biofertilizers in Iran market. Materials and Methods: Effect of carboxin tiram in 2 levels (applied, non-applied) as fungicide, on efficacy of wheat plant (Chamran Cultivar) and final crop yields under association conditions with 5 Azospirillum species (A. brasilense, A. lipoferum, A. halopraeferense, A. irakense, A. sp) using powdery and liquid formulation were studied in a greenhouse test for four months in Soil and Water Research Institute. At first some properties of used soil, including soil texture, pH, EC,organic carbon and available soil K, P, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu were measured by laboratory methods. Nutrient Broth medium were used for bacterial inoculum production with 108 bacterial cound per ml in final suspention. Using factorial experiment in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD), 2 bacterial inoculants factors (5 inoculation level and a non-inoculation level), CarboxinThiram fungicide levels (applied, non-applied) and two inoculants formulations (liquid and powdery) with four replicates per treatment and a total of 96 experimental units (pots), the most effective contribution of different species of Azospirillum bacteria with Chamran wheat varieties were evaluated {{in the presence of the}} fungicide. Studied Parameters included number of <b>tillers,</b> <b>node</b> interface, flag length, number of grains per spike, grain weight per spike, shoots wet weight, 1000 grain weight and shoot dry weight of wheat plant. Data were analyzed with SASS and Excel softwares. The comparison was done by Tukey test. Results and Discussion: Regarding ANOVA table (table 2), liquid and powdery formulations of Azospirillum with different species had significant effect on 8 of 11 studied traits including number of tillers, plant hight, spike length, node interface, flag length, number of spikes per square meter, grain weight in spike, shoot wet weight, shoot dry weight. Fungicide had effect on 2 traits such as number of grain per spike and grain weight spike independently. Bacteria and fingicide interaction had significant effect on number of <b>tillers,</b> <b>node</b> interface, flag length, number of grain per spike, shoot dry weight (p< 0. 01) and shoot wet weight (p< 0. 05). Numeric comparsion between similar treatments in presence and absence of fungicide, it can be concluded that although fungicide presence had no significant positive effectson studied traits, it did not have any negative effects eigther. Even it could increase traits quantity by affecting on bacteria. Also, regarding to Table 5, comparing fungicide effect on bacteria with studied trait in two formulations, it can be concluded that fungicide presence with bacteria was effective on quantity of some trait in powdery formulation and some in liquid formulation. These findinds may be the result of fungicide effects in controlling soil born pathogens in compatable treatments with used bacterial inoculums. Conclusions: As final result, using A. lipoferum with both formulations and A. halopraeferense with powdery formulation, because of high compatibility with carboxin thiram fungicide can be advised in case of fungicide application. This advice can have good effects on functional traits such as number of tillers, grain weight in spike and shoot dry weight. To consider the effects of environmental conditions on the final results we propose to do this experiment in field scale in some Iranian provinces with different climatic conditions. The use of different concentrations of carboxin tiram and also different kinds of PGPR and other fungicides must be consider in future experiments...|$|R
40|$|Human {{has been}} always {{enthusiastic}} of gardening {{with flowers and}} ornamentals since ancient periods of time. The economic importance of ornamentals (floricultural plants) has been increasing and its world-wide international demand has rapidly expanded {{with the passage of}} time. Worldwide trends and production centres of floricultural crops are changing continually. A predictable trend in the international flower market is the increased emphasis on quality. Quality factors related to post-harvest keeping quality include environmental influences on flower longevity, as well as the influence of pathogenic microorganisms, including virus diseases. As competition in the world market is increasing, quality has become a more important factor. Increasing vase-life or flower-life on a pot plant is an important goal. A large number of floriculture units based on green house technologies for the export of their produce have been set up. These developments had an effect on the flower cultivation in the open field condition and thus significant growth took place in the floriculture sector which is now experiencing a change in terms of technology of production, packaging and storage, varieties and qualities of product, quantum of production and the marketing mechanism. In this recent platform, Caryophyllacean dicot plant member Dianthus caryophyllus (Carnation) is an important, commercial season based floricultural crop. It grows well in temperate climate {{all over the world and}} popular as cut-flowers for its variegated petal’s colour. So, it has terrific market demands in international trading. In this modern era, an agronomic demand of high yielding cultivar of this crop was noticed. Development of cultivars with more desirable floral characteristics and higher productivity are also very important in this crop. Various biometrical/agrometrical characters viz. growth parameters (mature plant height, number and length of shoots and internode, number of <b>tillers,</b> <b>nodes,</b> leaves, stem diameter, length-breadth of leaf etc.), flowering parameters (days to flowering, bud opening, flower development, flower longevity etc.), flower quality parameters (length, girth and diameter, weight of flower, petal number, calyx splitting etc.) and yield parameters (number of flower/plant and seeds/inflorescence, seed weight etc.) were varied greatly from cultivar to cultivar. These parameters serve as key traits for crop improvement programme in which mutation breeding plays a vital stage...|$|R

Although many insect pests are associated with feed grasses, we report here the first occurrence of the fly Atherigona (Atherigona) reversura Villeneuve, 1936 (Diptera: Muscidae) feeding on bermudagrass in Brazil. This potential pest was observed in April 2015 in three localities (Abelardo Luz, Palmitos, and Videira) in western Santa Catarina, in southern Brazil. The infested plants had senescent and necrotic terminal leaves that reduced plant growth. New growth had to sprout new <b>tillers</b> from basal <b>nodes,</b> {{which resulted in a}} reduced plant growth rate. We also provide a morphological identification key (with figures) for A.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades switchgrass has {{received}} increasing attention as a promising bioenergy feedstock. Biomass is the principal trait for improvement in switchgrass breeding programs and tillering is an important component of biomass yield. Switchgrass inbred lines derived from a single parent showing vast variation in tiller number trait was used in this study. Axillary buds, which can develop into <b>tillers,</b> and <b>node</b> tissues, which give rise to axillary buds, were collected from high and low tillering inbred lines growing in field conditions. RNA from buds and nodes from the contrasting inbred lines were used for transcriptome profiling with switchgrass Affymetrix genechips. Nearly 7 % of the probesets on the genechip exhibited significant differential expression in these lines. Real-time PCR analysis of 30 genes confirmed the differential expression patterns observed with genechips. Cluster analysis aided in identifying probesets unique to high or low tillering lines as well as those specific to buds or <b>nodes</b> of high <b>tillering</b> lines. Rice orthologs of the switchgrass genes were used for gene ontology (GO) analysis with AgriGO. Enrichment of genes associated with amino acid biosynthesis, lipid transport and vesicular transport were observed in low tillering lines. Enrichment of GOs for translation, RNA binding and gene expression in high tillering lines were indicative of active metabolism associated with rapid growth and development. Identification of different classes of transcription factor genes suggests that regulation of many genes determines the complex process of axillary bud initiation and development. Genes identified in this study will complement the current ongoing efforts i...|$|R
40|$|Since {{more than}} ten years past a rice disease with bleached-tip of leaves has come to {{attention}} in Kyushu. The disease is observed both in upland and watered field. The bleached-tip symptom appears usually after the beginning of elongation growth. The tip of leaf about 2 to 5 cm. in length becomes pale yellowish green to white or transparent. Later the discolored part becomes brownish and is torn off. The affected leaf is considerably shortened and usually twisted at its apical portion. Commonly, the leaves with bleached-tips or white-tips are situated alternately on a stem. Sometimes, however, the bleached-tip symptoms are invisible on the whole leaves of affected plants. In paddy field in Kyushu, it is inferred that about three times of the numbers of stems with white-tips are affected by the pathogen.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of representatives of the tribe Triticеae (Triticum аestivum L., T. trispecies Shulind, Secale cereale L.) we have {{developed}} a conceptual model of management of the vital state of anthropogenically transformed ecosystems by the criteria of adaptation mechanisms, that are important for improving the controls of the vitality of culturivated plant species within certain ecosystems. Morpho-physiological and ontogenetic features of plants are considered as exogenous manifestation of adaptation to certain amplitude of ecological factors. According to preferences of {{the representatives of the}} tribe Triticeae for environmental conditions the plants were ranked by hygo-, helio-, trophomorphous affiliation as ecomorphs and subecomorphs. We established that an exogenous manifestation of high levels of adaptability of plant organisms to a variety of stress winter conditions was high photoperiodic sensitivity, which is manifested in morphological and physiological mechanisms, including weak growth in autumn and late spring vegetation restoration. The criteria of frost and winter resistance of plants are the accumulation of high overall sugar content in the <b>node</b> <b>tillering</b> (26 – 38 mg/g) as cryoprotectants and energy sources and their economical expenditure during the autumn-winter period. In drought resistant ecotypes growing in various habitats we detected smaller length, width and therefore area of flag leaf, however, the high index of leaf lamina, compared to leaves from less drought-prone areas. Expression was manifested of adaptive morphological and physiological changes (high index of leaf, glossy sheen, long duration of green colorin the flag leaf, the presence of awns, significant increase in dry mass for arid conditions caused by presence of alleles of genes of drought-resistant Dreb 1 glutenin Glu-D 1, gliadin Gli and high protein in the grain (14. 2 – 18. 0 %).

40|$|As one of {{the basic}} {{problems}} to establish seed production of two species of the tropical grasses, Green panic (Panicum maximum var. trichoglume) and Kazungula setaria (Setaria sphaeelata), morphological development and differentiation of the inflorescence on the main culm were investigated. At the same time, plant height, internodal elongation, numbers of leaves and tillers were also estimated in relation to the process of the inflorescence formation. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The differentiation of the inflorescences of Green panic and Kazungula setaria was initiated at the seventh and thirteenth leaf ages respectively. During 20 days after the differentiation of the inflorescence, tiller numbers of both the species increased at a uniform rate. After that, in the case of Green panic, <b>tillers</b> at the <b>nodes</b> higher than the soil surface level were observed, but not in Kazungula setaria. 2. Elongation of the internodes started on the fourth day after the differentiation of the inflorescence. Green panic attained the full length of the culm in 24 days and Kazungula setaria in 30 days. The inflorescence length started rapid increase on about the sixteenth day after the differentiation, and it finished at the ripe stage of the pollen. 3. In the case of Green panic, after the secondary branch primordia developed on all the primary ones, floret differentiation took place {{at the tip of the}} inflorescence and it proceeded towards the base. And in Kazungula setaria it proceeded from the middle towards both ends of the inflorescence. The secondary and the fourth protuberance primordia in Kazungula setaria developed into the florets, though the tertiary protuberance, primordia into the bristles. Green panic(Gp) とKazungula setaria(Ks) の種子生産の基礎問題として,幼穂の分化経過を形態的に追跡し,更にこれと草丈,節間伸長,主稈葉数,および分けつ数との関係を調査した. 調査材料は 1973 年 4 月下旬に苗箱に播種し,Gpは約 5 葉齢,Ksは約 9 葉齢のときに個体植えとし,主として主稈について調査した. 1) 幼穂の形成は,Gpでは主稈第 7 葉期,Ksでは同第 13 葉期に認められる. また分けつ数は両草種とも幼穂形成後 20 日間は,ほぼ一定の割合で増加する. Gpではその後も地面より高い節位から分けつ(高節位分けつ) が生じ,その数も増加したが,この現象はKsではみられない. 2) 両草種とも幼穂形成後 4 日めから節間伸長を始める. その後,茎の伸長はGpでは 24 日目,Ksでは 30 日目に停止する. また幼穂長は,両草種とも形成後 16 日目頃より急速に伸び,花粉完成期に停止する. 3) Gpではすべての第 1 次枝梗始原体に第 2 次枝梗始原体が分化して,初めて幼穂の先端から頴花分化が開始され,しだいに下部の小穂へと進むが,Ksでは幼穂の中央部より分化を開始し,しだいに上部と下部に及ぶ. なおKsでは第 2 次突起と第 4 次突起始原体が頴花に発達し,第 3 次突起始原体は硬毛に発達する...|$|R

Primary mapping on a F 2 population revealed two major QTL, qPN 1 and qPN 11, each with ~ 22 % phenotypic variation explained (PVE). When both qPN 1 alleles are from TNG 67, allele of qPN 11 from SA 1613. 1 acts dominantly to produce rootless plant with tiny single tiller, abbreviated as “rolts”. To characterize effect of the qPN 11 allele independently, and to construct materials for its fine-mapping, a Near-Isogenic Line (NIL) {{was supposed to be}} established by backcrossing. However, the tiny single tiller phenotype for such a NIL hindered this process. A Backcrossed Recombinant Inbreed Line (BRIL) which heterozygous on both qPN 1 and qPN 11 but mostly homozygous as TNG 67 throughout the genome was therefore established instead. Marker-assisted selections (MAS) were employed during the breeding process. Finally, using 146 BC 2 F 5 segregating progenies from the selected BC 2 F 4 BRIL line, candidate genes for qPN 11 was narrowed down to a 2 Mb region, most likely reside between two InDel markers, I 32635 - 4 and D 32674, which is 300 kb apart. To characterize phenotypic defects of rolts, BC 2 F 5 segregating seedlings were screened by markers that associated with qPN 1 and qPN 11. Hydroponic culture of rolts seedlings revealed an early symptom on 5 DAG, showing short seminal root, very few lateral root and absence of adventitious root. Noticeably, formation of tiller but not adventitious root resumed if rolts seedlings were remained within hydroponic culture, indicates that no major defect for its <b>tiller</b> development. Moreover, <b>node</b> seems to be formed normally in rolts plant as its node number reached ~ 15 in mature plants, although very tiny. Cryo scanning electron microscopic examination of 14 DAG seedlings revealed a similar radial structure between normal and rolts plants, suggesting that pattern formation and differentiation are not affected. Further confocal microscopic studies suggest that rolts plant is basically normal in cell size and organization, with thicker cell wall and more varied cell shape. However, no long cell {{can be found in the}} root elongation zone and almost all cell form root hair. Therefore, the major defect for rolts seems to be on cell elongation. 前言……………………………………………………………………… 1 前人研究………………………………………………………………… 2 一、水稻外觀與生活史…………………………………………… 2 二、水稻根部型態與生長發育…………………………………… 2 三、影響水稻根部生長知相關基因……………………………… 3 四、植物荷爾蒙對根的生長調控………………………………… 4 五、基因據圖選殖法……………………………………………… 5 六、分子標誌輔助選拔…………………………………………… 5 七、水耕栽培……………………………………………………… 6 材料與方法……………………………………………………………… 7 一、試驗材料……………………………………………………… 7 (一) 台農 67 號 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica, cv.
