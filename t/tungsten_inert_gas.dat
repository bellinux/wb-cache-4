5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} <b>tungsten</b> <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effect of heat input on the quality {{characteristics}} of <b>tungsten</b> <b>inert</b> arc <b>gas</b> welded incoloy 800 HT joints using inconel- 82 filler wire. Butt welding was done on specimens with four different heat inputs by varying the process parameters like welding current and speed. The result indicated that higher heat input levels has {{led to the formation of}} coarser grain structure, reduced mechanical properties and sensitization issues on the weldments. The formation of titanium nitrides provided resistance to fracture and increased the tensile strength of the joints at high temperatures. Further aging was done on the welded sample at a temperature of 750 °C for 500 hours and the metallographic result showed formation of carbides along the grain boundaries in a chain of discrete and globular form which increased the hardness of the material. The formation of spinel NiCr 2 O 4 provided oxidation resistance to the material during elevated temperature service...|$|R
500|$|Russell Meredith of Northrop Aircraft {{perfected the}} process in 1941. Meredith named the process Heliarc because it used a {{tungsten}} electrode arc and helium as a shielding gas, but it {{is often referred to}} as <b>tungsten</b> <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> welding (TIG). [...] The American Welding Society's official term is gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Linde Air Products developed a wide range of air-cooled and water-cooled torches, gas lenses to improve shielding, and other accessories that increased the use of the process. Initially, the electrode overheated quickly and, despite tungsten's high melting temperature, particles of tungsten were transferred to the weld. To address this problem, the polarity of the electrode was changed from positive to negative, but the change made it unsuitable for welding many non-ferrous materials. Finally, the development of alternating current units made it possible to stabilize the arc and produce high quality aluminum and magnesium welds.|$|E

2500|$|Tungsten and its alloys {{are often}} used in {{applications}} where high temperatures are present but still a high strength is necessary and the high density is not troublesome. Tungsten wire filaments provide {{the vast majority of}} household incandescent lighting, but are also common in industrial lighting as electrodes in arc lamps. Lamps get more efficient in the conversion of electric energy to light with higher temperatures and therefore a high melting point is essential for the application as filament in incandescent light. [...] Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW, also known as <b>tungsten</b> <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> (TIG) welding) equipment uses a permanent, non-melting electrode.

Data on high-Z ions will be important in this quest.
