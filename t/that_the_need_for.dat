5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly {{over the period}} between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed {{at least in part}} to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E
5|$|A giant clone of Keniclius, named Keniclius Five, kidnaps First Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). He {{believes}} the galaxy is as war-ravaged as Earth {{was when he}} left it. He plans to enforce peace on the galaxy {{with the aid of}} a fleet of Phylosian ships and a giant clone of Spock that he's created, at the expense of the original Spock's life. The newly awakened giant Spock clone uses his Vulcan telepathic abilities to mind meld with his original self and save his life. The two Spocks, in concert with Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner), convince Keniclius <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> his plan no longer exists. Spock Two and Dr. Keniclius Five devote themselves to restoring the Phylosian civilization as the original departs with his shipmates.|$|E
5|$|The NPVIC {{does not}} include any {{provision}} for a nationwide recount {{in the event that}} the vote tally is in dispute. While each state has established rules governing recounts {{in the event of a}} close or disputed statewide tally, it is possible for the national vote to be close without there being a close result in any one state. Proponents of the compact argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a recount would be less likely under a national popular vote than under the current electoral system.|$|E

50|$|In 1905, the Catholic archbishops of the United States {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> Catholic mission work in {{the black}} community exceeded the funding available from the annual appeal administered by the Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians.To create a second funding stream, the archbishops called for the establishment of the Catholic Board, which they incorporated in 1907 with Fr. John E. Burke as executive director in New York City.|$|R
25|$|Justice William O. Douglas largely concurred with Black, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a {{free press}} as a check on {{government}} prevents any governmental restraint on the press.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{also argued}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the {{expressway}} was not shown in studies. A 1963 transportation study which supported construction, expected {{the population of}} Hamilton to be 785,000 by 1985, while the actual population reached 480,000 by 2001. Employment in the industrial bayfront had dropped and a commuting route between Hamilton Mountain and the bayfront was less necessary.|$|E
25|$|It {{had long}} been {{recognised}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> Main Line trains to reverse at Greenisland was undesirable. Various plans for a direct line bypassing Greenisland had been proposed over the years but the engineering problems faced by having to cross Valentine's Glen near Whiteabbey and surmount Mossley Col had precluded these. However, construction started on such a scheme on 1 January 1931.|$|E

25|$|Tasers {{and other}} {{electronic}} control devices are considered firearms in Sweden and are banned for civilian use. The Swedish police had purchased a limited quantity of Tasers, {{and was about}} to initiate field trials when these were cancelled in 2005 after an ethics commission found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> (and risks of) such devices was not firmly established. The purchased Tasers were then donated to Finland, where field trials were initiated.|$|E
25|$|Love stories such as Solid Snake and Meryl Silverburgh (from Metal Gear Solid), {{which takes}} on {{more of a}} subtle approach, and couples defined more by their {{conflicts}} than their happiness, have also impacted the gaming industry. Video game insiders state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> these love stories within the gaming realm is valid and is a great addition to the gaming experience in most cases.|$|E
25|$|Other aspects are {{highlighted}} in different theories as of contributing importance. It is sometimes claimed that technological development, religious development, or socialization of members {{are crucial to}} state development. However, most of these factors {{are found to be}} secondary in anthropological analysis. In addition to conquest, some theories contend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> defense from military conquest or the military organization to conquer other peoples is the key aspect leading to state formation.|$|E

25|$|After NLA {{was founded}} in 1977, it started working to {{establish}} a permanent ambulance helicopter base in the central parts of Eastern Norway. Initially the foundation started fund-raising to run a one-year trial with a helicopter based near Oslo. The proposal {{was rejected by the}} Ministry of Social Affairs, which stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> such a service would be primarily in remote locations and that an equal service for the whole country would have to be established for state funding.|$|E
25|$|Each side {{employed}} a literary expert to testify {{whether or not}} the Lexicon had copied text without attribution. RDR hired a literature professor from the University of California, Berkeley, who cited reference guides to The Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia as precedents to the Lexicon's book. David Hammer, lawyer for RDR, claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a reference guide was greatest when the work being discussed is most creative, and fantasy is presumably the most creative form of literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, the divisions intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.|$|E

25|$|A public authority's duties are {{generally}} imposed by legislation, which gives it discretion {{as to how}} to meet the objectives of the Act while working within a finite budget. The financial resources available to a public authority when making discretionary choices in respect of the performance of its duties {{may or may not be}} a relevant consideration depending on how the courts interpret the overall legislative scheme. In certain cases, a court might find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> services cannot be assessed without having some regard to the cost of providing them, while in others the court might decide that financial resources are an irrelevant factor.|$|E
25|$|Georgia has {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> fresh water {{to use for}} human consumption is its primary concern in the issue. Experts in the metro Atlanta area assert {{that the people of}} metro Atlanta require and can safely extract 705 million gallons of fresh water per day from a number of reservoir and water basins around northern Georgia until the year 2030. Georgia states the water from Lake Allatoona and the Etowah River in North Georgia could sustain the water needs of the metro Atlanta area. Georgia's main concern is whether or not they have the capability to supply over 5.6 million people in the metro Atlanta area with potable water.|$|E
25|$|Employment of {{registered}} nurses and nurse practitioners {{is expected to}} increase immensely in the next ten years through legislation and the idea of short-term savings. Much of the growth is expected to come as a result of legislation and proliferation of online schools, leading to the idea of better health care and a greater variety of solutions for health problems which have not been proven through appropriate research. Also, life expectancy is getting longer; therefore more patients are living longer and living more active lives. It is further anticipated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> NPs will increase because of the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority. This {{is not to say}} that the phase of art denoted by {{post-modernism}} is accepted, merely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a term to describe movements in art after the peak of abstract expressionism is well established. However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|According to Marvin Harris, another {{anthropologist}} {{and among}} the first proponents of cultural materialism, these killings of legitimate children occurred only among the Rajputs and other elite land-owning and warrior groups. The rationale was mainly economic, lying in a desire not to split land and wealth among too many heirs and in avoiding the payment of dowries. Sisters and daughters would marry men of similar standing and thus pose {{a challenge to the}} cohesion of wealth and power, whereas concubines and their children would not and thus could be allowed to live. He further argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> warriors in the villages of a pre-industrial society meant female children were devalued, and the combination of war casualties and infanticide acted as a necessary form of population control.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of ideas which promote a {{specific}} change in behaviour as the key driver for the evolution of hominid bipedalism. For example, Wescott (1967) and later Jablonski & Chaplin (1993) suggest that bipedal threat displays could have been the transitional behaviour which led to some groups of apes beginning to adopt bipedal postures more often. Others (e.g. Dart 1925) have offered the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> more vigilance against predators could have provided the initial motivation. Dawkins (e.g. 2004) has argued that it could have begun as a kind of fashion that just caught on and then escalated through sexual selection. And it has even been suggested (e.g. Tanner 1981:165) that male phallic display could have been the initial incentive, as well as increased sexual signaling in upright female posture.|$|E
