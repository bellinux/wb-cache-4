5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol {{but not more than}} three pills per day.|$|E

25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E

25|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the revolution, {{and during the}} communist persecutions up to 1970, no canonizations took place. Only in 1970 did the Holy Synod {{made a decision to}} canonize a missionary to Japan, Nicholas Kasatkin (1836–1912). In 1977, St. Innocent of Moscow (1797–1879), the Metropolitan of Siberia, the Far East, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and Moscow was also canonized. In 1978 it was proclaimed that the Russian Orthodox Church had created a prayer order for Meletius of Kharkov, which practically signified his canonization because that was the only possible way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> that time. Similarly, the saints of other Orthodox Churches were added to the Church calendar: in 1962 St. John the Russian, in 1970 St. Herman of Alaska, in 1993 Silouan the Athonite, the elder of Mount Athos, already canonized in 1987 by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. In the 1980s the Russian Orthodox Church re-established the process for canonization; a practice that had ceased for half a century.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{intended}} to be a made-for-TV film, the film's producer Kenith Trodd upgraded his original plan to a cinema feature. The original working title for the film was [...] "Falling Man". Playwright Simon Gray was commissioned to write the screenplay, and Pat O'Connor chosen to direct. In contrast to the book, which is narrated as a recollection by Birkin as an old man, the film is set entirely in the 1920s, except for a brief moment towards the end. In initial drafts of the screenplay, Gray had included a narrator, but O'Connor felt this was not the correct way to present the story:I felt that if I couldn’t do it in the present, suggesting internal pain by performance, then I wouldn’t really want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E

Ocean, when {{uploading}} the album to iTunes, labeled it as bluegrass and death metal, out of arbitrariness. When asked {{about why he}} uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; [...] "I don't want to seem like I have a cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [...] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the level, the quality of records I wanted to make… But, it was a process I appreciate so much." ...|$|E

In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it.

[...] After work, while walking back to his car, he stops and gets down on one knee. When Pam stops and looks he says he has a question to ask her. After a second or so of hesitation, he asks her if she will wait while he ties his shoes. She laughs and they continue walking hand in hand.

He batted [...]333 with 62 hits, 13 home runs, and 42 RBI in 46 games before earning a promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League. In 31 games with Oklahoma, he hit [...]333 with 37 hits, 10 home runs, and 31 RBI. He {{was named to the}} All-Star Futures Game but was unable to play in it because he was promoted to the major leagues by the Texas Rangers. Later, during his breakout 2013 season, Davis referred to his time with Round Rock in 2008: [...] "I know nobody really cares about Triple-A, but I put up these numbers up in Triple-A. That was kind of the question, 'Was he going to be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the big league level?' The thing about it was, I just couldn't do it consistently. I couldn't put the bat on the ball. I was striking out an astronomical amount, and this year it's just been consistency day in and day out." ...|$|E

Caleb Swanigan {{verbally}} committed to Michigan State on April 10, 2015, but decommitted on May 7. He said, [...] "I just {{felt like it was}} better basketball-wise for me." [...] Similar to his high school decision, Barnes said, [...] "He wants to win a national championship and said he wants {{to do it in the}} state of Indiana and wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> a place he's never done it before." [...] Some people believe Barnes had ulterior motives in adopting Swanigan, to which Barnes said, [...] "Maybe if I wanted to develop the next hot-dog-eating champion, the next Joey Chestnut, people would have a legitimate gripe." [...] Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons, which allowed Swanigan to play the 4 spot.|$|E

This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem to be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to show you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E
