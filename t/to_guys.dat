500|$|In the original, non-broadcast pilot, Willow {{was portrayed}} by Riff Regan. However, network {{executives}} requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded {{that she be}} shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actresses who could portray this effectively and still be likable. After seven auditions, Alyson Hannigan was eventually chosen for the role. She was chosen {{for being able to}} spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism; she stated, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself. Especially in the first season, she couldn't talk <b>to</b> <b>guys,</b> and nobody liked her. I was like, 'I don't want to play somebody who's down on herself." [...] Whedon conceived the character as introverted, saying [...] "I wanted Willow {{to have that kind of}} insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great. To an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, but it really stands out in Willow's case." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Kornheiser's {{first game}} on Monday Night Football, Paul Farhi wrote in The Washington Post that Kornheiser had {{emphasized}} the obvious, played third fiddle, and was reminiscent of Dennis Miller [...] "in a bad way." [...] Kornheiser responded {{during an interview}} on The Dan Patrick Show on August 15, 2006, saying that Farhi was a [...] "two-bit weasel slug" [...] and his own newspaper had back-stabbed him. His response generated more criticism from The Washington Post and other media outlets. Other criticism has come from Toronto Argonauts play-by-play commentator Mike Hogan, who said, [...] "The thing that really bothers me is that Kornheiser doesn't seem to know his place. If you're there for comic relief, that's one thing. But for God's sake, leave the football analysis <b>to</b> <b>guys</b> who actually played the game." [...] Former NFL offensive lineman Mike Schad also criticized Kornheiser, saying that [...] "when people watch a game, they want to learn something. I don't need a guy who's sarcastic or trying to be funny. I love listening to Ron Jaworski on Monday Nights. He played the game and has lots of good insight and Kornheiser just gets in his way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) {{was originally}} conceived by Joss Whedon for a 1992 feature film. However, in its development Whedon felt it {{lost some of}} the quirkiness he considered was {{the heart of the}} project, and it was not received as well as he liked. He began to develop for television the concept of a fashion-conscious girl named Buffy, who is imbued with superhuman abilities and attends a high school situated on a portal to hell. Whedon created a group of friends for the main character, including Willow Rosenberg and Xander Harris. A half-hour pilot was filmed starring Riff Regan as Willow, but it was eventually left unaired and network executives requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded that she be shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actors who could portray this effectively and still be likable. After seven auditions, 23-year-old Alyson Hannigan was hired for the role. She was chosen for being able to spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism. She later stated in an interview, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself. Especially in the first season, she couldn't talk <b>to</b> <b>guys,</b> and nobody liked her. I was like, 'I don't want to play somebody who's down on herself.'" ...|$|E
