5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved <b>the</b> <b>limestone.</b> As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|Bristol {{is part of}} a {{limestone}} area {{running from}} the Mendip Hills in the south to the Cotswolds in the northeast. The rivers Avon and Frome cut through <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> to the underlying clay, creating Bristol's characteristically hilly landscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.|$|E
5|$|Glacial meltwaters {{also contributed}} to the {{formation}} and development of many of the caves in <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> area. Wild animal herds roamed the area, and their remains have been found in several of the local caves.|$|E

40|$|Vast {{deposits}} of limestones of Late Maastrichtian to Paleocene age {{occur in the}} Ohafia, Ozu-Abam and Arochukwu areas of southeastern Nigeria. The present study sought to gain insight into the evolutionary history and conditions of formation of <b>the</b> <b>limestones,</b> through detail investigations and characterization of the diagenetic processes that affected the rock. The diagenetic processes considered include cementation, neomorphism, micritization, compaction and dissolution. Dolomitization process was not considered because it was conspicuously absent in all the thin sections examined. The cement types observed include blocky or equant mosaic calcite cement, drusy mosaic calcite cement, micritic calcite cement with a meniscus fabric, and acicular aragonite cement. Micritization of bioclasts in <b>the</b> <b>limestones</b> is very low and is characterized by thin micritic envelopes covering the grain surfaces. Neomorphism is a prominent feature of <b>the</b> <b>limestones</b> and {{is responsible for the}} formation of large sized crystals in <b>the</b> <b>limestones.</b> Compaction is discernible by a parallel alignment of fractures in a thin section. Dissolution in <b>the</b> <b>limestones</b> is shown by the presence of solution cavities in the thin section. Dolomitization were not observed in <b>the</b> <b>limestones.</b> <b>The</b> various diagenetic transformations that the Late Maastrichtian to Paleocene limestones of Ohafia, Ozu-Abam and Arochukwu areas of southeastern Nigeria have undergone corroborates development under shallow marine conditions.

5|$|Much of the {{landscape}} falls into types determined by the underlying geology. These landscapes are <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> karst and lias of the north, the central clay vales and wetlands, the oolites of the east and south, and the Devonian sandstone of the west.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, twelve body fossil {{specimens}} of Archaeopteryx and a feather that may belong to {{it have been}} found. All of the fossils come from <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> deposits, quarried for centuries, near Solnhofen, Germany.|$|E
5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E
50|$|In {{parts of}} its eastern stretches, Muldraugh Hill {{is little more}} than a slight hill, but in some of the western areas, it is {{represented}} by extensive areas of knobs.

5|$|The {{comparatively}} {{warm and}} sunny climate allows {{species of plants}} to thrive which do not on the mainland. <b>The</b> <b>limestone</b> soil has low nutrient levels; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able {{to grow in the}} absence of larger species. Portland sea lavender {{can be found on the}} higher sea cliffs—unique to Portland it is one of the United Kingdom's rarest plants. The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland, including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe. Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom, including <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> race of the silver-studded blue.|$|E
50|$|The rock strata at Boho Caves {{date from}} the Asbian substage of the Carboniferous period, {{estimated}} to be around 325 million years old.

40|$|<b>The</b> Delaware <b>Limestone</b> {{of southwestern}} Ontario was {{originally}} called {{a part of}} <b>the</b> Corniferous <b>Limestone</b> by Murray (184. 3 - 53). Since that time the same outcroppings have been designated, either wholly or partially, as the Onondaga Formation, the Big Lime, Delaware Limestone, Norfolk Formation, Dundee Limestone, Columbus <b>Limestone,</b> and <b>the</b> Dundee (= Delaware) Limestone. As recently as 1971 <b>the</b> names Dundee <b>Limestone</b> and Delaware Limestone {{were used for the}} same formation. Hand specimen and petrographic study of samples from nineteen localities in southwestern Ontario indicates that <b>the</b> <b>limestones</b> of <b>the</b> formation exposed on the Niagara peninsula are intermediate in type between the rocks of <b>the</b> Delaware <b>Limestone</b> of Ohio and those of <b>the</b> Dundee <b>Limestone</b> of Michigan. <b>The</b> formation in Ontario becomes more like <b>the</b> Delaware <b>Limestone</b> southeast of <b>the</b> Findlay Arch and becomes more like <b>the</b> Dundee <b>Limestone</b> northwest of it. A comparison of the fauna and flora shows that more key species are common to the Ontario and Ohio formations than to the Ontario and Michigan ones.

5|$|The {{terrain of}} South Florida is {{relatively}} and consistently flat. <b>The</b> <b>limestone</b> that underlies the Everglades {{is integral to}} the diverse ecosystems within the park. Florida was once part of the African portion of the supercontinent Gondwana. After it separated, conditions allowed a shallow marine environment to deposit calcium carbonate in sand, shells, and coral to be converted into limestone. Tiny bits of shell, sand, and bryozoans compressed over multiple layers forming structures in <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> called ooids, which created permeable conditions that hold water.|$|E
5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once arid and semi-arid, interspersed with wet periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000years ago, sea levels rose, submerging portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated <b>the</b> <b>limestone,</b> eroding some of it and creating springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and through evaporation formed thunderstorms. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. <b>The</b> <b>limestone</b> wore away, and groundwater {{came into contact with}} the surface, creating a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference of inches in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.|$|E
5|$|A stream issuing to {{the west}} of the site runs down the {{tributary}} valley of Hope Wood before joining the main gorge.

40|$|Interpillow limestones were {{recovered}} from numerous cores of Leg 82. Limestones from Core 562 - 1, {{south of the}} Hayes Fracture Zone, display small-scale cross laminations composed of planktonic foraminiferal tests alternating with micrite. In nonlaminated portions of <b>the</b> <b>limestones,</b> graded bedding is evident.

5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E

5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt <b>the</b> <b>limestone</b> horizontally.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the comparative effects of calcium and magnesium limestones applied to Carrington loam, Tama silt loam and Grundy silt loam. These soils are all acid in reaction and have a lime requirement of about 3 tons per acre. They occur extensively in Iowa and are among the better agricultural soils of the state. Studies were made of the effects of <b>the</b> <b>limestones</b> on <b>the</b> hydrogen-ion concentration, the lime requirement, the exchangeable hydrogen, calcium and magnesium and on the degree of saturation of the exchange complex with bases. Studies were also made of the nitrate content and the nitrifying power of these soils as influenced by <b>the</b> two <b>limestones,</b> and of <b>the</b> yields of wheat and red clover on the Carrington loam and the Tama silt loam treated with <b>the</b> two <b>limestones.</b> <b>The</b> data obtained indicate that <b>the</b> calcium <b>limestone</b> reacted somewhat more rapidly with the soil acids than <b>the</b> magnesium <b>limestone.</b> It reduced <b>the</b> acidity more and stimulated a greater production of nitrates in the soil during the first few weeks after <b>the</b> <b>limestones</b> were applied. This advantage of <b>the</b> calcium <b>limestone</b> was apparently overcome by <b>the</b> magnesium <b>limestone</b> rather quickly and after 8 to 12 weeks there was no apparent difference in the effects of <b>the</b> two <b>limestones</b> on any of the chemical or bacteriological characteristics of the soils studied. Neither limestone was superior in its effects on the yields of wheat and clover. It is concluded from these experiments that in agricultural practice either limestone may be used to advantage to correct the acidity of soils, their long-time effects being practically identical...|$|R
