40|$|We analyze charmonium and bottomonium {{production}} at <b>fixed</b> <b>target</b> experiments.

40|$|Dynamic {{balance control}} - characterised as {{movement}} of the trunk and lower limbs - was assessed during fixation of a <b>fixed</b> <b>target,</b> smooth pursuits and saccadic eye movements in ten young (22. 9 ± 1. 5 years) and ten older (72. 1 ± 8. 2 years) healthy females walking overground. Participants were presented with visual stimuli to initiate eye movements, and posture and gaze were assessed with motion analysis and eye tracking equipment. The results showed an increase in medial/lateral (ML) trunk movement (C 7 : p = 0. 012; sacrum: p = 0. 009) and step-width variability (p = 0. 052) during smooth pursuits compared <b>to</b> a <b>fixed</b> <b>target,</b> with no changes for saccades compared <b>to</b> a <b>fixed</b> <b>target.</b> The elders demonstrated greater ML trunk movement (sacrum: p = 0. 037) and step-width variability (p = 0. 037) than the younger adults throughout, although this did not interact with the eye movements. The findings showed that smooth pursuits decreased balance control in young and older adults similarly, which was likely a consequence of more complicated retinal flow. Since healthy elders are typically already at a postural disadvantage, further decreases in balance caused by smooth pursuits are undesirable...|$|R

We show that the somewhat counterintuitive strategy of cutting links along a single line connecting A to B creates such a channel. The efficient transport along the cut is due to topologically protected chiral edge states, which exist even though the bulk Chern number in this system vanishes. We give a realization of the walk as a periodically driven lattice Hamiltonian, and identify the bulk topological invariant responsible for the edge states as the quasienergy winding of this Hamiltonian...|$|R

40|$|The tagging of spectator nucleons in polarised and unpolarised {{electron}} deuteron scattering {{offers the}} possibility to measure proton and neutron structure functions separately in the same nuclear environment. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>target</b> experiments, the spectator in collider mode has large momentum and is therefore rather easy to measure. In a polarised deuteron beam proton and neutron are both polarised. Tagging offers the ideal figure of merit, superior to any subtraction method of H, D and 3 He beams. As the proton and neutron asymmetries are measured simultaneously in one experiment many systematic uncertainties cancel and provide optimal conditions to measure the Bjorken Sum Rule. From the machine point of view, the acceleration of polarised deuterons compared to protons has both advantages and difficulties.
