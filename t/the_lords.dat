5|$|Prior to the 16th century, <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} houses of Parliament. A process of gradual developments combined with such moments of crisis as the English Civil Wars transferred the political control of England, first from the Crown to the House of Lords {{and then to the}} House of Commons. The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars, dethrone two Kings, and gradually reduce the power of <b>the</b> <b>Lords.</b> Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, the power of <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> of the ability to block, or veto, adoption of most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons has absolute power when it comes to money bills.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} threatened another dissolution if {{the bill}} for the Parliament Act were not passed, and followed through on their threat when opposition in <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> did not diminish. The general election of December produced little change from January. The calling of a second dissolution of parliament now {{seems to have been}} contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, was asked if he would be prepared to create sufficient peers, which he would only do if the matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King did, however, demand that the bill would have to be rejected at least once by <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> before his intervention. Two amendments made by <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led Asquith to declare the King's intention to overcome the majority in the House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> by 131 votes to 114 votes, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{passed through}} the Parliament Act, {{without the consent of}} <b>the</b> <b>Lords,</b> is still {{considered}} primary legislation. The importance of this was highlighted in Jackson v Attorney General, in which the lawfulness of the Parliament Act 1949 was questioned. The challenge asserted that the 1949 Parliament Act was delegated rather than primary legislation, and that the 1911 Parliament Act had delegated power to the Commons. If this were the case, then the House of Commons could not empower itself through the 1949 Parliament Act without direct permission from the House of Lords. Since it was passed under the 1911 Act, the 1949 Act had never received the required consent of <b>the</b> <b>Lords.</b> However, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords found that the 1949 Act had been lawfully enacted. The 1911 Act, it concluded, was not primarily about empowering the Commons, but rather had the purpose of restricting the ability of <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> to reject legislation. This ruling also appears to mean that efforts to abolish the House of Lords (a major constitutional change) by using the Act could be successful, although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling.|$|E

5|$|Until the Parliament Act 1911, {{there was}} no way to resolve contradictions between the two houses of {{parliament}} except through the creation of additional peers by the monarch. Queen Anne had created 12 Tory peers to vote through the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The Reform Act 1832 was passed when the House of Lords dropped opposition—William IV had threatened to create 80 new peers by request of the prime minister, Earl Grey—creating an informal convention that <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> would give way when the public was behind the House of Commons. For example, Irish disestablishment, which had been a major bone of contention between the two main parties since the 1830s, was—following intervention by the queen—passed by <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> in 1869 after W.E. Gladstone won the 1868 election on the issue. However, in practice, this gave <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> a right to demand that such public support be present and to decide the timing of a general election.|$|E
5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to <b>the</b> <b>Lords,</b> and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give <b>the</b> <b>Lords</b> jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E
5|$|Additionally {{in early}} May, Charles assented to an {{unprecedented}} Act that forbade {{the dissolution of the}} English Parliament without its consent. In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished. All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act. The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in <b>the</b> <b>Lords.</b>|$|E
