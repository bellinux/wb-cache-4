5|$|Besides sermons Wulfstan {{was also}} {{instrumental}} in drafting law codes for both kings Æthelred the Unready and Cnut the Great of England. He {{is considered one}} of the two major writers of the late Anglo-Saxon period in England. After his death in 1023, miracles were said to have occurred at his tomb, but attempts <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> declared a saint never bore fruit.|$|E
5|$|C. J. gets emotionally {{involved}} in {{a story about the}} deadly assault on a homosexual youth. She sees {{this as an opportunity to}} push hate crime legislation, but the suggestion finds little support among the others. Reporter Danny Concannon also disagrees, but this encourages her to finally accept his offer of a date, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> convince her.|$|E

5|$|Duke of Marmalade did {{not appear}} again until the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, {{for which he was}} made 4/1 second {{favourite}} despite O'Brien expressing concern over the soft ground. He was settled on the outside, but when Murtagh attempted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> move forward in the straight, he made no progress and finished seventh of the sixteen runners behind Zarkava.|$|E
5|$|It was Johnson's {{practice}} to avoid interference with military decisions, however he supported Morgan's request for two light artillery pieces that became hallmarks of his command. By contrast, he consistently opposed {{the command of}} General Lloyd Tilghman, trying repeatedly but unsuccessfully <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> removed. It is unclear how much military influence Johnson wielded in his position as governor, though he enjoyed a cordial relationship {{with most of the}} Confederate generals.|$|E
5|$|Jonah Hill {{plays the}} Junior Philosopher, a {{teenager}} Hal meets {{in the library}} while studying for the policy debate with Ginny. Hill had initially auditioned for another role in the film, but was unavailable as he was shooting another film at the same time. Blitz was keen <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> appear, though, and so wrote him a small role as the Junior Philosopher, appearing in only two scenes.|$|E

No feeling of shame would have kept her silent for a moment.|$|R

5|$|Macklin {{believed}} that Shackleton {{may have been}} influenced in his decision by Worsley who shared a mutual enmity with McNish, and had accompanied Shackleton back from Antarctica. Members of the Scott Polar Research Institute, New Zealand Antarctic Society and Caroline Alexander, the author of Endurance, have criticised Shackleton's denial of the award to McNish, {{and there is an}} ongoing campaign <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> awarded the medal posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Ochs's friends {{tried to}} help him. His brother Michael {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> committed to a psychiatric hospital. Friends pleaded with him to get help voluntarily.

5|$|Serving {{during the}} {{disorders}} of Stephen's reign, Theobald succeeded in forcing peace on the king {{by refusing to}} consecrate Stephen's son and heir, Eustace. After Eustace's death in 1153, Stephen recognised his rival Henry of Anjou as his heir, and later Theobald was named regent of the kingdom after Stephen's death. After a long illness, Theobald died in 1161, following which unsuccessful efforts were made <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> canonised as a saint.|$|E

5000|$|His owner said of him [...] "He was a marvellous racehorse {{and one of}} the {{greatest}} stayers. It was just as much of a thrill <b>to</b> <b>have</b> bred <b>him</b> as <b>to</b> <b>have</b> raced <b>him.</b> Champions like him don't come along often." ...|$|R
5|$|Shortly before Hitler was {{eligible}} for parole, the Bavarian government attempted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> deported back to Austria. The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his {{service in the}} German Army made his Austrian citizenship void. In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there is}} no {{physical}} evidence to prove that Rappo killed Callahan's wife and son, the case remains unsolved. Mulder's narration states that Rappo's family tries <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> buried at Arlington National Cemetery; he is instead buried in a civilian cemetery in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Britain's Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901 left King George as the second-longest-reigning monarch in Europe. His always cordial {{relations}} with his brother-in-law, the new King Edward VII, continued to tie Greece to Britain. This was abundantly important in Britain's support of King George's son Prince George as Governor-General of Crete. Nevertheless, Prince George resigned in 1906 after {{a leader in}} the Cretan Assembly, Eleftherios Venizelos, campaigned <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> removed.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel and {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino. Appel was looking for new locales to put Bart and {{thought it would be}} funny <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> work at a burlesque house. The problem was {{to find a way to}} put such a house in Springfield, which was solved with the bit with the toy airplane. There were a dozen different possible names for the Burlesque house, some of which were raunchy.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Vincent discovers Ronnie planned <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> {{killed and}} crushed in a car, but {{asked for the}} car's driver to be killed, {{assuming}} it would be Vincent, but Vincent finds the car and discovers Fatboy is dead. It is later revealed that Vincent's mother, Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), knew that Vincent would be killed if he was driving, so sent Fatboy instead.|$|E
60|$|Theodora's Christmas {{morning was}} cheered by {{a letter from}} Percy, {{to tell her that}} he was to be with Arthur and Violet on this occasion. It was greater {{happiness}} to her than it would even <b>have</b> been <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> at Brogden.|$|R

60|$|This unlucky {{sentence}} is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> crippled <b>him</b> {{in the midst}} of his tragic career, and ultimately <b>to</b> <b>have</b> driven <b>him</b> from the stage. He carried into the bookselling craft somewhat of the grandiose manner of the stage, and was prone to be mouthy and magniloquent.|$|R
5|$|This {{competitive}} {{group would}} spur McCudden {{to increase his}} score. 56's commanding officer, Major Richard Bloomfield noticed McCudden's leadership qualities and had hoped he could help turn the unit into an effective fighting team. At present the pilots, though talented, performed more as individuals. After flying {{for the first time}} with them Bloomfield promised <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> allocated to a position of Flight Commander. He formally took command of B flight on 14 August.|$|E
5|$|While Buckner was a Union {{prisoner}} of war at Fort Warren in Boston, Kentucky Senator Garrett Davis unsuccessfully sought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> tried for treason.

5|$|A coronial inquiry was {{conducted}} by the acting district officer in Talasea, which did not find a cause of death but concluded {{that there were no}} suspicious circumstances. It is believed that he died of complications from his war wounds. The men of the 10th Battalion AIF Club contacted his widow to ask that his remains be reinterred in the AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, South Australia, and offered their assistance, but she declined, choosing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>him</b> remain buried on Garua Island in New Guinea. On 23 April 1927, a photograph of Wilder-Neligan's grave was published {{on the front page of}} the Adelaide newspaper, The Mail, along with a summary of his exploits during the war.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah, {{he seems}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been a man}} of another breed. I could have asked nothing better than <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>him</b> at my sword-point.
