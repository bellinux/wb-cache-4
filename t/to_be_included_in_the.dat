5|$|All artwork for {{the album}} was {{selected}} from a contest held by DeviantArt.

Mustaine chose from the top 11 finalists <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CD booklet.

Although the cover of the CD was not the winner of the contest, Mustaine chose it as his favorite picture, and wanted it for the cover. No photographs of the band were taken for the CD booklet, leaving the entire design as fan-made artwork.|$|E
