5|$|Use {{of the era}} {{name was}} {{formally}} adopted {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC), yet its origins can be traced back further. The oldest method of recording years—which had existed since the Shang—set <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of a ruler's reign as year one. When an emperor died, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of a new reign period would begin. This system was changed by the 4th century BC when <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of a new reign period did not begin until {{the first day of the}} lunar New Year following a ruler's death. When Duke Huiwen of Qin assumed the title of king in 324 BC, he changed the year count of his reign back to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> For his newly adopted calendar established in 163 BC, Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC) also set the year count of his reign back to the beginning.|$|E
5|$|With Bertuzzi {{entering}} {{the final year}} of his contract, the Canucks began negotiating a contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. Despite Bertuzzi's agent, Pat Morris, declaring that they would cease negotiations once the season began, Bertuzzi signed a four-year, $27.8 million deal with the Canucks on October 23, 2003. The contract took effect immediately, erasing the last year on his previous contract, and included a $3 million signing bonus ($2.5 million paid in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> and $500,000 in the second). The deal paid him $4.3 million <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> $6.633 million the second year and $6.933 for the third and fourth.|$|E

5|$|Apple {{unveiled}} the PowerBook100 on October 21, 1991, at the Comdex computer expo in Las Vegas, {{with two other}} models, the PowerBook 140 and PowerBook 170. The advertisement and the product were both successful. Apple projected US sales of more than 200,000 PowerBooks in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> with peak demand {{in the first three}} months of release. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply problems, and the proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1billion in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> after launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share of portable computer shipments. The PowerBook100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992. At the end of the financial year, Apple announced its highest figures yet, $7.1billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8% to 8.5%, the highest it had been in four years.|$|E

5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> {{of life was}} 130% to 173%, slightly faster than {{the growth rate of}} alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E
