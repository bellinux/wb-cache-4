40|$|Nano-particle {{thin films}} of <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> were {{deposited}} on SiO 2 substrates by using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering with various substrate temperatures, sputtering powers and oxygen partial pressures. The <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> thin films were then investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). XPS data suggested that the deposited <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> thin films are almost made up of half of SnO 2 and half of SnO. The oxygen partial pressure nearly {{does not affect the}} chemical stoichiometry of the thin films in our deposition conditions. SEM results showed that the <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> thin films were formed by nano-particles with size of about 60 nm. Sputtering power has a strong influence on the particle size of the thin films.

5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, <b>tin</b> <b>oxide,</b> or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Indium has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection. Indium <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> and indium phosphide harm the pulmonary and immune systems, predominantly through ionic indium, though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of indium introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. Indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; {{they tend to be}} stored temporarily in the muscles, skin, and bones before being excreted, and the biological half-life of indium is about two weeks in humans.|$|E

25|$|Tin-opacified glazes {{appear in}} Iraq {{in the eighth}} century AD. Originally {{containing}} 1–2% PbO; by the eleventh century high-lead glazes had developed, typically containing 20–40% PbO and 5–12% alkali. These were used throughout Europe and the Near East, especially in Iznik ware, {{and continue to be}} used today. Glazes with even-higher lead content occur in Spanish and Italian maiolica, with up to 55% PbO and as low as 3% alkali. Adding lead to the melt allows the formation of <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> more readily than in an alkali glaze: <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> precipitates into crystals in the glaze as it cools, creating its opacity.|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} {{alternate}} transparent conductors is well documented. Current semiconductor based transparent conductors such as doped indium oxides, zinc <b>oxides,</b> or <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> suffer from practical downfalls including rigorous processing requirements, prohibitive cost, sensitivity toward acidic or basic media, and a brittle consistency. However, graphene does not suffer from these downfalls.|$|R
5000|$|For glaze {{use only}} one tin compound, <b>tin</b> (IV) <b>oxide</b> <b>Tin</b> dioxide (SnO2), and also called stannic acid, is commercially exploited. Opacity is {{produced}} in glazes {{by the addition of}} some substance to scatter and reflect some of the incident light.|$|R
500|$|John Dalton {{studied and}} {{expanded}} upon this previous work and developed {{the law of}} multiple proportions: if two elements can be combined to form {{a number of possible}} compounds, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers. [...] For example: Proust had studied <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> and found that their masses were either 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen or 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (these were tin(II) <b>oxide</b> and <b>tin</b> dioxide respectively). Dalton noted from these percentages that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen; 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. Dalton found that an atomic theory of matter could elegantly explain this common pattern in chemistry. In the case of Proust's <b>tin</b> <b>oxides,</b> one <b>tin</b> atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|R
25|$|Indium's uses can {{be divided}} into four categories: the largest part (70%) of the {{production}} is used for coatings, usually combined as indium <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> (ITO); a smaller portion (12%) goes into alloys and solders; a similar amount is used in electrical components and in semiconductors; and the final 6% goes to minor applications. Among the items in which indium may be found are platings, bearings, display devices, heat reflectors, phosphors, and nuclear control rods. Indium <b>tin</b> <b>oxide</b> has found a wide range of applications, including glass coatings, solar panels, streetlights, electrophosetic displays (EPDs), electroluminescent displays (ELDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), electrochemic displays (ECs), field emission displays (FEDs), sodium lamps, windshield glass and cathode ray tubes, making it the single most important indium compound.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Transparent conducting oxide (TCOs) thin films, including non-stoichiometric <b>tin</b> doped indium <b>oxide</b> (ITO) and aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO), have found considerable applications in various displays, solar cells, and electrochromic devices, due to their unique combination of high electrical conductivity and optical transparency. TCO thin films are normally fabricated by sputtering, thermal vapour deposition and sol-gel method. Among them, sol-gel processing, which was employed in this project, is no doubt the simplest and cheapest processing method, The main objectives of this project were to produce indium <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> (ITO) and zinc aluminium oxides (AZO) nanoparticles with controlled particle size and morphology and to fabricate TCO thin films with high optical transmittance and electrical conductivity. In this research, hydrothermal method was used to synthesise ITO and AZO nanoparticles. <b>Tin</b> <b>oxides,</b> zinc oxides, ITO and AZO particles with the particle size ranging from 10 nm to several micrometers and different morphologies were synthesised through controlling the starting salts, alkaline solvents and hydrothermal treatment conditions. ITO and AZO thin films were fabricated via sol-gel technique through dip coating method. The effects of the starting salts, alkaline solvents, surfactant additives and coating and calcination conditions on the formation of thin films were investigated.

500|$|In 1924, indium {{was found}} to have a valued {{property}} of stabilizing non-ferrous metals, and that became the first significant use for the element.

[...] New uses were found in fusible alloys, solders, and electronics. In the 1950s, tiny beads of indium were used for the emitters and collectors of PNP alloy-junction transistors.
