According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played instruments they had stolen. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to concerts, and when these were over <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> up on stage and steal as much musical equipment as they could carry.|$|E

5|$|Many of the Green Mountain Boys {{objected to}} Arnold's wish to command, insisting that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> home rather than serve under {{anyone other than}} Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no {{documented}} evidence exists concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold's contention, while others suggest he was merely given the right to march next to Allen.|$|E
5|$|The game {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the most successful era in Seattle franchise history, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on to win AL West division championships again in 1997 and 2001, and an AL Wild Card berth in 2000. However, they failed to reach the World Series each time and remain one of two MLB franchises to never reach the Fall Classic, along with the Washington Nationals.|$|E
5|$|Thơ's {{civilian}} government {{was plagued by}} infighting. According to Thơ's assistant, Nguyễn Ngọc Huy, the presence of Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Tôn Thất Đính in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralysed the governance process. Đính and Đôn were subordinate to Thơ in the {{civilian government}}, but {{as members of the}} MRC they were superior to him. Whenever Thơ gave an order in the civilian hierarchy with which the generals disagreed, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to the MRC and countermand it.|$|E

On the left, Gordon's company 2nd Battalion, with the 11th and 12th Battalion's survivors, charged five times and captured the summit of Baby 700, but were driven back by Turkish counter-attacks; Gordon was among the casualties. For the second time Maclagen requested reinforcements for Baby 700, but the only reserves Bridges had available were two 2nd Battalion companies and the 4th Battalion. It was now 10:45 and the advance companies of the 1st New Zealand Brigade were disembarking, so it was decided <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|Kono's {{inspiration}} for the first Clock Tower title came from watching Italian film director Dario Argento's horror films, especially his film Phenomena (1985). The game began as an experimental project with a low budget and small staff. It sold well enough to prompt a direct sequel which competed with Capcom's Resident Evil (1996). The third game in the series was not directed by Kono and was a critical failure. Human Entertainment {{went out of business}} in 2000, after which Sunsoft purchased the Clock Tower intellectual property. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on to develop Clock Tower 3 with Capcom which was a commercial failure.|$|E

Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in Martinique in 1724.|$|E

5|$|The captain {{asked for}} the descent {{checklist}} at 20:24:24. The fasten seat belt sign was switched on and the flight attendant started the process of preparing the cabin for landing. At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} checklist, informed the first officer that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger.

5|$|A fee {{equivalent}} to €280,000 {{was enough to}} take him to the Ukrainian Premier League and Dynamo Kiev in January 1998, where he signed a four-year deal. Here he scored six goals in 71 league games over the two-and-a-half seasons he spent there. The Ukrainian club had been under the ownership of Hryhoriy Surkis and the late Valeriy Lobanovskyi had just been installed as manager; <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on to win eight consecutive league titles. Kaladze also appeared in both legs of the semi-final of the 1998–99 Champions League against Bayern Munich, which Dynamo Kyiv lost 4–3 on aggregate. En route to the semi-finals, they beat teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Arsenal. He won eight league titles in a row during his time at both Dinamo Tbilisi and Dynamo Kyiv.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the Holmenkollen Line {{was opened}} to Besserud. One of the line's main revenue sources was {{transporting}} city-dwellers to the recreational area of Nordmarka where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> skiing. An alternative activity was tobogganing {{down the hill}} back to Majorstuen. The operator Holmenkolbanen immediately started plans to extend the line. There were two proposals: {{a continuation of the}} line past Holmenkollen and a branch from Midtstuen up Korketrekkeren to Frogneseteren. However, the latter required the use of a rack railway, as it would give a 1:8 gradient. The former route was selected and the line was extended to Frogneseteren in 1916. Holmenkolbanen started renting out sleds at Frogneseteren, which could be returned at most stations. To save the return ticket, many chose to continue the tobogganing ride to Majorstuen.|$|E

5|$|Unhappy in {{the estate}} agency, Kingsbury took up the {{position}} of caretaker on a farm at Boundary Bend, {{not far from where}} Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on an adventure – walking through western Victoria and New South Wales. In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman. They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury. As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the Australian Imperial Force on 29 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|DeHavilland's career spanned 53 years, from 1935 to 1988. During that time, she {{appeared}} in 49 feature films, {{and was one of}} the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood. She began her career playing demure ingénues opposite popular male stars, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made her breakout film Captain Blood in 1935. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on to make eight more feature films together, and became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. Her range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Following her film debut in the Shakespeare adaptation A Midsummer Night's Dream, deHavilland achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedies, such as The Great Garrick and Hard to Get, and Western adventure films, such as Dodge City and Santa Fe Trail. In her later career, she was most successful in drama films, such as In This Our Life and Light in the Piazza, and psychological dramas playing non-glamorous characters in films such as The Dark Mirror, The Snake Pit, and Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} Valparaiso on 23 July. After several {{walks in the}} area, Darwin {{obtained}} horses and on 14 August set off up the volcanic Andes with a companion. Three days later they spent an enjoyable day on {{the summit of the}} Bell mountain. Darwin visited a copper mine and spent five days scrambling in the mountains before going on to Santiago, Chile. On his way back, he fell ill on 20 September and had to spend a month in bed. It is possible that he contracted Chagas' disease here, leading to his health problems after his return to England, but this diagnosis of his symptoms is disputed. He learnt that the Admiralty had reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the Adventure. FitzRoy had taken it badly, selling the ship and announcing <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> back to recheck his survey, then had resigned his command doubting his sanity, but was persuaded by his officers to withdraw his resignation and proceed. The artist Conrad Martens left the ship and took passage to Australia.|$|E

5|$|They started {{recording}} Astraea in June at James Spence's {{house in}} Nottingham. They {{were forced into}} this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as {{there was a lot}} of production and pre-production involved. Sanderson would come to the practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more “produced” than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try things they had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, stagnant water remained and they had to move the guitar cab to his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos.|$|E
