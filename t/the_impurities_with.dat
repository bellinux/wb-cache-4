They were then packed on a bullock cart and taken up to the house. They were next passed through the mangle, which succeeded admirably, the juice flowing out in streams into the tub placed below to receive it. When all the canes had been passed through the mangle, the screws were {{tightened}} to increase the pressure, and they were again passed through; by which time, although the juice was not so thoroughly extracted {{as it would have}} been by a more powerful machine, the quantity that remained was not important. As the tub was filled the contents were taken to the great copper, under which a fire was then lighted. The crushing of the canes was continued until the copper was nearly full, when Mr. Hardy ordered the cutting of the canes to be discontinued for the day. The fire under the copper was fed with the crushed canes, which burned very freely. Mr. Hardy now added a small quantity of lime and some sheep's blood, which last ingredient caused many exclamations of horror from Mrs. Hardy and the young ones. The blood, however, Mr. Hardy informed them, was necessary to clarify the sugar, as the albumen contained in the blood would rise to the surface, bringing <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> <b>with</b> it. The fire was continued until the thermometer showed that the syrup was within a few degrees of boiling, and the surface was covered with a thick, dark-colored scum. The fire was then removed, and the liquor allowed to cool, the family now going about other work, as so large a quantity of liquor would not be really cold until the next day.|$|E
5000|$|Iron is {{commonly}} found in the Earth's crust {{in the form of}} an ore, usually an iron oxide, such as magnetite or hematite. Iron is extracted from iron ore by removing the oxygen through its combination with a preferred chemical partner such as carbon that is then lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This process, known as smelting, was first applied to metals with lower melting points, such as tin, which melts at about 250 C, and copper, which melts at about 1100 C, and the combination, bronze, which has a melting point lower than 1083 C. In comparison, cast iron melts at about 1375 C.

The polarizability follows closely the behavior of the binding energy so for smaller binding energies the polarizability is large showing a more delocalized electron cloud.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The current reduced {{availability}} {{and the high}} cost of electronic grade silicon for solar cell application pushed the photovoltaic industry towards faster development and alternative innovations: on one side the processing of thinner wafers and on the other, the production of low cost material with lower purity, the so called “solar grade silicon ” (SoG-Si, e. g. [1]). The use of this material in solar cell production depends strongly on the possible improvement of the electronic quality during the solar cell process and requires a better knowledge of the interaction of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> <b>with</b> extended defects. In addition to a higher concentration of metallic and other impurities, some SoG-Si production techniques will contain a high amount of dopants [2] and thus require compensation to obtain Si wafers with a resistivity compatible for solar cell production. This article presents a study of three p-type mc-Si ingots with different levels of compensation – one of them featuring an overcompensated part and thus, allowing the study of compensated n-type mc-Si material. The electrical characteristics of the material are determined by measuring the minority charge carrier lifetime and the Hall-mobility at room-temperature.

Disruption mitigation has been performed on MAST, to study the effect on heat loads and disruption time scales in a spherical tokamak. Massive gas injection is performed using a disruption mitigation valve capable of injecting between 0. 6 and 1. 5 × 1022 particles, corresponding to 10 – 150 times the plasma inventory. Noble gases are used for mitigation studies, specifically helium, argon, neon and a mixture of 10 % argon and helium. The effect of mitigation is studied using a comparison between mitigated discharges and reference unmitigated disruptions. Mitigation has been seen to be effective at reducing peak divertor power loads, with reductions of up to 60 % in the divertor power load being observed.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} here, that luminescence experiments provide {{a direct and}} reliable tool to investigate the properties of donor bands in very high magnetic fields. The change of their binding energy, wavefunction and overlap is much more directly reflected in these experiments than in transport measurements, as e. g. Hall effect experiments, where only the magnetic freezeout of charge carriers can be observed. Undoped p-type GaSb exhibits acceptors with ionization energies between 13 and 100 meV. Low temperature luminescence spectra are reported involving transitions to the different acceptors. The excitation intensity dependence and magnetic field dependence up to 100 kG of these spectra were investigated.

ERO modelling for ITER estimates the lifetime of the inner target (erosion of 0. 5 cm) to about 7000 shots with a shot length of 400 s. The maximum allowed tritium retention due to eroded carbon not redeposited locally on the target plates would be already reached after 380 - 440 shots. Strike point sweeping might increase the target life time by a factor of about 4 while tritium retention seems not to be influenced. Apart from transient events especially material mixing effects of the elements foreseen for ITER as PFC (carbon, beryllium and tungsten) introduce uncertainties in the prediction. The injection of hydrocarbon ((CH 4) -C- 13) through spherical shaped limiters (one made of tungsten, one of graphite) in TEXTOR reveal that carbon has a reduced deposition efficiency on tungsten compared to graphite.

In the V-Cr-Ti system, the titanium serves as a getter to control the concentration of oxygen and nitrogen in solid solution in the alloy.
