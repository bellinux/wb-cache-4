5|$|Pelé {{arrived in}} Sweden sidelined by {{a knee injury}} but on his return from the <b>treatment</b> <b>room,</b> his colleagues stood {{together}} and insisted upon his selection. His first match was against the USSR in the third match {{of the first round}} of the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where he gave the assist to Vavá's second goal. He was the youngest player of that tournament, and at the time the youngest ever to play in the World Cup. Against France in the semifinal, Brazil was leading 2–1 at halftime, and then Pelé scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.|$|E
5|$|Remote afterloading systems provide {{protection}} from radiation exposure to healthcare professionals by securing the radiation source in a shielded safe. Once the applicators are correctly positioned in the patient, they {{are connected to}} an ‘afterloader’ machine (containing the radioactive sources) {{through a series of}} connecting guide tubes. The treatment plan is sent to the afterloader, which then controls the delivery of the sources along the guide tubes into the pre-specified positions within the applicator. This process is only engaged once staff are removed from the <b>treatment</b> <b>room.</b> The sources remain in place for a pre-specified length of time, again following the treatment plan, following which they are returned along the tubes to the afterloader.|$|E

5|$|Sukartono (abbreviated as Tono) is a doctor, Tini's {{husband and}} Yah's lover. He treats poor {{patients}} {{for free and}} thus is well-liked by the general populace. He is also {{a big fan of}} traditional kroncong music: in medical school he preferred to sing rather than study, and as a doctor he keeps a radio in his <b>treatment</b> <b>room.</b> Suffering from loneliness in his loveless marriage with the modern-minded Tini, he becomes involved with Yah, whom he perceives as being more willing to play the traditional wife. However, when Tini and Yah leave him, he is left alone.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{the rear of}} the Grosvenor Road End was cordoned off as cracks had {{appeared}} in the rear wall, and this section of the ground was later segregated and allocated to away supporters. Extensive improvements were made over the mid 1980s, including new turnstiles, refurbished dressing rooms, new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's <b>treatment</b> <b>room</b> being readied, hospitality boxes being built to the Main Stand and crash barriers being strengthened. The David Longhurst Stand was constructed over the summer of 1991, and was named after the York player who collapsed and died from heart failure in a match a year earlier. It provided covered accommodation for supporters in what was previously the Shipton Street End, and was officially opened for a friendly match against Leeds United. In June 1995, new floodlights were installed, which were twice as powerful as the original floodlights.|$|E
5|$|At both Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors matches, away {{supporters}} are {{situated in the}} North Stand behind the goal. Occasionally, during rugby games which attract low away support, the 5,418 capacity North Stand is closed altogether, and the away fans who attend are put into an alternative stand. The eastern stand, known as 'The Boston Stand', and the western 'Springfield Stand' run across the longer sides of the pitch. The Boston Stand is the largest, capable of seating up to 8,238 fans and holding an electronic scoreboard. The Springfield Stand contains the stadium's vital facilities; four dressing rooms, benches, a doping control room and a <b>treatment</b> <b>room</b> for the players, as well as four executive boxes, ten radio commentary points and a designated TV studio, in addition to holding 6,100 fans. The North Stand and South Stand have a seating capacity of 5,418 and 5,412 respectively. The stadium also has facilities and access for up to 278 fans with disabilities, with facilities for partially sighted fans. The seats are a mixture of both resident teams' main colours — cherry red and blue. The stadium is fully compliant with safety guidelines for a sports ground.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s cracks had {{appeared}} in the wall built {{at the back of the}} Grosvenor Road End. The rear of the terracing was cordoned off, and the capacity of the ground reduced to under 13,500. The Grosvenor Road End was segregated and allocated to away supporters, and fencing was erected for the first time before the FA Cup match against Liverpool in February 1985. All the fencing had been dismantled by the early 2000s. During the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, problems had arisen in handling big crowds, due to the ground having only two of four sides available for entry and exit, and the home supporters funnelling through the car park to the Shipton Street End. Extensive improvements were made in the summer of 1985 for approximately £100,000, and eight new turnstiles were installed at the Shipton Street End. Further, the dressing rooms were refurbished to incorporate new baths and showers, and a new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's <b>treatment</b> <b>room</b> were readied. Hospitality boxes were built into the Main Stand during 1986–87, and video equipment was installed inside the ground. Crash barriers were strengthened, meaning ground safety requirements were met. These improvements meant that shortly before the Taylor Report was published, the ground's capacity was 14,109, including 3,059 seats. However, by September 1989, the capacity had been increased to 14,628.|$|E

25|$|With {{the growing}} {{recognition}} of the utility of CT imaging in using guidance strategies to match treatment volume position and treatment field placement, several systems have been designed that place an actual conventional 2-D CT machine in the <b>treatment</b> <b>room</b> alongside the treatment linear accelerator. The advantage is that the conventional CT provides accurate measure of tissue attenuation, which is important for dose calculation (e.g. CT on rails).|$|E
25|$|In general, at {{the time}} of 'planning' (whether a {{clinical}} mark up or a full simulation) the intended area for treatment is outlined by the radiation oncologist. Once the area of treatment was determined, marks were placed on the skin. The purpose of the ink marks was to align and position the patient daily for treatment to improve reproducibility of field placement. By aligning the markings with the radiation field (or its representation) in the radiation therapy <b>treatment</b> <b>room,</b> the correct placement of the treatment field could be identified.|$|E

25|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} a local {{treatment}} {{that is designed to}} treat the defined tumour and spare the surrounding normal tissue from receiving doses above specified dose tolerances. There are many factors that may contribute to differences between the planned dose distribution and the delivered dose distribution. One such factor is uncertainty in patient position on the treatment unit. IGRT is a component of the radiation therapy process that incorporates imaging coordinates from the treatment plan to be delivered in order to ensure the patient is properly aligned in the <b>treatment</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
25|$|With Kirk's help, Noel {{reaches the}} facility's control room through a {{ventilation}} duct and interrupts Kirk's next neutralizer session by shutting off {{power to the}} entire complex. Freed from the neutralizer, Kirk attacks Adams, leaving him unconscious in the <b>treatment</b> <b>room.</b> A guard discovers Noel's sabotage, restoring power before turning his attention to her. She tricks him by feigning unconsciousness before surprising him with a well aimed kick, propelling him into the circuitry and electrocuting him. She turns off the power.

25|$|Image-guided {{radiation}} therapy (IGRT) {{is the process}} of frequent two and three-dimensional imaging, during a course of radiation treatment, used to direct {{radiation therapy}} utilizing the imaging coordinates of the actual radiation treatment plan. The patient is localized in the <b>treatment</b> <b>room</b> in the same position as planned from the reference imaging dataset. An example of IGRT would include localization of a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) dataset with the planning computed tomography (CT) dataset from planning. IGRT would also include matching planar kilovoltage (kV) radiographs or megavoltage (MV) images with digital reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from the planning CT. These two methods comprise the bulk of IGRT strategies currently employed circa 2013.|$|E

25|$|Medical grade linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the <b>treatment</b> <b>room</b> itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E
25|$|When war was {{declared}} in September 1939, the government banned public gatherings until safety implications could be assessed. Most football grounds reopened soon afterwards, even those in built-up or strategically significant areas, but Birmingham's Chief Constable ordered the continued closure of St Andrew's {{because of its}} proximity to likely air-raid targets such as the BSA munitions factories. The matter was raised in Parliament, but the Home Secretary felt unable to intervene in {{what was perceived as}} a local issue, and the Chief Constable did not bow to public pressure until March 1940. The ground suffered 20 direct hits from Luftwaffe bombing, bringing down the roof of the Kop terrace, and fires damaged the railway end stand, scoreboard and clock, and destroyed the main stand, including board room, gymnasium, <b>treatment</b> <b>room</b> and offices. The club's current name of Birmingham City F.C. was adopted in 1943. When nationally organised football resumed in 1945, Harry Storer was appointed manager. In his first season the club won the Football League South title, ahead of Aston Villa on goal average– the 1945–46 Football League North and South included teams from the pre-war First and Second Divisions, and were an interim step between the highly regionalised and mixed-ability wartime leagues and the Football League itself, which restarted in 1946–47– and reached the semi-final of the first post-war FA Cup. Two years later they won their third Second Division title, conceding only 24 goals in the 42-game season.|$|E
