5|$|<b>The</b> <b>affair</b> {{substantially}} weakened popular American {{support of}} France.

The president knew that America {{would be unable to}} win a conflict, as France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe. Adams therefore pursued a strategy whereby American ships harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests. This was the undeclared naval war between the U.S. and France – the Quasi-War which broke out in 1798.|$|E
