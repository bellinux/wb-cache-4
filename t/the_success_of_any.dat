5|$|<b>The</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{pathogen}} {{depends on}} its ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E

After {{the defeat of the}} regular military, or when one is lacking, continued opposition to an invasion often comes from civilian or paramilitary resistance movements. Complete pacification of an occupied country can be difficult, and usually impossible, but popular support is vital to <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> invasion.|$|E

25|$|Running {{dynamical}} {{models of}} the Solar System with different initial conditions for the simulated length {{of the history of}} the Solar System will produce the various populations of objects within the Solar System. As the initial conditions of the model are allowed to vary, each population will be more or less numerous, and will have particular orbital properties. Proving a model of the evolution of the early Solar System is difficult, since the evolution cannot be directly observed. However, <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> dynamical model can be judged by comparing the population predictions from the simulations to astronomical observations of these populations. At the present time, computer {{models of the}} Solar System that are begun with the initial conditions of the Nice scenario best match many aspects of the observed Solar System.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Tho was also {{becoming}} unpopular {{in the military}} establishment. One {{of the goals of}} the coup plots at the time was to remove Tho and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from {{the fact that they were}} the primary target—at the time, the MRC was moving towards removing Tho, and Minh was the only senior general to still have confidence in him. A more important reason for the incumbent generals' lack of preparedness for Khánh's coup was their misunderstanding of the US stance. After what had happened to Diệm, as well as other failed coup attempts, they regarded American backing as the decisive factor for the survival of any government and <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> coup. As a result, repeated assurances from Lodge and Johnson's laudatory comments in private and public convinced them that they remained on firm ground. Johnson had told Lodge to assure Minh in a meeting on January 1, 1964, that he had [...] "the complete support of the United States as the leader of Vietnam [...] ".|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, the {{government}} abandoned {{its attempts to}} ban Scientology, after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity. The report by the BfV cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful. First, the BfV report stated {{there was no evidence}} that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization; there were German churches and missions, a German board, German bylaws, and no evidence that the organization was [...] "totally remote-controlled" [...] from the United States. A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one. The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology's aggressive opposition to the constitution. Here, the report found that Scientology's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany's free and democratic basic order. [...] "Neither its bylaws nor any other utterances" [...] supported the [...] "conclusion that the organization had criminal aims". The BfV also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence, but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning.|$|E

2500|$|Most historians portray Lee's {{experience}} with the inverted V and his illness as a great lost opportunity. However, some have shed doubt on this interpretation.

Venable, who gave a speech about it in Richmond in 1873, which included the [...] "we must strike them a blow" [...] quotation. Grimsley notes that [...] "no surviving contemporaneous correspondence alludes to such an operation, and the troop movements made on the night of May 23 and on May 24 were limited and defensive in nature." [...] Furthermore, he describes the inverted V as a poor position from which to launch an offensive, lacking depth. Col. Vincent J.

2500|$|Another {{important}} factor in <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> BPR effort is performing a thorough business needs analysis. [...] Too often, BPR teams jump directly into the technology without first assessing the current processes of the organization and determining what exactly needs reengineering. In this analysis phase, a series of sessions should be held with process owners and stakeholders, regarding the need and strategy for BPR. [...] These sessions build a consensus as to {{the vision of the}} ideal business process. They help identify essential goals for BPR within each department and then collectively define objectives for how the project will affect each work group or department on individual basis and the business organization as a whole. The idea of these sessions is to conceptualize the ideal business process for the organization and build a business process model. [...] Those items that seem unnecessary or unrealistic may be eliminated or modified later on in the diagnosing stage of the BPR project. It is important to acknowledge and evaluate all ideas in order to make all participants feel that they are a part of this important and crucial process. [...] Results of these meetings will help formulate the basic plan for the project.|$|E
