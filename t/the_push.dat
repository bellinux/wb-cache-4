5|$|Army Group B was {{commanded}} by Fedor von Bock. It was allocated 26 infantry and three Panzer divisions {{for the invasion}} of the Netherlands and Belgium. Of the three Panzer Divisions, the 3rd and 4th were to operate in Belgium under the command of the 6th Army's XVI Corps. The 9th Panzer Division was attached to the 18th Army which, after the Battle of the Netherlands, would support <b>the</b> <b>push</b> into Belgium alongside the 18th Army and cover its northern flank.|$|E
50|$|The plasma would cool to 14,000 °C as it traversed the 25 m {{distance}} to <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate and then reheat to 67,000 °C as, at about 300 microseconds, it hits <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate and is recompressed. This temperature emits ultraviolet light, which is poorly transmitted through most plasmas. This helps keep <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate cool. <b>The</b> cigar shaped distribution profile and low {{density of the}} plasma reduces the instantaneous shock to <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate.|$|R
50|$|The bombs {{had to be}} {{launched}} behind <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate with enough velocity to explode 20-30 meters beyond it every 1.1 seconds. Numerous proposals were investigated, from multiple guns poking {{over the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate to rocket propelled bombs launched from roller coaster tracks, however the final reference design used a simple gas gun to shoot the devices {{through a hole in the}} center of <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate.|$|R
50|$|Another {{potential}} problem with <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate {{is that of}} spalling—shards of metal—potentially flying {{off the top of}} the plate. The shockwave from the impacting plasma on the bottom of the plate passes through the plate and reaches the top surface. At that point spalling may occur damaging <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate. For that reason alternative substances, plywood and fiberglass, were investigated for the surface layer of <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> plate and thought to be acceptable.|$|R
5|$|In early April 1941, Hitler {{had agreed}} to the {{creation}} of the SS-Freiwilligenstandarte Nordwest (SS Volunteer Regiment Northwest), with an authorised strength of 2,500 men recruited from Flanders and the Netherlands. This formation capitalised on <b>the</b> <b>push</b> for an autonomous Flemish-Dutch region within the Reich. Significant proponents of such a union were Anton Mussert of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands and Staf De Clercq of the Flemish National League. In this, Berger was exploiting Mussert and De Clerq, because he was actually working towards Hitler's idea of incorporating Flanders and Wallonia into the Reich as two Gaue, not a unified autonomous entity.|$|E
5|$|On 12December 1979, {{in light}} of a {{build-up}} of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and PershingII theatre nuclear weapons in Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the Dual Track policy. Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations {{in the event of}} war. This action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether <b>the</b> <b>push</b> for deployment could be sustained.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{formulate}} {{and address}} the problem of planning a pushing manipulation by a mobile robot which tries to rearrange several movable objects in its work space. We present an algorithm which, when given a set of goal configurations, plans a <b>pushing</b> path to <b>the</b> “cheapest ” goal or announces that no such path exists. Our method provides detailed manipulation plans, including any intermediate motion of <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> while changing contact configuration with <b>the</b> <b>pushed</b> movables. Given a pushing problem, a pushing path is found using a two-phase procedure: a context sensitive back propagation of a cost function which maps the configuration space, and a gradient descent phase which builds <b>the</b> <b>pushing</b> path. Both phases are based on a dynamic neighborhood filter which constrains each step to consider only admissible neighboring configurations. This admissibility mechanism provides a primary tool for expressing the special characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>pushing</b> manipulation. It also allows for a full integration of any geometrical constraints imposed by <b>the</b> <b>pushing</b> robot, <b>the</b> <b>pushed</b> movables and <b>the</b> environment. We prove optimality and completeness of our algorithm and give some experimental results in different scenarios. Index Terms—Manipulation planning, pushing planning. I...|$|R

Instead Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/0-0/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn. One point in favour of 7...Qf6 is that after 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White from castling short and is well placed if White castles long.|$|E
5|$|A {{historic}} preservation movement in Omaha {{has led to}} a number of historic structures and districts being designated Omaha Landmarks or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of <b>the</b> <b>push</b> toward preservation came after Omaha gained the notorious designation of having, in 1989, demolished the largest-ever National Register historic district in the United States, a record that still stands as of 2013. The Jobbers Canyon Historic District, along the Missouri River, was felled for a new headquarters campus for ConAgra Foods, a company which threatened to relocate if Omaha did not allow them to raze the city's historic district. The Jobber's Canyon warehouses had before then been allowed to deteriorate and were the scene of several fires set by the homeless population that had come to live in the abandoned buildings. At the time, there were no plans in place for revitalizing the buildings.|$|E

30|$|The {{detection}} of seedling transportation mainly includes the {{detection of}} the position of the sampling seedling, {{the detection of}} the conveying status, the acquisition of the position and the state information, and the provision of indication signals for the control of the conveying action. The pressure change during <b>the</b> seedling <b>pushing</b> is detected by the pressure sensor to detect whether <b>the</b> <b>pushing</b> action is executing normally. It is used to prevent the positioning error caused by the conveyer belt and damage of the potted seedlings during <b>the</b> <b>pushing.</b> <b>The</b> potted vegetable seedling was put into the conveying cup after <b>the</b> <b>pushing</b> operation was completed, and the transportation state information was obtained by the CCD camera set above the cup conveying mechanism.|$|R

5|$|Colbourn {{established}} the university's honors program, {{and started the}} university's first satellite branch campus. In addition, Colbourn was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park, located adjacent to the UCF campus and founded in 1978. The park serves as {{a major focus of}} simulation for space and defense-related research. The park was one part of Colbourn's plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university's first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy, and Colbourn led <b>the</b> <b>push</b> to found both the Institute for Simulation and Training and the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989. However, Colbourn's most notable accomplishments as president were supporting the young university's athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school's football program in 1979, which began an era of growth for the university. In April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, Rockefeller renewed <b>the</b> <b>push</b> for a parkway {{along the}} New Jersey Palisades, and teamed with {{ultimate}} PIP planner, Robert Moses, {{to establish and}} design the parkway. The plan originally {{was to have the}} PIP stretch from the Garden State Parkway, along the Hudson River, to the George Washington Bridge, and then north along its present-day route ending at the Bear Mountain Bridge. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current PIP in New York on April1, 1947. Construction on the New Jersey portion began about one year later. Construction was delayed twice due to material shortages, but that did not stop the PIP from being opened in stages during the 1940s and 1950s. The route was completed in New Jersey in 1957, and on August28, 1958, the final piece of the PIP was completed between exits5 and9 in southern Rockland County.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{an article}} in The Day stated that <b>the</b> <b>push</b> to restore the house came from {{conservation}} specialist Doug Royalty, who was researching prefabricated homes from the 1920s and 1930s.

The Day referred to the house's historic value as a new discovery, but its history {{was included in the}} Winslow Ames House National Register of Historic Places nomination in 1995. The Winslow Ames House nomination detailed the House's origin, but criticized its gable roof modification. After its re-discovery, Connecticut College began collecting grants to restore the house under the direction of Royalty and Van Slyck. Royalty stated that the House and Winslow Ames House are very rare, with only a few surviving examples in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In {{his role}} as Controller of Atomic Energy, Morgan was present for Operation Hurricane, the first British atomic weapons tests at the Montebello Islands in October 1952. His {{position}} was gradually reduced to a figurehead, with his authority largely supplanted by the Atomic Energy Board, which was chaired by Lord Cherwell, and was abolished in 1954 {{with the creation of}} the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Morgan then became Controller of Nuclear Weapons. Nonetheless, he was still an important figure in <b>the</b> <b>push</b> for higher-yield weapons. He pressed for the testing of the Green Bamboo boosted fission weapon during Operation Mosaic. This resulted in Mosaic becoming a two-test series, although Green Bamboo could not be made available in time. A Green Bamboo assembly was subsequently taken to Christmas Island for Operation Grapple, but was deleted from the test series to save money. Morgan was also instrumental in putting the case {{for the development of the}} H-bomb on operational grounds.|$|E

In contrast, the NK 13th Division had bypassed Hamch'ang on the west and, save for minor skirmishes with ROK troops and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, it had not been engaged and consequently had suffered relatively few casualties.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, for mainly {{patriotic}} reasons, the Australian Natives' Association helped establish the Federation League, a society {{dedicated to the}} creation of a federal nation. Following a series of addresses by the future Prime Minister, Edmund Barton to large crowds, some 15 League branches were established in the towns along the southern border. One of these towns, Corowa, was the location for the first conference of the Australian Federation League in 1893. At this conference, Dr John Quick, a delegate from Bendigo, proposed a resolution calling for the colonial legislatures to pass an act providing for the election of representatives to a convention to develop a federal constitution. This has been seen as the turning point in <b>the</b> <b>push</b> for Federation. The momentum generated from this point lead to a series of conventions and elections and finally, the inauguration of a federal constitution on 1 January 1901.|$|E
