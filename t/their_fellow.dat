5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> royals as a matter of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin.

Thomas selected Damon Stoudamire, a point guard out of Arizona, around whom the franchise would seek to construct its near future. Yet, the selection of Stoudamire was met with boos from fans at the 1995 NBA draft at SkyDome in Toronto, many of whom wanted Ed O'Bannon of UCLA, an NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player.|$|E

A loss to Wake Forest in the 2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl—the team's second bowl appearance all-time—gave the Huskies a final 2007 record of 9–4. In the Big East preseason media poll, UConn was picked to finish 6th overall in the conference.|$|E

Stephen and his brother managed to reward <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> conspirators.

5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough {{and that they would}} have to make terms.|$|E
5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Japanese {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. Perched on a hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose deluge of gunshots causing the Japanese to scramble for cover. The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy {{but they could not}} advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way. About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated to the city to join <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E

After he comes to, he realizes this alternate reality was Lee showing him a life without the Millennium Group. However, he is left unsure whether his role within the Group is protecting his family from evil, or exposing them to it. Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E

After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to.

Selena and Pérez decided to date discretely to avoid a negative reaction from Abraham.

Selena and Pérez decided to elope in Corpus Christi, Texas on April 2, 1992; a move that Selena chose believing that her father would have never approved of them. In the days following their marriage, Abraham approached Pérez after news of their elopement spread on local news and radio stations, apologized, accepted their relationship, and accepted Pérez back into the band as its guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Goodman and Edson {{ultimately}} {{devised a}} program where troops chose, {{at the summer}} camp's conclusion, those boys from among their number who best exemplified the ideals of Scouting. Those elected were acknowledged as having displayed, {{in the eyes of}} <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> Scouts, a spirit of unselfish service and brotherhood. Edson helped Goodman research the traditions and language of the Lenni Lenape—also known as the Delaware—who previously had inhabited Treasure Island. The brotherhood of Scout honor campers with its American Indian overtones was a success and was repeated again the following summer at Treasure Island. Those Scouts honored at Treasure Island in 1915 and 1916 would become members of what is now Unami Lodge.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{was elected}} to the see of Lincoln about 14 April 1209, after a papal command to the cathedral chapter to elect a new bishop, as Lincoln had again been without a bishop since 1206. During the summer of 1209, Hugh, along with his brother, was one of the councilors of King John urging the king to settle with Pope Innocent III before the pope excommunicated the king. However, {{negotiations}} with papal representatives got nowhere, and the king was excommunicated on 8 November 1209. Hugh and his brother Jocelin had continued to support King John until this, two years after many of <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> bishops had deserted the king, but by late in the year, Hugh left the king's service and went into exile.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Barcelona {{were drawn}} against <b>their</b> <b>fellow</b> leading-scorers in the competition, Bayern Munich, who had beaten Barcelona's group stage opposition, Sporting CP, 12–1 on {{aggregate}} {{in the previous}} round. However, despite Bayern's impressive scoring record, goals from Messi and Eto'o gave Barcelona a 2–0 lead within the first 12minutes. Messi and Henry also scored to seal a 4–0 home victory before half-time. The lack of an away goal meant Bayern Munich would have to win by five clear goals {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals. After a goalless first half, they took the lead through Franck Ribéry in the 47thminute, but it was not enough for Bayern as Keita equalised in the 73rdminute to clinch a 5–1 aggregate win for the Spanish side.|$|E

The stomach pains had become unbearable and Schnaufer was taken to a hospital with appendicitis. He stayed in the hospital for about two weeks before, together with Rumpelhardt, he went on vacation back home. Carelessly lifting his suitcase, he burst his stitches, resulting in further hospitalisation. He flew his first mission after these events on 19 March 1944.|$|E
