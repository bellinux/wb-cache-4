40|$|A {{designated}} verifier signature (DVS) {{scheme is}} a special type of digital signature scheme without the property of non-repudiation. Such schemes only allow the designated verifier to validate the signer’s signature. Meanwhile, the designated verifier {{is not able to}} convince any third party of the signature’s actual signer, since he can also generate a computationally indistinguishable one compared <b>to</b> the <b>received</b> <b>signature.</b> A strong designated verifier signature (SDVS) scheme further prohibits anyone except for the intended verifier from validating the signature as it requires the designated verifier’s private key to finish the verification process. In this paper, we propose an efficient short SDVS scheme with low computation costs. Unlike many SDVS schemes primarily implemented on pairingbased cryptosystems, we focus on the discrete logarithms (DL) based system. Compared with those DL based SDVS schemes, ours provides better functionalities and efficiency and hence benefits the practical applications. In addition, the security requirement of unforgeability against existential forgery on adaptive chosen-message attacks (EU-CMA) is proved in the random oracle model...|$|R

30|$|In this article, three {{bit rate}} {{adjustment}} methods {{will be considered}} with the appropriate energy allocation schemes. These methods will be applicable to both SIC and non-SIC-based receivers, when using discrete and non-discrete rates. Initially, an iterative WF algorithm will be proposed with a sub-channel removal for the selection of signature sequences. The system values {{will be used to}} maximize the throughput for non-discrete rate allocation by accounting for the channel SINRs corresponding <b>to</b> the <b>received</b> <b>signature</b> sequences instead of using only the channel gains to find the water levels. When using discrete rates the signature sequence selection scheme will be further extended to optimize the total rate for the HSDPA system downlink. The system values will be used to select an optimum number of spreading signature sequences from a given total number of sequences without any prior energy allocation. The chosen optimum number of sequences will be loaded with discrete rates using both the equal SINR allocation methods proposed in this article and the equal energy allocation schemes as specified in the current HSDPA standard. The equal SINR and energy loading schemes will use the mean and the minimum of system values for a given total energy to transmit the symbols at the required discrete rates. These three methods will be named as the iterative WF-based continuous bit loading method, the mean system value-based discrete bit loading method, and the minimum system value-based discrete bit loading method.|$|R

40|$|In digital {{signature}} schemes a user {{is allowed to}} sign a document by using a public key infrastructure (PKI). For signing a document, the sender encrypts the hash of the document by using his private key. Then, the veriﬁer uses the signer’s public key <b>to</b> decrypt the <b>received</b> <b>signature</b> and <b>to</b> check if it matches the document hash. Generally a {{digital signature}} scheme demands only one signer to sign a message so that {{the validity of the}} signature can be checked later. But under some situations a group of signers is required to sign a message cooperatively, so that a single verifier or a group of verifiers can check the validity of the given signature. This scheme is known as a multisignature. A multisignature scheme is one of the tools in which plural entities can sign a document more efficiently than they realize it by trivially constructing single signatures. In general, in a multisignature scheme, the total signature size and the verification cost are smaller than those in the trivially constructed scheme. Thus, plural signers can collectively and efficiently sign an identical message. There are different base primitives describing the type of numerical problems upon which the underlying security scheme is based on. In this thesis, {{some of the most important}} DLP based multisignature schemes are presented. A categorization between these different existing schemes has been shown, along with their pros and cons...|$|R

A new low-complexity detector is presented that improves on some recently proposed methods without explicit estimation of the ISI channel. The key innovation is a reduced-rank detector architecture combined with an efficient subspace tracker that yields direct accurate estimation of the desired user’s <b>received</b> <b>signature.</b> Several representative simulation examples of detector output signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) for fading channels are provided in support of our claims of improved efficacy of the method.
