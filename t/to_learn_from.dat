5|$|At {{about ten}} years of age, Narayan learned the basics of dhrupad, the oldest genre of Hindustani {{classical}} music, by studying and imitating the practice of sarangi player Uday Lal of Udaipur, a student of dhrupad singers Allabande and Zakiruddin Dagar. After Uday Lal died of old age, Narayan met travelling singer Madhav Prasad, originally of Lucknow, who had performed at the court of Maihar. With Prasad, Narayan enacted the ganda bandhan, a traditional ceremony of acceptance between a teacher and his pupil, in which Narayan swore obedience in exchange for being maintained by Prasad. He served Prasad and was taught in khyal, the predominate genre of Hindustani classical music, but returned to Udaipur after four years to teach music school. Prasad later visited Narayan and convinced him to resign his position and dedicate his time to improvement as a musician, {{although the idea of}} giving up a steady life was not well received by Narayan's family. He stayed with Prasad and travelled to several Indian states until Prasad fell ill and advised him <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> singer Abdul Wahid Khan in Lahore. Following Prasad's death in Lucknow, Narayan enacted the ganda bandhan with another teacher who gave him lessons, but soon left for Lahore and never performed the ritual again.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of A Bug's Life, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)—long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation—Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz. By this time, Pixar's project was well-known within the animation community. Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.|$|E

He informed the British missionaries based {{there that he}} wished <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> them. These missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing Christianity to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission. While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories from the Bible, and was taught {{to read and write}} in English. He also performed chores for the mission, among them washing the dishes and weeding the gardens. Several months after arriving, Kenyatta was taken ill with tuberculosis. Kenyatta was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo. Many of their generation were increasingly resenting the patronising way in which most of the British missionaries treated them.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E

In the meantime, Suddhodana attempted to foil Koṇḍañña's prediction because he wanted his son to succeed him in ruling and expanding the kingdom. Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters, pampering him with all the material luxury and sense pleasures that he could find. However, Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow {{him out of the}} palace to meet his subjects. Suddhodana agreed, but attempted to present a sanitised image of human existence by ordering beggars, old people and sick people to be kept from the streets. Despite this, Siddhartha saw the four sights which prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world.|$|E

40|$|We {{compare the}} ways in which people react to good ideas that come from {{internal}} rivals (e. g., colleagues) versus external rivals (e. g., employees at a different organization). We hypothesize that because internal rivals and external rivals evoke threats with contrasting implications for the self, people adopt different strategic orientations to the rival’s knowledge. Study 1 found that people expected to lose more personal status if they <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> the accomplishments of an in-group rival as compared to an out-group rival, and they were therefore more likely to allocate resources <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> the out-group rival. Study 2 revealed that the more threat internal rivals provoke, the fewer resources people allocated <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> them, whereas the more threat external rivals provoke, the more resources people allocated <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> them. Finally, Study 3 found that self-affirmation attenuated these patterns and enabled the self to feel secure enough to value the knowledge of an internal rival. The threats and opportunities for affirmation facing the self determine how people construe using knowledge from a rival. These self-implicating processes shape the dynamics of internal and external rivalry and determine a person’s willingness to pursue knowledge under threat...|$|R
5|$|Other {{institutions}} were also formed {{with the purpose}} of providing feedback and monitoring activities on the ground. To enhance the protection of its crown colony further from internal skirmishes and attacks, in August 1915, the legislative council passed the Reserve Force and Civil Guard Ordinance. This was the first Act passed in a British colony which imposed compulsory military service on all male subjects between the ages 15 to 55 who were not in the armed forces, volunteers, or police. Additionally, a Reserve force in the Volunteer Corps was created for fit men over the age 40.

5|$|Through such episodes as the {{deception}} of Derby at Gloucester, Edward acquired {{a reputation as}} untrustworthy. During the summer campaign, though, he began <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> his mistakes, and acted {{in a way that}} gained the respect and admiration of his contemporaries. The war did not end with Montfort's death, and Edward participated in the continued campaigning. At Christmas, he came to terms with the younger Simon de Montfort and his associates at the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire, and in March he led a successful assault on the Cinque Ports. A contingent of rebels held out in the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle and did not surrender until the drafting of the conciliatory Dictum of Kenilworth. In April it seemed as if Gloucester would take up the cause of the reform movement, and civil war would resume, but after a renegotiation of the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth, the parties came to an agreement. Edward, however, was little involved in the settlement negotiations following the wars; at this point his main focus was on planning his forthcoming crusade.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} review current {{approaches}} <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> {{health and safety}} incidents in the workplace. The aim of the paper is to identify the diversity of approaches and analyse {{them in terms of}} learning aspects. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review was conducted searching for terms incident/accident/near misses/disaster/crisis modified with learning/training and safety. Shortlisted articles were analysed by questioning who is learning, what kind of learning process is undertaken, what type of knowledge is employed and the type of problem that these incidents addressed. Current approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> incidents were critically analysed and gaps identified. Findings – Very few papers addressed all the envisaged aspects when developing their <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> incidents approaches. With support from literature, it was concluded that all the four perspectives, namely participants of learning (participation and inclusion), learning process (single loop, double learning), type of incident and its relation <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> (Cynefin complexity framework) and types of knowledge (conceptual, procedural, dispositional and locative) are important when deciding on an appropriate <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> incidents approach. Research limitations/implications – The literature review focused on journal articles and identified keywords, which might have narrowed the scope. Further research is needed in identifying ways <b>to</b> embed the <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> incidents aspects in the organisation. Practical implications – The framework developed could be useful by safety planners, safety managers, human resource managers and researchers in the area of organisational learning and safety. Originality/value – The paper concludes by outlining key questions and proposing a framework that could be useful in systematically analysing and identifying effective approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> incidents...|$|R

5|$|On 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. Army Group B, under Generaloberst Fedor von Bock, {{attacked}} into Belgium, {{while the}} three Panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung {{around to the}} south and drove for the Channel. The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the River Dyle within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May. They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the Scheldt River on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold. During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves. On 19 May, Gort met with French General Gaston Billotte, commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities. Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble. After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at Arras to cut through the German spearhead, the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, Frederick {{commanded}} 27 battalions of infantry (17,000 men) and 43 squadrons of cavalry (5,000 horse), plus 72 companies of artillery, {{for a total}} of 22,000 men. He also had several of the siege guns from Leipzig, which arrived late in the morning. He spent the morning watching the French from the Goldacker manor rooftop in Rossbach. The initial stages of Allied movement convinced him that the Allies had started retreating southward towards their magazines; he sent out patrols <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> the peasants what could be gleaned. They reported back that Soubise had taken the Weissenfels road; it led not only to that village, but also toward Freiburg, where Soubise could find supplies, or to Merseburg, where they would cut the Prussians off from the Saale. At about noon Frederick went to dinner, leaving the young captain Friedrich Wilhelm von Gaudi to observe French movements. Two hours later, his watch captain reported the French approaching. Although Gaudi's excited report at first appeared to confirm a French-Austrian retreat, Frederick observed that Allied columns, which from time to time became visible in the undulations of the ground, appeared to turn eastwards from Zeuchfeld. When Frederick saw for himself that hostile cavalry and infantry were already approaching Pettstädt, he realized his enemy's intentions: to attack him in the flank and rear, and break his communications line, if not crush him completely. They now offered him the battle for which he had maneuvered in vain, and he accepted it without hesitation.|$|E
