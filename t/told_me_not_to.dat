The song [...] "Mama <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Come", written {{four years earlier}} for Eric Burdon, was delivered in stripped-down form, and helped Newman establish himself as a composer of note. Newman appeared in solo engagements beginning in June 1970 on an NBC TV special hosted by Liza Minnelli. [...] "Mama <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Come" [...] yielded a #1 chart topper for Three Dog Night in July 1970. Newman's career was in high gear.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, it was {{revealed}} that she had paid for the medical tests for a man called Julian Jean DeBaptiste in Saint Lucia in 2009. [...] "I had surgery on 1 July 2009... it cost a fortune and Amy paid for the whole thing. I tried to thank her but she just hugged me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say anything. Her generosity gave me my life back." ...|$|E
500|$|The author {{explained}} to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for {{including in the}} book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: [...] "The reason that line made the book is because he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say anything. And I will never, ever respond to anybody—man, woman, vegetable, or mineral—who tells me to keep my mouth shut. Alter what I've been through, I don't think so, pal." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} what a broiling day Friday was?" [...] interrupted Margaret. [...] "Miss Winter and Norman both <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I ought <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let them go, and I began to think so when they came home. Mary was the colour of a peony!" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{recording}} {{opens with}} Harrison's acoustic guitar and an electric piano riff that creates [...] "a sense of foreboding", according to Inglis, who likens the intro to Three Dog Night's 1970 hit single [...] "Mama <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Come". Along with Harrison, the musicians {{on the basic}} track were Jim Keltner (drums), Nicky Hopkins (electric piano) and Klaus Voormann (bass). Part of Harrison's guide vocal from the basic track was retained for the official release.|$|E
500|$|A {{sequel to}} her first {{greatest}} hits album, The Immaculate Collection (1990), GHV2 included fifteen singles released during Madonna's second decade in the recording industry, starting from [...] "Erotica" [...] (1992) to [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] (2001). Unlike the former release, GHV2 did not feature any new material. In an interview with BBC's Jo Whiley, Madonna spoke about {{the selection of the}} tracks, [...] "I only wanted songs that I could listen to five times in a row." [...] She also added that [...] "If you listen to the record, you can really see my evolution as a singer, songwriter, and, more important, a human being." [...] Madonna felt that because it was a [...] "greatest hits", it should only contain previously released hit songs. Several of her popular singles of that period were excluded from the album. Despite being a worldwide number-one hit in 2000, [...] "American Pie" [...] was not included because Madonna had regretted putting it on her eighth studio album, Music (2000). [...] "It was something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing, but it didn't belong on the album so now it's being punished... My gut <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> , but I did it and then I regretted it so just for that reason it didn't deserve a place on GHV2." [...] she said. Other notable exclusions were [...] "This Used to Be My Playground", [...] "Rain", [...] "I'll Remember" [...] and [...] "You'll See"—all of which had been included on her ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995).|$|E
500|$|The {{cover of}} the first {{printing}} of The Great Gatsby {{is among the most}} celebrated pieces of art in American literature. It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald {{was in the midst of}} writing it. The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had [...] "written it into" [...] the novel. Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg (depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop) which Fitzgerald described as [...] "blue and gigantic– their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose." [...] Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the [...] "girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs." [...] Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but [...] "Scott <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story. He said he had liked the jacket and now he didn't like it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ida von Miaskowski remarked in her memoir, {{published}} 7 {{years after}} his death:In the eighties, when Nietzsche's later writings containing some of the oft-quoted sharp words against women appeared, my husband sometimes <b>told</b> <b>me</b> jokingly <b>not</b> <b>to</b> tell people of my friendly relations with Nietzsche, since this was not very flattering for me. It was just a joke. My husband, like myself, always kept friendly memories of Nietzsche ... his behavior precisely towards women was so sensitive, so natural and comradely, that even today in old age I cannot regard Nietzsche as a despiser of women.|$|R
60|$|My little Marquis, as he <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> could <b>not</b> bear <b>to</b> {{see them}} thus alone, so he ran forward, and knelt on her other side, holding her hand. And {{he heard a}} horrid little laugh, {{something}} about a new edition and an imitation; but the Queen, who had forgotten all about her, asked who she was and what her husband was.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{your room}} to be sure,' said Jonas; 'but I'm almost {{inclined}} {{to ask you what}} YOU are doing here? My room {{is on the other side}} of that door.

[...] "'He said Muslims shouldn't be in the U.S. military, because obviously Muslims shouldn't kill Muslims. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> join the Army.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Pickett {{recorded}} several {{tracks in}} 1972 for a planned new album on Atlantic, {{but after the}} single [...] "Funk Factory" [...] reached #11 R and #58 pop in June 1972, he left Atlantic for RCA Records. His final Atlantic single, a cover of Randy Newman's [...] "Mama <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Come," [...] was culled from Pickett's 1971 album Don't Knock My Love.|$|E
5000|$|Perfect Shirl did not race at age two, then {{failed to}} win in her first three races in 2010 at age three. She finally won {{for the first time}} in a maiden special weight race on the turf at Woodbine on June 13. She then {{followed}} up with a win on the Woodbine's Polytrack artificial dirt surface in an allowance race on July 11. On July 28, she was shipped to Saratoga racetrack for the Grade II Lake George Stakes on the turf, where she went off at odds of 9-1. Racing in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, Perfect Shirl started making up ground around the far turn and then moved to the lead as they neared the finish line. [...] "When I asked her, she responded very well," [...] said jockey John Velazquez. [...] "The only thing the assistant <b>told</b> <b>me</b> was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be on the lead; very simple instructions!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{had just}} filled out an {{application}} for {{a job at the}} post office. I needed a real job to get on with my life, but the post office wasn't hiring for another month. So my father <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to go bowl another month. I didn't cash the first week, and the second week in Las Vegas I wasn't bowling well. I called my dad and told him I was going to quit and come home. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> quit for the wrong reason, to go ahead and bowl the last two weeks. I was in Vegas so I decided to play black jack. I was dealt a black jack and I beat the dealer, who had 20. I thought 'this is fate,' so I went to the next PBA event and won, and the rest is history. I can thank one hand of black jack for my career." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Ammons went to Baton Rouge to {{introduce}} his bill for reservoir funding, he met immediate hesitation or outright opposition from state {{officials in the}} new Jimmie Davis administration who complained {{about the lack of}} funds available for expensive new projects. At the close of a strategy session, Ammons said, [...] "Gentlemen, I called the meeting for you to tell me what could be done to build Toledo Bend, but all you have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> is what <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do.” The head of the state public works department, Lorris M. Wimberly, a former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, [...] "shook his finger" [...] at Ammons and warned the new legislator that he did [...] "not have the slightest idea {{what it would take to}} get this type of legislation passed. If you do introduce such a bill, you are going to hang yourself on the highest tree around this Capitol, and furthermore you are going to be the laughingstock of the whole Legislature." [...] Wimberly was soon replaced by Claude Kirkpatrick, formerly a legislator from Jennings, who worked on the administrative end to bring the project to reality.|$|R
2500|$|He {{returned}} to the show in the 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor, in 2013, playing a character who calls himself The Curator. On 20 November 2013, Baker revealed that he would appear, stating [...] "I am in the special. I'm not supposed to tell you that, but I tell you that very willingly and specifically; the BBC <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> tell anybody but I'm telling you straightaway." [...] The episode saw Baker {{in the role of}} a mysterious curator in the National Gallery.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1998, [...] "The Bartender and the Thief" [...] (the {{first single}} from the album Performance and Cocktails) was released, {{eventually}} reaching number {{three on the}} UK charts. [...] "Just Looking" [...] was released next and reached number four in March 1999. In that same month, the album was released, entering at number one and going platinum within three weeks. Later that year, the band played in front of 50,000 people at Morfa Stadium in Swansea. The concert was filmed and released on DVD the following year. They also collaborated with Tom Jones on a cover of the Randy Newman song [...] "Mama <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Not</b> <b>To</b> Come", for the Tom Jones album Reload.|$|E
2500|$|Combining with singer Tom Jones, Farnham {{undertook}} the Together in Concert series during 2004 {{with ten}} shows in Perth, Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne.

6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Longueville," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "where in {{the world}} did you drop from, and {{how long did it take}} you to cross the Atlantic? Three days, eh? It could n't have taken you many more, for it was only the other day that Gordon <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you were <b>not</b> <b>to</b> sail till the 20th. You changed your mind, eh? I did n't know you ever changed your mind. Gordon never changes his. That 's not a reason, eh, because you are not a bit like Gordon. Well, I never thought you were, except that you are a man. Now what are you {{laughing}} at? What should you like me call you? You are a man, I suppose; you are not a god. That 's what you would like me to call you, I have no doubt. I must keep that for Gordon? I shall certainly keep it a good while. I know a good deal more about gentlemen than I did when I last saw you, and I assure you I don't think they are a bit god-like. I suppose that 's why you always drop down from the sky--you think it 's more divine. I remember that 's the way you arrived at Baden when we were there together; the first thing we knew, you were standing in the midst of us. Do you remember that evening when you presented yourself? You came up and touched Gordon on the shoulder, and he gave a little jump. He will give another little jump when he sees you to-day. He gives a great many little jumps; I keep him skipping about! I remember perfectly the way we were sitting that evening at Baden, and the way you looked at me when you came up. I saw you before Gordon--I see a good many things before Gordon. What did you look at me that way for? I always meant to ask you. I was dying to know." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{programme}} is {{a defining}} {{example of the}} British television serial. The episodes were merely numbered, all sharing a gradually-revealed common plot. To a degree, the six episodes may {{be divided into two}} stories of three episodes each. The apparent conclusion of the first story at episode 3 seemed so complete to BBC executives that they were, according to Davies, [...] "a bit shocked". This, in part, stemmed from {{the fact that he had}} not sold the programme to them as two three-part stories—"in case they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do it!". Nevertheless, by the conclusion of episode 6, it becomes apparent to the viewer that all six episodes tell a conjoined story of Marcie's opposition to Mr. Eldritch, though split across two seemingly unrelated tales. Both incidents occur at least in the same school year, but perhaps over an even shorter period of time.|$|E
2500|$|On July 4, 1970, Kasem, {{along with}} Don Bustany, Tom Rounds, and Ron Jacobs, {{launched}} the weekly radio program American Top 40 (AT40). [...] At the time, top 40 radio {{was on the}} decline as DJs preferred to play album-oriented progressive rock. [...] Loosely based on the TV program Your Hit Parade, the show counted down from #40 on the pop charts to #1—the first #1 was Three Dog Night's [...] "Mama <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> (<b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Come)"—based on the Billboard Hot 100 each week. [...] The show, however, was {{not just about the}} countdown. [...] Kasem mixed in biographical information about the artists, flashback, and [...] "long-distance dedication" [...] segments where he read letters written by listeners to dedicate songs of their choice to far away loved ones. [...] He often included trivia facts about songs he played and artists whose work he showcased. Frequently, he mentioned a trivia fact about an unnamed singer before a commercial break, then provided the name of the singer after returning from the break. [...] Kasem ended the program with his signature sign-off, [...] "Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his third season in the ABA, the dissatisfied Strom contacted NBA Commissioner Walter Kennedy to discuss returning to the NBA. [...] Encouraged {{with the support of}} Wayne Embry and Pat Williams, general managers of the Milwaukee Bucks and Chicago Bulls respectively, Strom met with Kennedy during the 1972 ABA Playoffs. Kennedy informed Strom that John Nucatola, supervisor of officials, manages the staffing of officials, but Strom received a vote of confidence {{to come back to the}} NBA in the form of a handshake from the commissioner. Strom met with Nucatola and discussed salary and benefits. Strom was told by Nucatola that he would be getting a $25,000 salary and was guaranteed a job in the NBA for the start of the 1972–73 NBA season through a handshake agreement although no contract was signed. Strom was told a contract would be available to sign upon the completion of his twelve-game ABA playoff officiating schedule. Strom called the league to ask why he was not scheduled to officiate after his guaranteed schedule of games and was told by Norm Drucker, then supervisor of officials for the ABA, [...] "You know the reason. They know you're going back [...] and they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> assign you any more playoff games." ...|$|E
