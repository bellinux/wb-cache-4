5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. <b>The</b> <b>Mediator</b> finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. <b>The</b> <b>Mediator</b> is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and <b>the</b> <b>Mediator,</b> the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E

Derrick Green was chosen to replace Cavalera, and with the new vocalist the band released Against in 1998. Nation was released in 2001, the band's last studio album with Roadrunner Records. Sepultura signed to German label SPV and released Roorback. Dante XXI was released in 2006 as a concept album inspired by the literary classic Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri.

After review of the literature, we came to the realization that knowledge of this area was very limited and thus presents an unexplored topic.

If so, I want to know how they handle these challenges and how they reinforce their impartial role. The study will hopefully shed light on any difficulties with being an "impartial mediator" and present strategies on how to address such difficulties. Data and methods The study was conducted using a qualitative method. Interviews were held with five mediators based on a semi-structured interview guide. The interviews were each about an hour long and everything was recorded. Selected parts of the material was then transcribed and coded. Main results <b>The</b> <b>mediators</b> all interpret their impartial role in their own personal ways. Several of them also equate or are confused by the concepts of being "impartial" and "neutral". <b>The</b> <b>mediators</b> say that there are a lot of difficulties and paradoxes that the impartial role presents. <b>The</b> <b>mediators</b> also considered self-awareness to be a most decisive factor when it comes to being impartial.
