5|$|Behind the Devil's Back (2015) {{was noted}} for a heavier use of {{electronics}} <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> said by some critics to be reminiscent of Westaway and Haigh's side project Gunship. The Edge and Rocksins.com reviewers remarked {{in particular the}} album's 1980s-style synths, while NE:MM writer David Smith drew comparisons to American alternative rock supergroup Angels & Airwaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} this album is mostly {{original}} and {{a combination of}} progressive rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, but with a harder edge and with the guitar parts in more evidence <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> This was due both {{to the growth of}} guitarist Ritchie Blackmore as a songwriter and to the conflicts within the band over the fusion of classical music and rock proposed by keyboard player Jon Lord and amply implemented in the band's previous releases.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, {{although}} the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
5|$|These include {{same-sex}} relationships, single-parent households, adopting individuals, {{and extended}} family systems living together. The nuclear family is also choosing to have fewer children <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The percentage of married-couple households with children under 18 {{has declined to}} 23.5% of all households in 2000 from 25.6% in 1990, and from 45% in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the {{campaign}} finance laws, there was no perceptible decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more {{of their own money}} <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Switzerland, Constantine I and {{his family}} found {{themselves}} isolated and without an income. The Greek government under Venizelos did not pay pensions to former rulers and prohibited any contact between the exiles and King Alexander. Already in fragile health, the former king became gradually more depressed. The Russian Revolution and the National Schism deprived Olga of her immovable property and {{she was forced to}} live a much less lavish lifestyle <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> She did, however, enjoy spending more time with her sons and grandchildren, from whom she had been long separated by the war.|$|E
5|$|Multi-platform {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume the practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles. The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools. Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of the development budget <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> are easily transferable between multiple platforms.|$|E
5|$|When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2), {{improvements}} to the game were included. This edition's scenario was expanded by the original staff after {{the removal of the}} adult content consisting of sex scenes. Yūto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 times longer than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television sharper <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than on a computer screen. The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing eyestrain.|$|E

50|$|In economics, {{adaptive}} expectations is a hypothesized {{process by which}} people form their expectations {{about what will happen}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future based on what has happened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> For example, if inflation has been higher <b>than</b> expected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> people would revise expectations for the future.|$|R
5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries across {{most of its}} range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat {{and low levels of}} dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|There is a migratory {{divide in}} Europe at {{longitude}} 10–11°E. Birds {{to the west}} of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa, whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa. Cross-breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed the urge to migrate is genetically controlled, the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time. Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria, {{on opposite sides of the}} migratory divide, demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s.

5|$|The {{tendency}} to create larger caliber cannon during the World Wars has been reversed {{in more recent}} years. The United States Army, for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their aging pieces. As it could be towed, the M198 was selected to be the successor to the World War II-era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979. Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the M777 Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much, and can be transported by helicopter—as opposed to the M198, which requires a C-5 or C-17 to airlift. Although land-based artillery such as the M198 are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and, in some cases, having been replaced by cruise missiles. However, the 's planned armament includes the Advanced Gun System (AGS), a pair of 155mm guns, which fire the Long Range Land-Attack Projectile. The warhead, which weighs , has a circular error of probability of , and will be mounted on a rocket, to increase the effective range to —a longer range {{than that of the}} Paris Gun. The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will be capable of firing 10 rounds per minute, per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets will give Zumwalt-class destroyers the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional M-198 howitzers. The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in United States Navy ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun are far less expensive than a cruise missile, and are therefore a better alternative to many combat situations.|$|E
