Despite Thi's {{good relations with the}} Buddhists in his area, most notably Thích Trí Quang, Kỳ reportedly had the monks' support for Thi's removal.

25|$|Encosternum delegorguei are {{collected}} {{just before dawn}} when they are least active and are easier to catch. They are caught carefully, {{taking care not to}} kill them. The chemicals released by the bugs can often stain the hands of collectors orange if they collect them barehanded. The bugs which died during collection are carefully separated from live bugs. This is because the chemicals stored in <b>the</b> <b>stink</b> glands are unpalatable - being extremely bitter. As dead bugs can not release the remaining chemicals in their bodies, they are deemed unsuitable for consumption and discarded. The remaining live bugs are placed in a bucket {{with a small amount of}} warm water. This is then carefully agitated so as to make them release all their defense chemicals in alarm. This is repeated several more times until their stink glands are drained.|$|E

Haku returned to the WWF in the Rumble, and he and Rikishi formed a tag team and feuded with The Brothers of Destruction, The Dudley Boyz then The Hardy Boyz. The team split while Rikishi was sidelined with an eardrum injury in March. He returned on the May 4 SmackDown and fought The Undertaker to no-contest. On the next Raw, he turned face and gave <b>the</b> <b>Stink</b> Face to Stephanie McMahon after she distracted him, and cost him a non-title match with Austin.

25|$|Initially, the Mexican {{authorities}} {{reported the}} discovery of 37 bodies {{early in the morning}} on 13 May 2012 in the town of San Juan, 75 miles (125km) southwest of the border city of Roma, Texas. However, upon more detailed examination at the scene, the official figures reached 49 dead. The bodies were discovered on the Mexican Federal Highway 40 at about 4am, forcing the Mexican police and the federal troops to close the highway. The victims were all headless and dismembered; none of the victims were shot dead. According to the testimonies of several civilians from San Juan, late at night before the bodies were discovered, a foul-odor could be perceived from a distance, but none of them imagined that <b>the</b> <b>stink</b> actually came from dismembered bodies. When the forensic experts began to pick up the bodies, they had to use facemasks because the intensity of the odor was intolerable. The Mexican authorities in the area had to cover their mouths and noses for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|By early May, the Bouamlong fortifications had {{deteriorated}} into a military slum. The ADC militia, being home guards, had their families there with them. In total, there were almost 6,000 Hmong crowded onto the valley floor. The area {{was littered with}} castoff parachutes and other military debris. <b>The</b> <b>stink</b> of rotting Vietnamese corpses permeated the atmosphere. An improvised Royal Lao Army (RLA) battalion of 435 soldiers, composed of units plucked from other battalions, was airlifted into this. Four days later, 116 of its troopers quit and were evacuated. On 24 May, Bataillon Commando 205 (BC 205) was choppered in to replace the makeshift battalion; on the return trips, the departing troops were flown out. On 29 May, the newcomers moved out toward Phou Then. Air strikes by Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) T-28s and U.S. Air Force A-1s cleared their way in daylight. At night, AC-47 gunships provided defensive fire. A freshly arrived 105mm howitzer lent additional fire support. By 18 June, the outpost had been retaken, and the drive ended.|$|E
500|$|At {{the height}} of <b>the</b> <b>stink,</b> between 200 and 250 tons of lime were being used near the mouths of the sewers that {{discharged}} into the Thames, and men were employed spreading lime onto the Thames foreshore at low tide; the cost was £1,500 per week. On 15 June Disraeli tabled the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Bill, a proposed amendment to the 1855 Act; in the opening debate he called the Thames [...] "a Stygian pool, reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors". The Bill put the responsibility to clear up the Thames on the MBW, and stated that [...] "as far as may be possible" [...] the sewerage outlets should not be {{within the boundaries of}} London; it also allowed the Board to borrow £3million, which was to be repaid from a three-penny levy on all London households for the next forty years. The terms favoured Bazalgette's original 1856 plan, and overcame Hall's objection to it. The leading article in The Times observed that [...] "Parliament was all but compelled to legislate upon the great London nuisance by the force of sheer stench". The bill was debated in late July and was passed into law on 2 August.|$|E

500|$|There are {{two major}} {{instances}} of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro {{is dealing with the}} [...] "stink spirit." [...] <b>The</b> <b>stink</b> spirit was actually a river spirit, but it was so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go. The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of human's need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but don't think about how it can affect other living things.|$|E
500|$|Kỳ claimed Thi {{was leaving}} the country to receive medical {{treatment}} for his nasal passages, {{as well as a}} general health examination. An official announcement said that the junta [...] "had considered and accepted General Thi's application for a vacation".

[...] With the health story exposed as a sham, Kỳ gave a series of reasons for dismissing Thi, accusing him of being too left-wing, ruling I Corps like a warlord, having a mistress who was suspected of being a communist, and being too conspiratorial. Kỳ knew that Thi supported negotiations with the communists as a means of ending the war, and had a history of consistently removing officials and military figures who promoted such a policy, but did not publicly mention this as a reason. Thi's dismissal provoked the Buddhist Uprising, led by the [...] "Struggle Movement". Thi was immensely popular in the Buddhist stronghold of Huế, a city of approximately 120,000, and civil unrest erupted throughout the region. When he returned to the former imperial capital five days after being relieved of his command, around 20,000 supporters mobbed him, shouting and trying to touch him. This was part of a gamble by Kỳ to allow Thi back to his home city in an attempt to placate the dismayed locals, but it did not work. A general strike incapacited 90% of Da Nang, the second biggest city in South Vietnam and the main port in central Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|By mid-1858 the {{problems}} with the Thames had been building for several years. In his [...] novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was [...] "a deadly sewer... in the place of a fine, fresh river". In a letter to a friend, Dickens [...] said: [...] "I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that [...] "in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep" [...] on the Thames foreshore, and that [...] "the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged —rising to [...] in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained {{on the banks of the}} river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event [...] "The Great Stink"; the leading article in the City Press observed that [...] "Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales <b>the</b> <b>stink</b> can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a [...] "pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination", while a second wrote that [...] "the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream".
