5|$|Large {{coordination}} {{numbers are}} the rule for thorium {{due to its}} large size. <b>Thorium</b> <b>nitrate</b> pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the borohydride (first prepared in the Manhattan Project) has coordination number 14.

5|$|Many other {{inorganic}} thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, {{such as the}} perchlorates, sulfates, sulfites, nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, vanadates, molybdates, and chromates, {{and their}} hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, {{but most of them}} have not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, <b>thorium</b> <b>nitrate</b> is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds. Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as oxalate, citrate, and EDTA, are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes.|$|E
25|$|Thorium hydroxide, Th(OH)4, can be {{prepared}} by adding a hydroxide of ammonium or an alkali metal to a thorium salt solution, where it appears as a gelatinous precipitate that will dissolve in dilute acids, among other substances. It can also {{be prepared}} by electrolysis of <b>thorium</b> <b>nitrates.</b> It is stable from 260–450°C; at 470°C and above it continuously decomposes to become thoria. It easily absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the hydrated carbonate ThOCO3·xH2O and, under high-pressure conditions in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, Th(CO3)2·0.5H2O or Th(OH)2CO3·2H2O. Several mixed oxides are known, such as BaThO3, which has the perovskite structure.|$|R
40|$|Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) is {{emerging}} as a powerful technique in the extraction of metal ions. In the present study, the extraction of nitrates of uranium and thorium in their solid form was carried out using supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO 2) modified with various organophos-phorous compounds such as dialkylalkyl phosphonates, trialkyl phosphates and trialkyl phos-phine oxides {{in the presence of}} co-solvents such as methanol, dichlormethane and n-hexane. The influence of ligand and co-solvent on the extraction of the metal nitrates was studied in detail. These studies have established that co-solvent {{plays an important role in}} the extraction as well as fractionation of uranium and <b>thorium</b> <b>nitrates.</b> Polar co-solvent, methanol provided faster extrac-tion without fractionation whereas the non-polar solvent, e. g. n-hexane provided some fractiona-tion of metal nitrates though the extraction kinetics was slower...|$|R
40|$|A wet {{chemical}} route (oxalate precipitation) {{was chosen to}} prepare gadolinium-doped thoria powders as a feed for pellet fabrication. The oxalate and derived oxide powders were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis coupled to evolved gas analysis, BET, XRD and SEM. Dilatometry was used to study the sintering behavior. From homogeneous solutions containing selected mixtures of gadolinium (III) and <b>thorium</b> (IV) <b>nitrates</b> solid precipitates were obtained, that were composed of two phases. Calcination at 700 °C or 1000 °C was insufficient to obtain single phases {{for any of the}} compositions. Rietveld analysis of calcined powders confirmed the presence of both a Th-rich phase (ThxGd 1 −xO 2 −x/ 2) and a Gd-rich phase ((GdyTh 1 −y) 2 O 3 +(1 −y)) in which limited substitution of the foreign element (Gd or Th, respectively) occurred. A fluorite-type solid solution formed during sintering at 1750 °C.

These are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, but most have not yet been fully characterised, especially on their structural properties. For example, thorium perchlorate is very water-soluble and crystallises from acidic solutions as the tetrahydrate Th(ClO4)4·4H2O, while <b>thorium</b> <b>nitrate</b> forms tetra- and pentahydrates, is soluble in water and alcohols, and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds.|$|E
2500|$|Large {{coordination}} {{numbers are}} the rule: <b>thorium</b> <b>nitrate</b> pentahydrate {{was the first}} known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the [...] anion in the calcium and magnesium salts is 12-coordinate. Due to the large size of the Th4+ cation, thorium salts have a weaker tendency to hydrolyse than that of many multiply charged ions such as Fe3+, but hydrolysis happens more readily at pH above 4, forming various polymers of unknown nature, culminating {{in the formation of}} the gelatinous hydroxide: this behaviour is similar to that of protactinium, which also hydrolyses readily in water to form colloidal precipitates. The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents. As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable.|$|E
2500|$|Thorium abundance. A LFTR breeds thorium into uranium-233 fuel. The Earth's crust {{contains}} {{about three to}} four times as much thorium as U-238 (thorium is about as abundant as lead). It is a byproduct of rare-earth mining, normally discarded as waste. Using LFTRs, there is enough affordable thorium to satisfy the global energy needs {{for hundreds of thousands of}} years. [...] Thorium is more common in the earth’s crust than tin, mercury, or silver. A cubic meter of average crust yields the equivalent of about four sugar cubes of thorium, enough to supply the energy needs of one person for more than ten years if completely fissioned. Lemhi Pass on the Montana-Idaho border is estimated to contain 1,800,000 tons of high-grade thorium ore. Five hundred tons could supply all U.S. energy needs for one year. Due to lack of current demand, the U.S. government has returned about 3,200 metric tons of refined <b>thorium</b> <b>nitrate</b> to the crust, burying it in the Nevada desert.|$|E
40|$|Three {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of radium were evaluated. In two methods, the radium is finally precipitated with barium sulfate as carrier and alpha-counted. In the other method, the radium is recovered in a carrierfree condition for alpha counting. A method for determining radium by removing interfering elements with solvent extraction technniques and precipitating the radium with barium sulfate is described. A method which gives a rapid estimation of radium isotopic composition in samples, based on precipitation with barium sulfate, conversion to the carbonate, and alpha counting, is described. Flowsheets are contained on all five processes discussed. Two processes for {{the determination of}} thorium were evaluated. One method consists essentially of extraction of carrierfree thorium in TTA-benzene, stripped in nitric acid, and direct plating of the nitric acid solution for counting. The second method consists of thorium precipitation on lanthanum hydroxide, then on lanthanum fluoride, dissolution in nitric acid aluminum <b>nitrate,</b> <b>thorium</b> extraction into TTA solution, stripping into nitric acid, and counting. Flowsheets for the processes are given. The effects of pH, sulfate ion concentration, calcium and other contaminants, and temperature on the adsorption of radium from acid leach liquors by barite were studied.
