5|$|As Galván left a Farmacia Guadalajara {{drugstore}} {{near his}} home in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on the evening of 27 February 2014, he was kidnapped along with businessman Miguel Ángel Ortiz. His vehicle was discovered abandoned with open doors in the pharmacy's parking lot by his wife. The following day, a disfigured corpse found in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pickup truck in the town of García, Nuevo León, was taken to the hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. After more than a month of forensic examination, experts officially identified the corpse as that of Galván on 31 March 2014. Post-mortem reports concluded that Galván had been tortured before being killed with a coup de grâce. The exact location of Galván's murder remains unknown, although authorities tend to believe he was most likely killed in Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|Banza {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who he looked to for support. Mandaba {{went along with the}} plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him into <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Mercedes and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake.|$|E

5|$|Dexter's girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) comforts her upset co-worker, Yelina (Monique Curnen), and {{learns that}} Yelina's fiancé, who was immigrating from Cuba {{illegally}} {{with the help}} of a coyote, is missing. Rita asks Dexter to look into the problem using his police connections, and he finds a list of subjects from a past police case. He investigates Jorge Castillo, a salvage yard owner, and after Yelina's fiancé washes up dead on a beach, he discovers that Castillo is murdering the smuggled immigrants who cannot pay for their freedom. Dexter leads Castillo into a trailer in his salvage yard, but as he prepares to kill him, Castillo's wife Valerie (Valerie Dillman) arrives. Dexter realizes that the couple are working together, and decides to kill both Jorge and Valerie in the trailer. After killing them, he dumps their bodies in the ocean and frees their Cuban prisoners, not noticing the person watching him from <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car in the yard.|$|E
5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, 2013, the Ethan Lader-directed {{music video}} premiered via rap mogul Diddy's {{television}} network Revolt. The video shows an overly intoxicated Ty Dolla Sign and B.o.B drugged with paranoia about their various women. Ty is hunted down by his two female lovers when they discover {{that he has}} been cheating on them. They team up to get revenge, chasing him through the streets and attacking him at home. By the end of the night, Ty finds himself bleeding out on the middle of his kitchen floor, from a stab wound courtesy of his two lovers. Meanwhile, B.o.B suffers a similar fate via a drugged drink given to him by a seductive, promiscuous woman. Ty's body is then taken away in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car.|$|E

5|$|With a crew {{of roughly}} 120 persons, filming took a total of 25 days, {{spanning}} from July to August 2012. Car chase scenes were shot at Long Beach and a Westlake Village office building was modeled as the emergency dispatch center. The latter was also used for the scenes in which Welson is locked in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car. Other filming locations include the Burbank Town Center on Magnolia Boulevard in Burbank, California, Santa Clarita, California and the 170 Highway. At one point, Berry was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after falling headfirst on concrete while shooting a fight sequence. A spokesperson for Berry confirmed that she suffered a minor head injury and {{was taken to the}} hospital as a precaution, but she checked out healthy and was released.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{fourteen}} years after Blazkowicz's admission, the Nazis {{order that the}} asylum is to be shut down, killing all the patients and executing Anya's family when they resist. Blazkowicz awakens from his vegetative state as {{he is about to}} be executed, killing the extermination squad and escaping the asylum with Anya. Blazkowicz and Anya drive to her grandparents' farm, where they inform him that the Nazis won the war by forcing the United States to surrender in 1948, and that the members of the ensuing Resistance were captured. Blazkowicz interrogates a captured officer from the asylum (he was hidden in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car), learning that the top members of the Resistance are imprisoned in Berlin before brutally executing him with a chainsaw. Anya's grandparents smuggle her and Blazkowicz through a checkpoint in Stettin before they travel to Berlin. During the train ride, Blazkowicz and Anya enter into a romantic relationship. When they arrive, Anya helps Blazkowicz break into the prison, where he rescues the person he spared {{fourteen years}} prior (Fergus or Wyatt) and finds that the Resistance movement is a revived Kreisau Circle led by Caroline Becker (Bonita Friedericy), who was left paralyzed due to her injuries at Isenstadt.|$|E

25|$|The most typical form {{which the}} Jesse Tree takes {{is to show}} the figure of Jesse, often larger than all the rest, {{reclining}} or sleeping (perhaps by analogy to Adam when his rib was taken) {{at the foot of}} the pictorial space. From his side or his navel springs <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree or vine which ascends, branching to either side.

25|$|No {{definite}} relation {{exists between}} the annual rings of growth {{and the amount of}} sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional {{to the size of the}} crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.|$|E
25|$|Layering is a {{technique}} in which rooting is encouraged from part of a plant, usually a branch, while it is still attached to the parent plant. After rooting, the branch {{is removed from the}} parent and grown as an independent entity. For bonsai, both ground layering and air layering can create a potential bonsai, by transforming a mature branch into <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new tree. The point at which rooting is encouraged can be close to the location of side branches, so the resulting rooted tree can immediately have a thick trunk and low branches, characteristics that complement bonsai aesthetics.|$|E
