40|$|A novel {{parabolic}} trough concentrating solar heating for cut <b>tobacco</b> <b>drying</b> system was established. The opening width effect of V type metal cavity absorber was investigated. A cut <b>tobacco</b> <b>drying</b> mathematical model calculated by fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical solution method {{was used to}} simulate the cut <b>tobacco</b> <b>drying</b> process. And finally the orthogonal test method was used to optimize the parameters of cut <b>tobacco</b> <b>drying</b> process. The result shows that the heating rate, acquisition factor, and collector system efficiency increase with increasing the opening width of the absorber. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data for cut <b>tobacco</b> <b>drying</b> process. The relative errors between simulated and experimental values are less than 8 %, indicating that this mathematical model is accurate for the cut <b>tobacco</b> airflow <b>drying</b> process. The optimum preparation conditions are an inlet airflow velocity of 15 [*]m/s, an initial cut tobacco moisture content of 26 %, and an inlet airflow temperature of 200 °C. The thermal efficiency of the dryer and the final cut tobacco moisture content are 66. 32 % and 14. 15 %, respectively. The result shows that this {{parabolic trough}} concentrating solar heating {{will be one of}} the heat recourse candidates for cut <b>tobacco</b> <b>drying</b> system...|$|R

40|$|To {{suppress}} {{the global environment}} pollutions, we tried to develop a new-type solar <b>drying</b> <b>house</b> by improving a typi-cal agricultural green-house, so that an all weather-type solar <b>drying</b> <b>house</b> was invented ultimately. This house is capa-ble to dry raw wood materials (Ogako) into suitable moisture content (Mc) to make a wood pellet. The all weather-type solar Ogako <b>drying</b> <b>house</b> {{is covered with a}} triple transparent film, and an open/close free-type shield sheet is spread along with house’s inner surface with a small space, which is opened when solar radiation is incident on the house in daytime and closed to prevent heat loss from the house while out of sun shining in night. Inside of the all weather-type solar Ogako <b>drying</b> <b>house,</b> there are four belt-conveyors over which four top radiation panels are hanged, and on which four Ogako agitators are touched, a turn-table, two hoppers, four small fans, and besides, a floor heating is molded in concrete floor. Also on the north wall outside the house, two insulated cylinders (chimney) are stood up vertically to exhaust inside moist air passively. Then, to make clearly the operation performance of the <b>house,</b> the <b>drying</b> tests for the proof examination were conducted nineteen times at first test site in Ashoro where is located east-central part of Hok-kaido, Japan.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{sorts of}} lumber <b>drying</b> <b>house</b> {{covered by a}} {{composite}} surface consisting of three layer transparent films and a carbon-fibre sheet (CF-sheet; looks like a semi-opaque) were invented and developed. One of them was built in Ashoro-cho, {{the eastern part of}} Hokkaido, Japan (the first proving site), and the other was built in Asahikawa-shi, the central part of Hokkaido (the second proving site). The dimension of each <b>drying</b> <b>houses</b> is a frontage of 4. 5 m, depth of 5. 0 m and height of 3. 4 m (the 1 st site) and the same frontage and depth as the former, but height of 3. 8 m (the 2 nd site), respectively. Two types of models of the <b>drying</b> <b>house</b> (East-West type and South-North-type) were desinged. The former is shaped like a half Quonset hut and the latter a just Quonset hut. All of the surfaces including the roof and walls except for a north wall of both models are covered by a composite surface. The composite surface is specially consisted by a triple transparent film from upper side and a CF-sheet to bottom side between which there are a few space of air layers. As a result of mutual effect of a spectral radiation properties of the films and the CF-sheet, a total solar radiation incident upon the <b>drying</b> <b>house</b> with cubic body composed of multi-surface from all the sky globally, can be collected into the house as solar rays volumetrically, converted into infrared radiation and trapped inside the <b>drying</b> <b>house</b> as solar heat passively, without any electric power. Moreover, the moist air inside the house being evaporated when drying green lumber can be naturally exhausted through two insulated cylinders (chimney) outside the <b>drying</b> <b>house</b> according to a principle of the thermo-siphon. From these reasons, “An opaque solar lumber <b>drying</b> <b>house</b> covered by a composite surface consisting of a triple-transparent film and a CF-sheet” could be called “A fully passive solar lumber drying house” in other word. In this paper, after explained the principle of drying mechanism due to solar radiation and heat rays, the experimental procedures and the results at the proving test, on a board-larch lumber at the 1 st proving site and a boxed heart squares-larch lumber for pillar material at the 2 nd proving site, were described and discussed thoroughly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based model for environmental {{variables related to}} the <b>tobacco</b> <b>drying</b> process. A fitting ANN was used to estimate and predict temperature and relative humidity inside the tobacco dryer: the estimation consists of calculating {{the value of these}} variables in different locations of the dryer and the prediction consists of forecasting the value of these variables with different time horizons. The proposed model has been validated with temperature and relative humidity data obtained from a real tobacco dryer using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). On the one hand, an error under 2 % was achieved, obtaining temperature as a function of temperature and relative humidity in other locations in the estimation task. Besides, an error around 1. 5 times lower than the one obtained with an interpolation method was achieved in the prediction task when the temperature inside the tobacco mass was predicted with time horizons over 2. 5 hours as a function of its present and past values. These results show that ANN-based models can be used to improve the <b>tobacco</b> <b>drying</b> process because with these types of models the value of environmental variables can be predicted in the near future and can be estimated in other locations with low errors...|$|R
