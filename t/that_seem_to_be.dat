5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographical}} {{layout of}} Teotihuacan {{is a good}} example of the Mesoamerican tradition of planning cities, settlements, and buildings as a representation of the view of the Universe. Its urban grid is aligned to precisely 15.5º east of North. One theory says this is due to the fact that the sun rose at that same angle during the same summer day each year. Settlers used the alignment to calibrate their sense of time or as a marker for planting crops or performing certain rituals. Another theory is that there are numerous ancient sites in Mesoamerica <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> oriented with the tallest mountain in their given area. This appears to be the case at Teotihuacan, although the mountain to which it is oriented is not visible from within the Teotihuacan complex due to a closer mountain ridge. Pecked-cross circles throughout the city and in the surrounding regions indicate how the people managed to maintain the urban grid over long distances. It also enabled them to orient the Pyramids to the distant mountain that was out of sight.|$|E

500|$|For Villani, {{this theory}} {{of sin and}} {{morality}} being tied directly with fate and fortune fit well with the ultimate fate of the Capetian dynasty of France. The House of Capet was once the champion of the Church and ally of the papacy. However, Villani correlated Philip the Fair's defiance of Pope BonifaceVIII and seizure of the Templar's wealth with later Capetian misfortunes, such as Philip's death in a hunting accident, the adultery of the wives of his three sons, {{the death of his}} heirs, and even French defeats in the Hundred Years' War. Green points out that in Villani's writing there are two significant earthly powers <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exempt or immune from this theory of immorality leading to downfall: Florence and the papacy. The interests of these two powers represent, as Green states, [...] "the kingpin of Villani's scheme of historical interpretation." ...|$|E

500|$|Due {{to their}} {{dioecious}} nature, a hybrid involving {{a pair of}} Nepenthes species can represent one of two possible crosses, depending on which species was the female and which was the male. When the cross is known, the female (or pod) parent is usually referred to first, followed by the male (or pollen) parent. [...] This is an important distinction, as the hybrid will usually display different morphological features according {{to the type of}} cross; the pod parent is thought to be dominant in most cases and hybrid offspring usually resemble it more than the pollen parent. [...] Most wild plants of N. × kinabaluensis, for example, show a greater affinity to N. rajah than N. villosa and are thus thought to represent the cross N. rajah × N. villosa. [...] However, specimens have been found <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more similar to N. villosa, suggesting that they might be the reverse cross (see [...] ). [...] The same is true for other hybrids involving N. rajah.|$|E
500|$|On April 9, 2005, Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson {{were cast}} as the goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. Johnson, who was {{starring}} in the Canadian television series Instant Star (2004–2008), had auditioned to play Wendy's sister Julie; that role later went to Amanda Crew, who originally auditioned to play Erin. Johnson said that she wore a rocker jacket during her second reading and was in a bad mood. As she was leaving, the filmmakers called her back to read for Erin, with the dialogue in her scene being sarcastic. Johnson thought that her dry sense of humor, which the filmmakers caught, helped her land the role. Regarding his role, Lemche said that Ian [...] "spouts some interesting facts <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just {{right there on the}} tips of his fingers". Lemche researched most of Ian's information. During read-throughs, he often asked Morgan about Ian's facts; to help him, Morgan wrote Lemche notes and gave him URLs to research the information Ian gives out.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Brockmann argues {{the fact}} that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because [...] "there is no access to a natural world {{beyond the realm of}} the {{tortured}} human psyche". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Dr. Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they {{are the only ones who}} truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.|$|E

Studies on {{the mechanism of}} restriction enzymes have revealed several general features <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true in almost all cases, although the actual mechanism for each enzyme is most likely some variation of this general mechanism. This mechanism requires a base to generate the hydroxide ion from water, which will act as the nucleophile and attack the phosphorus in the phosphodiester bond. [...] Also required is a Lewis acid to stabilize the extra negative charge of the pentacoordinated transition state phosphorus, {{as well as a}} general acid or metal ion that stabilizes the leaving group (3’-O-).|$|E
2500|$|As for {{the types}} of pollinators, reptile pollinators are known, but they form a {{minority}} in most ecological situations. They are most frequent and most ecologically significant in island systems, where insect and sometimes also bird populations may be unstable and less species-rich. Adaptation {{to a lack of}} animal food and of predation pressure, might therefore favour reptiles becoming more herbivorous and more inclined to feed on pollen and nectar. Most species of lizards in the families <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significant in pollination seem to carry pollen only incidentally, especially the larger species such as Varanidae [...] and Iguanidae, but especially several species of the Gekkonidae are active pollinators, and so is at least one species of the Lacertidae, Podarcis lilfordi, which pollinates various species, but in particular is the major pollinator of Euphorbia dendroides on various Mediterranean islands.|$|E
2500|$|Impulse control {{disorder}} (ICDs) are a {{class of}} DSM diagnoses that do not fall into the other diagnostic categories of the manual (e.g. substance use disorders), and that are characterized by extreme difficulty controlling impulses or urges despite negative consequences. [...] Individuals suffering from an impulse control disorder frequently experience five stages of symptoms: compelling urge or desire, failure to resist the urge, {{a heightened sense of}} arousal, succumbing to the urge (which usually yields relief from tension), and potential remorse or feelings of guilt after the behavior is completed. Specific disorders included within this category include intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, pathological gambling, pyromania, trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), and impulse control disorders not otherwise specified (ICD NOS). ICD NOS includes other significant difficulties <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to impulsivity but do not meet the criteria for a specific DSM diagnosis.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{featuring}} {{improved performance}} over the original Kinect, its successor has {{been subject to}} mixed responses. In its Xbox One review, Engadget praised Xbox One's Kinect functionality, such as face recognition login and improved motion tracking, but that whilst [...] "magical", [...] "every false positive or unrecognized [...] command had us reaching for the controller." [...] The Kinect's inability to understand some accents in English was criticized. [...] Writing for Time, Matt Peckham described the device as being [...] "chunky" [...] in appearance, but that the facial recognition login feature was [...] "creepy but equally sci-fi-future cool", and that the new voice recognition system was a [...] "powerful, addictive way to navigate the console, and save for a few exceptions <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smoothing out with use". However, its accuracy {{was found to be}} affected by background noise, and Peckham further noted that launching games using voice recognition required that the full title of the game be given rather than an abbreviated name that the console [...] "ought to semantically understand", such as Forza Motorsport 5 rather than [...] "Forza 5".|$|E

[...] However, Jakala affirmed the first actual appearance of Sakuragi probably would be more impactaful if his face had not been showed on a Jumbotron {{at the end of the}} chapter. [...] "Still, it was a cute bit", he said. The third chapter had [...] "a very powerful" [...] scene about the formation of a lifelong friendship between Sakuragi and a childhood's friend.
