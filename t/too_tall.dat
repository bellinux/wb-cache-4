5|$|Melora Hardin was {{originally}} {{cast in the}} role of Marty's girlfriend Jennifer, but was let go after Stoltz was dismissed, with the explanation that the actress was now <b>too</b> <b>tall</b> to be playing against Fox. Hardin was dismissed before she had a chance to shoot a single scene and was replaced with Claudia Wells. Actress Jill Schoelen had also been considered to play Marty's girlfriend.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} batches of double deckers have {{a height of}} , <b>too</b> <b>tall</b> to meet many height {{standards}} set by the provincial Ministry of Transportation. Thus, they are restricted to routes which avoid low bridges and underpasses. In particular, they are found exclusively on routes on the Highway 407 and Highway 403 corridors, providing service between Peel and York Regions.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often <b>too</b> <b>tall,</b> or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
60|$|My {{favorite}} of all wild flowers--the purple asters--were there <b>too,</b> on <b>tall</b> nodding stems, with pale faces {{held up to}} the light. The reflection of mountain and forest in Trappers Lake was clear and beautiful.|$|R
60|$|Next, one by one, {{came out}} of the throng, blushing, but with heads erect and firm steps, the seven maidens whom the seven young men loved. They, <b>too,</b> were <b>tall,</b> and beautiful, and stately, like the stone maidens called Caryatides who bear up the roofs of temples.|$|R
60|$|Of set purpose did Trenchard {{add this}} {{fuel to the}} blazing fire. It was no part of his views that this {{encounter}} should be avoided. If Richard Westmacott were allowed to live after what had passed, there were <b>too</b> many <b>tall</b> fellows might go in peril of their lives.|$|R
5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're <b>too</b> <b>tall,</b> you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
5|$|The cast {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} unknowns, though Isabel Bigley, {{who had just}} originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls, was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie. For Larry, the assistant stage manager {{who falls in love}} with Jeanie, they cast Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry, but lost out because he was thought to be <b>too</b> <b>tall</b> to be afraid of Mark Dawson, hired as the towering bully Bob.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the American Bar Association {{presented}} {{a statue of}} Blackstone to the English Bar Association, however, at the time, the sculpture was <b>too</b> <b>tall</b> {{to be placed in}} the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The sculpture, designed by Paul Wayland Bartlett was eventually cast in Europe and presented back to the US for display. Congress approved the placement of the sculpture in Washington, D.C. on 15 March 1943, and appropriated $10,000 for the installation. The bronze statue is a nine-foot (2.7 m) standing portrait of Blackstone wearing judicial robes and a long curly wig, holding a copy of Commentaries. It is placed on a tall granite base and stands on Constitution Avenue & 3rd Street NW. The town of Blackstone, Virginia is named after him.|$|E

25|$|An upper gallery {{over the}} esonarthex, {{following}} the same plan of the one existing in the Church of the Pantokrator, was removed in 1854. Also {{the north and south}} aisles along the nave were destroyed, possibly during the nineteenth century <b>too.</b> The <b>tall</b> triple arches connecting the aisles with the nave are now the lower windows of the church.|$|R

5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow <b>too</b> <b>tall</b> and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel. Edward's prototype {{had an average}} height, but retained his automail. In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine Monthly Shonen Gangan, Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse's huge armor. In {{the design of the}} character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable for his age. She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it <b>too</b> <b>tall.</b> As the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso. While stating that this was because she wanted to draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 {{the company}} also {{discovered}} that the new trains were <b>too</b> <b>tall</b> to use the Italian tunnels along the Riviera coastline route, so the trains have to end at the French/Italian border and transfer passengers to a smaller train.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} Tom had reached his last quarter at King's Lorton the years had made {{striking}} changes in him. He {{was a tall}} youth now, and wore his tail-coat and his stand-up collars. Maggie, <b>too,</b> was <b>tall</b> now, with braided and coiled hair. She was almost as tall as Tom, though she was only thirteen; and she really looked older than he did.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{if the air}} {{pressure}} within the drain becomes suddenly higher than ambient, this positive transient could cause waste water to be pushed into the fixture, breaking the trap seal, with serious hygiene and health consequences if <b>too</b> forceful. <b>Tall</b> buildings of three or more stories are particularly susceptible to this problem. Vent stacks are installed in parallel to waste stacks to allow proper venting in tall buildings.|$|R
50|$|At a site not <b>too</b> faraway, the <b>tall</b> man sits around, upset on {{how things}} {{did not go}} his way at the young woman's house. He then {{develops}} a grudge towards Oswald, and plans {{to get rid of}} his colleague.|$|R
25|$|He grew {{very tall}} already in primary school, his height {{causing him to}} {{constantly}} hunch. Later, when trying {{to break into the}} film industry, he was told he was <b>too</b> <b>tall</b> to become an actor, so he started his career in modeling instead.|$|E
25|$|Patterson {{initially}} estimated {{its height}} at six and one-half to seven feet, and later raised his estimate to about seven and one-half feet. Some later analysts, anthropologist Grover Krantz among them, have suggested Patterson's later estimate was about one foot <b>too</b> <b>tall.</b> Gimlin's estimate was six feet even.|$|E
25|$|At 5’5”, {{most people}} thought that Khorkina was <b>too</b> <b>tall</b> to be an artistic gymnast. However her coach, Boris Pilkin, saw her {{potential}} and created alternative training methods and skills to accommodate her taller body. Khorkina has more skills named after her in the Code of Points than any other gymnast.|$|E
60|$|On {{entering}} the tent {{they found a}} table set for two, with snowy linen, bright silver and sparkling glassware, a vase of roses {{in the center and}} many dishes of delicious food, some smoking hot, waiting to satisfy their hunger. Also, {{on either side of the}} tent were beds, with satin sheets, warm blankets and pillows filled with swansdown. There were chairs, <b>too,</b> and <b>tall</b> lamps that lighted the interior of the tent with a soft, rosy glow.|$|R
40|$|Investigating {{assimilate}} contribution {{and grain}} filling pattern in winter wheat is importance under drought stress condition. This {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the relationship between drought stress on grain filling and yield of 4 cultivars including MV 17 (dwarf), Alvand, Shahryar (semi-dwarf) and <b>Toos</b> (<b>tall).</b> Experimental design was randomized complete block with three replications. Drought stress assigned to main plots and cultivars to sub plots. Growth curve sampling started at 7 days after anthesis with 4 days interval. In pre-anthesis drought stress Alvand produced highest yield, while it was 29. 14 % less than control treatment. The yield of Toos cultivar was lowest at pre-anthesis drought stress. Rate of grain filling of Toos cultivar did not change at pre-anthesis drought stress. Drought stress treatment at post-anthesis decreased rate of grain filling in all cultivars as compared to control, but it was significant only Toos c. v. In pre-anthesis drought stress grain filling duration increased in Alvand but decreased in Toos. Alvand with higher rate of grain filling produced highest grain yield (3850 kg/ha). It can be concluded that, drought stress decreases grain filling duration and rate of grain filling...|$|R
60|$|The {{manner in}} which Britt entered the room proclaimed a {{distinctive}} character. He edged himself through the door, not stealthily, but carelessly, casually. He, <b>too,</b> was <b>tall,</b> with a wide, dark beard curling over very pink and rather plump cheeks, and in his bright black eyes a sardonic sheen played as he loosely shook his host's hand. His expression {{was that of a}} man perpetually amused, as if anticipating a joke or recollecting a mockery. His voice was as languid as his limbs, but his words were precise and to their mark.|$|R
25|$|Garrett's {{body was}} <b>too</b> <b>tall</b> for any {{finished}} coffins available, so a special {{one had to}} be shipped in from El Paso. His funeral service was held March 5, 1908, and he was laid to rest next to his daughter, Ida, {{who had died in}} 1896 at the age of fifteen.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Mtimkulu, who was {{employed}} as chief engineer at Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) {{claimed to have}} a PhD in engineering, which was a lie; he was merely qualified as an engineering technician. Under Mtimkulu's leadership, Prasa ordered 70 new locomotives, valued at R3.5 billion.

The child actor found the shooting conditions to be too difficult to handle, and the film's editors were unable to match day and evening sequences because {{of the difference in}} the two portrayals. Because Gale also served as an understudy, he took over the role.|$|E
