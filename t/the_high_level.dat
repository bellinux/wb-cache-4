These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD.

5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|Following the station's opening, Downtown Flushing {{evolved into}} a major {{commercial}} and transit center, as development sprung around the section of Main Street near the station. On April 24, 1939, express trains began operating {{to and from the}} station, in conjunction with the reconstruction of the Willets Point station for the 1939 World's Fair. Due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of passenger use, beginning in 1940 local residents requested an additional exit at the east end of the station, and the widening of existing staircases. A new eastern entrance was added after World War II. Ground broke on the new entrance on November 5, 1947, and it opened on October 28, 1948 with two new street stairs and an additional token booth. Upon its initial opening, the new entrance did little to relieve crowding at the main fare control area.|$|E
