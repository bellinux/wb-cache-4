40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship of}} drug abuse violations of three variables: age, time period, and cohort over a 20 -year period. By utilizing drug abuse violation statistics from the Uniform Crime Reports, this study tests Richard Easterlin’s cohort hypothesis. Easterlin’s hypothesis suggests that crime rates will fluctuate according to the relative size of age cohorts. That is, large cohorts will generate higher arrest rates than small cohorts. This hypothesis was tested as it applied <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> rates for <b>drug</b> abuse violations. The findings disclosed that both age and cohort, but not period, had a significant relationship <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> rates for <b>drug</b> abuse violations. The variable age had a more significant relationship <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> ates for <b>drug</b> abuse violations than did cohort. Therefore, Easterlin’s hypothesis is not confirmed...|$|R

5000|$|John DeLorean then lobbied the British {{government}} for aid, but was refused {{unless he was}} able to find a matching amount from other investors. What followed is a matter of debate between the British government, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, DeLorean, his investors, and the US court system. At some point in 1982, John DeLorean became the target of an FBI sting operation designed <b>to</b> <b>arrest</b> <b>drug</b> traffickers. He was arrested in October 1982 and charged with conspiring to smuggle $24 million worth of cocaine into the US. The key element of evidence for the prosecution was a videotape showing DeLorean discussing the drugs deal with undercover FBI agents Benedict (Ben) Tisa and West, although DeLorean's attorney Howard Weitzman successfully demonstrated to the court that he was coerced into participation in the deal by the agents who initially approached him as legitimate investors. He was acquitted of all charges, but his reputation was forever tarnished. After his trial and subsequent acquittal, DeLorean quipped, [...] "Would you buy a used car from me?" ...|$|R

The Florida Bar charged Fred with ethics violation as he was admitting to violations of Florida law, and demeaning the legal profession. The prosecution became a circus with numerous witnesses testifying to Fred’s extraordinary legal skills and charitable nature, but the judge found him guilty and a public reprimand was recommended.
