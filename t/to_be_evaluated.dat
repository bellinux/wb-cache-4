5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E

40|$|The {{incoherent}} {{dynamic form}} factor S/Q, <b>to)</b> <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> in solid helium for {{comparison with the}} impulse approximation (IA). The purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> determine the Q values for which the IA is valid for systems uch as helium where the atoms interact via a potential having a steeply repulsive but not infinite hard core. For 3 He, Si(Q, <b>to)</b> <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> from first principles, beginning with the pair potential. The density of states g (<b>to)</b> <b>is</b> <b>evaluated</b> using the self-consistent phonon theory and Si(Q, o~) is {{expressed in terms of}} g(to).

The difference between S ~ and SIA, which <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> final state interactions of the scattering atom with the remainder of the atoms in the solid, is also predominantly antisymmetric in (to-ton), where toR is the recoil frequency. This suggests that the symmetriz-ation procedure proposed by Sears to eliminate final state contributions should work well in solid helium. 1...|$|R

5|$|On 25 March 2010, an A-10 {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} of an aircraft with all engines powered by a biofuel blend. The flight, performed at Eglin Air Force Base, used a 1:1 blend of JP-8 and Camelina-based fuel. On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a new fuel blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based that can be derived using wood, paper, grass, or any cellulose based material, and are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel. ATJ is the third alternative fuel <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> by the Air Force {{as a replacement for}} petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel. Previous types were a synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from coal and natural gas and a bio-mass fuel derived from plant-oils and animal fats known as Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet.|$|E
5|$|The black honeyeater may be {{adversely}} affected {{by the loss of}} the emu bush to grazing and weed control by farmers. Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be particularly rapid; the current population seems to be of sufficient numbers, and the species has a sufficiently large range, for the species <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> as of species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However Claire A. Runge and colleagues observed that the black honeyeaters' range across inland Australia contracted after years of low rainfall and showed a slow and incomplete recovery even after several years. They added that although nomadic species such as the black honeyeater may have a large distribution, they are often habitat specialists and hence may only occupy a small area within their range. Thus the risk of extinction of these species may be underestimated.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated</b> in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, 2015, Jones {{announced}} he was ending his college career to enter the 2015 NBA draft. He was selected with the 24th overall {{pick in the draft}} by the Cleveland Cavaliers, who then traded his draft rights to his hometown team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, in exchange for a 2019 second round draft pick and the draft rights to the 31st and 36th picks in the draft, Cedi Osman and Rakeem Christmas, respectively. On July 7, 2015, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Timberwolves. Jones started in the preseason opener when Ricky Rubio was sidelined, but did not fare well against Russell Westbrook, going scoreless and nearly giving up a triple double. Jones began the season fourth on the Timberwolves depth chart at point guard (behind Rubio, Zach LaVine and Andre Miller) and was inactive for the October 28 season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers. Jones was active {{for the first time on}} November 7 when Kevin Martin had to be away from the team for the game against the Chicago Bulls. Two games later on November 10, he was active again when three starters were sidelined, including Rubio who was scratched from the lineup right before tipoff. He made his debut that night against the Charlotte Hornets, posting his first assist, steal, rebound and point. On December 5, using the flexible assignment rule, the Timberwolves assigned Jones to the Idaho Stampede, the D-League affiliate of the Utah Jazz. On December 22, he was recalled by the Timberwolves after he averaged 24.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.5 steals in 35.2 minutes per game in six starts in the D-League. He made his first NBA field goals on December 23 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring 6 points in 20 minutes. Jones didn't play in 17 consecutive games (since January 4) and then had a season-high 5 assists on February 8 against the New Orleans Pelicans. By late February, head coach Sam Mitchell noted that Jones would be getting sufficient playing time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>evaluated.</b> He achieved a career-high on February 22 with 9 points on 4-of-7 shooting against the Boston Celtics. On February 28, he posted 6 assists against the Dallas Mavericks. Jones posted 6 assists and 10 points against the San Antonio Spurs on March 8. On April 7, Jones tallied 4 steals against the Sacramento Kings. On April 13, he closed out the season with a 12-assist effort against the New Orleans Pelicans.|$|E
