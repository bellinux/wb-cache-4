5|$|Chief Vanuatu, {{leader of}} the bigfoots, in {{recognition}} of the pair's actions, makes the Freelance Police members of the bigfoot tribe and tells them of a spell that will make <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> bigfoots again, preventing their capture by humans. However, the chief requires help deciphering the spell's four ingredients, and asks for Sam and Max's help. Eventually, they discover that the ingredients are a vegetable resembling John Muir, hair restoration tonic, the tooth of a dinosaur, and a vortex contained within a snow globe. Combined with a live bigfoot sacrifice—which Max substitutes for frozen bigfoot-clad Bumpus and Harvey—the ingredients cause large trees to spring into existence, destroying towns and cities and covering the bulk of the west United States in forest. Content that their work is done, Sam and Max take the frozen ice block containing Bumpus and Harvey to the carnival. Believing that Bruno has been returned to them, the owners give a large reward of skee ball tickets to the Freelance Police, who then spend the end credits shooting targets at a carnival stall with real firearms.|$|E

3000|$|When Kent Beck invented XP, he {{intended}} to make <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>safer</b> <b>for</b> programmers. Ron Jeffries believes that nowadays, “agile is not making <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>safer</b> <b>for</b> programmers” (Lockard et al. 2017). One participant [Anonymous] identifies management pressure as one reason {{for a lot of}} careless software “craftsmanship” on the developer’s level. Jeff Sutherland points out that there is a “lot of sloppy software craftsmanship [because of] management pressure” (Lockard and Gifford 2017 a). This often creates a huge mess since the agile approach is not tailored to the specific context. Jeff Sutherland (2017 a) mentions that there are many teams outside without working software. According to Arie van Bennekum, often “teams deliver [software] and then use the following sprint for test” (Hohl 2017). In addition, Mike Beedle is disappointed because many people “maybe just have misunderstood [the concepts of agile] and doing [it] on the cheap” (Lockard and Gifford 2016 a). The problem he points out is that “people want solutions and people want an execution plan” (Lockard and Gifford 2016 a). Organizations which want to retain their hierarchy often try to introduce Scrum by the book to speed up development [Anonymous]. Furthermore, Mike Beedle states that“agile is about the understanding, what makes sense” (Lockard and Gifford 2016 a). John Kern emphasizes to view agile methods and practices in a more differentiated manner. He states: “I hope the hack that someone building software that can kill you is not following the same process as someone designing some start up bullshit webpage. Please tell me not to follow the same methodology. Whatever it is. To me that’s the difference. Rightsizing the mind-set and be as agile as you could be in your work. Fail safe better be developed with a much more strict process.” (Lockard 2016 a) [...]...|$|R

Bustles Sarah Freymiller wrote that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype", citing cheerleading as an outlet the character chooses willingly. Kim is not a tomboy; Julia Pugachevsky of BuzzFeed credits the series with [...] "show that you could be traditionally feminine and strong at the same time." [...] Conversely, Geek Chic: Smart Women in Popular Culture author S. Inness argued that Kim Possible reinforces that [...] "girls can do anything they choose" [...] but must look a certain way in order to do so since its female character participate in consumerism and normative femininity that its male characters do not, such as shopping and spending much time on their appearance.

25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure <b>the</b> <b>world</b> trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open <b>the</b> <b>world</b> economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>safer</b> <b>for</b> them.

In the same year, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war. Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican–American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram, which was intercepted by British Intelligence. Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic. Wilson then asked Congress for [...] "a war to end all wars" [...] that would [...] "make <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> democracy", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917.
