50|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{preparing}} Kalamata olives, {{known as the}} long and short methods. The short method debitters the olive by packing them in water or weak brine for around a week. Once complete, they are then packed in brine and wine vinegar {{with a layer of}} olive oil and slices of lemon on top. The olives are often slit to decrease the processing time. The long method involves slitting the olives and placing them in salted water in order <b>to</b> <b>debitter</b> them, a process that can take as long as three months. Levels of polyphenol remain in the olives after processing, giving them their slightly bitter taste.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried {{out for the first}} time on the triterpenicacids in tableolives. Maslinic acid was found in a higher concentration than oleanolic acid in the flesh of 17, unprocessed olive varieties, with the Picual and the Manzanilla varieties showing the highest and almost the lowest contents, respectively. The level of triterpenicacids in several types of commercial black and green olives ranged from 460 to 1470 mg/kg fruit, which represents a much higher value than reported for virgin olive oils. In fact, the NaOH treatment employed <b>to</b> <b>debitter</b> black and green olives reduced the concentrations of these substances in the flesh because of their solubilisation into alkaline solutions. Thus, natural black olives, which are not treated with NaOH, showed a higher concentration than 2000 mg/kg in the olive flesh. These results will contribute to the reevaluation of tableolives from a nutritional and functional point of view because of the promising bioactivity properties attributed to olivetriterpenicacids.

40|$|Seven Gram-negative {{bacterial}} isolates showing aerobic growth using lupanine as {{the only}} source of carbon and energy were obtained from samples of Lupinus sp. cultivation soil. Four of these isolates were identified using the BIOLOG system, two Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, one Xanthomonas campestris pv. xanthosoma and one Gluconobacter cerinus. Two unidentified isolates, IST 20 B and IST 40 D exhibited the highest specific growth rates (0. 13 and 0. 17 h"-" 1 respectively) and were able to remove 99 % of the initial lupanine after ca. 24 h incubation at 27 deg C in a media containing only lupanine (2 gl"-" 1) and mineral salts. Both of these might be useful for the biotechnological treatment of alkaloid-containing effluents with high alkaloid content which may conceivably originate from a lupine seed fractionation process. Final alkaloid contents were found to be lowered to 42 and 53 % of initial values after a 44 h growth at 20, 27 or 34 deg C in a medium prepared from an aqueous Lupinus albus extract. These isolates were also tested as to their ability <b>to</b> <b>debitter</b> feed grade Lupinus flour, and it was found that their efficiency of alkaloid removal depended on initial inoculum content, temperature and incubation time. The effects of these variables were modelled using the response surface methodology, yielding equations useful in predicting final alkaloid content in debittered floursAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

50|$|In humans, {{naringin}}ase {{is found}} in the liver and rapidly metabolizes naringin into naringenin. This happens in two steps- first, naringin is hydrolyzed by α-L-rhamnosidase activity of naringinase to rhamnose and prunin. The prunin formed is then hydrolyzed by β-d-glucosidase activity of naringinase into naringenin and glucose. Naringinase is an enzyme that has a wide occurrence in nature and can be found in plants, yeasts, and fungi. It is commercially attractive due <b>to</b> its <b>debittering</b> properties.|$|R
40|$|A hidrólise enzimática de proteínas pode levar ao desenvolvimento de sabor amargo, associado à liberação de grupos hidrofóbicos. Neste trabalho, desenvolveu-se uma nova metodologia, baseada no encapsulamento em lipoesferas, para mascarar o sabor amargo de hidrolisados de caseína obtidos pela ação da papaína. Além disso, utilizou-se a espectrofotometria derivada segunda (EDS), como método de determinação da taxa de encapsulamento de hidrolisados enzimáticos de proteínas, e as amostras analisadas apresentaram valores em torno de 66 %. Este microencapsulamento mostrou ser uma tecnologia eficiente para reduzir a hidrofobicidade e o sabor amargo de hidrolisados de caseína. A análise por microscopia eletrônica de varredura revelou a morfologia esférica das microcápsulas e a medida da oxidação lipídica mostrou boa estabilidade química por período de até 60 dias. In {{several studies}} the {{nutritional}} value of enzymatic protein hydrolysates has {{been related to}} their small peptide contents, especially di- and tripeptides. However, a disadvantage found in the enzymatic process {{is the development of}} a bitter taste, {{which is one of the}} main obstacles for using the hydrolysates in dietetic formulations and also seems to be associated to the exposition of buried hydrophobic groups. The methods proposed in the literature to solve this problem show some disadvantages, like the reduction of the nutritional value of these preparations. In this work, a new methodology based on the encapsulation in lipospheres was developed, in order <b>to</b> <b>debittering</b> casein hidrolysates obtained by using papain. The second derivative spectrophotometry (SDS) was used for the first time, for measuring the entrapment efficiency of protein hidrolysates and the results were around 66 %. This microencapsulation system showed to be an efficient technology to reduce the hydrophobicity and the bitter taste of casein hidrolysates.

40|$|Cold water {{processing}} by soaking, {{cooking and}} washing {{has been used}} for hundreds of years <b>to</b> produce <b>debittered</b> lupine in the Andean region. The process of debittering lupine (Lupinus mutabilis Sweet) was investigated at semi-industrial village-scale and laboratory scale in Ecuador. The process took 5. 7 1. 0 days, removed 94. 9 % of the total alkaloids, used water at almost 62 times the weight of the raw dry and bitter lupine, and caused a 22 % loss of total solids, principally fat, minerals and carbohydrates. During the debittering process the microbiological quality deteriorated. Mathematical modeling based on Fickian diffusion suggested that the diffusion coefficient of alkaloids would be expected to be between 10 - 10 and 10 - 11 m 2 /s because the lupine endosperm is a polymer matrix whose properties change during processing. Of the process operations, cooking was the most efficient at removing alkaloids both in terms of time and water used, followed by soaking and washing...|$|R
40|$|Table olives {{have been}} a {{component}} of the Mediterranean diet for centuries and their consumption is increasing worldwide because of their nutritional and palatable characteristics. The raw olive drupe is inedible because of its high content in a bitter glucoside named oleuropein, which is hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions during the two most popular methods of preparing table olives, the Spanish-style green olives and the California-style black olives. Moreover, natural olives are those that do not suffer the alkaline treatment but lose their bitterness slowly for months due to the acid hydrolysis of the oleuropein (1). Recently, a new and rapid method <b>to</b> <b>debitter</b> olives has been proposed, which is based on the oxidation of the oleuropein (2). However, this method has failed in some cases and a study has been carried out to optimize this new process. Olives preserved in acidified brine into industrial tanks were maintained under oxygen overpressure for several days and the phenolic content was analyzed. The reduction in olives of the oleuropein concentration ranged from 30 to 100 %, being lower as the storage time in tanks progressed. As it has been previously reported (2), the enzyme polyphenoloxidase catalyzes the oxidation reaction of oleuropein giving rise to non-bitter products. Likewise, the activity of this enzyme is highly reduced in preserved olives (3). Hence, it was hypothesized that the debittering must be carried out soon after brining of olives. New oxidation experiments were performed with olives stored just only one month in the acidified brines and the reduction of oleuropein concentration in fruit reached 90 - 95 %. These results open the possibility of debittering natural olives {{in just a few days}} instead of months without the use of sodium hydroxide, which is not allowed for organic table olives in many countries.

40|$|Psychotrophic {{bacteria}} produce heat-stable lipase, protease, and phospholipase. Pervious {{studies indicate}} {{the production of}} multiple enzymes in several strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, but conclusive evidence is lacking. The influence of culture conditions on the production and thermostability of phospholipase, protease, and lipase was investigated in 17 raw milk and environmental isolates. Production and thermostability of the enzymes were influenced by strain, stage of growth, and the culture medium. Cross-reactivity of antibodies raised to a purified protease and a commercial lipase indicated the immunological diversity of the enzymes. Protease purification was undertaken to investigate the production of multiple proteases within a single strain. A single monomeric protease with a molecular weight of 52 kDa was purified from P. fluorescens RO 98. Biochemical characterization of the enzyme revealed {{that it was a}} zinc-metallo acidprotease with pH and temperature optima of 5. 0 35 °C, respectively. The enzyme was thermostable with a D 55 of 41 min and a D 62. 5 of 18 h. Although sensitive assays exist for proteases, they are not suitable for detection of protease activity in milk in the presence of milk proteins. Existing immunoassays approach the required sensitivity but take about 6 h and cannot distinguish between active and inactive enzyme. An immunoassay that can be completed within 2 h and that can detect and distinguish both total and active enzyme was explored. The ratio of these two forms gives insight into the history of the milk. The ability of the purified protease to hydrolyze hydrophobic peptides associated with bitterness in Cheddar cheese was also investigated. Results demonstrated that the protease had the potential <b>to</b> <b>debitter</b> Cheddar cheese because it was able to hydrolyze the bitter peptides commonly found during aging. Two lipolytic enzymes with molecular weights of 50 (Pf-lip 1) and 12 kDa (Pf-lip 2) were purified from P. fluorescens RO 98. Differences were observed in their biochemical properties. D 62. 5 -values of 12. 7 and 29. 9 h were determined for Pf-lip 1 and Pf-lip 2, respectively. Pf-lip 1 preferred longer chain length fatty acids, and Pf-lip 2 preferred shorter chain length substrates. Pf-lip 1 hydrolyzed milk fat and emulsified triolein, but Pf-lip 2 did not, indicating that the latter was an esterase. This information is of significance to the dairy industry because activity tests that assay both the lipolytic enzymes need to be used in order to direct raw milk to short shelf-life products during processing and ensure quality of long shelf-life product...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{contribution}} of proline residues to protein hydrolysate bitterness, much {{research has focused on}} the application of proline-specific exopeptidases in hydrolysate <b>debittering</b> strategies due <b>to</b> the general inability of most general aminopeptidases to hydrolyze the imino bond ([FitzGerald and O'Cuinn 2006]). PepP from lactococcoal strains may contribute to the abolition of bitterness during cheese ripening when peptide degradation is involved during fermentation ([McDonnell et al. 1997]). Debittering of a tryptic hydrolysate of β-casein has been described using purified general and proline-specific aminopeptidases from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris AM 2 ([Bouchier et al. 2001]). Thus, PepP has industrial potential based on its application <b>to</b> the enzymatic <b>debittering</b> of proline-rich peptide mixtures in foods. In addition to native enzyme production and purification, recombinant DNA technology can be used to express large amounts of interesting enzymes ([Oliveira et al. 2011]). This possibility greatly expands the range of potential applications for enzymes (e.g., β-galactosidases) and their economically effective utilization in industrial processes ([Oliveira et al. 2011]).|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} {{characteristics of}} five oleuropeinolytic {{strains of the}} Lactobacillus plantarum group selected within 135 isolates from table olives were investigated. The metabolism of phenolic compounds during elaboration of green (cv. Chalkidikis) and black (cv. Kalamata) olives under reduced salt conditions was evaluated. Olives of both cultivars were fermented in two different kinds of brine (Brine A containing 2. 3 % NaCl, 32. 3 mM Ca-acetate and 33. 9 mM Ca-lactate and Brine B containing 4 % NaCl, pH 5. 0 in both brines) by five selected strains of L. plantarum group. After 60 days of fermentation, the analysis of phenolic compounds was performed by HPLC and nine compounds were identified and quantified: oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and vanillin and the phenolic acids protocatechuic, caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic and p-coumaric acid.

The FSPHs were obtained by hydrolysis of fish skin using Alcalase in a batch reactor a 60 °C and pH 8. 25. The ash was removed by adsorbing FSPHs onto MAR. Desorption was achieved by washing with alcohol at different concentrations. Ash content of the FSPHs was reduced from 4. 69 - 5. 57 to 1. 07 - 2. 48 % range. The protein content was enriched from 89. 07 - 90. 82 to 94. 89 - 96. 38 % range. MAR has good hydrolysate recoveries. The use of MAR showed promising results in decolourization and fishy flavour reduction. Nile tilapia and Nile perch skin protein hydrolysates were moderately bitter compared to Grass carp skin protein hydrolysates.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{technological}} aspects of the debittering process of lupin in a food sovereignty framework. Of all investigated lupin species,Lupinus mutabilishas the best nutritional composition, {{which is similar to}} that of soya bean (Glycine max). Lupins can be used to fortify the protein content of many products. In addition, specific lupin protein concentrates or isolates display functional properties of industrial interest (as emulsifier, gelling and foaming agent). On the other hand, lupins contain bitter alkaloids that have to be removed prior consumption because are toxic (the fatal acute dose of lupin alkaloids was reported as 10 mg kg - 1 body weight (bw) for infants and children, and 25 mg kg - 1 bw for adults). However, alkaloids also have medical uses for their hypocholesterolemic, anti-arrhythmic and immunosuppressive activity. Bitter lupins have been detoxified by biological, chemical or aqueous processes. However, our research concentrated on the aqueousprocessing because this is the only way <b>to</b> produce <b>debittered</b> lupin for human consumption in an environment-friendly manner. The process investigated involved soaking, cooking, and washing of the raw seeds. This process showed to be inefficient because it took 5. 7 ± 1. 0 days, used water at almost 62 times the weight of the raw dry and bitter lupine, and caused a 22 % loss of total solids, principally fat, minerals, and carbohydrates. In addition, the microbiological quality deteriorated during this debittering process. Mathematical modeling based on Fickian diffusion suggested that the diffusion coefficient of alkaloids would be expected to vary between 10 - 10 and 10 - 11 m 2 s - 1 because the process is carried out in unsteady conditions. In this scenario, it was clear that a new technology for debittering lupins is needed. For this purpose ahydro-agitator was designed, built and used to test the effect of different washing conditions on alkaloids content, solids in the product, final weight, processing time and water and energy consumption. Results were modeled and optimal processing conditions were inferred from a technological point of view; the optimum solution comprised 18 h of soaking, 1 h cooking, 3 changes of water/day and 22 h of agitation/day. For estimating the washing time a mathematic function was inferred (∂c / ∂t = kc;k= - 0. 188 - 4. 973 - 3 * Agitation – 0. 0043 * Changes - 1. 681 - 3 Agitation*Changes). Then, the products obtained from different processing conditions were evaluated by consumers on the basis of their willingness to pay in relation to their appreciation scores and product price. Results were modeled. Treatments with more processing increased the product price and diminished liking level. However, the willingness to pay is the combined effect of both variables. For example, people would accept an increase in price of 0. 3 $/kg if the liking level increases from “like slightly” to “like moderately”. The new developed technology could be used to optimize processes such as hydration and/or removal of undesired materials of legumes and other seeds. The approach used in this study also seems suitable to estimate relationships between processing conditions, liking, price and willingness to pay in other products. The generated information can be helpful in decision making, such as selection of consumers´ preferred process and liking in relation to pricing...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (l) to screen out active proline-specific peptidases from Lactobacillus casei subspecies, (2) to study growth kinetic and enzyme production from enriched medium (MRS) and cheese whey medium, (3) to purify and characterize two active proline-specific enzymes, and (4) to investigate the action of purified enzyme on bitter tryptic digests of $ beta$-casein as well as bitter enzyme-modified cheese. Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei LLG and Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus S 93 were examined for extra- and intra-cellular proline-specific peptidase activities. Both strains showed strong activity for x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase and proline iminopeptidase but had weak activities for prolidase, prolinase, and post proline endopeptidase. Histochemical staining of crude enzyme extract from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei LLG with different substrates revealed a distinct protein band for x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase as well as for proline iminopeptidase. The growth kinetics showed that the intracellular proline-specific peptidases increased gradually {{at the beginning of the}} exponential phase and reached a maximum at the beginning of stationary phase. Storage stability of x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase and proline iminopeptidase in crude extract, with and without stabilizers showed no significant loss in activity of these two enzymes at 4 $ sp circ$C for 9 days without adding any stabilizers. The levels of x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase, proline iminopeptidase, and post proline endopeptidase activities of cells grown in whey did not vary markedly from cells grown in MRS broth. X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase and proline iminopeptidase were purified from crude cell-free extract of Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei LLG by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) equipped with ion-exchange and gel-filtration columns. X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase was found to be a serine-dependent enzyme with molecular mass of 79 kDa. The pH and the temperature optima by the purified enzyme were 7. 0 and 50 $ sp circ$C, respectively. Proline iminopeptidase was sulfhydryl enzyme with molecular mass of 46 kDa. The maximum enzyme activity was observed at pH 7. 5 and 40 $ sp circ$C. This is the first report describing the purification and characterization of x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase and proline iminopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei <b>to</b> homogeneity. The <b>debittering</b> of tryptic digests from $ beta$-casein by x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase was studied by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results showed that two bitter peptides (f 53 - 97 and f 03 - 209) containing X-Pro-Y-Pro in their amino acid residues were completely hydrolyzed and many other peptides with high hydrophobicity were decreased in peak area. The addition of purified x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase on bitter enzyme-modified cheese (EMC) also showed that at least one bitter peptide with X-Pro-Y derived from $ alpha$-casein hydrolysis was removed...|$|R
