5|$|The {{technique}} of plant <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> in vitro improves {{the propagation of}} Hippeastrum by decreasing {{the time required to}} reach the minimum size to start the reproductive cycle, using sections of bulbs grown in artificial media with the addition of plant hormones.|$|E
5|$|Bulb offsets and <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> produce genetic clones of {{the parent}} plant and thus {{maintaining}} genetic integrity of the cultivars. Bulb offsets usually require {{at least a year}} before flowering. Commercially, plants may be propagated in vitro and then planted out to grow into plants large enough to sell.|$|E
40|$|Photorespiration {{rates in}} <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> of a C 4 plant, Portulaca oleracea, were {{compared}} to those in <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> of a C 3 plant, Streptanthus tortuosus. The C 4 plant <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> have one-half to one-third the photorespiration rate of the C 3 plant <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> and respond to varying O 2 concentrations in a manner typical of C 4 plants. The {{results suggest that the}} lack of detectable photorespiration in C 4 plants is not related to leaf anatomy...|$|R

5|$|Extracts of {{the fruit}} body of Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{have been shown to}} favorably influence the growth and development of HeLa cells grown in <b>tissue</b> <b>culture.</b> The mushroom contains nicotianamine, an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Nicotianamine is a metal-chelating compound essential in iron metabolism and utilization in plants. Several sterols have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, ergosterol peroxide, cerevisterol, and 9α-hydroxycerevisterol, in addition to the previously unknown ceramide (2S,2R,3R,4E,8E)-N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah, like {{virtually}} all {{species in the}} genus, is a scrambling vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (≤30mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. rajah does not produce runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from <b>tissue</b> <b>culture,</b> where numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E
5|$|The Salk vaccine, or inactivated {{poliovirus}} vaccine (IPV), {{is based}} on three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney (type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus), grown in a type of monkey kidney <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> (Vero cell line), which are then inactivated with formalin. The injected Salk vaccine confers IgG-mediated immunity in the bloodstream, which prevents polio infection from progressing to viremia and protects the motor neurons, thus eliminating the risk of bulbar polio and post-polio syndrome.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} 19 {{different}} primary and serial <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> were investigated for their sensitivity to virulent or attenuated rubella virus (RV). Primary guinea pig tissues, a serial passage of baby hamster kidney, and primary human amnion were comparable to African green monkey kidney <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> in their sensitivity. In general, primary human tissues were relatively insusceptible to the Gilchrist strain of RV. RV {{interfered with the}} growth of vesicular stomatitis virus. Based on this finding, it was possible to develop an assay method in guinea pig <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> by using VSV as the challenge virus. This system appeared to be comparable in sensitivity to the use of primary monkey kidney <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> for the detection of small amounts of RV and offers the advantages of economy, rapidity, and safety...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} compares the {{exogenous}} NAD(P) H oxidation and the membrane potential ([delta][psi]) generated in mitochondria isolated from different tissues {{of an important}} agricultural crop, sugar beet (Beta vulgaris}. We observed that mitochondria from taproots, cold-stored taproots, and in vitro-grown <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> contain a functional NADH dehydrogenase, whereas only those isolated from <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> displayed a functional NAD(P) H dehydrogenase. It is interesting that the NADH-dependent [delta][psi] of mitochondria from cold-stored taproots and from <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> was not affected by free Ca 2 + ions, whereas free Ca 2 + was required for the mitochondrial NADPH oxidation by in vitro-grown cells and cytosolic NADH oxidation by mitochondria from fresh taproots. A tentative model accounting for the different response to Ca 2 + ions of the NADH dehydrogenase in mitochondria from cold-stored taproots and <b>tissue</b> <b>cultures</b> of B. vulgaris is discussed...|$|R
5|$|The recent {{advent of}} {{artificial}} <b>tissue</b> <b>culture,</b> or more specifically in vitro, technology in Europe and the United States {{has meant that}} plants can be produced in large numbers and sold at relatively low prices (~US$20–$30 {{in the case of}} N. rajah). In vitro propagation refers to production of whole plants from cell cultures derived from explants (generally seeds). This technology has, to a large extent, removed the incentive for collectors to travel to Sabah to collect the plant illegally, and demand for wild-collected plants has fallen considerably in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The second inactivated polio {{virus vaccine}} was {{developed}} in 1952 by Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh, and announced to the world on 12 April 1955. The Salk vaccine, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine, is based on poliovirus grown in a type of monkey kidney <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> (vero cell line), which is chemically inactivated with formalin. After two doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (given by injection), 90 {{percent or more of}} individuals develop protective antibody to all three serotypes of poliovirus, and at least 99 percent are immune to poliovirus following three doses.|$|E
5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years {{as a result of the}} availability of inexpensive clones from <b>tissue</b> <b>culture.</b> I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, gardens became {{focused on}} the plant conservation. The Botanic Gardens Conservation Secretariat was {{established}} by the IUCN, and the World Conservation Union in 1987 {{with the aim of}} coordinating the plant conservation efforts of botanical gardens around the world. It maintains a database of rare and endangered species in botanical gardens' living collections. Many gardens hold ex situ conservation collections that preserve genetic variation. These may be held as: seeds dried and stored at low temperature, or in <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> (such as the Kew Millennium Seedbank); as living plants, including those that are of special horticultural, historical or scientific interest (such as those held by the NCCPG in the United Kingdom); or by managing and preserving areas of natural vegetation. Collections are often held and cultivated with the intention of reintroduction to their original habitats. The Center for Plant Conservation at St Louis, Missouri coordinates the conservation of native North American species.|$|E
5|$|Other {{plants that}} are {{considered}} to be protocarnivorous have sticky trichomes on some surface, such as the flower scape and bud of Stylidium and Plumbago, the bracts of Passiflora foetida, and leaves of Roridula. The trichomes of Stylidium, which appear below the flower, have been known to trap and kill small insects since their discovery several centuries ago, but their purpose remained ambiguous. In November 2006, Dr. Douglas Darnowski published a paper describing the active digestion of proteins when they come in contact with a trichome of a Stylidium species grown in aseptic <b>tissue</b> <b>culture,</b> proving that the plant, rather than the surface microbes, was the source of protease production. Darnowski asserts in that paper that given this evidence, Stylidium species are properly called carnivorous, though in order to fulfill the strict definition of carnivory it needs to be proven that they are capable of absorbing nutrients derived from prey and that this adaptation gives the plants some competitive advantage.|$|E

25|$|Plants can be {{propagated}} by seed, cuttings, and <b>tissue</b> <b>culture.</b> Seeds {{are usually}} sown on damp chopped Sphagnum moss, or on sterile plant <b>tissue</b> <b>culture</b> media {{once they have}} been properly disinfected. The seeds generally become nonviable soon after harvesting, so seed are not usually the preferred method of propagation. A 1:1 mixture of orchid medium with moss or perlite {{has been used for}} germination and culture. Seed may take two months to germinate, and two years or more to yield mature plants. Cuttings may be rooted in damp Sphagnum moss in a plastic bag or tank with high humidity and moderate light. They can begin to root in one to two months and start to form pitchers in about six months. <b>Tissue</b> <b>culture</b> is now used commercially and helps reduce collection of wild plants, as well as making many rare species available to hobbyists at reasonable prices. Nepenthes species are considered threatened or endangered plants and all of the are listed in CITES appendices 2, with the exception of N. rajah and N. khasiana which are listed in CITES appendix 1.|$|E
