5|$|During extratropical transition, the cyclone {{begins to}} tilt {{back into the}} colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's primary energy source {{converts}} from the release of latent heat from condensation (from thunderstorms near <b>the</b> <b>center)</b> <b>to</b> baroclinic processes. The low pressure system eventually loses its warm core and becomes a cold-core system.|$|E
5|$|The main backfield {{positions}} are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB). The quarterback {{is the leader}} of the offense. Either he or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.|$|E
5|$|A {{qualitative}} {{justification for}} this extrapolation of his method {{has been suggested}} by Valluri, Wilson and Harper. According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from <b>the</b> <b>center)</b> <b>to</b> be a smooth, continuous function of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that {{the force of gravity}} is an inverse-square law.|$|E

5|$|Amy neared {{hurricane}} intensity several times, {{beginning on}} June30 as maximum winds increased to 70mph (110km/h); however, {{the storm was}} unable to acquire enough tropical features, and remained predominately subtropical. Gale-force winds at this time extended roughly 125mi (210km) out from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> the north and east. Despite being subtropical at this point, the NHC decided against renaming it due to Amy's proximity to land. On July2, a barometric pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg) was recorded, the lowest in relation to Amy. The following day, another trough caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. On July4, Amy passed roughly 170mi (270km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland before becoming an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Despite being named, Rafael {{remained}} disorganized initially; {{this was}} the result of the interaction between an upper-level trough and the cyclone itself. Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated the center of Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity. Over the course of the next few days, however, the upper-level trough gradually weakened and backed westward, allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical storm. Wind shear lessened, allowing <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system. As it began to execute a turn towards the north under the influence of an upper-level trough to its west, a central dense overcast was noted on satellite imagery. Following a series of intensity estimates, Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600UTC on October15, while positioned about 650mi (1045km) south of Bermuda, although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight into the system.|$|E
5|$|Diane quickly {{weakened}} as {{a tropical}} storm over the mountainous terrain of central North Carolina. The associated area of precipitation expanded and spread away from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> the north and northeast. The weakening system turned {{to the north and}} recurved toward the northeast through Virginia after a ridge built in from the west. It did not interact much with the non-tropical westerlies, and as a result it remained a distinct tropical cyclone over land. Convection redeveloped as the storm approached the Atlantic coast once again. Diane passed through the Mid-Atlantic states, exiting New Jersey on August 19 into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City. Paralleling the southern coast of New England, the storm later accelerated east-northeastward, becoming extratropical on August 21. Passing south and east of Newfoundland, the remnants of Diane accelerated and restrengthened slightly while moving to the northeast. Late on August 23, the storm dissipated between Greenland and Iceland.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of August 16, a brief increase in wind shear due to a trough over the southeastern United States, caused <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> become exposed. Despite this, Claudette attained its peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) around this time. Around 1:10am EDT (0510UTC) on August 17, the storm made landfall near {{the eastern end of}} Santa Rosa Island with winds of 45mph (85km/h). Shortly thereafter, the barometric pressure decreased to 1005mbar (hPa; 29.68inHg), the lowest pressure recorded in associated with the storm. Several hours after landfall, convection associated with the storm quickly decreased and by 8:00am EDT, the NHC issued their final advisory on Claudette as it weakened to a tropical depression. At this time, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) began issuing advisories on the system. The HPC issued their final advisory late on August17 as the remnants of Claudette began to dissipate over Alabama. The remnants persisted for several more hours before becoming indistinguishable over Mississippi, on August 18.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to transfer M-108 in its entirety to the Village of Mackinaw City and Emmet County. In preparation for this transfer, MDOT repaved, widened and reconstructed the roadway.

Plans had this section to be completed, and <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the transfer to local control, M-108 ceased to be a state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway was too small to merit highway status under federal guidelines. The transfer was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of understanding to finalize the transfer. The section within the Village of Mackinaw City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to Emmet County.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> the ends of the tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E

Those that move south of 25°S are monitored by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. At the start of the season, a new naming policy was introduced by the Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South Pacific and South- East Indian Ocean. The policy stated that a storm attaining gale-force winds in only one quadrant near its center would be named by the Fiji Meteorological Service. This is in contrast to the previous policy in which gale-force winds had to completely surround <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> be named.|$|E
5|$|The {{conjugation}} of the {{new field}} colours, especially the use of green, was not traditional in the Portuguese national flag's composition and represented a radical republican-inspired change that broke the bond with the former monarchical flag. Since a failed republican insurrection on 31 January 1891, red and green had been established as the colours of the Portuguese Republican Party and its associated movements, whose political prominence kept growing until it reached a culmination period following the Republican revolution of 5 October 1910. In the ensuing decades, these colours were popularly propagandized as representing {{the hope of the}} nation (green) and the blood (red) of those who died defending it, as a means to endow them with a more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment. Although the flag flown from the Oporto city hall in the morning of 31 January 1891, symbol of the republican uprising was red and green.

5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the depression was embedded within a deep easterly steering current provided by a ridge to its north. Expected to track across sea surface temperatures greater than 82°F (28°C), the cyclone was forecast to gradually strengthen and within four days attain hurricane status; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the depression to reach Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale within three days. Increased northeasterly wind shear shifted <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> the northeastern edge of the deep convection, and despite the shear and its relatively low latitude of 9.7°N, the depression strengthened to attain tropical storm status early on September 3; upon reaching the intensity, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Storm Ivan.|$|E
5|$|Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hellen of March 2014 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} tropical cyclones in the Mozambique Channel on record, as well as the most intense of the 2013–14 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. It formed on March26 in the northern portion of the channel, and in its formative stages brought rainfall to coastal Mozambique. While moving southeastward, it developed an organized area of convection over the center. Warm waters allowed Hellen to rapidly intensify while passing south of the Comoros, with a well-defined eye forming in the middle of the thunderstorms. The cyclone attained peak intensity March30, with maximum sustained winds estimated 230km/h (145mph) according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, Météo-France in La Réunion. Subsequently, Hellen weakened quickly due to dry air and interaction with Madagascar, and the eye dissipated. On March31, the storm made landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a weakened cyclone, despite previous forecasts for <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> remain over water. By April1, Hellen was no longer a tropical cyclone after most of the convection dissipated. The remnants turned to the west, moving over Mozambique without redeveloping.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Beryl {{were from a}} trough that {{developed}} over the Yucatán Peninsula on May16. It drifted eastward into the northwestern Caribbean Sea, spawning a low pressure area on May18. For the next three days, it remained nearly stationary without development, until the system became better defined on May22 when it began moving to the northeast. On May23, the elongated low had an area of disorganized convection. While passing over the Cuban Island of Isla de la Juventud, an exposed center of circulation and transient convection was noted due {{to the effects of}} high wind shear across the region. The next day, the system moved through the Florida Keys, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the potential for increasingly favorable conditions over the next two days. The low became better defined as its cloud pattern consolidated. It moved further into the western Atlantic over the next 24 hours, and a band of convection extended across the Bahamas and Cuba to wrap around the southwestern edge of the circulation. On May25, the system interacted with a mid- to upper-level low, causing <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>to</b> reform further to the northeast. After the system attained gale-force winds near the center and sufficiently organized convection, the NHC initiated advisories on Subtropical Storm Beryl at 0300UTC on May26, while the cyclone was 305mi (490km) east of Charleston, South Carolina. Post-season analysis indicated that Beryl developed three hours prior.|$|E
