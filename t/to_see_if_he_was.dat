5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. Fanning decided to work independently and acted on direction he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of his inspiration was derived from a will <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> capable of recording a solo album, considering what he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law {{and let his}} party membership lapse. There had been speculation dating back to October 2002 that Dosanjh was interested in joining the Liberal Party of Canada. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> interested in running as a federal candidate but Dosanjh refused. In March 2004, with a federal election expected in the spring or summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to {{be a candidate for}} the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, union leader Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party's socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.|$|E

He had surgery on his foot and was waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in condition to play. He said that in Europe, he would only play for Modo Hockey, and in the NHL he would probably play for one of his former three clubs. On 25 February 2008, Forsberg signed a contract with the Colorado Avalanche {{for the rest of the}} 2007–08 season.|$|E

Merlo arrived in the Mexican capital with a fake Uruguayan passport, where he soon realized that the Mexican security forces were following him. He thought they were just doing basic surveillance on him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing any illegal activity in Mexican territory.|$|E

If neither move would place him closer to the player, the Minotaur skips his turn. Theseus may also skip his turn.|$|R

25|$|Although Smith-Dorrien was {{perfectly}} urbane and, {{by the standards}} of the day, kind-hearted towards his troops, he was notorious for furious outbursts of bad temper, which could last for hours before his equilibrium was restored. It has been suggested that the pain from a knee injury was one cause of his ill temper. It was rumoured that Smith-Dorrien’s temper was caused by some kind of serious illness. Esher (a royal courtier who exercised great influence over military appointments) had dined with Smith-Dorrien (28 January 1908) <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> indeed “changed and weakened”. Lord Crewe (letter to Seely 5 September 1913) turned him down for the post of Commander-in-Chief India because of his foul temper (A.J. Smithers, probably wrongly, blames French’s enmity for denying Smith-Dorrien the promotion).|$|E
25|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the season, MacLeod left the team to become the head coach at the University of Notre Dame. President David Checketts reached out to Pat Riley, who was working as a commentator for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> interested in returning to coaching. Riley accepted the Knicks proposition on May 31, 1991. Riley, who coached the Lakers to four NBA titles during the 1980s, implemented a rough and physical style emphasizing defense. Under Riley, the team, led by Ewing and guard John Starks, who scored 24 points per game and 13.9 points per game respectively, improved to a 51–31 record, tying them for first place in the Atlantic Division. After defeating the Pistons {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, the team faced the Bulls, losing the series 4–3 in seven games. The 1992–93 season proved to be even more successful, as the Knicks won the Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record. Before the season, the Knicks traded Mark Jackson to the Los Angeles Clippers for Charles Smith, Doc Rivers, and Bo Kimble while also acquiring Rolando Blackman from the Dallas Mavericks. After defeating the Indiana Pacers and Charlotte Hornets in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals, where once again they met the Bulls. After taking a two games-to-none lead, the Knicks lost the next four games.|$|E

In his high school years, N'Diaye, who stood [...] at the time, was considered one of the tallest to play at that level. He was also approached by the Guinness World Records to determine the authenticity of the claims.

500|$|Raich Carter {{once said}} of Frank Swift {{that he looked}} so big in goal that as a forward it often seemed that trying to score against him {{was like trying to}} put the ball into a matchbox. Swift's hands, which had a finger span of , were {{sufficiently}} large for him to easily pick up the ball with one hand, and gave rise to the nickname [...] "Frying Pan Hands". Swift kicked with his left foot as the result of an injury to his right foot sustained during his youth. However, where possible he preferred throwing the ball to the wing over kicking it downfield. When asked for advice to give to young goalkeepers, Swift replied that he drew diagrams of each goal scored against him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at fault.|$|E

Having revealed his true allegiance with Ōkubo, Saitō postpones the duel, and leaves to kill Shibumi and Arundo.|$|E

500|$|Sellers's final {{performances}} were {{a series of}} advertisements for Barclays Bank. Filmed in April 1980 in Ireland, he played Monty Casino, a Jewish con-man. Four adverts were scheduled, but only three were filmed as Sellers collapsed in Dublin, again with heart problems. After two days in care—and {{against the advice of}} his doctors—he travelled to the Cannes Film Festival, where Being There was in competition. Sellers was again ill in Cannes, returning to his residence in Gstaad to work on the script for his next project, Romance of the Pink Panther. He agreed to undergo an angiogram at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to undergo open-heart surgery.

The company is {{trying to use the}} books about the First People, including those that William Bell had sought, that they have collected to understand the workings of the device. They are aware that before her departure, Fauxlivia (Anna Torv)—Olivia's parallel universe doppelgänger—stole one component of the unit, possibly its power source as they cannot find any other way to engage the device. However, as Peter (Joshua Jackson) nears it, the device reacts, moving into a new configuration and sending out electromagnetic pulses, while Peter suddenly has a nosebleed. Peter returns with Olivia (Torv) and Walter (John Noble) to Massive Dynamic to undergo some tests <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the cause for the device's activation. Meanwhile, Broyles (Lance Reddick) asks Astrid (Jasika Nicole) to discreetly review the files pulled from Fauxlivia's computer for any hidden messages, not wishing to have Olivia or Peter be forced to learn of what Fauxlivia wrote about them.|$|E
