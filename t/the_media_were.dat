News of the attack made front pages throughout the world, including The Times of London, The New York Times, and the Montreal Gazette. In some newspapers, the news took precedence over the 'Dambuster' raids performed in Europe by No. 617 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964.

An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E

5|$|Wembley bosses were {{in dispute}} with {{newsreel}} companies over the broadcast {{rights for the}} 1936 final. Gaumont British Film Company initially had offered £900 to film inside the ground, but this was refused by the authorities who wanted a sum of £1,500. They later backed down {{and said that they}} would accept the initial offer, but the film company was now only willing to pay £500. A solution could not be reached, and <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>were</b> banned from inside of the stadium. To get around the ban and be able to report on the match, a number of autogyros were hired to fly the reporters over the stadium giving them a birds–eye view of the match, with the only filming inside Wembley conducted by the official stadium cameraman. Autogyros had been used to film the final in 1935, and also by the Metropolitan police for crowd control.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{understanding}} of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>were</b> again highly critical of the park service and their policies.|$|E

40|$|In {{the age of}} information, {{with the}} {{development}} of new technologies, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> playing more significant roles in political and economic activities in societies.

40|$|Abstract This project {{examines}} {{the power of}} <b>the</b> <b>media</b> during <b>the</b> Danish election at 2011. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> has <b>been</b> through a big development over the last 20 years. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> now seen as the fourth power of <b>the</b> state. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> setting <b>the</b> political agenda and we will examinate how this power can affect our votes during an election. The choice of methods we used is semi-structured interviews and a quantitative survey “Danske Medie” has made. The theories there {{are being used to}} explain this is; Stig Hjarvard, he <b>is</b> describing <b>the</b> <b>media</b> mediatization. In addition, we have Michel Foucault who has a theory about power. The power lies in how <b>the</b> <b>media</b> can influence voters to have certain attitudes about politics. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> have <b>the</b> power to control what they think is importance and want to send out to the voters. The politicians have no influence on how <b>the</b> <b>media</b> chooses to cover the election campaign. We have in this project been trying to find out whether or not, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>is</b> weakening <b>the</b> Danish democracy and if it in fact <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> that has <b>the</b> power? If <b>the</b> <b>media</b> has <b>the</b> power, how does it affect the relation between <b>the</b> <b>media</b> and <b>the</b> voters during the democratic elections? This will be discussed, to see if the hypothesis we have about <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> one with the main holds...|$|R
