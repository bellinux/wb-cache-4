5|$|Eventually, {{following}} {{the resumption of}} shuttle flights in 1988, the launch of <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> was scheduled for 1990. On April 24, 1990, shuttle mission STS-31 saw Discovery launch <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> successfully into its planned orbit.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> {{needed a}} new drive wheel, {{as one of the}} 64 {{original}} wheels had cracked; in 2008 another new steel tyre was needed after a second wheel cracked. These are the only two wheel changes needed since <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> started operation in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> was {{originally}} completed, Lovell and Husband started contemplating {{the idea of}} upgrading <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> so {{that it had a}} more accurate surface, and was controlled by a digital computer. Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967. <b>The</b> <b>telescope</b> was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, and Husband had been warning about the decay of <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> since 1963. The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> working; if tey had not been put right, then the elevation system could have failed and perhaps jammed. <b>The</b> <b>telescope</b> was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the £400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.|$|E
50|$|The EPTA uses five European <b>telescopes.</b> These are <b>the</b> Westerbork Synthesis Radio <b>Telescope,</b> <b>the</b> Effelsberg Radio <b>Telescope,</b> <b>the</b> Lovell <b>Telescope,</b> <b>the</b> Nançay Radio <b>Telescope</b> and <b>the</b> Sardinia Radio <b>Telescope.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{observatory}} is {{no longer}} used for research purposes, though <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> is still used as a teaching tool in the university's astronomy classes.

5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> and instruments {{were to be}} housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of <b>the</b> <b>telescope.</b> A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell in which <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> into space.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>telescope</b> also {{tracked the}} Soviet moon probes, {{including}} Lunik II from 13 to 14 September 1959 as {{it hit the}} moon; this was proven by <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> by measuring {{the effect of the}} moon's gravity on the probe,Piper, Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 42Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, pp. 269–271 and Luna 3 around 4 October 1959.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 271 Also, <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> tracked Luna 9 in February 1966, the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon. <b>The</b> <b>telescope</b> listened in on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press – the probe transmitted, likely intentionally to increase chances of reception, in the international format for image transmission by newswire – and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} this {{proposed}} mission ended in 2007 with no further activities planned. To produce an image, <b>the</b> <b>telescopes</b> {{would have had to}} operate in formation with distances between <b>the</b> <b>telescopes</b> controlled to within a few micrometres, and the distance between <b>the</b> <b>telescopes</b> and receiver controlled to within about one nanometre. Several more detailed studies would have been needed to determine whether technology capable of such precision is actually feasible.|$|R

By the end of July the dish surface was completed, and first light was on 2 August 1957; <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> did a drift scan across the Milky Way at 160MHz, with the bowl at the zenith. <b>The</b> <b>telescope</b> was first {{controlled}} from the control room on 9 October 1957, by a purpose-built analogue computer.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>telescope</b> {{possibly}} detected {{signals from}} Venera 1, a Russian satellite {{en route to}} Venus, in 19–20 May 1961.

5|$|There {{were large}} cost overruns with the telescope's construction, mainly {{due to the}} steeply rising cost of steel at the time <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> was constructed. The {{original}} grant for the telescope's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased {{its share of the}} funding several times as the cost of <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> rose; other money came from private donations. The final part of the debt from the construction of <b>the</b> <b>telescope,</b> £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly due to the telescope's early, very public role in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories. The final total cost for <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> was £700,000.|$|E

A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> {{observed}} the coordinates {{of the recently}} discovered pulsar, confirming its existence and investigating the dispersion measure.

This marked the start of a substantial amount of work investigating pulsars at Jodrell, which is still ongoing. In the 30 years following the discovery of pulsars, <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> discovered over 100 new pulsars (and astronomers at Jodrell Bank discovered around 2/3 of the total number using the Lovell and other telescopes). 300 pulsars are regularly observed using either the Lovell, or a nearby 42-foot (13-m) dish.|$|E
50|$|The 2012 National Reconnaissance Office space {{telescope}} donation to NASA was the declassification and donation to NASA of two identical space <b>telescopes</b> by <b>the</b> United States National Reconnaissance Office.

5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. <b>The</b> <b>telescope</b> turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> {{was used}} to observe the {{ionisation}} in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors. Shortly after this, <b>the</b> <b>telescope</b> {{was used to}} determine the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. <b>The</b> <b>telescope,</b> as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E
