40|$|Vertical cracks {{near the}} midspan of large-sized {{prestressed}} concrete bridge girders may develop during the curing process and can extend through {{the depth of}} the girder. The cracking is attributed to restrained shrinkage and thermal effects prior to release of the prestressing strands. Eighteen full-scale Mn/DOT Type 28 M prestressed concrete beams were tested to investigate the effects of the cracks on the performance of <b>the</b> <b>beams.</b> Thirteen beams tested in this study incorporated manmade pre-release cracks. All of <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> were tested under static loading to investigate the effects of pre-release cracks on concrete strains, flexural crack initiation and re-opening loads, overall beam stiffness, and ultimate flexural capacity. Three of <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> were subjected to cyclic testing to evaluate possible effects of the pre-release cracks on the strand stress ranges and fatigue life of <b>the</b> <b>beams.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> field observations, the pre-release cracks in <b>the</b> test <b>beams</b> did not close completely under <b>the</b> <b>beam's</b> weight and pre-stressing force. The pre-release cracks were found to cause changes in <b>beam</b> strains around <b>the</b> crack locations.

25|$|A general {{limitation}} to the spatial {{resolution of this}} method is given by the blurring in the analyzer crystal which arises from dynamical refraction, i.e. the angular deviation of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> due to the refraction in the sample is amplified about ten thousand times in the crystal, because <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> path within the crystal depends strongly on its incident angle. This effect can be reduced by thinning down the analyzer crystal, e.g. with an analyzer thickness of 40 m a resolution of about 6 m was calculated.

Since <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> strikes the ground at a point closer to the aircraft when it is pointed straight down, the returns during this period are closest to the zero ring.
