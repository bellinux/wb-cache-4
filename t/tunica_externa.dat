50|$|For example, the {{connective}} tissue that surrounds an artery {{is called the}} <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> because it is considered extraneous to the artery.|$|E
5000|$|Adventitia is the {{outermost}} connective tissue covering of an organ, vessel, or other structure. [...] It is {{also called the}} tunica adventitia or the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tunica {{media is}} made up of smooth muscle cells and elastic tissue. It lies between the tunica intima on the inside and the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> on the outside.|$|E
50|$|The tunicae {{of blood}} vessels are three layers: an inner, middle, and outer layer that are called, respectively, the tunica intima, the tunica media, and the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> (or tunica adventitia).|$|E
5000|$|The {{tunica media}} (New Latin [...] "middle coat"), or media for short, {{is the middle}} tunica (layer) of an artery or vein. It lies between the tunica intima {{on the inside and}} the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> on the outside.|$|E
50|$|The aorta is {{an elastic}} artery, {{and as such}} is quite distensible. The aorta {{consists}} of a heterogeneous mixture of smooth muscle, nerves, intimal cells, endothelial cells, fibroblast-like cells, and a complex extracellular matrix. The vascular wall consists of several layers known as the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa,</b> tunica media, and tunica intima. The thickness of the aorta requires an extensive network of tiny blood vessels called vasa vasorum, which feed the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> and tunica media outer layers of the aorta. The aortic arch contains baroreceptors and chemoreceptors that relay information concerning blood pressure and blood pH and carbon dioxide levels to the medulla oblongata of the brain. This information is processed by the brain and the autonomic nervous system mediates the homeostatic responses.|$|E
50|$|A common {{pathological}} disorder {{concerning the}} <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> is scurvy, {{also known as}} vitamin C deficiency. Scurvy occurs because vitamin C {{is essential for the}} synthesis of collagen, and without it, the faulty collagen cannot maintain the vein walls and rupture, leading to a multitude of problems.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> (New Latin [...] "outer coat"), {{also known}} as the tunica {{adventitia}} (New Latin [...] "additional coat")(or adventitia for short), is the outermost tunica (layer) of a blood vessel, surrounding the tunica media. It is mainly composed of collagen and, in arteries, is supported by external elastic lamina. The collagen serves to anchor the blood vessel to nearby organs, giving it stability.|$|E
50|$|Microscopically, veins have a thick {{outer layer}} made of {{connective}} tissue, called the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> or tunica adventitia. There is a middle layer of bands of smooth muscle called tunica media, which are, in general, much thinner {{than those of}} arteries, as veins do not function primarily in a contractile manner and {{are not subject to}} the high pressures of systole, as arteries are. The interior is lined with endothelial cells called tunica intima. The precise location of veins varies much more from person to person than that of arteries.|$|E
50|$|This fibrous {{connective}} tissue interpenetrates and surrounds the muscles, bones, nerves and blood vessels of the body. It provides connection and communication {{in the form of}} aponeuroses, ligaments, tendons, retinacula, joint capsules, and septa. The deep fasciae envelop all bone (periosteum and endosteum); cartilage (perichondrium), and blood vessels (<b>tunica</b> <b>externa)</b> and become specialized in muscles (epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium) and nerves (epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium). The high density of collagen fibers is what gives the deep fascia its strength and integrity. The amount of elastin fiber determines how much extensibility and resilience it will have.|$|E
50|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} an artery (or vein) {{is known as}} the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa,</b> also known as tunica adventitia, and is composed of connective tissue made up of collagen fibers. Inside this layer is the tunica media, or media, which is made up of smooth muscle cells and elastic tissue (also called connective tissue proper). The innermost layer, which is in direct contact with the flow of blood, is the tunica intima, commonly called the intima. This layer is mainly made up of endothelial cells. The hollow internal cavity in which the blood flows is called the lumen.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{incidence of}} a Weberian apparatus {{is from the}} fossil fish Santanichthys diasii dating from the Early Cretaceous of Northeastern Brazil. In the aforementioned taxon, the Weberian apparatus is fairly developed; there is a distinguishable intercalarium and a tripus which articulate with {{the second and third}} vertebrae respectively. A scaphium can be seen in at least two specimens. The neural arch of the third vertebra has already broadened, almost similar to that of modern ostariophysans. The claustrum, an element in modern apparati, is noticeably absent from the Weberian apparatus of S. diasii. Only the first four vertebrae are involved in the Weberian apparatus of Santanichthys; There are no signs of involvement from the elements of the fifth vertebra unlike in modern otophysans. An important feature within the formation of the Weberian apparatus, which is a synapomorphy of the Otocephala, is the attachment of the anterior Pleural cavity(rib) to the Swim bladder. Another crucial feature is the anterior otophysic diverticula of the swim bladder and contacting the inner ear, seen in extant Clupeiformes. There is also a relationship between the interossicular ligament and the swim bladder that it originated from the swim bladder diverticulum. This was shown by comparing the fiber of the ligament and the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> of the swim bladder that have the same histological composition of elastin and icthyocoll (a specific type I collagen).|$|E

40|$|During a {{study of}} myxosporean parasites of {{cultivated}} freshwater fish, a new myxosporean species, Henneguya pellucida n. sp., was discovered. Of the 120 Piaractus mesopotamicus sampled, only 10 specimens (8. 3 %) were infected. Yellow, round plasmodia measuring 0. 5 - 3 mm {{were found in the}} serous membrane of the visceral cavity and in the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> of the swim bladder. Sporogenesis was asynchronous, with the earliest developmental stages aligned prevailingly along the endoplasmic periphery and mature spores in the central zone.

The polar capsules were elongated (length: 4. 0 ± 0. 4 μm; width: 1. 6 ± 0. 2 μm). The development of the parasite in the swim bladder produced thickening of the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> and a granulomatous reaction.

40|$|Anatomical and {{histological}} {{observations were}} made on the gas bladder of the soft-rayed marine salmonoid fish Argentina situs, which usually lives at depths of about 200 m. The gas bladder is completely closed but rather unlike other known types of closed gas bladders. It is composed of three tissue layers, which may conveniently be called mucosa, submucosa, and <b>tunica</b> <b>externa.</b> The latter contains {{a large amount of}} guanine. The <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> is penetrated by numerous blood-vessels, which form, a widely distributed rete mirabile of a peculiar 'bi-dimensional ' type in the submucosa. All vessels reaching the mucosa seem to come from this rete system, and no special 'resorbent mucosa 1 such as occurs in euphysoclistae could be identified. The mucosa is folded, forming an alveolar-like structure of unknown function. The gas gland layer is separated from the lumen of the bladder by smooth muscles and an inner epithelium. The close anatomical association of the gas gland tissue with smooth muscles probably is of importance for gas secretion. Analyses of gases from specimens taken from a depth of about 80 m showed a mean oxygen value of almost 80 %, which indicates a similar gas secretory mechanism to that in euphysoclistae. Certain aspects of the physiology of the gas bladder in relation to life in deep water are shortly discussed, and the need for a thorough histological examination of the gas bladder in deep-water salmonids is emphasized. ...|$|E
40|$|Ovaries {{up to the}} 8 th day pupae of Dermatobia hominis {{were studied}} by {{transmission}} electron microscopy. Ovarioles were recognized in ovaries of 4 -day old pre-pupae, surrounded by a thin tunica propria of acellular fibrilar material similar in structure to the internal portion of the external tunica of the ovary. There is continuity of the tunica propria and the ovarian tunica, indicating that the former structure originates from the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa.</b> In 5 to 7 -day pupae the interstitial somatic cells from the apical region of the ovary, close to the ovarioles, show delicate filamentous material inside of their rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae; similar material is seem among these cells.

40|$|The {{permeability}} of the swimbladder to gas {{was measured}} as the conductance to oxygen in seven species of fish. The low over-all conductance {{resides in the}} low diffusion constant, K, of the middle layer of the wall (submucosa) while the outer and inner layers (<b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> and mucosa) have diffusion constants similar to other vertebrate tissues. The low diffusion constant {{is due to a}} low diffusion coefficient, D (not to a low-solubility coefficient), apparently caused by multiple layers of very thin (about 0 - 02 /im) and broad (up to 100 /im) crystals, clearly identifiable in electron micrographs, and presumably consisting of guanine. Crystals occupy {{only a small fraction of}} tissue volume. They are flexible as a consequence of their extreme thinness, and subject to being elaborately folded when the mucosa and submucosa of the secretory part of the swim-bladder is contracted during reabsorption of gas. The low conductance of the swimbladder wall reduces the metabolic energy needed to maintain swimbladder volume...|$|E
40|$|Overfished {{species of}} rockfish, Sebastes spp., from the Northeast Pacific {{experience}} high bycatch mortality because of ‘barotrauma’, a condition induced from the rapid change in pressure during capture. Field experiments {{show that it}} may be possible for rockfish to recover from barotrauma if quickly recompressed; however, no work has followed the physiological recovery of rockfish after recompression or determined whether it is possible for rockfish to survive barotrauma in the long term. Barotrauma was induced in adult black rockfish, Sebastes melanops Girard, from a simulated depth of 35 m, followed by recompression. Blood and selected tissues (eye, heart ventricle, head kidney, liver, rete mirabile and gonad) were sampled at days 3, 15 and 31 post-recompression to evaluate the tissue- and physiologic-level response during recovery. No mortality from barotrauma occurred during the experiments, and feeding resumed in 80 % of both treatment and control fish. The primary injury in treatment fish was the presence of a ruptured swimbladder and/or a ruptured <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> (outer layer of swimbladder), which was slow to heal. Blood plasma was analysed for glucose, sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, insulin-like growth factor- 1 and cortisol. Plasma analyses indicated no strong effects because of barotrauma, suggesting overall handling stress outweighed any effect from barotrauma. Rockfish with ruptured swimbladders may face compromised competency in the wild; however, it appears the majority of black rockfish decompressed from 35 m have a high potential for recovery if recompressed immediately after capture. This research suggests recompression could be a valuable bycatch mortality reduction tool for rockfish in recreational fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract__ Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the leading}} cause of death in the western world and their prevalence is rising. Currently CVD account for approximately one out of every five lives (Roger et al., 2011). The primary cause of CVD is atherosclerosis, a disease of the vessel wall. In Figure 1. 1 the structure of an arterial vessel is shown schematically. Looking outwards from the center of the vessel it consists of the following parts: • lumen - this is the central area of the vessel where the blood flows through • tunica intima - this layer is composed of a thin sheet of endothelial cells surrounded by a thin elastic layer • tunica media - this is a layer of smooth muscle cells • tunica adventitia - also called <b>tunica</b> <b>externa.</b> This is the outside part of the artery which is made up of an elastic sheet surrounded by collagen Atherosclerosis causes thickening of the vesselwall due to the accumulation of fatty materials such as cholesterol between the tunica intima and the tunica media. These areas with fatty materials are called plaques. If the vessel wall thickens, the lumen area may get narrower (stenosis) and the blood flow through the vessel may become compromised. Eventually this thickening of the wall can lead to a total occlusion of the vessel. Stenosis of the artery affects the blood and oxygen supply to the distal organs. In the case of the carotid artery, which is the vessel studied in this thesis, this is the brain. Decreased blood supply to the brain can have fatal consequences...|$|E
40|$|The gross {{morphology}} {{of the gas}} bladder {{is described}} and illustrated for representatives of most species and all valid genera of the Auchenipteridae (Siluriformes). Although, a simple cordiform gas bladder is present in some species of the family, others are characterized by their distinctive gas-bladder shape and diverticula disposition. An acute posterior end of the gas bladder characterizes Centromochlus heckelii and C. macracanthus, and is variably present in specimens of Auchenipterus. Tocantinsia piresi and Asterophysus batrachus have distinctive gas bladders differing in number of diverticula (two or many). The two species of Trachycorystes are diagnosed based on their gas bladder morphology: T. menezesi has a simple cordiform bladder, whereas T. trachycorystes has a pair of lateral diverticulum and, usually, a well-developed terminal diverticulum. Species of Auchenipterichthys are characterized by having a secondary bladder with simple chamber. Short or elongate and divergent terminal diverticula are exclusive to most cis-andine species of Trachelyopterus. Tetranematichthys and trans-andine species of Trachelyopterus share a well-developed secondary chamber or terminal diverticula ventrally or dorsally connected to the posterior chambers. The small-sized species of Ageneiosus have well-developed gas bladders {{with a pair of}} posterior diverticula, whereas large-sized species have a reduced gas bladder with <b>tunica</b> <b>externa</b> varying from non-, partially, or completely ossified. Eight phylogenetic characters are proposed based on the morphology of the gas bladder and associated structures in species of Auchenipteridae, and the evolution of those characters in the family discussed.

40|$|Porcine {{models have}} become {{increasingly}} popular in cardiovascular research, because physiological and anatomical features of the cardiovascular system from pigs including the coronary vascular system and the coronary collateral vessels are comparable to humans. The standard farm pig rapidly increases in body weight and size, potentially confounding serial measurements of cardiac function and morphology. In contrast Göttingen® minipigs have a characteristic growth curve that avoids the dramatic increase in weight in adulthood seen in farm pigs. The Göttingen® minipig is especially suitable for long-term studies because of its inherent small size and ease of handling, even at full maturity, which is reached at 2 y of age compared with 3 y for domestic pigs. However, {{there is still a}} need on detailed information about the macro- and microvascular characteristics of the vascular system from the Göttingen® minipigs. The study was aimed to describe the macro- and microvascular characteristics of adult Göttingen® minipigs (n= 18) by use of CT-imaging and histology over a time period of 4 months starting from 16 months of age up to 20 months. The animals showed no clinical symptoms of disease and were kept in-house at a light/dark rhythm of 12 : 12 under defined climatic conditions. The experiments were licensed by the regional authorities for health and social affairs (LaGeSo), Berlin. The study included the measurement of the length and of the luminal diameter of arteries and veins from the neck, thorax, abdomen, and limbs which are frequently used in experiments with pigs. In addition microscopical and histological parameters (luminal vessel diameter, thickness of the <b>tunica</b> <b>externa,</b> tunica media, and tunica interna) were studied on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of the blood vessel...|$|E
