5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie {{would give}} him a global brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his way onto the ship, many in the crowd at the dock reached out <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him.</b> Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to give the impression of a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} game, the Xbox {{exclusive}} Halo 4, Cortana wakes the Chief when forces from an Ex-Covenant splinter faction attack {{the remains of}} the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn, then crashes with him on Requiem. Over the course of the game, Cortana begins showing strange signs and behavior: vocal and graphic glitches, irrational behavior and a tendency to become irritable or angered. Their cause is soon revealed: Cortana's operation beyond her seven-year lifespan and her interaction with the Halo installations and the Flood have caused her to become Rampant, a state of over-knowledge that makes AIs 'think' themselves to death. Helped by the Master Chief and kept safe from the captain of the Infinity, who wishes to delete her, she helps in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner who hates humans, and stops his scheme to convert all of humanity into his mechanical Promethean army using the Composer. In doing so, she has to fragment her various rampant personalities and upload them into the system, which first brings down the shields around the central core, then enables her to save Master Chief from the Didact. In a final act of love, she shields the Master Chief when he destroys the Composer, then, using the last of her energy to manifest as a solid hologram, she bids a final farewell to the Chief, managing <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him</b> for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him.</b> The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

25|$|Tongan {{males were}} often heavily tattooed. In Captain Cook's time only the Tui Tonga (king) was not: {{because he was}} too high ranked for anybody <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him.</b> Later it became the habit that a young Tui Tonga went to Samoa to be tattooed there.|$|E

25|$|After leaving Hogwarts, Snape {{became a}} Death Eater and {{informed}} Voldemort of half of an overheard prophecy, which Voldemort takes {{to refer to}} Lily and her son, Harry. Fearing for Lily's life, Snape joins the Order as a spy for Dumbledore, in exchange for what he hopes will be Dumbledore's protection of Lily. Voldemort offered Lily the chance to step aside before he killed Harry because of Snape's request to spare Lily's life, but Lily refused and Voldemort killed her. The result of her selfless act of love manifested itself two ways: when Voldemort attempted to kill Harry with the Killing Curse the spell backfired, rendering Voldemort non-corporeal. The lingering protection afforded to Harry by Lily's sacrifice rendered Voldemort unable <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him</b> physically. The second way in which Harry is protected by Lily's sacrifice occurs when Petunia takes Harry in. Dumbledore told Harry that he had extended Lily's protection to Privet Drive, because Lily and Petunia are related by blood. This protection ends when Harry comes of age at 17.|$|E

Something on which his right hand seemed to have been resting clattered on to the carpet. Nigel turned around and waved Maggie back.|$|R
500|$|The 1968 {{presidential primary}} {{elections}} in California were held on Tuesday, June 4. The statewide results gave Kennedy 46% and McCarthy 42%. [...] Four {{hours after the}} polls closed in California, Kennedy claimed victory in the state's Democratic presidential primary. He spoke by phone with South Dakota Senator George McGovern. At approximately 12:10a.m. PDT on , he addressed his campaign supporters in the Ambassador Hotel's Embassy Room ballroom, in the Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles. At the time, the government provided Secret Service protection for incumbent presidents but not for presidential candidates. Kennedy's only security was provided by former FBI agent William Barry and two unofficial bodyguards, former professional athletes. During the campaign, Kennedy had welcomed contact with the public, and people had often tried <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him</b> in their excitement.|$|E
500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how she would feel if she were <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him</b> for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and I guess I should try/ to do what I should do/ but I could fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
500|$|Nicoletta Browne of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews {{described}} it as a [...] "vignette of bittersweet nostalgia", praising the anime for being a [...] "gorgeously detailed piece with beautiful animation." [...] Browne also wrote favorably of the story's progression, noting that its dark undertones grew heavier as the main character matured, and that the consistent characterization of Hotaru from childhood to her early teens was impressive, especially given the film's length. [...] Browne's criticisms were limited to noting the film's short length, a clash between the cartoonish depictions of the forest spirits {{and the rest of the}} movie, and an issue with one element of plot development near the end of the film. [...] She did note that sensitive viewers may interpret some aspects of the story as inappropriate, such as the initial age difference between the main characters and the way Gin punishes Hotaru as a child when she tries <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him.</b> [...] In the case of the former, Browne noted that their romance developed only when Hotaru began to approach Gin's physical age, and with the latter, she noted that no harm was intended. [...] In both cases, she also mentioned that cultural differences must be considered.|$|E

500|$|Pelé {{is one of}} {{the most}} lauded players in history and is {{frequently}} ranked the best player ever. Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated; [...] "Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic." [...] Brazil's 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined; [...] "His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game." [...] Tostão, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup; [...] "Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé." [...] His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed; [...] "In some countries they wanted <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him,</b> in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful." [...] Former Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Puskás stated; [...] "The greatest player in history was Di Stefano. I refuse to classify Pelé as a player. He was above that." ...|$|E

Christian author Eva Marie Everson compared the image to [...] "Madonna doing her own impersonation of Marilyn Monroe." [...] Spears and her boyfriend (played by Stephen Dorff) are arriving to the hotel inside a limousine. They sit apart from each other, staring out separate windows. Spears wears a Birmingham Barons cap in these scenes. The boyfriend is talking on his cell phone, and when she attempts <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him,</b> he pushes her away. The entrance is full of fans and paparazzi taking pictures. When they leave the car, fans and paparazzi alike act in an extreme way and fights break in the crowd. While her bodyguards try to protect her, her boyfriend throws magazines at the paparazzi. Stephanie Zacharek of The New York Times compared the shots of the paparazzi with the Jews in the 2004 film The Passion of the Christ. During this scene, she gets hit {{in the head with a}} camera, and unknowingly gets a wound on her head, but keeps walking.|$|E
500|$|Kỳ claimed Thi {{was leaving}} the country to receive medical {{treatment}} for his nasal passages, {{as well as a}} general health examination. An official announcement said that the junta [...] "had considered and accepted General Thi's application for a vacation". Thi retorted that [...] "The only sinus condition I have is from the stink of corruption." [...] With the health story exposed as a sham, Kỳ gave a series of reasons for dismissing Thi, accusing him of being too left-wing, ruling I Corps like a warlord, having a mistress who was suspected of being a communist, and being too conspiratorial. Kỳ knew that Thi supported negotiations with the communists as a means of ending the war, and had a history of consistently removing officials and military figures who promoted such a policy, but did not publicly mention this as a reason. Thi's dismissal provoked the Buddhist Uprising, led by the [...] "Struggle Movement". Thi was immensely popular in the Buddhist stronghold of Huế, a city of approximately 120,000, and civil unrest erupted throughout the region. When he returned to the former imperial capital five days after being relieved of his command, around 20,000 supporters mobbed him, shouting and trying <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him.</b> This was part of a gamble by Kỳ to allow Thi back to his home city in an attempt to placate the dismayed locals, but it did not work. A general strike incapacited 90% of Da Nang, the second biggest city in South Vietnam and the main port in central Vietnam.|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Kindt {{received}} a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin. He became the starter at right halfback in his first year, while fellow freshman Clarence Self started at left halfback. In the season opener against Camp Grant, Kindt scored his first career touchdown on a six-yard run in the fourth quarter, which tied the game 7–7. Wisconsin went on to lose the game 10–7 after Camp Grant scored a field goal with five seconds left. In his third game, Kindt became a [...] "hero of the game" [...] for his playing tactics against the Iowa Hawkeyes. He scored the only touchdown of the game, a two-yard run, and managed to force the Hawkeyes to score a safety with time expiring when he did a quarterback kneel, and purposely fell down in the end zone, getting an Iowa defender <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him</b> for the safety. It prevented the Hawkeyes from potentially scoring a game-winning score as the Badgers won the game 7–5. Wisconsin temporarily managed to be in {{first place in the}} Big Ten conference play standings, though it was the lone highlight of the season for the Badgers, as they lost all their remaining games, mostly by blowouts and finished with a 1–9 record. [...] After his first three games Kindt was impressing Wisconsin's coaches with his [...] "ball carrying and defensive abilities", while scoring two of Wisconsin's three touchdowns so far for the season. In the next game against the University of Illinois, head coach Harry Stuhldreher named Kindt as the captain of the team. [...] He missed the next two games due to a leg infection suffered prior to a game against the University of Notre Dame. He returned for the homecoming game against Northwestern University, where he played a [...] "couple of minutes" [...] as he was still recovering from his injury. He came back to full form against the University of Michigan. Overall, Kindt scored four of Wisconsin's six touchdowns of the season.|$|E

Depicting the moment when the risen Christ tells Mary Magdalene not <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him,</b> Holbein adheres to the details of the bible story.

[...] On a second date, Moore allegedly [...] "took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes...touched her over her bra and underpants...and guided her hand <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him</b> over his underwear." [...] Three other women came forward to say that Moore, in his 30s, pursued relationships with them when they were 16 to 18 years old, with 16 being the legal age of consent in Alabama. These three women said that Moore did not force them into having a relationship or non-consensual sexual contact. [...] Moore has denied these allegations, calling them [...] "completely false" [...] and [...] "a desperate political attack by the National Democratic Party and The Washington Post." ...|$|E

[...] Johnny Depp once said one of main reasons of why he starred in Nick of Time was him wanting to work with Walken. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell, Bradley Cooper, Leonardo DiCaprio are among actors who spoke about their admiration for Walken. Prominent movie critic Roger Ebert was particularly impressed by his villain and anti-hero portrayals, once stated [...] "when he is given the right role, there is nobody <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him</b> for his chilling ability to move between easy charm and pure evil" [...] and called him [...] "one of the few undeniably charismatic male villains." ...|$|E

[...] Golaud bursts in with blood on his forehead — he claims it was caused by a thorn hedge. When Mélisande tries to wipe the blood away, he angrily orders her not <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>him</b> and demands his sword. He says that another peasant has died of starvation. Golaud notices Mélisande is trembling and tells her {{he is not going to}} kill her with the sword. He mocks the [...] "great innocence" [...] Arkel says he sees in Mélisande's eyes. He commands her to close them or [...] "I will shut them for a long time." [...] He tells Mélisande that she disgusts him and drags her around the room by her hair.

Thi told the large crowd [...] "Think about our country, not about me". He told a journalist that he would accept [...] "any position which is useful for the country", leading some to think that he wanted Kỳ or Thiệu's job. According to Time magazine, Thi's speeches showed that he [...] "was obviously torn between a desire to rally support for a comeback and his soldier's distaste for adding to dissension". Thi's speech was followed by presentations by student and Buddhist leaders, who called for the removal of Thiệu and Defense Minister Nguyễn Hữu Có. Both were Catholic generals notorious known for their rampant corruption. However, despite the large-scale demonstrations and support for Thi, there had been no clashes or strong tensions at the time.
