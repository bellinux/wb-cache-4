25|$|The great {{advantage}} {{of this approach is}} the efficiency and low cost involved in settling large volumes of trades. The inconvenience is that the issuing corporation no longer knows who its owners are, since its <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> has all the immobilized shares recorded as the owner being Cede & Co. For purposes of sending proxy notices and other communications with beneficial owners, the <b>transfer</b> <b>agent,</b> acting on a request of the issuing corporation, sends an inquiry to DTCC, which in turn sends inquiries to its members and so on down the chain.|$|E

PNC Global Investment Servicing serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. In 2007, PNC Global Investment Servicing Trustee & Custodial Services Limited was awarded a banking licence by financial regulators allowing it to expand further into Europe. As a result, the name changed to PNC Global Investment Servicing. PNC Global Investment Servicing was formally known as PFPC until July 2008.|$|E
25|$|Supercritical {{hydrolysis}} is {{a method}} of converting all biomass polysaccharides as well the associated lignin into low molecular compounds by contacting with water alone under supercritical conditions. The supercritical water, acts as a solvent, a supplier of bond-breaking thermal energy, a heat <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> and {{as a source of}} hydrogen atoms. All polysaccharides are converted into simple sugars in near-quantitative yield in a second or less. The aliphatic inter-ring linkages of lignin are also readily cleaved into free radicals that are stabilized by hydrogen originating from the water. The aromatic rings of the lignin are unaffected under short reaction times so that the lignin-derived products are low molecular weight mixed phenols. To take advantage of the very short reaction times needed for cleavage a continuous reaction system must be devised. The amount of water heated to a supercritical state is thereby minimized.|$|E

Working alongside Joy at Berkeley were undergraduates William Jolitz (BS 1997) and his future wife Lynne Jolitz (BA 1989), who together created 386BSD, a version of BSD Unix that runs on Intel CPUs and evolved into the BSD family of free operating systems and the Darwin operating system underlying Apple Mac OS X.

25|$|Reversible addition-fragmentation chain {{transfer}} or RAFT polymerization {{is one of}} several kinds of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization. It makes use of a chain <b>transfer</b> <b>agent</b> {{in the form of a}} thiocarbonylthio compound (or similar, from here on referred to as a RAFT agent, see Figure 1) to afford control over the generated molecular weight and polydispersity during a free-radical polymerization. Discovered at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) of Australia in 1998, RAFT polymerization {{is one of several}} living or controlled radical polymerization techniques, others being atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), etc. RAFT polymerization uses thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, thiocarbamates, and xanthates, to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. As with other controlled radical polymerization techniques, RAFT polymerizations can be performed with conditions to favor low dispersity (molecular weight distribution) and a pre-chosen molecular weight. RAFT polymerization can be used to design polymers of complex architectures, such as linear block copolymers, comb-like, star, brush polymers, dendrimers and cross-linked networks.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "One in eight Americans are entitled to unclaimed and abandoned assets, according to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators. These unclaimed and abandoned assets include savings and checking accounts, securities, paychecks, insurance settlements, and utility and rental deposits. Most of this money is unclaimed because the owner moved and simply forgot about the account, changed his or her name, or died. After a period of dormancy, the funds are turned over to state unclaimed property offices. To protect investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a rule in 1997 requiring <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> to search for lost security holders, maintain written procedures for searching for lost security holders, and annually report to SEC on the accounts of lost security holders. However, the rule excluded the broker-dealers {{that are involved in}} the buying and selling of securities and that hold the vast majority of owners' assets. Legislation was introduced in Congress in 2000 that would have expanded the SEC rule to cover broker-dealers. GAO surveyed broker-dealer and <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> survey respondents and found that the number of lost accounts was about two percent of total accounts. Survey respondents said that they believe the number of lost security holders has remained steady since 1998. <b>Transfer</b> <b>agents</b> and broker-dealers said that the main reason for lost accounts was that owners forgot to send a change of address when they moved. Both <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> and broker-dealers generally resorted to telephone calls and mailings to locate lost security holders, using each method at least 75 percent of the time. <b>Transfer</b> <b>agents</b> and broker-dealers used credit bureaus and professional search firms the least and found these methods to be the least effective. About 40 percent of the responding <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> and broker-agents spent less than $ 10 trying to locate each lost customer. SEC has been unable to use data provided by <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> to assess the operation of the 1997 rule because of differences in the way agents interpreted the questions. In addition, the requested information was insufficient for SEC staff to review the operation of the rule after three years as they were directed when the Commission adopted the rule. SEC relies primarily on its general inspections of <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> to ensure that these firms comply with the 1997 rule. SEC found violations in compliance with the 1997 rule's reporting and procedural requirements in about one quarter of the inspections it made between 1998 and 2000. Given that only <b>transfer</b> <b>agents</b> are covered by the 1997 rule, the extent of the lost security holder issue may be small. ...|$|R

2500|$|US equities, {{corporate}} and municipal bonds can be issued in certificated form, though this practice {{has been largely}} replaced due to the costs and inefficiencies of keeping them.
