5|$|South Dakota Senator Peter Norbeck also {{introduced}} legislation for a Norse-American medal on February 5, 1925. It was referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on the Library. On the 6th, that committee was discharged {{of responsibility for}} the bill and it was referred instead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Banking and Currency. Norbeck, on behalf of the Banking Committee, reported the bill favorably and without amendment to the Senate on February 13. It was passed by the Senate without objection or amendment on the 18th.|$|E
5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Judiciary Act of 1789 took effect, Attorney General Edmund Randolph proposed, {{in a report}} to the House of Representatives, a {{criminal}} appeal similar to that in England: a writ of error as of right in non-capital cases, and no writs of error in capital cases.

5|$|Slaughter's {{political}} career {{began in earnest}} with his 1797 election to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Mercer County. He was named <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Enrollments, and probably served as chair, since he delivered the committee's reports to the Assembly. It is unclear whether he did not seek re-election in 1798, or whether he was defeated in that year's canvass. Whatever the case, he filled the space of his legislative hiatus by serving as trustee of the newly incorporated Harrodsburg Academy. He was re-elected to the state House in 1799. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Enrollments, he served on the Committee on Privileges and Elections and a joint committee that reported {{on the state of}} the Auditor's, Treasurer's, and Registrar's offices. Records show that he also served as chairman when the House sat as a committee of the whole on November 25, 1799.|$|E
5|$|The bill then {{proceeds}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> stage, {{where the}} details of the drafting of the proposed law are examined. Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is referred to a committee of the whole Parliament; in other words, all the MPs attending the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause. Bills that are more controversial, or that require the views of interested groups or the public, are often referred to a select committee. This is a committee of selected MPs who invite interested people to make representations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee.</b> Public hearings to hear submissions on the bill may be held. The select committee then reports its findings, together with any suggested amendments to the bill, to Parliament.|$|E

Adams also served as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting, which convened despite the Massachusetts Government Act, and was appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> of Inspection to enforce the Continental Association.

5|$|Chandler's mentor Harry F. Byrd led a {{group of}} Southern conservatives in the Senate, and through Byrd's influence, Chandler was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Military Affairs.

He vociferously disagreed with Roosevelt's decision to prioritize European operations in World War II over the war in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Despite its aims, the Committee was {{in large}} part {{responsible}} for {{the ease with which}} the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium and was unable to moderate many German policies, such as deportation of workers to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the persecution of Jews. In particular, encouraging the Germans to delegate tasks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, the Committee was always at a disadvantage during negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E
