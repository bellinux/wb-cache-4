Along {{with the}} {{diminishing}} supplies of fossil fuels, the continually increasing price of oil, and {{the deterioration of}} the environment as an effect of fossil fueled vehicles, the world now focuses its attention on green energy and vehicle hybridization. This has given rise to many alternatives in internal combustion engine vehicle hybridization such as the parallel and series hybrids, as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. This paper proposes a new method of hybridization which allows ICE vehicles to be retrofitted to take advantage of regenerative braking and acceleration assistance. The conjoined automotive regenerative braking system is a small trailer like device that can be attached via trailer hitch to the ICE vehicle {{in order to create a}} pseudo parallel hybrid. The CARB will be connected to the trailer hitch of the ICE vehicle through a series elastic element in order to filter impulse shock loads as well as provide stability and robustness in force control. This thesis explains the dynamic modeling of the system as well as the response of the system to varying control schemes. Firstly, the system was analyzed analytically as a Series Elastic Actuator. The system model is very simple and a PD force controller is implemented to regulate the force in the spring connecting the CARB and the Vehicle. The closed loop transfer function is determined and the step response of the system was analyzed to determine that the closed loop natural frequency of the system needed to be above 100 Hz in order for the transients in the response to die out within half of a second. Secondly, a simulink model of the system was created. A linear damper is added in parallel with the series elastic element between the vehicle and the CARB. The system input is a feed forward desired force for the vehicle determined from the Federal Urban Driving Schedule and the mass of the vehicle. A proportion of this feed forward desired force of the car is used as the desired force from the CARB. A PID controller regulates the torque of the CARB to minimize the force error between the desired force and the load force. The control parameters for this load force control scheme are determined using the signal constraint block in simulink and are determined for a variety of linear spring constants and linear damping constants. The velocity error of the system velocity response versus FUDS is less than 0. 3 m/s for any simulation, and the load force error was limited to less than 150 N. The power used by the vehicle was shown to be significantly lessened by the addition of the CARB. Thirdly a more detailed Simulink model was created using the Simscape toolbox which allowed for highly detailed simulated physical entities, such as drivelines, inertias, electronics, etc. This system uses a battery model and DC/DC converter which is connected to a 50 kW PMSM to simulate the electronics of the CARB, The longitudinal and tire dynamics of the car and of the system are accounted for. A model of an ICE was used to act as a torque source for the driveline of the vehicle based on an input <b>throttle</b> <b>signal.</b> This model also used a feed forward desired force as the input into the system. The CARB was limited in this model to provide torque assistance below 40 km/h. This strict guideline of CARB "on" below 40 km/h and CARB "off" above caused high frequency oscillations in the system velocity response when the system is near 40 km/h. The power consumed by the ICE was compared with the power consumed by the ICE for a vehicle model without the CARB attachment. The addition of the CARB resulted in large power savings for low speeds when the CARB was activated, but caused an increase in engine power for speeds above the CARB activation speed since the CARB acted like a passive mass attached to the car. Fourthly the detailed Simulink model was adjusted to utilize a PI speed control to control the throttle of the ICE and brake, and the load force control from the first simulink model was implemented to control the CARB based on a desired force determined from the throttle and brake of the ICE vehicle. Unfortunately, the PID load force control interaction with a vector control contained within the motor model caused high frequency fluctuations in torque output which caused high frequency oscillations in the load force and ICE torque as well. Therefore to do any significant power study of this model, the torque control of the CARB must be resolved first...|$|E

40|$|In {{the spark}} {{ignition}} engine system, driver convenience is very dependent on satisfying engine torque appropriate with the throttle position given by the driver. Unfortunately, sometimes the fulfillment of engine torque is not in line with fuel saving efforts. This requires the development of high performance and robust power train controllers. One way to potentially meet these performance requirements is to introduce a method of controlling engine torque using fuzzy gain scheduling. By using this method, the throttle opening commanded by the driver will be corrected by <b>throttle</b> correction <b>signal</b> that guarantees engine torque output will follow the desired engine torque input, and also reducing fuel consumption. In this case, {{spark ignition engine}} with automatic transmission is used to meet a good performance under this controller design...|$|R

50|$|Many layout {{builders}} are choosing digital operation of their layouts {{rather than the}} more traditional DC design. The industry standard command system is Digital Command Control (DCC). The advantages to DCC are that track voltage is constant (usually {{in the range of}} 20 volts AC) and the command <b>throttle</b> sends a <b>signal</b> to small circuit cards, or decoders, hidden inside the piece of equipment which control several functions of an individual locomotive, including speed, direction of travel, lights, smoke and various sound effects. This allows more realistic operation in that the modeller can operate independently several locomotives on the same stretch of track. Less common closed proprietary systems also exist. Several manufacturers offer software that can provide computer-control of DCC layouts.|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of {{adaptive}} cruise control (ACC) system two separate control loops - an outer loop to maintain the safe distance from the vehicle traveling in front and an inner loop to control the brake pedal and throttle opening position - are commonly used. In this paper a different approach is proposed in which a single control loop is utilized. The objective of the distance tracking is incorporated into the single nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) by extending the original linear time invariant (LTI) models obtained by linearizing the nonlinear dynamic model of the vehicle. This is achieved by introducing the additional states corresponding to the relative distance between leading and following vehicles, and also the velocity of the leading vehicle. Control of the brake and throttle position is implemented by taking the state-dependent approach. The model demonstrates {{to be more effective}} in tracking the speed and distance by eliminating the necessity of switching between the two controllers. It also offers smooth variation in brake and <b>throttle</b> controlling <b>signal</b> which subsequently results in a more uniform acceleration of the vehicle. The results of proposed method are compared with other ACC systems using two separate control loops. Furthermore, an ACC simulation results using a stop&go scenario are shown, demonstrating a better fulfilment of the design requirements...|$|R
