In recent years, the numerical methods for the biharmonic eigenvalue problems adopted mainly <b>the</b> conforming <b>finite</b> element method (see [6 – 9]), <b>the</b> nonconforming <b>finite</b> element method (see [3, 10 – 12]), and <b>the</b> mixed <b>finite</b> element method (see [13 – 16]).
