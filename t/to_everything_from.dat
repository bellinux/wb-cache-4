One notable exception is {{in the design of}} gardens, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow; to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times critic Allan Kozinn {{writes that}} with Nixon in China, Adams had {{produced}} a score {{that is both}} [...] "minimalist and eclectic... In the orchestral interludes one hears references, both passing and lingering, <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> Wagner to Gershwin and Philip Glass." [...] In reviewing the first recording of the work, Gramophone's critic discusses the mixture of styles and concludes that [...] "minimalist the score emphatically is not". Other commentators have evoked [...] "neo-classical Stravinsky", and concocted the term [...] "Mahler-meets-minimalism", in attempts to pinpoint the opera's idiom.|$|E
500|$|Gamāhīr, {{rendered}} in English as [...] "the masses", carries Marxist overtones of class struggle. Northwestern University professor Joe Khalil, {{who studies the}} Arab media, explains that it can [...] "refer <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> the indoctrinated members of a political party {{to a group of}} enthusiasts at a pop performance." [...] Within a political context it most often denotes [...] "several groups of people bound together by a common activity or ideology and easily recognizable within a larger population." [...] The term, like the Pan-Arabism it was also associated with, gradually fell into disuse after Egypt was defeated by Israel both in the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War of 1967.|$|E

[...] Dan Isett, PTC director of public policy, {{said that this was}} the first time since last fall that the PTC had asked its members to send complaints to the FCC, although the PTC regularly discusses issues it has with shows. The PTC named [...] "Family Gay" [...] the [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] for the week of March 13.

500|$|Upon release, [...] "Coming Home" [...] was {{generally}} {{met with a}} positive reception from music critics, who praised the autobiographical lyrics and composition of Skylar Grey's vocals with the Alex da Kid and Jay-Z production. Becky Bain of Idolator wrote, [...] "We have to give some credit to Diddy (or Jay-Z, if he did indeed write [...] ) for dropping some truly introspective lyrics {{instead of the usual}} not-so-subtle Cîroc vodka promotions. Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly agreed, and noted [...] "Coming Home" [...] as one of Last Train to Paris highlights, saying it was a [...] "must download" [...] as the album's only [...] "redemptive ballad". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News also noted the song's redemptive themes. He said 'Coming Home' is the [...] "only song which breaks the flow" [...] of Last Train to Paris, [...] "Diddy confesses <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> bad parenting to fear of commitment. It's an interesting moment but an unnecessary one." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics commended Sam & Max Save the Worlds {{graphics}} and art direction; Dickens commented that [...] "the cartoonish, absurdist nature of Steve Purcell's characters is captured perfectly" [...] within an [...] "enthusiastically colorful {{world that is}} at its best the stranger it gets", while GameZone reviewer Anise Hollingshead praised Telltale for successfully upgrading the characters' graphics [...] "without losing any of their cartoon appeal". Kristen Reed, writing for Eurogamer, felt that the graphics reflected a [...] "great degree of care and attention <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> the locations to the standard of character modelling and animation". They also praised the game for its sound, voice acting and music. In a review for The Entertainment Depot, Tim McGowan complimented Emerson-Johnson's soundtrack as [...] "being quite excellent and listenable on its own", and IGN's Alex Van Zelfdendate {{described it as a}} [...] "breath of fresh air". However, PC Gamer UKs Alec Meer felt that the opening theme tune was [...] "so busy trying to hint at [...] that it forgets to have a memorable melody of its own". Nowlin and Kasten's voicework also received a positive response.|$|E

500|$|Chris Cottingham of NME {{gave the}} album {{six out of}} ten, saying that [...] "Tinie is most {{definitely}} a star, second only to Dizzee Rascal on the UK scene, perhaps even above him following Dizzee's dismal ‘The Fifth’ album. So perhaps it's no surprise Tinie's brimming with confidence on record number two." [...] However, Cottingham dismissed the quality of some lyrics as [...] "all great fun for him, no doubt, {{but in the past}} he didn’t trade in this lowest common denominator stuff." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the album three out of five stars, describing the album as [...] "inoffensive grime-pop for the masses that makes all the right moves, but lacks any serious bite." [...] Larry Day of musicOMH gave the album two and half out of five stars, commenting [...] "this is a massive collaborative project. That's probably the reason it's such a chaotic, unwieldy mess." [...] On the other hand, he praised the promotional single [...] "Don't Sell Out", saying [...] "crunchy handclaps and jerky hooks work a kiss of life on the record, and Tempah's lyrics are fascinating to listen to – he compares himself to Othello and nods <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> the Queen to Celebrity Juice – if utterly misogynistic." [...] Day concluded the review with [...] "Tempah has gone from rapping with a knowing wink or a glint in his eye to unloading a lewd spiel sans wit." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{noted by}} {{interviewer}} Kurt Wolff, [...] "the melody and overall {{sound of the}} song also stand out as something fresh and very different." [...] Tompkins explained to Wolff that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was an [...] "attempt at 'melodic pop' that was 'unique' yet still 'country.'" [...] Tompkins also commented that [...] "Blown Away" [...] is [...] "not even mine and Josh’s song anymore; it's [...] song now. She's completely claimed it. The song is Carrie. It's not even a song that had a chance of being pitched to anybody else. It's a completely different type of song for Carrie. She's {{got a lot of}} pop elements, and I listen to a lot of pop, but I listen <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> Randy Newman to Mozart to Rihanna to Steely Dan. I think all that stuff shows up in my music, and I think it showed up in 'Blown Away.'" [...] The final version of the song was produced by Mark Bright, who drew inspiration from 1980s music. Underwood recalled Bright adding an effect to her vocals similar to the ones used in Def Leppard songs: [...] "That was a big thing with , all of that hollow vocal sound. And I liked it." [...] Bright used a similar effect on [...] "See You Again", another song from Blown Away. Melodically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] is written in the key of A minor, and is set in the common time with a tempo of 134 beats per minute. The song follows the sequence of Am - C - G as its chord progression, and Underwood's voice spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of E5.|$|E
500|$|Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{commented that}} the video [...] "features the pop star at her most gloriously provocative, with {{extended}} dance sequences, explosions, nudity, and a violent attack on a box of Honey Nut Cheerios." [...] Gin Sepre of E! Online compared the video with the book Girl, Interrupted noting that [...] "with equal parts autobiography and pure spectacle, it truly has something for everyone." [...] Sepre also praised {{the fact that the}} video is [...] "certainly not hurting for a lack of creativity" [...] with the scenes being shown in a [...] "slightly more straightforward, [...] less metaphorical way". Jocelyn Vena from MTV opined that [...] "with references <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> Fame and Black Swan to The Bell Jar, the video is a sweeping look into Gaga's psyche. Entertainment Weeklys Tanner Stransky described the video as [...] "quite the trip to Total Crazyville, population: 1, Lady Gaga... Leave it to Lady Gaga to unspool a mini-movie video that’s half the length of a sitcom episode." [...] Eleanor Gower from Daily Mail felt that the video was [...] "no less spectacular than her past offerings." [...] Gilly Ferguson of Daily Mirror noted that the video [...] "still has the shock factor – she's naked for starters." [...] Tim Nixon of The Sun noted that Gaga [...] "shocks in [...] most graphic video to date." [...] Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post {{commented that the}} video [...] "is slightly NSFW because of one word and some censored skin." [...] Oscar Moralde of Slant Magazine wrote that the video, [...] "is one of her biggest epics not merely by length (a weighty 14 minutes), but by the breadth of its modes of expression." ...|$|E

2500|$|Garbage's {{intention}} is to make pop-like songs which mixed a variety of genres, with Steve Marker saying that the band wanted to [...] "take pop music and make it as horrible sounding as we can." [...] These genres include trip hop, grunge, 1980s rock music, techno, power pop and shoegazing. Shirley Manson has stated that the band itself [...] "used to describe [...] as sci-fi pop, because {{we felt it was}} taking a futuristic approach." [...] Vig has said the crossover-heavy sound was inspired by the band's background with remixes, where songs would be rearranged to every musical style to which they held interest, and also that he [...] "grew up listening <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> pop radio and opera to country music and polka, so I really thought that Garbage would be an interesting and eclectic thing to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Wayne McIntosh notes, [...] "the spirit, {{if not the}} person, of Louis Brandeis, has {{continued}} to stimulate the constitutional mutation of a 'right to privacy.'" [...] These influences have manifested themselves in major decisions relating <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> abortion rights to the [...] "right to die" [...] controversies. Cases dealing with a state ban on the dissemination of birth control information expanded on Brandeis by including an individual's [...] "body," [...] not just her [...] "personality," [...] {{as part of her}} right to privacy. In another case, Justice Harlan credited Brandeis when he wrote, [...] "The entire fabric of the Constitution ... guarantees that the rights to marital privacy and to marry and raise a family are of similar order and magnitude as the fundamental rights specifically protected." [...] And the landmark case of Roe v. Wade, {{one of the most controversial}} and politically significant cases in U.S. Supreme Court history, the Court wrote, [...] "This right of privacy ... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clear Channel Communications, {{owner of}} many popular radio {{stations}} and affiliated with Super Bowl broadcaster CBS, had also censored or removed many songs from radio following the event, including blacklisting Jackson from receiving airplay as well as focusing on editing rock radio formats in particular. Rolling Stone stated [...] "Stations all over the country, the petition notes, are dropping or editing dozens of songs, including the Who's 'Who Are You,' Lou Reed's 'Walk on the Wild Side,' Pearl Jam's 'Jeremy' and John Mellencamp's 'Jack and Diane.' According to the petition, a Clear Channel programmer combed through the song database for five Denver stations and made changes <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> Steve Miller's 'Jet Airliner' to Nine Inch Nails' 'Closer.' Cleveland classic-rock station WNCX 98.5 has yanked Warren Zevon's 'Lawyers, Guns and Money,' Pink Floyd's 'Money' and several other classics. 'It's absurd,' says Reed. 'It's like being censored by a squirrel. It's beneath me, it's beneath all these artists. It's done {{by people who are}} very pious and stupid.'" [...] Clear Channel Communications also removed talk-radio host Howard Stern from several of its large-market radio stations within a month of the incident, citing the raunchy content of Stern's show. The FCC fined Clear Channel over allegedly indecent content on the Bubba the Love Sponge radio show. As a result of the incident, some networks established regulations requiring time delays of as much as five minutes for live broadcasts such as awards shows and sporting events. In late 2004, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the maximum FCC fine penalty from said US$27,500 to US$500,000 per violation; the United States Senate voted to decrease it to US$275,000 per incident, with a cap of US$3 million per day. By June 2006, the two houses reconciled the differences in fine levels, settling for a fine of US$325,000 per violation in the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005.|$|E
