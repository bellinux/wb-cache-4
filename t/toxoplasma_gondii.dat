5|$|An {{exhibit at}} the San Diego Natural History Museum states that cat feces from urban runoff carry <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> parasites to the ocean and kill sea otters.|$|E
5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} are hunted by woodland {{birds of}} prey such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the northern goshawk. This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> which causes toxoplasmosis. The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat {{may have}} {{external}} parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, {{especially those of}} rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with the}} skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 he {{was ordained}} into the Church of the Eternal Source, a Kemetic Pagan group, but moved on again in 1977, when {{he founded the}} Minoan Brotherhood as a Wiccan {{tradition}} for gay and bisexual men. Turning to academia, from 1980 to 1985 he studied for a bachelor's degree in Classical archaeology at Hunter College, which he followed up with a master's degree in the subject at Bryn Mawr College from 1985 to 1988. Buczynski was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1988, and died from a related <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> infection the following year, converting to Roman Catholicism briefly beforehand. In 2012, the practicing Pagan Michael G. Lloyd published a biography of Buczynski entitled Bull of Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016, no {{approved}} human vaccine exists against <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii.</b> Research {{on human}} vaccines is ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Glyphosate {{can control}} the growth of apicomplexan parasites, such as <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), and Cryptosporidium parvum, and has been {{considered}} an antimicrobial agent in mammals.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} some {{inconsistent}} findings of links between infection by the parasite <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> and human mental disorders such as schizophrenia, with the direction of causality unclear. A number of diseases of the white matter can cause symptoms of mental disorder.|$|E
25|$|A seven-year-old female named Jin Yi died in 2014 in a zoo in Zhengzhou, China, after showing {{symptoms}} of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. It {{was found that}} {{the cause of death was}} toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> and infecting most warm-blooded animals, including humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} Wain's {{schizophrenia}} {{may have been}} precipitated by <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> a parasite which is excreted by cats in their feces. The theory that toxoplasmosis can trigger schizophrenia {{is the subject of}} ongoing research, though the origins of the theory can be traced back as early as 1953.|$|E
25|$|<b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} {{as the cause of}} death of a Giant panda kept in a zoo in China, who died in 2014 of acute gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. Although seemingly anecdotal, this report emphasizes that all warm-blooded species are likely to be infected by T. gondii, including endangered species such as the Giant panda.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety level 2 is {{suitable}} for work involving agents of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. This includes various microbes that cause mild disease to humans, or are difficult to contract via aerosol in a lab setting. Examples include Hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Plasmodium falciparum, and <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wild rodents, {{including}} rats, {{can carry}} many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> and Campylobacter. The Black Death is traditionally {{believed to have}} been caused by the micro-organism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is the foot-and-mouth disease.|$|E
25|$|This {{species can}} {{also serve as}} a {{reservoir}} for <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, though the disease usually spreads from rats to humans when domestic cats feed on infected brown rats. The parasite has a long history with the brown rat, and there are indications that the parasite has evolved to alter an infected rat's perception to cat predation, making it more susceptible to predation and increasing the likelihood of transmission.|$|E
25|$|Toxoplasmosis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii.</b> Infections with toxoplasmosis usually cause no obvious symptoms in adults. Occasionally {{there may be}} a few weeks or months of mild flu-like illness such as muscle aches and tender lymph nodes. In a small number of people, eye problems may develop. In those with a weak immune system, severe symptoms such as seizures and poor coordination may occur. If infected during pregnancy, a condition known as congenital toxoplasmosis may affect the child.|$|E
25|$|Some parasites modify host {{behavior}} {{in order to}} increase the transmission between hosts, often in relation to predator and prey (parasite increased trophic transmission). For example, in California salt marshes, the fluke Euhaplorchis californiensis reduces the ability of its killifish host to avoid predators. This parasite matures in egrets, which are more likely to feed on infected killifish than on uninfected fish. Another example is the protozoan <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> a parasite that matures in cats but can be carried by many other mammals. Uninfected rats avoid cat odors, but rats infected with T. gondii are drawn to this scent, which may increase transmission to feline hosts.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{in rates}} {{and types of}} {{infection}} alone however, {{have been unable to}} explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment. Evidence has shown that exposure to food and fecal-oral pathogens, such as hepatitis A, <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> and Helicobacter pylori (which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries), can reduce the overall risk of atopy by more than 60%, and an increased rate of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma. It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering TH1/TH2 regulation. Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins, exposure to pets and growing up on a farm.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier acts very {{effectively}} {{to protect the}} brain from most pathogens. Thus, blood-borne infections of the brain are very rare. Infections {{of the brain that}} do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass. In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. However, not all drugs that are delivered directly to the CSF can effectively penetrate the CSF barrier and enter the brain. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation. This allows some antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB. Examples of pathogens that can traverse the BBB and the diseases they cause include <b>toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> which causes toxoplasmosis, spirochetes like Borrelia which causes Lyme disease, Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns, and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis. Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin which have a direct toxic effect on brain microvascular endothelium and tight junctions.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{studying}} 553 feral cats in Northern Florida in the United States tested {{them for}} a number of infections that could be detrimental to feline or human health. The study found the most prevalent infection to be Bartonella henselae, the cause of cat-scratch disease in humans, with 33.6% of the cats testing positive. Feline coronavirus was the next most common infection, found in 18.3% of the cats, although they noted that the antibody levels were low in most of the cats who tested positive, and concluded that the cats they tested {{did not appear to be}} a greater risk for shedding the virus than pet cats. Researchers studying 96 feral cats on Prince Edward Island in Canada found that feline roundworm was the most common infection in cats in that colony, afflicting 34% of cats. This was followed by <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> which was detected in 29.8% of cats, although only one cat of the 78 for whom fecal samples were available was shedding T. gondii oocysts. They did note that most fecal samples collected indicated the presence of one intestinal parasite, with some samples indicating the presence of multiple parasites.|$|E
500|$|An {{emaciated}} [...] female fin whale, which stranded {{along the}} Belgian coast in 1997, {{was found to}} be infected with lesions of Morbillivirus. In January 2011, a [...] emaciated adult male fin whale stranded dead on the Tyrrhenian coastline of Italy {{was found to be}} infected with [...] Morbillivirus and the protozoa <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> as well as carrying heavy loads of organochlorine pollutants.|$|E
500|$|Life expectancies may {{be up to}} 20–25 years. [...] Parapoxvirus is common, though rarely fatal; Infection causes papular and nodular lesions. There {{have been}} {{epidemics}} of contagious pustular dermatitis. [...] Bacteria such as E.coli and Lyme borreliosis are common, and <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> has been reported. [...] C.crispus is susceptible to numerous parasites, such as the nematode Trichuris discolor and the lungworm Protostrongylus shiozawai.|$|E
500|$|Some {{survival}} strategies often involve disrupting cytokines {{and other}} methods of cell signaling {{to prevent the}} phagocyte's [...] responding to invasion. The protozoan parasites <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania infect macrophages, and each has a unique way of taming them. Some species of Leishmania alter the infected macrophage's signalling, repress the production of cytokines and microbicidal molecules—nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species—and compromise antigen presentation.|$|E
500|$|The {{eggs and}} chicks of red-billed tropicbirds are prey for both brown and black rats {{in places like}} Abrolhos Archipelago, where these rats are {{invasive}} species. Feral cats are also predators of breeding tropicbirds, with the birds providing about 3% of the diet of the cats in locations such as the Caribbean island Saba. On Saba, the problem has only arisen since about 2000. On Ascension Island, {{the effect of the}} eradication of feral cats was the increase of the red-billed tropicbird population there by about 1.6% in a year. [...] On the Galapagos Islands, the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) [...] occasionally eats young birds. <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> an intracellular parasite, can be found in this bird. About 28% of red-billed tropicbirds produce antibodies for T. gondii.|$|E
500|$|The fossa {{has been}} {{assessed}} as [...] "Vulnerable" [...] by the IUCN Red List since 2008, as its population size has probably declined {{by at least}} 30percent between 1987 and 2008; previous assessments have included [...] "Endangered" [...] (2000) and [...] "Insufficiently Known" [...] (1988, 1990, 1994). The species is dependent on forest and thus threatened by the widespread destruction of Madagascar's native forest but is also able to persist in disturbed areas. A suite of microsatellite markers (short segments of DNA that have a repeated sequence) {{have been developed to}} help aid in studies of genetic health and population dynamics of both captive and wild fossas. Several pathogens have been isolated from the fossa, some of which, such as anthrax and canine distemper, are thought to have been transmitted by feral dogs or cats. <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> was reported in a captive fossa in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Torrey became {{interested}} in viral infections as possible causes of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, particularly a parasite <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> whose definitive host is the cat, but whose intermediate host can be any mammal, including humans. Up to {{one third of the}} world's human population is estimated to carry a Toxoplasma infection. Since then he has published, often with Robert Yolken, more than 30 articles on seasonal variation and possible infectious causes of schizophrenia, focusing especially on <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii.</b> He is involved in five or six ongoing studies using anti-Toxoplasmosa gondii agents (e.g. antibiotics such as minocycline and azithromycin) as an add-on treatment for schizophrenia. He believes that infectious causes will eventually explain the [...] "vast majority" [...] of schizophrenia cases. Some of his collaborators have disagreed with the emphasis he has placed on infection as a direct causal factor. Many of the research studies on links between schizophrenia and <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii,</b> by different authors in different countries, are funded and supported by the Stanley Medical Research Institute. The hypothesis is not prominent in current mainstream scientific views on the causes of schizophrenia, although infections may be seen as one possible risk factor that could lead to vulnerabilities in early neurodevelopment in some cases.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> (...) is an obligate intracellular, {{parasitic}} alveolate {{that causes}} the disease toxoplasmosis. [...] Found worldwide, T. gondii is capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals, but felids such as domestic cats are the only known definitive hosts in which the parasite can undergo sexual reproduction.|$|E
2500|$|Women are counseled {{to avoid}} certain foods, {{because of the}} {{possibility}} of contamination with bacteria or parasites that can cause illness. Careful washing of fruits and raw vegetables may remove these pathogens, as may thoroughly cooking leftovers, meat, or processed meat. [...] Unpasteurized dairy and deli meats may contain Listeria, which can cause neonatal meningitis, stillbirth and miscarriage. Pregnant women are also more prone to Salmonella infections, can be in eggs and poultry, which should be thoroughly cooked. Cat feces and undercooked meats may contain the parasite <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> and can cause toxoplasmosis. Practicing good hygiene in the kitchen can reduce these risks.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, {{while working}} at the Pasteur Institute in Tunis, Charles Nicolle and Louis Manceaux {{discovered}} a protozoan organism in the tissues of a hamster-like rodent known as the gundi, Ctenodactylus gundi. [...] Although Nicolle and Manceaux initially believed the organism {{to be a member}} of the genus Leishmania that they described as [...] "Leishmania gondii", they soon realized they had discovered a new organism entirely; they re-named it <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii.</b> The new genus name Toxoplasma is a reference to its morphology: Toxo, from Greek [...] ( [...] , [...] "arc, bow"), and [...] ( [...] , [...] "shape, form") and the host in which it was discovered, the gundi (gondii). The same year Nicolle and Mancaeux discovered T. gondii, Alfonso Splendore identified the same organism in a rabbit in Brazil. However, he did not give it a name.|$|E
2500|$|Thrombocytopenia {{that starts}} {{after the first}} 72 hours since birth is often the result of {{underlying}} sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In the case of infection, PCR tests may be useful for rapid pathogen identification and detection of antibiotic resistance genes. [...] Possible pathogens include viruses (e.g. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus, HIV), bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica), fungi (e.g. Candida sp.), and <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii.</b> The severity of thrombocytopenia may be correlated with pathogen type; some research indicates that the most severe cases are related to fungal or gram-negative bacterial infection. The pathogen may be transmitted during or before birth, by breast feeding, or during transfusion. Interleukin-11 is being investigated as a drug for managing thrombocytopenia, especially in cases of sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).|$|E
2500|$|Complex {{plastids}} {{start by}} secondary endosymbiosis (where a eukaryotic organism engulfs another eukaryotic organism {{that contains a}} primary plastid resulting in its endosymbiotic fixation), when a eukaryote engulfs a red or green alga and retains the algal plastid, which is typically surrounded by more than two membranes. In some cases these plastids may be reduced in their metabolic and/or photosynthetic capacity. [...] Algae with complex plastids derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga include the heterokonts, haptophytes, cryptomonads, and most dinoflagellates (= rhodoplasts). Those that endosymbiosed a green alga include the euglenids and chlorarachniophytes (= chloroplasts). The Apicomplexa, a phylum of obligate parasitic protozoa including the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium spp.), toxoplasmosis (<b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii),</b> and many other human or animal diseases also harbor a complex plastid (although this organelle has been lost in some apicomplexans, such as Cryptosporidium parvum, which causes cryptosporidiosis). [...] The 'apicoplast' is no longer capable of photosynthesis, but is an essential organelle, and a promising target for antiparasitic drug development.|$|E
2500|$|Differences in sex-dependent {{behavior}} {{observed in}} infected hosts compared to non-infected individuals {{can be attributed}} to differences in testosterone. Infected males had higher levels of testosterone while infected females had significantly lower levels, compared to their non-infected equivalents. Looking at humans, studies using the Cattell’s 16 Personality Factor questionnaire found that infected men scored lower on Factor G (superego strength/rule consciousness) and higher on Factor L (vigilance) while the opposite pattern was observed for infected women. This means that men were more likely to disregard rule and were more expedient, suspicious and jealous. On the other hand, women were more warm hearted, outgoing, conscientious and moralistic. Mice infected with T. gondii have a worse motor performance than non-infected mice. Thus, a computerized simple reaction test was given to both infected and non-infected adults. It was found that the infected adults performed much more poorly and lost their concentration more quickly than the control group. But, the effect of the infection only explains less than 10% of the variability in performance. (i.e., there could be other confounding factors) Correlation has also been observed between seroprevalence of T. gondii in humans and increased risk of traffic accidents. Infected subjects have a 2.65 times higher risk of getting into a traffic accident. A similar study done in Turkey showed that there is a higher incidence of <b>Toxoplasma</b> <b>gondii</b> antibodies among drivers who have been involved in traffic accidents. Furthermore, this parasite has been associated with many neurological disorders such as schizophrenia. In a meta-analysis, 23 studies met inclusion criteria. The results demonstrate that the seroprevalence of antibodies to T. gondii in people with schizophrenia is significantly higher than in control populations (OR=2.73, P<0.000001). More recent studies found that suicide attempters has significantly higher IgG antibody levels to T. gondii than patients without a suicide attempt. Infection was also shown to be associated with suicide in women over the age of 60. (P<0.005) ...|$|E
