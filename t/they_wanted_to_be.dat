His {{job was to}} monitor the health and physical fitness of the American troops stationed there.

5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first to offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarian government's {{strategy}} for the negotiations was to demand areas where at least 50% of Hungarians lived, according to the 1910 census.

25|$|The Khalkha nobles' {{power was}} {{deliberately}} undermined by Qianlong, when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal {{family of the}} eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated Jebtsundamba, instead of the Khalkha Mongol which <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appointed. The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles, and then the Khalkhas sought to have him {{placed at a distance}} from them at Dolonnor. Nevertheless, Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the message that he was putting an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy. The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols.|$|E

25|$|Stella Browne was {{a leading}} birth control campaigner, who {{increasingly}} began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced {{by the work of}} Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and other sexologists. She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy. In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mothers or not.|$|E

They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.|$|E
25|$|On January 21, 2004, Insane Clown Posse {{appeared}} on {{an episode of}} the weekly NWA Total Nonstop Action PPV. The duo were shown partying in the crowd alongside the juggalos in attendance. In the main event of the night, which featured Jeff Jarrett going against El Leon, Jarrett and El Leon were fighting in the crowd when Insane Clown Posse sprayed Faygo in Jarrett's eyes. The following week, Insane Clown Posse were interviewed in the ring by Mike Tenay. The duo explained that they were fans of TNA, and that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a part of the}} promotion themselves. As they started making (kayfabe) negative remarks toward Jeff Jarrett, Glenn Gilberti and David Young interrupted. When Gilberti tried to convince the duo to apologize to Jarrett, Insane Clown Posse chased Gilbertti and Young out of the ring before challenging the team to a match for the next week.|$|E

25|$|One {{of these}} {{students}} was Edwin Catmull. Catmull had just come from The Boeing Company and {{had been working on}} his degree in physics. Growing up on Disney, Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered {{that he did not have}} the talent for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of the revolution. The first animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. He also pioneered texture mapping to paint textures on three-dimensional models in 1974, now considered one of the fundamental techniques in 3D modeling. It became one of his goals to produce a feature-length motion picture using computer graphics - a goal he would achieve two decades later after his founding role in Pixar. In the same class, Fred Parke created an animation of his wife's face.|$|E
25|$|In July 2016, it was {{revealed}} that Hill could face charges of endangerment under Article 138 of the Air Navigation Order 2009 and also of manslaughter by gross negligence. Sussex Constabulary applied to the High Court for a disclosure of records order in respect of certain evidence gathered by the AAIB, which <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released to them. They wanted copies of interviews between the AAIB and Hill, the results of tests carried out by the AAIB and video evidence filmed from inside the aircraft during its display. At the High Court on 28 September 2016, an order was made that the onboard video evidence would be released, but not copies of the interview or the results of tests. Following the publication of the AAIB's final report, Sussex Police stated that they would look into the report in detail. They intended to present a file to the Crown Prosecution Service before the pre-inquest review on 20 June 2017, but stated then that their investigation was not quite complete.
