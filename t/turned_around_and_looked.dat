60|$|The Prince <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> inquiringly at the surgeon.|$|E
60|$|They {{all three}} <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at the {{wonderful}} bank of pink roses {{within a few}} feet of them.|$|E
60|$|At {{this she}} <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at him. Even into her strong mind the sharp edge of {{distrust}} began to insert itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it?" [...] said Rollo, <b>turning</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> up to {{the part}} of the heavens where he had seen the star the evening before.|$|R
60|$|I {{thanked her}} for her {{information}} and bade her good-bye. She shook my hand very cordially and I walked away. I had gone but a very few steps when I wanted to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> back, but I did not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Prove it yourself. <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at him. You've {{got him in}} profile. Look at his nose. That's Isaac Ford's. Yours is a thin {{edition of}} it. That's right. Look. The lines are fuller, but they are all there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Shaggy Man," [...] called Dorothy, and {{ran after}} Toto. The little dog pranced briskly along for some distance; when he <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at his {{mistress}} questioningly.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Philippa's {{tone was}} melancholy. She did not recover her good spirits {{until we were}} out on the pretty, grassy, elm-shaded country road, garlanded with its ribbon of buttercups. Then she {{suddenly}} <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> me over scrutinizingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get home, Franco!" [...] said Jonas again; and, stooping down, {{he took a}} {{piece of}} {{hardened}} snow or ice from the road, and threw it towards him. The ice fell, before it reached Franco, and rolled along towards his feet, which made him scamper along a little farther; and then he stopped, and <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at Jonas, as before.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{beauty of}} McPherson’s writing is that peripheral, shimmery weirdness, the tug at your sleeve of {{something}} so otherworldly and luminous, you can’t bear to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look.</b> What’s going on? A spellbinding and absolutely gorgeous new play {{by one of}} the true poets of the theater, that’s what." ...|$|R
50|$|Humor is an {{on-going}} feature, a {{thing he}} focuses a lot on. One of his idols, Stephen King, once said his biggest wish was {{that someone would}} die of terror after reading his book. To that Jürgensen has remarked that his biggest wish is that someone will laugh so hard from reading his book {{that people in the}} bus will <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} famous and {{historical}} name plates in the temple.After {{you enter the}} temple, <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> above the door, {{you will see a}} large name plate with the three Chinese characters “Da Zhang Fu”（大丈夫）carved in it.In Chinese culture, “Da Zhang Fu” represent courage, strength and loyalty, the traits of Guan-Gong.The name plate was presented to the temple by a Qing dynasty general in A.D.1791.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Jimmy stopped chuckling. Then {{he stopped}} ambling along the Crooked Little Path. He <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> back, {{and as he}} did so he {{scratched}} his head thoughtfully. He had just happened to think that Old Mr. Toad had gone up the Crooked Little Path, and it was up the Crooked Little Path that Mr. Blacksnake had shown himself that morning.|$|E
60|$|Jocelyn Thew <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> reflectively at the speaker. For {{a single}} moment Crawshay's muscles tingled with the {{apprehension}} of danger. There was a smouldering light in the other's eyes, such a light as might gleam in the tiger's eyes before his spring. Crawshay's hand slipped to his hip pocket. So for a moment they remained. Then Jocelyn Thew shrugged his shoulders, and the tense moment was past.|$|E
60|$|After he had rested a bit, he <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{at his new}} home, {{for that}} is what it was, {{although}} he had not come there to live yet, and no one knew of it, no one but jolly, round, red Mr. Sun, who, peeping between the branches of the old apple tree, had caught Johnny Chuck at work. But he wouldn't tell, not jolly Mr. Sun! Looking down from the blue sky every day he sees all sorts of queer things and he learns all kinds of secrets, does Mr. Sun, but he never, never tells. No, Sir! Mr. Sun never tells one of them, not even to Old Mother West Wind when at night they go down together behind the Purple Hills.|$|E
5000|$|Guests {{have often}} praised the {{chemistry}} between Ferguson and Peterson during their interviews on The Late Late Show. Regis Philbin said [...] "Y'know the robot? I've actually [...] in love. I wasn't {{sure of the}} robot but he's grown on me. I think it's a great combination. You Ferguson say something funny, you <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at him, <b>and</b> he Peterson says something funnier!" ...|$|R
60|$|Dominey {{paused in}} the act of {{inserting}} a cartridge into his gun. He <b>turned</b> slowly <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> into his companion's expressionless face.|$|R
500|$|According to Charles Isherwood of The New York Times, {{not only}} are the {{character}} names derived from Chekhov, but also [...] "The country-house setting is also borrowed from the work of that Russian master, as are the self-delusions and self-pity that plague the central characters, all of whom have reached the difficult age when life’s path has narrowed uncomfortably, and there is little point in <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> to take another, more rewarding course." ...|$|R
60|$|I pitied {{the poor}} old fellow, who, {{if he had}} been a horse, would have been no more than {{fourteen}} hands high, and as he went puffing along, tugging and grunting as if I was a load of coal, I felt as if I couldn't stand it another minute, and I called out to him to stop. It did seem as if he would drop before he got me back to the hotel, and I bounced out in no time, and then I walked {{in front of him and}} <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at him. If it is possible for a human hack-horse to have spavins in two joints in each leg, that man had them; and he looked as if he couldn't remember what it was to have a good feed.|$|E
60|$|They rushed from Paris {{once more}} into the country, with its spring perfumes, its soft breezes, its restful green, but fast though they drove another {{messenger}} had outstripped them. From the little chapel, as the car rolled up the avenue, came the slow tolling of a bell. Madame Christophor stood {{on the corner of}} the lawn alone. The invalid chair was empty. The blinds of the villa were being slowly lowered. She <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> toward the city. It seemed to her that she could see into the rooms of the man whom she had left a few minutes ago. A lark was singing over her head. She lifted her eyes and looked past him up to the blue sky. Her lips moved, but never a sound escaped her. Yet the man who sat in his rooms at that moment, yawning and wondering where to spend the evening, and which companion he should summon by telephone to amuse him, felt a sudden shiver in his veins.|$|E
60|$|Hamel strolled {{down the}} terrace steps and wandered {{for a time}} in the gardens behind the house. Here, in the shelter of the great building, he found himself {{suddenly}} in an atmosphere of springtime. There were beds of crocuses and hyacinths, fragrant clumps of violets, borders of snowdrops, masses of primroses and early anemones. He slowly climbed one or two steep paths until he reached a sort of plateau, level with the top of the house. The flowers here grew more sparsely, the track of the salt wind lay like a withering band across the flower-beds. The garden below was like a little oasis of colour and perfume. Arrived at the bordering red brick wall, he <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> along the narrow road which led to the sea. There was no sign of Mr. Fentolin's return. Then to his left he saw a gate open and heard the clamour of dogs. Esther appeared, walking swiftly towards the little stretch of road which led to the village. He hurried after her.|$|E
60|$|His nerves, however, were proof {{against my}} attack. He <b>turned</b> half <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{me in the}} face with great sad eyes, in which there was neither {{kindness}} nor resentment, nor any perceptible surprise.|$|R
5|$|Michael (turned {{back into}} a zombie) and his fellow corpses then back the frightened girl {{into the corner of}} a nearby {{abandoned}} house. Michael then reaches for his date's throat as she lets out a bloodcurdling scream, only to awake and realize it was all a dream. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily obliges. As they walk out of the house, Michael <b>turns</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> at the camera, thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs {{from the beginning of the}} video, as we hear Vincent Price's haunting laugh, while Michael grins.|$|R
50|$|As {{they drive}} back to Baker Street, Holmes tells Dr. Watson how Adler showed him the hiding place as expected. He tells him that he plans on calling {{early the next morning}} at Briony Lodge as himself with the king and Dr. Watson to collect the photograph. While Holmes and Dr. Watson are about to enter their home on Baker Street, another coach stops nearby, and a person gets off. Only the person's shoes are seen. The person walks past Holmes and Dr. Watson and greets Holmes good night. By the time both of them <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look,</b> the person is seen walking away rapidly with the back facing them.|$|R
6000|$|King was a polo pony from St. Louis, and Prince a many-gaited love-horse from Pasadena. The {{hardest thing}} was {{to get them to}} dig in and pull. They rollicked along on the levels and galloped down the hills, but when they struck an up-grade and felt the weight of the breaking-cart, they stopped and <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at me. But I passed them, and my {{troubles}} began. Milda was fourteen years old, an unadulterated broncho, and in temperament was a combination of mule and jack-rabbit blended equally. If you pressed your hand on her flank and told her to get over, she lay down on you. If you got her by the head and told her to back, she walked forward over you. And if you got behind her and shoved and told her to [...] "Giddap!" [...] she sat down on you. Also, she wouldn't walk. For endless weary miles I strove with her, but never could I get her to walk a step. Finally, she was a manger-glutton. No matter how near or far from the stable, when six o'clock came around she bolted for home and never missed the directest cross-road. Many times I rejected her.|$|E
5000|$|A famous legend {{says that}} when her deposed son Muhammad XII left Granada after its fall, he <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> back upon it. Aixa then replied: ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 13, 1991, Mobley {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} from the Hall County Sheriff's Department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Mobley made a voluntary oral confession to Collins's murder and dictated a written confession. He made further statements on March 14 and 15, including the statement: [...] "The guy I was robbing <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at me. I said 'don't look at me, face the wall.' I pointed the gun up in his direction and turned my head away and fired." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} the deer <b>turned</b> partly <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{squarely}} at the boys. They were evidently taken completely by surprise and their heads went up high as they discovered the enemy. Then, without further hesitation they leaped forward, toward the dense timber ahead.|$|R
5000|$|Bulletproof, {{as a child}} back in his hometown, {{was riding}} his bike {{when he saw the}} streets, the building, and {{everything}} else melting right before his eyes. Next thing he knew, he was falling into a void of darkness and landed on the ground with a thud. When he got up a bit, he found himself having a cybernetic armor chest on him and wondering what was happening to his hometown. Suddenly he heard guns blazing. He <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at a skull bullet design being made by none other than Buttons McBoomBoom who kicked the door open and utters, [...] "Hi Kid." [...] and [...] "Bye Kid." [...] just as he opened the chest to reveal his twin machine gun torso that he fires at his target....and Bulletproof wakes up in cold sweat.|$|R
5000|$|Mellon made {{a trip to}} San Bruno {{to brief}} Montoya’s staff on the concept. During the presentation, {{a member of the}} {{audience}} spoke out saying, “You can’t do that. That’s illegal!” It turns out that the vocal outburst came from Mellon’s father. Mellon had invited the elder Mellon to the presentation to learn about the project being developed by his son. They had dinner together the night before, met in the morning, went to San Bruno’s headquarters building together, met the Chief Procurement Officer, Helen Lyle, and then proceeded to the briefing together. Following the outburst, Montoya <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at the elder Mellon upon which Mellon remarked, “Sir, may I introduce you to my father, Commander Hugh Mellon, U.S.N. Supply Corps, retired and obviously a contracting guy.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Roh {{enrolled}} in Michigan's College of Literature, Science and the Arts {{and joined the}} football team for summer practice in August 2009. He impressed the coaching staff during summer practice and earned {{a spot in the}} starting lineup as a true freshman. His speed and athleticism were attributes that drew the coaches' attention. Michigan's tailback, Carlos Brown, described seeing the big freshman running by his side, and keeping up. Brown added, [...] "He <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at me, and I said, 'That's Craig Roh running with me right down the field?' It's ridiculous. He's real fast." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Simon Wells, {{one of the}} movie's directors, {{describes}} {{the moment when the}} singer recorded the song. [...] "He just came in and set the whole studio on fire." [...] Brenda Chapman, another director on the project, adds, [...] "It was great. I <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at everyone in the booth as he was singing, and people just had these big grins on their faces, because he WAS Jethro when he was doing this." [...] Brian's dynamic rendering of [...] "Through Heaven's Eyes," [...] in concert with the spectacular, colorful animation, brings the scene and character to life in one of THE PRINCE OF EGYPT's most breathtaking sequences." ...|$|E
50|$|After a few {{talks with}} the islanders, Lucas <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at the hole where Caitlyn was peeking through and waved goodbye, and ran, the islanders chasing him. When Caitlyn saw this, she went out of hiding and ran {{as fast as she}} can just to get to Lucas. When Lucas got to the mudflats, which is very dangerous, since one wrong step can lead to death by sinking, he didn't stop while the villagers stayed in place. When Caitlyn got there she took the first step, but didn't get through all the way to Lucas, because Dom and John took a hold of her, because it was deadly, leaving Caitlyn {{thrashing}} around and shouting 'Lucas'.|$|E
5000|$|... What type of {{structure}} (shape) does my work propose? It is organic, geometric? What if I <b>turn</b> the stain <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> {{at it from}} different angles? ...|$|R
5000|$|Leyla (Melis Birkan): The {{last major}} Leyla in the series, who appears in season three, most closely resembles the {{original}} Leyla. Like the first Leyla, Mecnun {{falls in love}} with her when he sees her {{at the top of the}} stairs. Leyla is a businesswoman, and Mecnun's constant presence sabotages her company; once, he starts a fire. When Leyla criticizes him one day, Meclun says: [...] "What are you doing? Why are you always criticizing me? Why are you always doing this? For once, <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at yourself. Maybe you are to blame, huh? Maybe you are just not good enough. Maybe you are not made for this job. If you can't do this job, then don't. Stop!" [...] Leyla tries to slap him, Mecnun gently grabs her hand and they gaze into each other's eyes.|$|R
50|$|Last Samurai is {{a typical}} samurai {{character}} who runs a barbershop under the bridge, capable of cutting everyone's hair {{in a matter of}} seconds. He comes from a samurai family and the sword that he has was an inheritance passed down from his ancestors. Before he started living under the bridge, he was a famous hairdresser that captured the hearts of all his female customers. At the time, in order to prevent them from <b>turning</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> at him, he needed to put eye covers on all of them. He listened to all the comments of his female customers and felt that he had lost his way as a hairdresser. One night, he went to the bridge to swing his sword <b>around</b> <b>and</b> suddenly met the chief. After a brief conversation, his samurai blood boiled up and he regained his confidence. He seems to be in love with P-KO.|$|R
