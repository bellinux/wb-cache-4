40|$|This thesis {{documents}} home bias {{in currency}} carry trade: i. e. carry trade activity {{from the main}} funding countries is biased towards investment countries that {{are located in the}} same region and thus more familiar to investors. My research provides new insight to the forward premium puzzle and arising currency carry <b>trade</b> excess <b>returns</b> stressing the importance of Switzerland, Japan and U. S. as the main funding countries in their own region during the sample period from January 1999 to January 2014. Utilizing spot and forward exchange rates of 28 currencies from EMEA, Asia Pacific and Americas, I form carry portfolios by sorting sample currencies based on their forward discount and examine the risk-return relationship between the main funding countries' funding liquidity measures and carry <b>trade</b> <b>returns</b> in these three regions. Furthermore, I test whether the tightening funding conditions in the main funding country are associated with currency crashes in the major investment countries located in the same region. The results indicate that the main funding countries' key volatility measures and liquidity spreads have in general the highest explanatory power for carry <b>trade</b> <b>returns</b> in their own regions. While the liquidity spreads produce less significant values relating to carry <b>trade</b> <b>returns,</b> they prove to be more relevant measures when explaining the currency crashes in the major investment countries. I show that the contemporaneous change in the Swiss and U. S. volatility measures can alone explain around 20 percent of the regional currency carry <b>trade</b> <b>returns</b> and crashes in EMEA and Americas, respectively, leaving other main funding countries' volatility measures redundant. In Asia Pacific, the changes in the key volatility measure have also delayed effect to carry <b>trade</b> <b>returns</b> due to slow collective action of numerous Japanese retail investors. Japanese and U. S. funding liquidity measures explain together one third of the carry <b>trade</b> excess <b>returns</b> and over 40 percent of the currency crashes in major investment countries in Asia Pacific region...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of recent {{evidence}} suggests that premiums for financial options might be too high. For agricultural options, market participants often make similar claims, however there is very limited scientific literature to prove or disprove such claims. This research investigates the efficiency of corn and soybean options markets by directly computing <b>trading</b> <b>returns.</b> Time effects on market efficiency are also investigated. When the sample period is considered as a whole, risk adjusted returns indicate that no profits {{can be made by}} taking either side of the corn or soybean options markets. However, when time effects are analyzed, corn calls appear to have provided excess returns during the 1998 [...] 2005 period. This result {{do not appear to be}} driven by movements in the underlying futures, since similar differences were not found for corn puts. Based on the evidence presented here, corn puts and soybean options would constitute fairly-well priced insurance tools.

40|$|Market {{participants}} {{who want to}} trade “quickly ” demand transactional liquidity. Market {{participants who}} demand to trade “immediately ” demand transactional immediacy. Traders supply immediacy when the <b>trading</b> <b>returns</b> are high and demand immediacy when the <b>trading</b> <b>returns</b> are low. Traders supply immediacy by being non-immediate and traders demand immediacy by being immediate. As these time-based expectations are functions of the underlying distributions of the clearing prices, one is able to define exact analytical functions for time-differing non-immediacy traders. As non-immediacy is heterogenous, a range of non-immediacy traders with differing non-immediacies can compete in the marketplace and {{give rise to a}} “zone ” of limit order functions. The bid-ask expectations are also assumed to be rank-dependent to maintain transitivity and monotonicity. The limit orders placed by non-immediacy traders can then be “picked ” off by immediacy traders as they arrive at the exchange. A simulation of a simple trading model is undertaken to illustrate the mechanism of price formation under rank-dependent non-immediacy trading. In doing so, we show that immediacy is a consequence of non-immediacy trading and is provided freely in any organised asset markets when participants transmit their demand propensities to the market in the form of limit orders. While certain participants such as dealers and specialists do indeed (at a price) provide immediacy, they need not be the only providers...|$|E

In addition, non-trading hours may exhibit sufficient reasons to make the market volatile and asymmetric during the next usual trading day i.e., from 09 : 55 IST to 15 : 30 IST.
