40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{fabricate}} and characterise TiAl/Ti 3 Al-based intermetallic composites (IMCs) reinforced with ceramic particles. Design/methodology/approach: Composites were formulated by blending commercially available powders of either TiAl or Ti 3 Al (technical grade with traces of Al and Ti) with ceramic powders (B 4 C, TiC or TiB 2) in appropriate amounts to create titanium aluminide-based matrices with 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 vol. % of B 4 C, TiC or TiB 2 discontinuous reinforcement. The powder blends were thoroughly mixed and subsequently cold compacted. Findings: Qualitative metallographic analysis of the as-densified microstructures confirmed that during densification of the composite matrix both TiAl and Ti 3 Al single phase titanium aluminide powders were transformed into various intermetallic phases (TiAl, Ti 3 Al and TiAl 3). Regarding the room temperature tensile properties, excellent <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> and Young’s modulus were measured in all fully dense composite samples, irrespective of their phase composition and volume fraction of reinforcement.
