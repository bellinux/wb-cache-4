60|$|The Rover {{brothers}} were three in number--Dick, {{the oldest and}} most studious; <b>Tom</b> <b>next,</b> is full of fun as an egg is full of meat, and Sam the youngest.|$|E

60|$|<b>Tom's</b> <b>next</b> {{unconscious}} blunder {{was to get}} up {{and leave}} the table just when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with uplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of beginning the blessing. Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done a thing unusual.|$|R

60|$|As old {{readers of}} this series of books know, the Rover boys were three in number, Dick being the oldest, fun-loving <b>Tom</b> <b>next,</b> and small but sturdy Sam {{bringing}} up the rear of a trio of as bright and up-to-date a set of American lads as could be found anywhere.|$|E

They were the only {{offspring}} of Anderson Rover, a former traveler and mine-owner, who, at present, was living with his brother Randolph and his sister-in-law Martha, on their beautiful farm at Valley Brook, {{in the heart of}} New York State.|$|E
6000|$|To {{those who}} have read any of the twelve {{previous}} volumes in this [...] "Rover Boys Series" [...] the three brothers will need no special introduction. For the benefit of new readers allow me to state that Dick was the oldest, fun-loving <b>Tom</b> <b>next,</b> and Sam the youngest.

6000|$|For {{the benefit}} {{of those who have}} not read the other books of this series, {{entitled}} [...] "The Rover Boys at School" [...] and [...] "The Rover Boys on the Ocean," [...] I would state that the Rover boys were three in number, Dick being the oldest, <b>Tom</b> <b>next,</b> and Sam the youngest, as already mentioned. Whether the boys were orphans or not was a question which could not be answered. Upon the death of their mother, their father, a rich mine owner and geological expert, had left the boys in the care of his brother, Randolph Rover, an eccentric gentleman who devoted his entire time to scientific farming. Mr. Anderson Rover had then journeyed to the western coast of Africa, hoping to locate some valuable gold mines {{in the heart of the}} Dark Continent. He had plunged into the interior with a number of natives, and that was the last heard of him, although Mr. Randolph Rover had made diligent inquiries concerning his whereabouts.|$|E

Before the gladiatorial matches began, he delivered a speech in which he criticised the way Reed Richards and Tony Stark were, in his view, responsible for killing his uncle, declaring himself 'ready for the Hulk's justice'- in this case, death by combat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tom</b> <b>next</b> {{relocated}} to Los Angeles {{where he started}} the theatre company, TomCats. This is where he began his directing career. After two guest star appearances on NYPD Blue and some minor roles in small independent films and television shows, including a guest star in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Mike Hammer, Private Eye with Stacy Keach and Slither.

50|$|The {{reviews from}} {{this show and}} a {{recommendation}} by Al Pacino got Tom the lead, Ralph in Clifford Odets' Awake and Sing! and Sing on Broadway with actress Frances McDormand and actor Harry Hamlin. Tom was then cast in the lead role of Broud in The Clan of the Cave Bear (1986) with Daryl Hannah and James Remar. Terrible critical notices and a cold reception from the public combined to make Clan of the Cave Bear a less than career-building move. It {{was at this point}} that he met his future wife, Lisa Greenberg, with whom he has two children: Samuel Jackson Waites and Michaela Kate Waites. <b>Tom</b> <b>next</b> played Otis the baby-stealer in ABC's All My Children for approximately 9 months, while performing Israel Horovitz's North Shore Fish at the WPA Theater in NYC alongside John Pankow, Christine Estabrook, Wendie Malick and Laura San Giacomo. Tom also made guest appearances in such popular television shows as Kojak (with Telly Savalas), Miami Vice and two episodes of The Equalizer.

Fox and Joan Jett, and was then cast as Al Capone, competing with actors like Harvey Keitel, for the film Gangland (1987) with Scott Glenn.|$|E
5000|$|In 2017, London {{decided to}} {{audition}} for America's Got Talent. Tom London's audition in Episode 1204 consisted first of having the audience members hold their phones in the air; the phones' screens subsequently changed color, alternating between red, white, and blue. Then, he had the judges pick three volunteers and host Tyra Banks to join him on the stage. Tom had the volunteers provide guesses to numerical questions about the four judges' pasts, the last of which came from Tyra typing eight digits on a calculator with her eyes closed. He then multiplied on the calculator those four numbers to get a large number: 73,928,547. He then showed a pre-recorded video depicting him holding a card with the same number. Finally, he explained that the seemingly random number actually {{directly related to the}} judges' pasts. Howie Mandel, Mel B, Heidi Klum, and Simon Cowell all voted [...] "Yes", sending Tom to the Judge Cuts. Tom London's Judge Cuts performance in Episode 1207 consisted of first having the audience members hold up photos of famous landmarks from all over the world. He first had guest judge Chris Hardwick pick one, write the name of it on a card, fold it up, and place it in his pocket. <b>Tom</b> <b>next</b> revealed an envelope taped to his back with a ticket that went to Hardwick's destination. Next, he had the four other judges pick four random landmarks they wanted to visit. Finally, he demonstrated an application on his phone that when filmed on the ticket, showed instead videos of Tom visiting the four landmarks the judges mentioned. Howie Mandel gave him a standing ovation. Tom's performance was not strong enough for the judges to send him to the Quarterfinals, eliminating him from the competition instead of Eric Jones. In an interview with Metro, {{he said that he had}} though about doing Britain's Got Talent for a long time but decided {{to audition for}} America's Got Talent as he thought the show would help him more with his dream of performing in Las Vegas.He has also performed for Richard James.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, we aimed to {{specifically}} investigate visual cognitive and visual affective ToM abilities in eBPs {{and to explore}} their relationship with basic neurocognitive functions, subsyndromal symptom severity, and indicators of illness burden. As primary outcome measures, we chose the Mental State Attribution Task (MSAT; Brüne 2003) to measure visual cognitive ToM, and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET; Baron-Cohen et al. 2001) to measure visual affective <b>ToM.</b> <b>Next,</b> {{we were interested in}} the difference of time taken to complete the ToM tasks in patients versus controls.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tom's</b> <b>next</b> {{business}} venture was {{a development}} of new homes in Emmerdale, Kings River, which divided the village, as many local people couldn't afford the prices the Kings were asking. Carl got around opposition by raffling off the showhouse and rigging the competition for local couple Marlon and Donna Windsor-Dingle (Verity Rushworth) to win, creating goodwill in the community. However, Jimmy cut corners during the development, and the showhouse was destroyed by a gas explosion at {{the launch of the}} development, killing three people. Jimmy himself was trapped in the house, with only Sadie in a position to save him - but she took the opportunity to get rid of Matthew's rival for good, pushing him to what she assumed would be his death. Jimmy survived, and when Matthew discovered the truth he furiously ended things with Sadie.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tom's</b> <b>next</b> hit {{involves}} a trip out of state. Jerry tags along, {{and when he}} becomes surly, Tom allows him to accompany him {{to the site of}} the hit itself, a cinema. There, they meet an unnamed man who becomes annoyed with their loud conversation in which Jerry describes a domestic dispute with his girlfriend, Deb. The man in the cinema tells them the story about how he and his fiancée, Vicki, the star of the low budget action film he is watching, angered the mob. After hit men assassinate Vicki via a weapons mishap on the set, he goes into hiding and loses his will to live. Moved by the story, Jerry decides to marry his girlfriend, and the two hit men rise to leave. Jerry is surprised when Tom slits the throat of the man, and Tom admonishes him to not get so emotionally involved in the stories of their victims.|$|R
