40|$|Conference Theme: Curriculum Development, Implementation, and ReviewSession 4 Students at the University of Hong Kong {{now take}} a first year general English for {{academic}} purposes course, followed by a disciplinary English course later in their degree. New disciplinary English courses for Faculty of Arts students include a number of written academic language features that did not appear in past courses. This paper focuses {{on one of these}} features: Inductive rhetoric at the paragraph level of writing, where the main idea is not summarized in <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> placed early in the paragraph. Inductive and deductive rhetoric have drawn limited interest from contemporary applied linguists, but scholars of more traditional approaches of enquiry such as contrastive rhetoric and composition studies have offered some useful insights, including that Asian writers generally prefer inductive rhetoric, while westerners generally prefer deductive rhetoric. The response by some writing instructors has been to try to teach Asians to be more deductive in their academic writing. At the whole-text level, this may be appropriate, but past research has indicated that the emphasis on deductive paragraphing (i. e., beginning each paragraph with <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>sentence)</b> in teaching and assessment may be misguided. This paper picks up from long-standing doubts about the actual use of <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> in professional academic writing. The paper theorizes why teachers of second language writing have emphasized deductive paragraph rhetoric, why inductive rhetoric in paragraphs is a feature worth teaching in humanities and social science writing courses, and then suggests what functions inductive rhetoric performs in sophisticated humanities and social science writing...|$|R
5000|$|English {{students}} are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> or [...] "main idea", preferably first, and multiple [...] "supporting" [...] or [...] "detail" [...] sentences which explain or supply evidence. One technique of this type, intended for essay writing, {{is known as}} the Schaffer paragraph. For example, the following excerpt from Dr. Samuel Johnson's Lives of the English Poets, the first sentence is the main idea: that Joseph Addison is a skilled [...] "describer of life and manners". The succeeding sentences are details that support and explain the main idea in a specific way.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the theoretical concept of English paragraph {{as opposed to}} its ambiguity in practice. As for the definition of what an ideal paragraph is, there is fairly general agreement {{that it is a}} group of several related sentences that develops one main idea and also that it is usually composed of <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>sentence,</b> supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. The clarity of the concept, however, seems very doubtful and obscure when various English pafagraphs are analyzed in view of their length and composite parts. Of the 201 expository paragraphs taken from fourteen texts representing newspapers, weekly and monthly magazines, and English textbooks for Japanese EFL learners, only 23 paragraphs are judged as ideal from the viewpoint of length, i. e. the number of sentences contained in each paragraph. Most paragraphs examined in this study are short and judged as exceptional in light of the ideal concept of the English paragraph. Furthermore, qualitative analysis of the 23 ideal examples shows that no concluding sentences are clearly stated in the paragraphs, although many of them contain <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> in various positions. These findings clearly contradict the concept of the ideal Enghsh paragraph and show the great gap between theory and practice. The concept of the English paragraph seems very clear in theory but becomes very obscure if considered practically. This suggests the difficulties we may have in teaching the concept of the English paragraph. In response to this, this paper briefly discusses how to teach paragraph writing／reading in Japanese EFL settings, because teaching the concept of English paragraph is very important for academic essay writing／reading...|$|R

The goals of the study are {{to find out how}} Whole Brain Writing Game (WBWG) stimulates the students to generate and to develop ideas writing process, to identify the constraints experienced by the students when writing and how they coped with those problems. Over six months of conducting the research; field notes, transcribed interviews, and responses from questionnaire served as the data. The results showed that the Whole Brain Writing Game (WBWG) stimulated the students to generate and to develop ideas writing process by conducting two parts: Complexors and Puzzles. Complexors gave the students hundreds of repetitions in basic writing skills. Puzzles guided the students through a set of writing patterns. When students were playing with Complexors, they worked in teams to orally create as many Complexor tasks as possible in a minute. Complexors are speed games designed to build oral fluency. Writing <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> was enormously simplified because students could speak 20 <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> in <b>a</b> row. When students were playing with Puzzles they worked individually or in teams, completing prewriting and writing tasks.

This research will be helpful for future researchers to have an understanding about teaching organization in writing. Our students' level of English proficiency in writing at tertiary level is not adequate at all. One of the major reasons for this may be ineffective teaching.

40|$|The {{increasing}} interest in sentiment classification of product reviews {{is due to}} its potential application for improving e-commerce services {{and quality of the}} products. However, in realistic e-commerce environments, the review-related data are imbalanced, and this leads to a problem in which minority class information tends to be ignored during the training phase of a classification model. To address this problem, we propose <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> sentence-based instance transfer method to process imbalanced Chinese product reviews by using an auxiliary dataset (source dataset). The proposed method incorporates a rule and supervised learning hybrid approach to identify <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> of each product review and adds the feature set of the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> to the feature space of sentiment classification. Next, to measure the transferability of instances in source dataset, a greedy algorithm based on information gain of top-N common features is used to select common features. Then, a common feature-based cosine similarity of instances between source dataset and target dataset is introduced to select the transferable instances. Furthermore, a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (Smote) based method is adopted to overcome feature space inconsistency between the source dataset and target dataset. Finally, we immigrate the instances selected in source dataset into target dataset to form a new dataset for the training of classification model. Two datasets collected from Jingdong and Dangdang are the target dataset and source dataset. The experimental results verify that, considering the ability of generalization, our proposed method helps a support vector machine (SVM) to outperform other classification methods, such as the J 48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Random Committee methods, when applied to datasets produced by resampling and Smote...|$|R

In these two concepts, overdetermination and class, this dissertation presents a new understanding of trade controls, and a new argument against their use as economic policy.

40|$|The paper {{starts with}} a {{semantic}} differentiation between the notions of <b>sentence</b> <b>topic</b> and discourse <b>topic.</b> <b>Sentence</b> <b>topic</b> is conceived of {{as part of a}} semantic predication in the sense of Y.

For restricting the context of investigation, a specific relation between discourse constituents, Elaboration, is chosen. If Elaboration holds between two discourse constituents, one of them can be identified as the explicit discourse topic with respect to the other one. Whereas an elaborating sentence - with or without <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>topic</b> - is used to infer a 'dimension' for extending the discourse topic, the role of the <b>sentence</b> <b>topic</b> if it occurs is to mark an 'index' for predication along that dimension.

This paper explores why tax reform was hotly debated in Japan throughout the 1920 s, focusing on the policies of the two main political parties. <b>Though</b> <b>a</b> <b>topic</b> rarely treated by historians, this controversy reveals a wealth of information on the concerns that lay behind policy choices in years that were marked by economic instability and social unrest; it shows, in particular, how the ruling elites tried to attenuate class conflict by enhancing the redistributive function of taxes, which had thus far been subordinated to the encouragement of rapid economic growth and the financing of state investment. While these attempts deserve attention as tentative steps towards the development of a welfare state, their limits indicate that the parties, in spite of extending the suffrage during this period, retained strong links with a restricted network of established constituents.
