5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> the Toledo Strip, the Erie Canal was built, linking New York City and the Eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes at Buffalo. The canal, {{finished}} in 1825, immediately {{became a major}} route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into boomtowns.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> the {{succession}} suggests that Offa needed to re-establish control over Mercia's traditional dependencies, {{such as the}} Hwicce and the Magonsæte. Charters dating from {{the first two years}} of Offa's reign show the Hwiccan kings as reguli, or kinglets, under his authority; and it is likely that he was also quick to gain control over the Magonsæte, for whom there is no record of an independent ruler after 740. Offa was probably able to exert control over the kingdom of Lindsey at an early date, as it appears that the independent dynasty of Lindsey had disappeared by this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{continent}} of Valentia was once {{divided between the}} Earth Goddess Mila and the Dark God Duma, siblings who split up and formed rival nations devoted to worshiping them: Mila's nation of Zofia, and Duma's nation of Rigel. The two deities, who each held extreme viewpoints on the world, ended up corrupting their subjects, and Zofia was eventually swallowed in a war triggered when its military leader, General Desaix, attempted a coup d'état. Rigel's ruler King Rudolf used this opportunity to lead Rigel's armies across Valentia {{in an attempt to}} destroy both deities. The game follows two protagonists, lifelong friends Alm and Celica, as they lead armies on opposing sides of <b>the</b> <b>conflict.</b> <b>Over</b> the course of the game, it is revealed to Alm that he is the hidden prince of Rigel, whereas Celica is both the princess of Zofia and a priestess of the goddess Mila. Despite having different goals, the two join forces and fight back against both Desaix and Rudolf. They then find the vanished Mila and launch a final assault on Duma. With Duma's defeat, both deities disappear from the world. Alm and Celica marry and unite Valentia under their rule.|$|E

25|$|The British Isles is a {{term used}} to mean the island of Great Britain plus the island of Ireland and many smaller {{surrounding}} islands, including the Isle of Man and, in some contexts, the Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey).

25|$|Division between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland pre-dates <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> the Union. To some extent, it can {{be traced}} back to the wars of religion, land and power arising out the 16th and 17th century Plantations of Ireland. In the 18th century, Ireland was ruled by a Protestant-only Irish Parliament, {{autonomous}} in some respects from Britain. Catholics and Presbyterians were denied full political and economic rights under the Penal Laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{publicity}} surrounding Gordon's killing led to {{the resignation}} of a policeman whom she had accused of framing her, and the suicide of her daughter. The Tammany Hall political machine's hold on the city was largely eliminated in the ensuing scandal, as it was already weakened by Rothstein and <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> his former empire.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> {{military}} flight activities {{has led to}} a practice of continuous tactical military provocations. Turkish aircraft regularly fly in the zones over which Greece claims control (i.e., the outer four miles of the claimed Greek airspace and the international parts of Athens FIR), while Greek aircraft constantly intercept them. Aircraft from both countries frequently engage in mock dog-fights. These operations often cause casualties and losses for both the Greek and Turkish Air Forces.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{the representatives}} of Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church signed the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, {{apparently}} resolving <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> the nature of justification which was {{at the root of}} the Protestant Reformation, although Confessional Lutherans reject this statement. This is understandable, since there is no compelling authority within them. On 18 July 2006, delegates to the World Methodist Conference voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2009, China orders 4 Zubr-class LCAC from Ukraine {{and bought}} 4 {{more from the}} Hellenic Navy (Greece). These hovercrafts/LCACs were viewed to be {{a direct threat to}} Taiwan's pro-independence {{movement}} as well as <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> Diaoyu Islands. China is continually shifting the power balance in Asia by building up its military. These machines are built to send troops and armored vehicles (tanks, etc.) onto beaches in a fast manner, acting as a landing craft.|$|E

The Nabonidus Chronicle records that, prior to the battle(s), Nabonidus had ordered cult statues from outlying Babylonian cities to be brought into the capital, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> Susa had begun possibly in the winter of 540BCE.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> slavery led to {{the split}} in the Democratic Party in the 1860 Convention. Hardline pro-slavery Southerners {{rejected}} Douglas, and nominated their own candidate, Vice President John C. Breckinridge, while the Northern Democrats nominated Douglas. Douglas deeply believed in democracy, arguing {{the will of the}} people should always be decisive. When civil war came in April 1861, he rallied his supporters to the Union cause with all his energies, but he died of typhoid fever a few weeks later.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Louisiana in 1948, Perez urged Long to reject the Truman administration's {{proposal}} of payment for these areas, which would have greatly enhanced state revenues. Perez wanted to seek a better arrangement by taking <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> jurisdiction before the United States Supreme Court, but Louisiana lost its case. The Louisiana Attorney General, Bolivar Edwards Kemp Jr., and the lieutenant governor, Bill Dodd, later said that the state should have accepted the Truman administration offer and that not doing so cost billions in lost revenues over ensuing decades.|$|E

According to a 1932 Soviet estimate, 85% of the area was rural, while only 15% was urban. This urban percentage increased to 18% by 1939 and 27% by 1959. As of 2011, 127,200 people of Nakhchivan's total population of 435,400 live in urban areas, making the urban percentage 29.2% in 2014.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} years, both empires sought {{to strengthen their}} influence in southern Italy with several campaigns. In 969, John I Tzimiskes assassinated and succeeded Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros in a military revolt. Finally recognizing Otto's imperial title, the new eastern emperor sent his niece Theophanu to Rome in 972, and she married Otto II on 14 April 972. As part of this rapprochement, <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> southern Italy was finally resolved: the Byzantine Empire accepted Otto's dominion over the principalities of Capua, Benevento and Salerno; in return the German Emperor retreated from the Byzantine possessions in Apulia and Calabria.|$|E
25|$|The Berkeley end of Telegraph Avenue, {{along with}} Sproul Plaza, {{has been the}} site of {{numerous}} protests and riots beginning in the 1960s.

Alameda County Sheriff's deputies killed one man (James Rector) and permanently blinded another (Alan Blanchard) when they fired buckshot loaded shotguns at people sitting on the roof above Telegraph Ave. At one point, protesters were chased down Telegraph as far as Willard Junior High School (now Willard Middle School) at Derby Street, with Sheriff's deputies firing teargas canisters onto the school grounds.|$|E

McCartney recorded his album {{during a period of}} depression and confusion, following John Lennon's private announcement in September 1969 that he was leaving the Beatles, and <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>over</b> its release further estranged McCartney from his bandmates.

Accusing the Azerbaijani SSR government of conducting forced Azerification of the region, the majority Armenian population, with ideological and material support from the Armenian SSR, started a movement to have the autonomous oblast transferred to the Armenian SSR. The oblast's borders were drawn to include Armenian villages and to exclude as much as possible Azerbaijani villages. The resulting district ensured an Armenian majority. In August 1987, Karabakh Armenians sent a petition for union with Armenia {{with tens of thousands of}} signatures to Moscow.|$|E
