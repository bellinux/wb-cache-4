5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E

5|$|In May 1957, Eisenhower tasked the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) {{to provide}} {{a report on the}} {{potential}} effectiveness of fallout shelters and other means of protecting the US population {{in the event of a}} nuclear war. Chaired by Horace Rowan Gaither, the PSAC team completed their study in September, publishing it officially on 7 November as Deterrence & Survival in the Nuclear Age, but today known as the Gaither Report. After ascribing an expansionist policy to the USSR, along with suggestions that they were more heavily developing their military than the US, the Report suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> significant gap in capability in the late 1950s due to spending levels.|$|E
5|$|Ip Man is {{the first}} film in the Ip Man film series. It premiered in Beijing on 10 December 2008, and was {{released}} theatrically in Hong Kong on 19 December 2008, receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences. Before the film's release, Raymond Wong announced <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sequel; a second installment titled Ip Man 2, was released in April 2010, and a third installment titled Ip Man 3 was released in 2015. Ip Man grossed over US$21 million worldwide, despite not being released in North America and most of Europe. Following its success, the film was nominated for 12 Hong Kong Film Awards, winning awards for Best Film and Best Action Choreography.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev's U.S. visit {{resulted}} in an informal agreement with U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower {{that there would be}} no firm deadline over Berlin, but <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> four-power summit to try to resolve the issue, and the premier left the U.S. to general good feelings. Khrushchev returned from the U.S. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by the Soviet leader) and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. He pushed for an immediate summit, but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} side, {{there were still}} huge numbers of Roman Catholics. Some conformed, bending with the times, hoping <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fresh reverse. Vestments were still hidden, golden candlesticks bequeathed, chalices kept. The Mass was still celebrated in some places {{alongside}} the new Communion service but was more difficult than before. Both Roman Catholic priests and laity lived a double life, apparently conforming, but avoiding taking the oath of conformity. Only as time passed did recusancy—refusal to attend Protestant services—became more common. Jesuits and seminary priests, trained in Douai and Rome to make good the losses of English priests, encouraged this.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{construction}} of a new harbour had begun, the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal Company constructed a tramway from Llanelli to Pwll colliery. Another tramway was built from Burry Port to the coal levels at New Lodge, with a branch to Kilrhos. The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in due course, so <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> tramway link from Burry Port harbour to Llanelli; the connection was eventually opened on 8 July 1837.|$|E
5|$|The {{end result}} of the air {{campaign}} against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler committed Germany to ever increasing military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched {{and was unable to}} cope with a multi-front war. By 1944, the Allies were ready to launch Operation Overlord, the invasion of Western Europe. The Battle of Britain ensured that the Western Allies had a base from which to launch the campaign and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Western Allied presence on the battlefield to meet the Soviet Red Army in central Europe {{at the end of the}} war in May 1945.|$|E

5|$|The writers created Mahone's {{character}} in the second season so <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fugitive pursuer who was not corrupt. When the writers saw {{that the number of}} antagonists was increasing, they decided to make him the alter ego of Scofield. The writers try to let Mahone inhabit a gray area, shifting the audience's sympathy for the character. Fichtner, attracted to the potential of the character, was cast as Mahone just one day before filming began for the second season; he signed on for only two seasons, but was convinced to appear in a third.|$|E
5|$|After Rollins {{suffered}} a legitimate severe knee injury at a live event, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was vacated {{and it was}} announced <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> tournament to determine a new champion at Survivor Series. On the November 9 episode of Raw, Triple H offered to give Reigns a bye to the finals of the tournament if he joined The Authority, but Reigns refused. At Survivor Series, Reigns defeated Dean Ambrose in the tournament finals to become WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H came out and attempted to congratulate Reigns, but was instead hit with a spear. This allowed Sheamus to cash in his Money in the Bank contract and quickly defeat Reigns to win the championship, resulting in Sheamus aligning with The Authority.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} defeat the RAF, the Luftwaffe adopted a {{different}} and clearer strategy of strategic bombing known as The Blitz. However, as with the campaign against the RAF, the types of targets differed radically and no sustained pressure was put under any one type of British target. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had even begun. The end result of the air campaign against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler committed Germany to ever increasing military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched {{and was unable to}} cope with a multi-front war.

50|$|Royal Cinque Ports {{had been}} planned as the {{location}} for the Open Championship in 1915, but in early in that year it <b>was</b> decided <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no championships during the remainder of World War I; the next Open Championship after the war <b>would</b> <b>be</b> held at Royal Cinque Ports. Although {{the war was over}} in November 1918, it <b>was</b> decided <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no championship in 1919. During the war, six of the greens were involved in a scheme to build a rifle range.

5|$|Hundreds of Australians {{participated in}} the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945. Ten RAAF squadrons, {{hundreds}} of Australians in RAF units and about 500Australian sailors serving with the Royal Navy formed part of the force assembled for the landing in Normandy on 6 June 1944; overall, {{it has been estimated}} that about 3000 Australian personnel took part in this operation. From 11 June until September 1944 the Spitfire-equipped No.453Squadron RAAF was often based at forward airfields in France and it and Australian light bomber and heavy bomber squadrons supported the liberation of France. RAAF light bomber and fighter squadrons continued to support the Allied armies until the end of the war in Europe by attacking strategic targets and escorting bomber formations. No.451 and 453Squadrons formed part of the British Army of Occupation in Germany from September 1945, and it was planned <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long-term Australian presence in this force. Few RAAF personnel volunteered to remain in Europe, however, and both squadrons were disbanded in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} announced <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> simultaneous release on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows {{as well as}} concurrent Japanese and American release, but this was later changed. There was also discussion of an Xbox release, but it was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB hard drive. Originally announced in January 2000 at the Yokohama Millennium Conference, {{there was a great}} deal of negative press. There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it was not clear whether the game would have a structured story, which it ended up having, and the title of Final Fantasy Online was suggested. Following an August 2001 beta test in Japan, a public Japanese beta test was done in December 2001.|$|E
5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere. However, it was revealed prior to broadcast <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> time jump in the episode. After {{it was announced that}} Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set picture on Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to the unwanted release of spoilers, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room, in which there was a picture of Robbins alive on the screen. The picture has since been taken down.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Union {{that led}} to the {{formation}} of the Kingdom of Great Britain ensured <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Protestant succession as well as a link between church and state that still remains. The Church of England (Anglican) is legally recognised as the established church, and so retains representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Lords Spiritual, whilst the British monarch is a member of the church as well as its Supreme Governor. The Church of England also retains the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration) through the General Synod that can then be passed into law by Parliament. The Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales is the second largest Christian church with around five million members, mainly in England. There are also growing Orthodox, Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, with Pentecostal churches in England now third after the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of church attendance. Other large Christian groups include Methodists and Baptists.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the trouble}} was an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble had burst in 1836–39, causing a collapse of the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented {{that it would be}} necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Khitan {{marriage}} practices {{differed from}} those of the Han Chinese in several ways. Men from the elite classes tended to marry women from the generation their senior. While this did not necessarily mean <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> large gap in ages between husband and wife, it was often the case. Among the ruling Yelü clan, the average age that boys married was sixteen, while the average age that girls married was between sixteen and twenty-two. Although rare, ages as young as twelve were recorded, for both boys and girls. A special variety of polygamy known as sororate, in which a man would marry two or more women who were sisters, was practiced among the Liao elite. Polygamy was not restricted only to sororate, with some men having three or more wives, only some of whom were sisters. Sororate continued throughout the length of the Liao dynasty, despite laws banning the practice. Over the course of the dynasty, the Liao elite moved away from polygamy and towards the Han Chinese system of having one wife and one or more concubines. This was done largely to smooth over the process of inheritance.|$|E
