[...] Its main {{features}} are a small mesh size (to exclude animals down {{to the size of}} a mouse), a curved <b>top-cap</b> (to prevent animals climbing over) and an underground foot (to prevent animals burrowing underneath).|$|E
50|$|The 807 was {{preferred}} to the similar 6L6 by amateur radio enthusiasts because high transient voltages on the 6L6's anode when operating in class C {{could cause a}} flashover between pins 2 and 3 on the octal base, whereas {{this was not a}} problem with the <b>top-cap</b> anode of the otherwise identical 807, physically distant from all the base pins.|$|E
40|$|Light {{outcoupling}} for top-emitting organic light-emitting devices {{is improved}} {{by using a}} semitransparent multilayer cathode structure of Al(2. 5 nm) Ag(0. 5 nm) Al(1 nm) Ag(0. 5 nm) Al(0. 5 nm) Ag(11 nm). In addition, an excellent transparency of 70 % is achieved with a 78 -nm-thick tris-(8 -hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq 3) film as a <b>top-capping</b> layer, which is overlaid onto the cathode. The electroluminescence intensity with this Alq 3 -covered cathode is increased {{by a factor of}} 1. 9 ∼ 3. 1 (applied voltage from 7 to 21 V) compared with the conventional cathode Al(4 nm) Ag(12 nm). This enhancement can be attributed to a gradual change of index refraction and extinction coefficient in the multilayer cathode (actually, not multilayer AlAg, but an Al:Ag alloylike configuration) and to the reduction of top Ag reflection by overlaying an Alq 3 -capping layer onto the cathode. Besides, photoluminescence of the <b>top-capping</b> Alq 3 layer is helpful to improve device luminance. © 2006 American Institute of Physics. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Even in the {{relatively}} small region of space that is the Earth's magnetosphere, ion and electron fluxes can vary by several orders of magnitude. Top-hat electrostatic analyzers currently do not possess the dynamic range required to sample plasma under all conditions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare, through computer simulation, three new electrostatic methods that would allow the sensitivity of a sensor to be varied through control of its geometric factor (GF) (much like an aperture on a camera). The methods studied were inner filter plates, split hemispherical analyzer (SHA) and <b>top-cap</b> electrode. This is the first discussion of the filter plate concept and also the first study where all three systems are studied within a common analyzer design, so that their relative merits could be fairly compared. Filter plates were found to have the important advantage that they facilitate the reduction in instrument sensitivity whilst keeping all other instrument parameters constant. However, it was discovered that filter plates have numerous disadvantages that make such a system impracticable for a top-hat electrostatic analyzer. It was found that both the <b>top-cap</b> electrode and SHA are promising variable geometric factor system (VGFS) concepts for implementation into a top-hat electrostatic analyzer, each with distinct advantages over the other...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to determine}} the damping and elastic properties of particulate materials subjected to low intensity vibration was investigated. Acceleration transmissibility through a shallow bed was measured by sensing two acceleration signals at both {{top and bottom of}} the bed using a <b>top-cap</b> mass mounted on the bed surface. An analogue model technique was employed, which enables the damping and elasticity to be identified simultaneously and conveniently, compared to existing direct experimental techniques. The effects of the model forms upon the acceleration transmissibility data were theoretically examined. From the experimental resonant characteristic curve, the loss factor and elastic modulus were deduced using the analogue model technique. The data gave a reasonable agreement with data generated by existing techniques...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} methodology {{to measure}} the stiffness of loosely packed powder beds was developed, which had not been possible using previous methods. Experiments were performed {{on a range of}} sample powders including polyethylene, rubber, glass, sand, and clay powders. Powders were placed in a vertical, open, cylindrical vessel, and subject to sweep vibration at low accelerations. Base force and acceleration were measured using an impedance head and accelerometer. Apparent mass, defined as a ratio of base force to base acceleration, measured showed a significant peak frequency. The longitudinal elastic modulus of the bed was calculated from the data. For shallow beds in which the wall friction is negligible, the peak frequency is independent of the cross-sectional area of the bed and sweep rate, but dependent on the bed height and acceleration. Data generated by the <b>top-cap</b> method agreed reasonably for cases in which the packing state was not sensitive to external force. A substantial change in elasticity was detected with changes of packing states. Furthermore, the elasticity of packed beds conforms to Kendall's fourth-order relationship with solid volume fraction over a range of packing conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this report is the upending of a {{floating}} monopile for an offshore wind turbine foundation. This is an assignment of Van Oord Dredging and Marine Contractors BV. An analytical model has been developed to simulate the upending of a monopile in MapleTM, based on the general theoretical principles {{and the experience of}} Van Oord. An experiment was then done to validate the analytical model. The MapleTM script can be used to calculate the forces of the crane for future projects. The monopile, sealed with two end-caps, is towed by a tugboat from the storage site to the installation site and is then upended by the jack-up vessel of Van Oord, the Aeolus. The end-caps guarantee buoyancy during transport and upending. After upending the end-caps are removed, either internally or externally. A conceptual design has been developed for both removal methods. With upending the vertical position of the monopile can be reached with a nett weight of the pile greater than the safe working load of the crane using the buoyant force. The minimum draught needed for the buoyant force to remain within the safe working load of the crane, determines the minimum hydrostatic pressure needed for the external removal of the bottom-cap. The <b>top-cap</b> can only be removed once the pile has been placed on the seabed, since the buoyant force is the auxiliary of the crane. As shown in figure 1, the upending of the monopile is performed, by vertically displacing the connection point between the pile and the crane. Because the crane hook is attached to the pile with a hinge, the monopile can rotate freely around this point. For the analytical model in MapleTM it is assumed that the upending process is quasi-static because the influence of the inertia is negligible. The experiment has confirmed that the inertia may indeed be neglected by showing the similarity between two scaled upending tests at different continuous hoisting velocities and the corresponding quasi-static simulation. Therefore the scaled upending correlates to the quasi-static model. It is found that, only when the lifting starts and stops, and respectively the acceleration and deceleration are relatively large, the inertia influences the upending process. Further research to refine the upending process, as well as the design of the end-caps is recommended. The hoisting speed of the crane can be optimized if the expectations of the experiment and the analytical model are confirmed in practice. The design depends on the airflow when releasing the end-cap and the internal pressure when lowering the pile towards the seabed. The internal pressure can be controlled using a pressure valve. These recommendations will lead to the optimized upending process of monopiles for offshore wind turbine foundations that are transported by towage using end-caps.
