500|$|Ian Holm {{was cast}} as Mitchell Stephens after the actor {{originally}} set {{to play the}} character, Donald Sutherland, quit the project. In casting the part, Egoyan was inspired by Holm's [...] "strangely compassionate, yet furtive and menacing" [...] performance in The Homecoming (1973). Holm explained why he accepted the role, saying, [...] "It's not often you get offered a leading role at age 65... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> in a movie," [...] and afterwards said the film is [...] "very touching" [...] and [...] "a masterpiece." [...] Holm called his part challenging, as {{it was his first}} lead, but he found Egoyan and the Canadian actors to be great to work with.|$|E
500|$|Torres {{was called}} up for Spain's Euro 2008 squad, where {{he set up}} Villa to score Spain's first goal of the tournament {{in the first game}} in the group stage against Russia. Torres came under {{criticism}} for apparently refusing to shake the hand of Spanish manager Luis Aragonés after being substituted off. He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching, saying that he was actually [...] "irritated with himself". He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain's next game, a 2–1 win over Sweden. Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1–0 victory. He said, [...] "It's just a dream come true. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> title and I hope it's the first of many. Victory in a Euro, it is almost as big as a World Cup. We are used to watching finals on television, but today we were here and we won. My job is to score goals. I want to win more titles and be the most important player in Europe and the world." [...] He was later named as a striker along with his striking partner David Villa in the Team of the Tournament.|$|E

500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E

[...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back in Paris, she was {{increasingly}} discontented with Perrin {{and the management}} of the Comédie Française. He insisted that she perform the lead in a new play, L'Aventurière by Emile Augier, a play which she thought was mediocre. When she rehearsed the play without enthusiasm, and frequently forgot her lines, she was criticized by the playwright. She responded, [...] "I know I'm bad, but not as bad as your lines." [...] The play went ahead, but was a failure. She wrote immediately to Perrin, [...] "You forced me to play when I was not ready... what I foresaw came to pass... <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> failure at the Comédie and my last." [...] She sent a resignation letter to Perrin, made copies, and sent them to the major newspapers. Perrin sued her for breach of contract; the court ordered her to pay 100,000 francs, plus interest, and she lost her accrued pension of 43,000 francs. She did not settle the debt until 1900. Later, however, when the Comédie Française theater was nearly destroyed by fire, she allowed her old troupe to use her own theater.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, [...] "Good for You" [...] was not {{intended}} to be the lead single from Revival. Michaels and Tranter thought the song would [...] "never be a single in a million years", and was better suited as an album track, though Gomez insisted: [...] "Nope, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> single, motherfucker". Interscope CEO John Janick also questioned its strength as a lead single, as well as Gomez's collaboration with Rocky, which he felt may be perceived as odd. Gomez did not want the lead single to be [...] "the obvious, huge song", and instead wanted it to set the tone for Revival and a new phase in her artistry. In an interview for iHeartRadio, she explained: [...] "I have become more comfortable with my sexuality, and who I am, and my body, and I feel really proud of that. That's why it was the one to kick off the album". As a result, besides serving as the first single from the album, the song also was the first by Gomez to be released through Interscope and Polydor Records. She created anticipation for its release, posting several teasers in her Instagram account. On June 12, 2015, the singer announced that the song would be released ten days later.|$|E
