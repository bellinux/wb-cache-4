5|$|Rialto paid Burton by monthly {{checks for}} the first four months. Burton {{received}} the first check on November 22. Burton indorsed and deposited <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> at Riggs National Bank in Washington, D.C., which in turn sent <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> to Rialto's bank, the Commonwealth Trust Company in St. Louis, Missouri, for payment. The last $500 was paid in cash to Burton in person, at Rialto's office in St. Louis, on March 26, 1903, after which Burton's representation of Rialto terminated.|$|E
5|$|A {{federal grand}} jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri was already {{investigating}} the Brooks Brokerage Company, with which Dennis, the President of Rialto, was associated. Witnesses against Burton at the grand jury included Chief Post Office Inspector William E. Cochran, Dennis, and W.B. Mehaney, the Vice President of Rialto. About two weeks before Burton's indictment, the grand jury came into possession of <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> from Rialto to Burton.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian Transport Ministry {{said that}} if the {{aircraft}} showed signs of problems, <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> would be expanded to cover all 737s operating in Indonesia. On 5 March, it was reported that five of the six aircraft had returned to normal operations, but the sixth was still undergoing a full maintenance overhaul at maintenance, repair and overhaul firm, GMF AeroAsia facility. Adam Air had resumed its normal schedule by 9 March 2007.|$|E
50|$|Generate a {{check digit}} for 232346:c is 2, so <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit is inv(2), which is 3.Validate <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit 2363:c is zero, so <b>the</b> <b>check</b> is correct.|$|R
5000|$|Blocking <b>the</b> <b>check.</b> This {{will only}} work if <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> piece is a queen, rook or bishop {{and there is}} at least one empty square in the line between this <b>checking</b> piece and <b>the</b> <b>checked</b> king. Blocking a check is done by moving a piece to a square in line in between <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> piece and <b>the</b> <b>checked</b> king. (<b>The</b> {{blocking}} piece is then pinned to the king by the attacking piece.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{remainder}} is <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit. If <b>the</b> remainder is 10, <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit is X. In this example, {{the remainder}} is 10, so <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit is transliterated as X.|$|R
5|$|Seven months later, Carl {{shows his}} boss that Frank has been forging checks all over western Europe and asks {{permission}} to go to Europe to look for him. When his boss refuses, Carl brings Frank's checks to printing professionals who claim that <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> were printed in France. From an interview with Frank's mother, Carl remembers that she was actually born in Montrichard, France. He goes there and locates Frank, and tells him that the French police will kill him {{if he does not}} go with Carl quietly. Frank assumes he is lying at first, but Carl promises Frank he would never lie to him, and Carl takes him outside, where the French police escort him to prison.|$|E
5|$|Funding on the paving project between Buck Hill and the {{boundary}} of the national lakeshore was held up, pending passage of a technical corrections bill by the US Senate. The original funding authorization specified that sections were being repaved; instead they were being paved {{for the first time}} or realigned. A technical corrections bill solved the legal hurdles involved. The road commission used state matching grants from the Michigan Department of Transportation to complete the financing needed to pave the roadway. Local officials received <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> to pay for the projects at a ceremony in August 2008. While the county completed a segment on their own in 2006, the 2008 projects paved segments of the roadway outside of the national lakeshore boundaries from Buck Hill northwards. Construction in 2009 and 2010 completed the roadway inside the park boundaries, including a new bridge over the Hurricane River.|$|E
5|$|The scene then flashes {{forward to}} a plane {{returning}} Frank home from prison, where Carl informs him that his father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane {{and goes back to}} his old house, where he finds his mother with the man she left his father for, as well as a girl who Frank realizes is his half-sister. Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces the FBI to offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, which Frank accepts. While working at the FBI, Frank misses the thrill of the chase and even attempts to fly as an airline pilot again. He is cornered by Carl, who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him. On the following Monday, Carl is nervous that Frank has not yet arrived at work. However, Frank eventually arrives and they discuss their next case.|$|E
5000|$|The person {{preparing}} a <b>check</b> positions <b>the</b> <b>check</b> in <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer so its print-heads are centered {{over the field}} on <b>the</b> <b>check</b> where <b>the</b> amount of <b>the</b> <b>check</b> would otherwise be written out in words. Using a series of levers or buttons on the checkwriter's control panel, the operator enters the monetary amount of <b>the</b> <b>check.</b> This amount is then printed onto <b>the</b> <b>check</b> by <b>the</b> operator pulling a lever {{on the side of}} the unit (or by pressing a button on electric units). This brings the print-heads down upon a wide inked (usually multicolor) ribbon through which they print the selected amount on <b>the</b> <b>check,</b> with a prefix and suffix to prevent a fraudster from adding extra digits. Entering $6,762.64, for example, will produce text reading [...] "TheSum6762dol's64cts".|$|R
50|$|Gaining tempo may be achieved, for example, by {{developing}} a piece while delivering check, though here, too, if <b>the</b> <b>check</b> can be countered {{by the development of}} a piece, the net result may be nil. If <b>the</b> <b>check</b> can be blocked by a useful pawn move which also drives <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> piece away, <b>the</b> <b>check</b> may even lose a tempo.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer guessed {{correctly}} at any point, {{the game}} {{ended with the}} audience member winning all prizes accumulated to that point and <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer earned <b>the</b> chance to place a fourth digit in their check. James then asked one last question to the gallery contestants. The correct respondent tried to guess the final digit selected by <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer for <b>the</b> thousands digit in their <b>check.</b> If successful, <b>the</b> respondent became <b>the</b> new <b>check</b> writer. If <b>the</b> correct digit was not guessed, the number was placed in <b>the</b> <b>check</b> and <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer won that amount in cash.|$|R
25|$|The {{banks that}} had {{originated}} <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> were keen {{to ensure the}} depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> had been received and endorsed by the check's payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not {{be held liable for}} the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customers' accounts.|$|E

25|$|Two {{months after}} the coup, the junta issued a white paper {{identifying}} many reasons for the coup, including corruption, abuse of power, lack of integrity, interference in <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> and balances system, human rights violations, and destroying {{the unity of the}} people.|$|E
5000|$|However, it is {{possible}} to divide Sichuanese into four sub-dialects according to the preservation or distribution of <b>the</b> Middle Chinese <b>checked</b> tone: <b>the</b> Minjiang dialect (...) which preserves <b>the</b> <b>checked</b> tone, <b>the</b> Chengdu-Chongqing dialect (...) in which <b>the</b> <b>checked</b> tone has merged into the light level tone, the Renshou-Fushun dialect (...) which merges <b>the</b> <b>checked</b> tone into <b>the</b> departing tone, and the Ya'an-Shimian dialect (...) in which <b>the</b> <b>checked</b> tone is merged into the dark level tone.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>check</b> {{writer was}} able to {{complete}} three digits in their <b>check,</b> <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer played a game against a studio audience member. The audience member was shown four prizes and their values, and asked to pick one. <b>The</b> <b>check</b> writer had to guess the prize the audience member selected. If incorrect, the audience member won that prize, and the process repeated with the remaining prizes. If <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer incorrectly guessed three times, <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer lost their position and the audience member won all four prizes.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that in some}} places, for a {{criminal}} prosecution on a bad check, there must be “fraud” involved. In some U.S. states, if <b>the</b> <b>check</b> drawer informs <b>the</b> party they are uttering <b>the</b> <b>check</b> to {{that it will not}} clear at the current time (such as asking someone to “hold” a check for a few days), if <b>the</b> <b>check</b> bounces, they can still be sued for the value of <b>the</b> <b>check,</b> but warning <b>the</b> recipient before acceptance that <b>the</b> <b>check</b> will not clear immediately negates the element of fraud and prevents criminal prosecution.|$|R
25|$|The {{investigation}} by the FBI, which cleared Barker's bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication {{of members of the}} CRP, to whom <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> had been delivered. Those individuals were the Committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, Hugh Sloan.|$|E
25|$|On one {{occasion}} in early 1945, a check was written to King Neptune for his upkeep. The bank asked Lingle {{to obtain the}} pig's endorsement to cash <b>the</b> <b>checks.</b> Lingle was promoted to Chief Petty Officer {{as a result of}} his fund raising efforts with Neptune.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the county}} judge and commissioners, the other {{elective}} offices {{found in most}} counties include the county attorney, county and district clerks, county treasurer, sheriff, tax assessor-collector, justices of the peace, and constables. As a part of <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> and balances system, counties have an auditor appointed by the district courts.|$|E
5000|$|Nonetheless, if [...] "the {{customer}} {{has given}} notice {{to the bank}} of the postdating describing <b>the</b> <b>check</b> with reasonable certainty" [...] the Uniform Commercial Code requires that the notice to be honored. In practice, whether <b>the</b> <b>check</b> writer has any redress against the financial institution where the payee deposited <b>the</b> <b>check</b> may depend on whether it can be shown that <b>the</b> <b>check</b> was accepted over the counter without examination.|$|R
5000|$|A {{person who}} {{physically}} writes a <b>check</b> or cheque. <b>The</b> <b>check</b> writer {{is also known}} as the [...] "", [...] "signer", [...] "maker", the drawer, or the [...] "account holder". The signer or presenter of <b>the</b> <b>check,</b> or person who prints and authorizes <b>the</b> <b>check.</b>|$|R
50|$|When a bad <b>check</b> is negotiated, <b>the</b> {{recipient}} of <b>the</b> <b>check</b> {{may choose to}} take action against the drawer. The action that is taken may be civil or criminal, depending on the amount of <b>the</b> <b>check</b> and <b>the</b> laws in the jurisdiction where <b>the</b> <b>check</b> is drawn.|$|R
25|$|Deep {{learning}} often uses convolutional {{neural networks}} (CNNs), whose origins {{can be traced}} back to the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980. In 1989, Yann LeCun and colleagues applied backpropagation to such an architecture. In the early 2000s, in an industrial application CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> written in the US.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with s Kris Aquino in early 2009, Nina stated that she would file an estafa (fraud) case against ex-boyfriend Nyoy Volante's parents Evangeline and Oliver for not paying their debts. She added that in 2007, the couple borrowed ₱1.4 million from her. The following year, Oliver issued several checks as payment for their debt. Some of <b>the</b> <b>checks,</b> however, bounced, she said. She further stated that in July 2008, she entered into a compromise agreement with the couple under which Evangeline immediately paid her ₱300,000 in cash. The couple also agreed {{to settle the balance}} of ₱1.1 million in monthly installments—from August 20, 2008 to February 20, 2010. They later gave her nineteen postdated checks which were signed by Oliver. Nina said that although she was able to cash some of <b>the</b> <b>checks,</b> some—which totaled ₱550,000—were not honored due to insufficient funds.|$|E
25|$|At {{approximately}} 11:30 p.m. on November 14, 2006, Community Service Officers were conducting routine {{checks of}} students' BruinCard IDs in Powell Library. UCPD Assistant Chief of Police Jeff Young said <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> are a standard procedure in the 24-hour library after 11:00 p.m., when {{use of the}} library is restricted to staff, faculty and students.|$|E
50|$|The {{reasons for}} receipt of bad checks mostly {{relate to the}} party issuing <b>the</b> <b>check</b> not having {{sufficient}} funds available in the amount presented for withdrawal from <b>the</b> <b>checking</b> account. Other reasons that checks may not be honored include the account holder cancelling <b>the</b> <b>check</b> to deliberately withhold payment; the account holder's funds being frozen; the account not actually existing due to a false check being presented; and damage to <b>the</b> <b>check.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, cashier's {{checks are}} often forged in fraud schemes. The {{recipient}} of <b>the</b> <b>check</b> can deposit <b>the</b> <b>check</b> {{in his or}} her account, withdraw funds under next-day availability, and assume that <b>the</b> <b>check</b> is good. <b>The</b> <b>check</b> can take weeks to clear the banks. So the bank can discover that a check is fraudulent weeks after the customer has withdrawn the funds, and the customer is then legally liable for the cash already withdrawn.|$|R
5000|$|The result (3) is <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit. In {{case the}} sum of digits ends in 0 then 0 is <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit.|$|R
25|$|On 20 December the Ministry of Environment {{announced}} an extra program {{to monitor the}} impact of radiation exposure on children born to mothers in Fukushima Prefecture, to find links between the mothers' radiation exposure and congenital abnormalities, asthma, allergies or other diseases of their children. <b>The</b> <b>checks</b> would stop when the children reach the age of 13. No health effects of this nature are expected to rise {{as a result of}} the incident.|$|E
25|$|To {{sum up the}} defense: {{the defender}} should keep his king {{in front of the}} {{opposing}} pawn and keep his rook on the third rank until the pawn advances to that rank, then go {{to the far end of}} the board (the seventh or eighth rank) and check the king from behind. If the attacker tries to get his king to his sixth rank by moving his rook to that rank first to block <b>the</b> <b>checks,</b> the defender simply exchanges rooks and has a drawn king and pawn versus king endgame.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{errors are}} {{attributed}} to mistakes made by individuals who may be penalized for these mistakes. The usual approach to correct the errors is to create new rules with additional checking steps in the system, aiming to prevent further errors. As an example, an error of free flow IV administration of heparin is approached by teaching staff {{how to use the}} IV systems and to use special care in setting the IV pump. While overall errors become less likely, <b>the</b> <b>checks</b> add to workload and may in themselves be a cause of additional errors.|$|E
50|$|On April 28, 1936, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia mailed a {{check for}} $24.20, drawn on the Treasurer of the United States, to Clair Barner. <b>The</b> <b>check</b> was Barner's paycheck from the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Barner never {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>check,</b> which was stolen by an unknown party. The thief forged Barner's signature and cashed <b>the</b> <b>check</b> at <b>the</b> J.C. Penney department store in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, where the thief assumed the identity of Mr. Barner. J.C. Penney then turned <b>the</b> <b>check</b> over to Clearfield Trust Co. as its collection agent. Clearfield Trust Co. collected <b>the</b> <b>check</b> from <b>the</b> Federal Reserve Bank, knowing nothing about the forgery.|$|R
5000|$|If {{there is}} no {{remainder}} <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit is 0, otherwise the remainder value is subtracted from 11 to give <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a MICR line that is {{illegible}} or torn, <b>the</b> <b>check</b> can still be processed without <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit. Typically, a repair strip or sleeve is attached to <b>the</b> <b>check,</b> then a new MICR line is imprinted. Either 021200025 or 0212-0002 (with a hyphen, but no check digit) may be printed, and both are 9 digits. <b>The</b> former (with <b>check</b> digit) is preferred to ensure better accuracy, but requires computing <b>the</b> <b>check</b> digit, while <b>the</b> latter is easily determined by inspection of the fraction, with minimal clerical handling.|$|R
