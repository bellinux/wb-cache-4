5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a jaw of Sudamerica. Because {{some of this}} jaw's features {{were thought to be}} incompatible with a multituberculate identity, they regarded gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) as Mammalia incertae sedis. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) and multituberculates. <b>The</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> partially due to disagreement over the assignment of two upper premolars and the jaw fragment described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996; Gurovich and Beck identify these as Ferugliotherium, while Kielan-Jaworowska and others regard them as indeterminate multituberculates.|$|E
25|$|The Pirahã {{language}} is most notable {{as the subject}} of various controversial claims; for example, that it provides evidence for linguistic relativity. <b>The</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> compounded by the sheer difficulty of learning the language; the number of linguists with field experience in Pirahã is very small.|$|E
25|$|Opinions partly differ about {{sleep in}} migratory birds. <b>The</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> mainly {{about whether they}} can sleep while flying or not.

25|$|Economists and {{economic}} historians are almost evenly split {{as to whether}} the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression. Today <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz add non-monetary explanations.|$|E
25|$|Responsibility for {{enforcement}} of the qanuns rests both with the National Police and with a special Sharia police force unique to Aceh, known as the Wilayatul Hisbah (Sharia Authority). All of the qanuns provide for penalties including fines, imprisonment, and caning, the latter a punishment unknown {{in most parts of}} Indonesia. Between mid-2005 and early 2007, at least 135 people were caned in Aceh for transgressing the qanuns. In April 2016, a 60-year-old non-Muslim woman was sentenced to 30 lashes for selling alcohol drinks. <b>The</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> that qanun is not allowed for non-Muslim person, and national law should be used instead as in other parts of Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to {{fluoridation}} {{has existed}} since its initiation in the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, conspiracy theorists claimed that fluoridation was a communist plot to undermine American public health. In recent years water fluoridation {{has become a}} prevalent health and political issue in many countries, resulting in some countries and communities discontinuing its use while others have expanded it. <b>The</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> propelled by a significant public opposition supported by a minority of professionals, which include researchers, dental and medical professionals, alternative medical practitioners, health food enthusiasts, a few religious groups (mostly Christian Scientists in the U.S.), and occasionally consumer groups and environmentalists. Organized political opposition has come from libertarians, the John Birch Society, and from groups like the Green parties in the UK and New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Lyme Disease {{was first}} {{described}} in Europe in 1883, the 1970s in North America and 1982 in Australia. It is an illness {{caused by a}} spiral bacterium called a spirochaete. The most common name for this spirochaete is Borrelia burgdorferi, but many different Borrelia species cause Lyme Disease worldwide. An Australian spirochaete has not been found in humans yet, and may be quite different from Borrelia burgdorferi. Despite clinical case reports, it is still controversial as to whether Lyme disease can be contracted in Australia. Some doctors and health authorities believe it does, while others are adamant that it does not. Until <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> resolved patients with suspected Lyme-like Disease should be treated with an appropriate course of antibiotics because early treatment of Lyme Disease invariably results in a complete cure.|$|E
25|$|One {{of several}} {{issues that have}} risen from <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> the issue of blood lineage and {{government}} records in regards to determining tribal membership. Historians have noted that before the Dawes Commission, the Cherokee have included people from previous rolls and people of non-Cherokee descent {{as members of the}} nation, from former captives to members by adoption. The Delaware and Shawnee tribes, two non-Cherokee tribes, are members of the Cherokee Nation via the Delaware Agreement of 1867 and the Shawnee Agreement of 1869. Another issue is that of a tribe's breaking a treaty protected by Article Six of the United States Constitution. Daniel F. Littlefield Jr., director of the Sequoyah Research Center at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, stated that the Treaty of 1866 granted freedmen their rights as citizens, and the case should not be made into a racial issue.|$|E

[...] "t this point we're not sure when the record will come out and in what form.

Comparisons were made with the Dreyfus affair of 1894, when a French-Jewish army captain was found guilty of treason based on a forgery.

500|$|Johnson had {{the matter}} investigated, and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader {{statistics}} re-checked, discovered {{only the first}} game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested actual batting average at [...]385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Initially Lajoie refused the car but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, [...] "I am glad that I won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I have no one to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, I am glad that <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> <b>is</b> over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success." ...|$|E
