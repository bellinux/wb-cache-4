After Patroklus is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge. Hector {{and his younger brother}} Troilus are killed, to the grief of everyone in Troy.

500|$|In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas {{was married}} to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia (her first name was usually {{shortened}} to [...] "Kasturba", and affectionately to [...] "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the {{custom of the region}} at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I used <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} mixed reviews. [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{compared the}} song to [...] "Diva", stating that [...] "Video Phone" [...] is [...] "Almost equally weird, but much better, [...] introduces {{us to the}} unlikely figure of Beyoncé Knowles, amateur pornographer: 'You want me naked? If you like this position you can tape it.' She doesn't make for the world's most believable Reader's Wife, but it doesn't matter, because the spare, eerie backdrop of groans and echoing electronics is so thrilling." [...] A writer of Rolling Stone said that Knowles sings in a [...] "dirty groove on the slippery" [...] song. Colin Mcguire from PopMatters wrote that [...] "'Video Phone' is sexy enough {{to the point where}} it almost becomes uncomfortable <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> listening back to this with her father in the room." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the song ended the album abruptly. Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix noted that the song was [...] "smutty" [...] for an artist like Knowles. J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post chose the song as a highlight on I Am... Sasha Fierce saying, [...] "The moaning, groaning 'Video Phone' positions Beyoncé as the star of a sex tape set to a thrillingly spare soundtrack that sounds like a Nine Inch Nails instrumental." [...] A negative review for the song was given by Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald who described it as [...] "awful".|$|E
500|$|Teaching {{was one of}} the few careers {{then open}} to educated working-class girls, and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of £25 that enabled her to begin her training. For half the week she {{attended}} the Manchester Day Training College, and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School. Her classroom approach—she sought to interest her pupils, rather than impose learning by rote—led to frequent clashes with her superiors, and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching. At the college, where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of Robert Blatchford. By this time she was impatient with religion; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute. At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and at one of her first branch meetings encountered Katherine Bruce Glasier, whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact. Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague George Middleton that Glasier had [...] "brought me into the Socialist movement... It always makes me humble <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> indomitable courage". After meeting the suffragist Hannah Mitchell, Wilkinson took up the cause of women's suffrage, the major women's rights issue of the day. Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets and putting up posters, she made a considerable impression on Mitchell, who later remembered her as [...] "brilliant and gifted".|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} later a fifth {{member of the group}} who {{recorded}} the encounter released the video which showed the encounter to be consensual. The 5 minute video showed Ndonye having sex with two of the men. Ndonye admitted that the sex was consensual and said that she had lied because she did not want her boyfriend <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as a [...] "slut". All charges were subsequently dropped and Bedward was reinstated at Hofstra.|$|E

2500|$|That autumn, in {{an attempt}} to save his marriage, Frédéric {{returned}} to Paris with Alice; he was unsuccessful. Alice visited Frédéric's mother: revealing that {{she was in love with}} de Trafford, she asked her help in obtaining a divorce. Her mother-in-law advised her <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two daughters and do nothing she might later regret. Alice soon returned to Kenya and her lover. Hoping to keep Alice's extramarital affair from becoming a scandal, her mother-in-law loaned Alice a furnished flat in a quiet street in Paris to use as a [...] "love nest" [...] with de Trafford. Under pressure by his family, Frédéric quickly sued for divorce.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{his most}} {{significant}} relationships throughout the show is with Nicole Wallace, a brilliant con artist and serial killer who is first introduced in the episode [...] "Anti-Thesis". Wallace {{is one of the}} few criminals Goren encounters who is able to outwit him and even get to him emotionally, particularly by confronting him about his unhappy childhood. Goren comes <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as his [...] "white whale". When Wallace murders his brother Frank, Goren is convinced that she is trying to destroy him at last; it turns out, however, that she was manipulated and murdered by the true mastermind of the plot - his old mentor, Declan Gage.|$|E
2500|$|Brazilian {{musician}} Caetano Veloso {{wrote about}} Miranda's legacy in a New York Times essay, [...] "For generations of musicians who were {{adolescents in the}} second half of the 1950s and became adults at the height of the Brazilian military dictatorship and the international wave of counterculture - my generation - Carmen Miranda was first a cause of both pride and shame, and later, a symbol that inspired the merciless gaze we began to cast upon ourselves; Carmen conquered 'white' America as no other South American has done or ever would, in an era when it was enough to be 'recognizable Latin and Negroid' in style and aesthetics to attract attention." [...] For Veloso and other musicians contemplating a career abroad, Miranda's pioneering experiences continue to loom as a point of reference. Miranda helped establish and transform the relationship between Brazilian musicians and American producers that now has created several remarkable transnational collaborations... <b>To</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> is to think about the complexity of this relationship".|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, Itō's book ,'appeared in {{the series}} [...] "The Present State of Women's Poetry," [...] which was {{published}} by the Japanese publisher Shichōsha and also featured a number of rising young female poets, including Toshiko Hirata, Yōko Isaka, and Kōko Shiraishi. [...] In the mid-1980s, Itō's writing gravitated to issues of the feminine body, sexuality, and motherhood, making her the most prominent voice of {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "women's poetry boom." [...] The two collections , published in 1985, and , published in 1987, describe her feelings after giving birth to her first daughter, Kanoko Nishi. [...] These poems probe the meaning of the mother-child relationship and the demands that motherhood places on the mother's identity and sexuality. [...] For instance, in the often anthologized poem , she describes the feelings of a young mother experiencing postpartum depression and anger at her newborn, even though the world is congratulating her on becoming a mother. [...] Her eagerness to explore women's issues has led some <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as a feminist writer, although this is a term that Itō has not always embraced in building her public persona.|$|E
2500|$|While Tyler herself {{does not}} like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> novels in terms of themes, {{numerous}} reviewers and scholars have noted {{the importance of family}} and marriage relationships to her characters and stories. Liesl Schillinger summarized: “Taken together, the distinct but overlapping worlds of her novels have formed a Sensurround literary record of the 20th century American family—or, at least, of the proud but troubled archetypal families that…interested her most." [...] Michiko Kakutani, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for The New York Times, has been reviewing Tyler novels for over 25 years. [...] She has frequently noted Tyler’s themes with regard to family and marriage. [...] Reviewing Noah's Compass, Kakutani states that “the central concern of most of this author’s characters has always been their need to define themselves in terms of family — {{the degree to which they}} see themselves as creatures shaped by genetics, childhood memories and parental and spousal expectations, and the degree to which they are driven to embrace independent identities of their own.”. This is an example of where Anne Tyler got some of her characteristics from, being able to be independent and get to know herself through her writing.|$|E
2500|$|Schneemann {{considers}} her photographic {{and body}} pieces {{to still be}} based in painting despite appearing otherwise on the surface. [...] She has described herself as [...] "A painter who has left the canvas to activate actual space and lived time." [...] She cites her studies with painter Paul Brach as teaching her to [...] "understand the stroke as an event in time" [...] and <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> performers as [...] "colors in three dimensions." [...] Schneemann took the ideas found in her figurative abstract paintings of the 1950s, where she cut and destroyed layers of paint from their surfaces, and transferred them to her photographic work Eye Body. [...] Art history professor Kristine Stiles asserts that Schneemann's entire oeuvre is devoted to exploring the concepts of figure-ground, relationality (both through use of her body), and similitude (through the use of cats and trees). [...] Stiles asserts that the issues of sex and politics in Schneemann's work merely dictate how the art is shaped, rather than the formal concepts found behind it. [...] For example, Schneemann relates the colors and movement featured in Fuses to brush strokes in painting. [...] Her 1976 piece Up to and Including Her Limits, too, invoked the gestural brush strokes of the abstract expressionists with Scheemann swinging from ropes and scribbling with crayons onto a variety of surfaces.|$|E
