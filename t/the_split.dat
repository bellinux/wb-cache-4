40|$|AbstractOperator or time {{splitting}} {{is often}} used in the numerical solution of initial boundary value problems for differential equations. It is, for example, standard practice in computational air pollution modelling where we encounter systems of three-dimensional, time-dependent partial differential equations of the advection–diffusion–reaction type. For such systems {{little attention has been}} devoted to <b>the</b> analysis of <b>splitting</b> and to <b>the</b> question why <b>splitting</b> can work so well. From the theoretical point of view, <b>the</b> success of <b>splitting</b> is primarily determined by <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> error. This paper presents an analysis of operator splitting aimed at providing insight into <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> error. Using <b>the</b> Lie operator formalism, a general expression is derived for a three-term Strang <b>splitting</b> in <b>the</b> pure initial value case. For a class of advection–diffusion–reaction problems <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> error is analyzed in greater detail. A special case is discussed in which <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> error can be reduced. Also some attention is paid to the use of operator splitting in initial boundary value problems...|$|R

We show that the size of <b>the</b> <b>splitting</b> is exponentially small if the strip of analyticity is wide enough.

5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{molecular}} {{study of}} the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period (35–30 million years ago), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil albatrosses were found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early Oligocene of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina. Similar to the last was Plotornis, formerly often considered a petrel but now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when <b>the</b> <b>split</b> between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri, both being mid-Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California.
