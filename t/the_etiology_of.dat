5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand <b>the</b> <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E

40|$|Hypercholesterolemia is a {{classical}} {{risk factor for}} cardiovascular disease development. <b>The</b> genetic <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> hypercholesterolemia in familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH), {{one of the most}} common genetic dyslipidemias, is poorly understood.

Sequencing, genotyping and computational analyses were performed in a case-control setting to better understand the ‘nature’ aspect of hypercholesterolemia in FCH. My findings suggest that FCH more likely has a polygenic basis. All my findings have shown that the genetic definition of a disease, especially relatively common diseases like FCH that have been previously considered to be monogenic, may need to be reconsidered.

25|$|Many {{drugs have}} been found that lessen the risk of {{neurotoxicity}} from NMDA receptor antagonists.

25|$|Chorea {{is another}} {{condition}} which results from {{damage to the}} basal ganglia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: While exophthalmus is {{quantifiable}} with {{readily available}} measurement tools, {{there is no}} such tool for hypoglobus/hyperglobus. Despite its possible life-threatening causes only few articles address <b>the</b> <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> vertical globe displacement in the current literature. The aim of our study was to describe <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> hypoglobus and to analyze the ratio of malignant diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 3000 portrait photographs taken in our ophthalmology department between 2005 and 2009 were retrospectively screened for patients with vertical globe displacement. Pictures were assessed by three independent ophthalmology-trained observers and matched to the diagnosis based on patient records. RESULTS: 95 patients with supposed vertical globe displacement were identified. Vertical globe displacement was due to an intracranial or orbital disease in 45 patients including 6 patients with a malignant disease. Additional 10 patients had thyroid associated orbitopathy. 11 patients turned out to have mere facial asymmetry, 26 patients had strabism and four patients had an ocular prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> hypoglobus ranges from orbital fractures to life-threatening malignant tumors. Distinction between apparent and true hypoglobus can be challenging...|$|R
25|$|The goal of all DBT {{treatment}} approaches is {{to reduce}} the ineffective action tendencies linked to dysregulated emotions. DBT is based on a biosocial theory of personality functioning in which the core problem is seen as the breakdown of the patient's cognitive, behavioral and emotional regulation systems when experiencing intense emotions. <b>The</b> <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> BPD is seen as a biological predisposition toward emotional dysregulation combined with a perceived invalidating social environment.|$|E
25|$|Disturbance of the dopaminergic {{system in}} {{the central nervous system}} has also been {{suggested}} to be involved in <b>the</b> <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> bruxism. Evidence for this comes from observations of the modifying effect of medications which alter dopamine release on bruxing activity, such as levodopa, amphetamines or nicotine. Nicotine stimulates release of dopamine, which is postulated to explain why bruxism is twice as common in smokers compared to non-smokers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of MRI is its utilization of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) sequences. MRCP provides useful information regarding <b>the</b> <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> acute pancreatitis, i.e., {{the presence of}} tiny biliary stones (choledocholithiasis or cholelithiasis) and duct anomalies. Clinical trials indicate that MRCP can be as effective a diagnostic tool for acute pancreatitis with biliary etiology as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but with the benefits of being less invasive and causing fewer complications.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Although <b>the</b> genetic <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> {{traditional}} {{cigarette smoking}} is well studied, <b>the</b> genetic <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> e-cigarette smoking {{is not fully}} elucidated. This study utilizes polygenic risk scores to examine the potential genetic overlap of traditional and e-cigarette behaviors. Each score reflects the combined effect of selected risk alleles for smoking. Method A polygenic risk score analysis was calculated using the Genes for Good (n= 258) sample and regression weight from UK Biobank (n= 19, 357). Scores were generated at six p-value thresholds, with 5 e- 8 being the most stringent. Scores were then correlated to cigarettes per day (CPD) and frequency of e-cigarette use. Results One correlation between CPD and risk scores at a p-value threshold of 5 e- 7 approached significance (p~ 0. 05). No other correlations were significant. Conclusions This is the first study, to {{the knowledge of the}} investigators, that examines <b>the</b> genetic <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> e-cigarettes. However, due to the limited sample size in this study, significant associations were not detected. As the Genes for Good study continues to grow, further investigation conducted with sufficient power would be necessary to better elucidate <b>the</b> genetic <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> e-cigarette behaviors...|$|R
