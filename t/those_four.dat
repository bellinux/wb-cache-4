Included here are raw materials, minerals, synthetic chemicals (including hazardous substances), manufactured products, food, living organisms and waste. By 2050, humanity could consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year (three times its current amount) unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption.

5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax incentives to motivate industry to reduce pollution {{and the creation of}} a new interstate compact to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. <b>Those</b> <b>four</b> states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water pollution in the Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to join in the future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E

5|$|The genus Carcharocles {{currently}} contains four species: C. auriculatus, C. angustidens, C. chubutensis, and C. megalodon. The genus {{was proposed}} by D. S. Jordan and H.

Before this, in 1960, the genus Procarcharodon was erected by French ichthyologist Edgard Casier, which included <b>those</b> <b>four</b> sharks and was considered separate from the great white shark.

The genus Palaeocarcharodon was erected alongside Procarcharodon to represent {{the beginning of the}} lineage, and, in the model wherein megalodon and the great white shark are closely related, their last common ancestor. However, it is believed to be an evolutionary dead-end and unrelated to the Carcharocles sharks by authors who reject that model.|$|E
