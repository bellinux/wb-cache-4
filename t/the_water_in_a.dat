5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear and enters <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject the shark with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but {{he manages to}} escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly, killing Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|E

25|$|For obvious reasons, the Talmud adds to {{the biblical}} {{regulations}} a prohibition against consuming poisoned animals. Similarly, the Yoreh De'ah prohibits the drinking of water, if the water had been left overnight and uncovered {{in an area where}} there might be serpents, on the basis that a serpent might have left its venom in <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> place where there is no suspicion of snakes, this prohibition does not apply (tosafos, beitzah 6a).|$|E

25|$|The {{wastewater}} {{exiting the}} anaerobic digestion facility will typically have {{elevated levels of}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). These measures of the reactivity of the effluent indicate an ability to pollute. Some of this material is termed 'hard COD', meaning it cannot be accessed by the anaerobic bacteria for conversion into biogas. If this effluent were put directly into watercourses, it would negatively affect them by causing eutrophication. As such, further treatment of the wastewater is often required. This treatment will typically be an oxidation stage wherein air is passed through <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sequencing batch reactors or reverse osmosis unit.|$|E

25|$|It is a {{commonly}} held misconception that when flushed, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> toilet bowl swirls one way if the toilet is {{north of the}} equator and the other way if south of the equator, due to the Coriolis effect – usually, counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. In reality, the direction that the water takes is much more determined by the direction that the bowl's rim jets are pointed, {{and it can be}} made to flush in either direction in either hemisphere by simply redirecting the rim jets during manufacture. On the scale of bathtubs and toilets, the Coriolis effect is too weak to be observed except under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the sky and the {{location}} of the Duat are uncertain. Egyptian texts variously describe the nighttime sun as traveling beneath the earth and within the body of Nut. The Egyptologist James P. Allen believes that these explanations of the sun's movements are dissimilar but coexisting ideas. In Allen's view, Nut represents the visible surface of the waters of Nun, with the stars floating on this surface. The sun, therefore, sails across <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circle, each night passing beyond the horizon to reach the skies that arch beneath the inverted land of the Duat. Leonard H. Lesko, however, believes that the Egyptians saw the sky as a solid canopy and described the sun as traveling through the Duat above the surface of the sky, from west to east, during the night. Joanne Conman, modifying Lesko's model, argues that this solid sky is a moving, concave dome overarching a deeply convex earth. The sun and the stars move along with this dome, and their passage below the horizon is simply their movement over areas of the earth that the Egyptians could not see. These regions would then be the Duat.|$|E

500|$|There were {{originally}} mills at Firepool and Obridge as well. Because {{of the difficulties}} of navigating past the mill pools, the Conservators of the River Tone decided to buy the mill at Firepool in December 1793 {{with a view to}} demolishing it [...] "for the benefit of the navigation", and they obtained it for just £32. In 1797, they decided to follow the same course with Obridge Mill. The mill at Creech St Michael {{was the subject of a}} court action at the King's Bench. In October 1830, while replacing the mill stones, the millers had opened the flood gates for 16 days, and built a dam across the river, thus preventing navigation.

500|$|Many of {{the male}} islanders {{utilised}} {{their knowledge of the}} Firth's currents to hire themselves out to passing vessels as maritime pilots. Their expertise was the product of a lifetime's experience on the waters of the Firth; as it was said, they had been [...] "dabbling in salt water from their childhood upwards". Indeed, the whole island was drenched in salt water thrown up by the powerful tides and storms to which it was subjected, particularly in the winter. The Statistical Account of Scotland noted that during a storm the sea level on the west of the island was more than two fathoms [...] higher than on the east side, and that the spray was thrown so high that it washed over the cliff tops [...] "and falls in such profusion as to run in rills to the opposite shore". The islanders took advantage of this phenomenon by capturing <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reservoir to power a watermill which ground their grain in the winter months. It is not now known exactly where the mill was or what happened to it. Although it is described in the Statistical Account, written in the 1790s, and a Robert Miller is listed in the 1851 census as its miller, by 1861 he had moved to farm a five-acre croft and no further mention is made of the mill in contemporary accounts.|$|E
