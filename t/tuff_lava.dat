University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 Hydrovolcanic {{activity}} in Okmok Caldera predominated on the crater floor during approximately the first 775 {{years after the}} caldera collapsed at 2050 yr. B. P. Interactions between rising magma and shallow water (< 100 m) controlled the development of lithofacies observed in the early post-caldera deposits. The distinctive lithofacies reflect the eruptive processes active as Cone D, a composite <b>tuff,</b> <b>lava</b> flow, and cinder cone, breached {{the surface of a}} lake which once covered the caldera floor. Three phases of eruptive activity constructed Cone D: first, a subaqueous cycle; second, emergent; and finally a purely subaerial strombolian and hawaiian phase built the edifice to its current height. Radiocarbon dates provide constraining ages for a catastrophic flood that emptied the 4. 3 x 10 ⁹ m³ caldera lake and exposed the subaqueous lithofacies. An effusion rate of 2. 7 x 10 ⁶ m³yr⁻¹ for this early eruptive period is calculated using eruptive volumes determined from a 5 -m resolution DEM, based on AirSAR data. The prehistoric effusion rate determined for Cone D is on the same order of magnitude as the calculated historic effusion rate of 5. 3 x 10 ⁶ m³yr⁻¹ from Cone A, based on mapped extents and thicknesses of lava flows and the cone itself...|$|E

40|$|The Dinner Creek Tuff is a mid-Miocene rhyolitic to dacitic ignimbrite, {{consisting}} of four cooling units with 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages 16 [...] 15 Ma. Previous geologists have {{suspected that the}} source of the tuff is located in northwestern Malheur County, eastern Oregon. This broad area is called the Dinner Creek Tuff Eruptive Center. This thesis summarizes field work, XRF/ICP-MS geochemistry, thin section petrography, and SEM feldspar analysis from the summers of 2015 and 2016. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to identify sources for the Dinner Creek Tuff units within the Dinner Creek Tuff Eruptive Center. The secondary purpose is to map lave flows that pre-date and post-date the Dinner Creek Tuff, and correlate them with regionally extensive volcanic units. Two volcanic centers related to the Dinner Creek Tuff were identified. The southern volcanic center, centered at Castle Rock, is a caldera and source of the Dinner Creek Tuff unit 1 (DIT 1). Rheomorphic, densely welded DIT 1 is over 300 m thick along the east side of Castle Rock. The northwestern margin of the caldera has been uplifted along faults, showing vertically foliated tuff dikes and associated mega-breccia deposits. Up to 200 m of incipiently welded tuffs, and fluvial volcanoclastic sediments were deposited on the caldera floor, which has been uplifted due to resurgence and regional extension, creating the complex structural relationships between the volcanic units. The northern volcanic center is located at Ironside Mountain, where densely welded rheomorphic Dinner Creek Tuff unit 2 (DIT 2) is exposed in outcrops over 600 m thick. The top of the DIT 2 consists of glassy, moderately welded tuff. Sources for the DIT 2 are tuff dikes along the south and western flanks of Ironside Mountain. The thick deposits of DIT 2 at Ironside Mountain indicate that the mountain is an uplifted caldera, herein named the Ironside Mountain caldera. Uplift may have been due to resurgence, but it is most likely due to normal faulting along the Border Fault, a major regional normal fault that strikes across the northern margin of the caldera. Pre-Dinner Creek <b>Tuff</b> <b>lava</b> flows occur throughout the study area, and can be correlated with the Strawberry Volcanics and the Basalt of Malheur Gorge. A distinct lava flow, herein called the Ring Butte trachy-basalt occurs within the center of the study area, and is distinct from regional lava flows. Following the eruptions of the Dinner Creek Tuff units 1 2 ̆ 6 2, aphyric basaltic-andesite and icelandite intrude into, and overlie the intra-caldera tuffs and caldera floor sediments at both calderas. These aphyric lavas are similar in appearance and stratigraphic position with the regionally extensive Hunter Creek basalt.

40|$|Abstract In this study, we {{integrate}} {{information gathered}} from surface geology and tectonics {{with the results}} of a shallow (0 – 2 km b. s. l.) seismic tomography of Vulcano Island (Italy), obtained from the analysis of local earthquakes. The observed low Vp regions correspond to caldera filling products, mainly consisting of pyroclastics, <b>tuffs,</b> <b>lava</b> flows and hyaloclastites. High-velocity anomalies represent intrusive bodies. The striking correspondence between the stratigraphy from deep wells and the calculated velocity structure allows us to reconstruct the geometry and distribution of a main intrusion and to recognize some intra-caldera depressions. The shape and location of the high and low Vp anomalies are consistent with NW–SE and N–S strikes. Eruptive centres younger than 42 kyr, as well as the structural depressions of Vulcano and of the neighbour Lipari Island, align along a N–S direction. The combined interpretation of the available structural data and of the results from the tomography suggests that magmatic reservoirs of Vulcano at shallow depth (> 0. 5 km) align along a NW–SE strike but their shape is controlled by N–S striking normal faults and/or cracks that accommodate the right-lateral movements of the NW–SE strike-slip fault system...|$|R

Investigations indicate two dif-ferent type of mineralizations, First type is gold and silver mineralizations in quartz veins emplaced in tension fractures of silici-fied dacitic lavas at Altıntepe (Arapdağ) sector. The other kind of mineralizations is related to hydrothermal alterations in dacitic tuffs at Çilektepe (Çerkeskayası or Pilavtepe) sector. Gold mineralizations are developed as stockworks and disseminations in those kind of rocks because uprising channels are tapped by silica gels. The age of volcanism based on regional geological data is between Late Oligocene and Middle Miocene. Biotite-hornblende-dacites (14. 7 + 0. 5 Ma) contain no precious metal mineral-izations and are believed to occur after ore mineralizations.
