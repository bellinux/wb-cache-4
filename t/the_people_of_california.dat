25|$|On February 7, 2012, a {{three-judge panel}} on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 2–1 {{majority}} opinion affirming the judgment in Perry v. Schwarzenegger, which declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional, saying it violated the Equal Protection Clause. The opinion, written by Judge Stephen Reinhardt and joined by Judge Michael Hawkins, states that Proposition 8 did nothing more than lessen the status and dignity of gays and lesbians, and classify their relationships and families as inferior to those of opposite-sex couples. The court found that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>California,</b> by using their initiative power to target a minority group and withdraw the right to marry they once possessed under the California State Constitution, violated the federal Constitution.|$|E

500|$|Voorhis often {{opposed the}} {{petroleum}} industry, questioning {{the need for}} the oil depletion allowance. In 1943, he was told by a Pasadena attorney that the Navy Department was planning to grant Standard Oil exclusive free drilling rights in the vast Elk Hills naval reserve in central California, then thought to be the richest oil reserve outside the Arabian Peninsula. The congressman in a speech from the House floor in May 1943 exposed the deal, which was soon cancelled. The Washington Post hailed him as a hero, and House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Carl Vinson of Georgia stated that Voorhis had performed [...] "the greatest kind of service". However, the Los Angeles Times suggested that Voorhis had harmed the war effort by depriving <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> of gasoline. In 1945, Voorhis fought a bill which would have given oil companies offshore drilling rights. The petroleum industry journal Second Issue blamed the defeat of the bill on Voorhis. Nixon biographer Roger Morris suggested that these stands led oil companies to give Nixon substantial, but surreptitious, financial assistance during the 1946 campaign against Voorhis.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{because the}} law allows private {{citizens}} to sue and collect damages from any business violating the law, there have been cases of lawyers and law firms using Proposition 65 to force monetary settlements out of California businesses. The Attorney General's office has cited several instances of settlements where plaintiff attorneys received significant awards without providing for environmental benefit to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>California,</b> resulting in the requirement of the Attorney General's approval of pre-trial Proposition 65 settlements.

2500|$|Schwarzenegger's early {{victories}} included repealing {{an unpopular}} {{increase in the}} vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later {{he began to feel}} the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>California.</b> He would later comment that [...] "no one could win if the opposition raised 160million dollars to defeat you".

2500|$|Omori and {{his colleagues}} spent time in the city {{measuring}} damaged buildings and taking photographs. [...] They were reportedly assaulted {{on more than one}} occasion. At least two authors state that Omori and colleagues were attacked on Mission Street, San Francisco by a gang of men and youths who were later hailed by the local press for their anti-Japanese racist stoning and slugging of random Japanese men, however contemporary sources indicate that one boy involved in the stoning of Dr. Omori worked for the Post Office as a messenger was fired by Postmaster Fisk of San Francisco when the Japanese Association of America protested. Other incidents alleged {{in a letter to the}} newspaper are unreferenced by any other sources, and Omori himself chose to forgive writing, [...] "referring to some trouble I had with hoodlums in San Francisco. [...] I was very glad to see that the people of Hawaii did not like to have me treated in that way, but then it did me no injury and I bear no malice. [...] There are hoodlums in all countries.

60|$|One can {{understand}} why a different theory is in favor at the South. It would be very convenient, no doubt, to the slaveholder to be permitted to transfer his slaves to the gold diggings, and gather the precious metal {{in lieu of a}} crop of cotton. But this, the policy of the whole country forbids. Congress has very justly left the decision of this very important matter to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> itself; and they have almost unanimously raised their voices against the measure. This, after all, is the really sore point in controversy between the South and the North. The fugitive slave has been, and will be given up to the legal claims of his master; and, in a vast majority {{of the people of the}} North, there is no disposition to disturb the legislative compromise that has been made of this matter. It is true that the North still owes the South a great deal more, though it may be questioned if the machinations of demagogues and the ravings of fanaticism will permit it to discharge the obligation. Penal laws should be passed, punishing those who meddle with this grave interest out of the limits of the State in which the parties reside; and energy should be shown in rendering such an act of justice effective and sure. Good-neighborhood, alone, would exact some such provision from every well-disposed community, and there cannot be a doubt that good policy coincides. The abolitionists, beyond a dispute, have only had a tendency to rivet the fetters of the slave, and to destroy the peace of the country. Emancipation has not been extended a single foot by any of their projects; while the whole South has been thrown into an attitude of hostile defiance, not only towards these misguided persons, but to their innocent and disgusted fellow-citizens. There might be a hope that the well-intentioned portion of these people, and it is both numerous and respectable, could be induced to adopt a wiser mode of procedure, were it not that dissolute politicians, who care only for the success of parties, and who make a stalking-horse of philanthropy, as they would of religion or patriotism, or any other extended feeling that happened to come within their influence, interpose their sinister schemes to keep agitation alive for their benefit. This, then, is the actual state of things, as between the North and the South; and we will take a hasty view of its probable consequences on the growth and commerce of the towns at the mouth of the Hudson.|$|E
