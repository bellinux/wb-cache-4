5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Navy {{decided that}} Nevada was <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be retained, so they {{assigned}} {{it to be a}} target ship in the atomic experiments at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 (Operation Crossroads). The ship was hit by the blast from the first atomic bomb, Able, and was left heavily damaged and radioactive. Unfit for further service, Nevada was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948.|$|E
5|$|Connected {{protected}} areas {{are important for}} the conservation of slow lorises because these primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground. Training for enforcement officials helps improve identification and the awareness of their legal protection. Sanctuaries and rescue facilities are available to provide both temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow lorises. Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have grown <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> reproduce, although the pygmy slow loris is doing well at some facilities, such as the San Diego Zoo.|$|E

40|$|In {{some cases}} {{radiocarbon}} dating {{of both the}} NaOH soluble fraction and the insoluble fractionof lacustine sediments give different ages {{as a result of}} dating errors : (1) the insoluble fraction is <b>too</b> <b>old,</b> due probably <b>to</b> contamination by <b>old</b> inactive carbon, either bedrock-derived graphite or carbonate; (2) the soluble part is also <b>too</b> <b>old,</b> due probably <b>to</b> hard-water effect or contamination by redeposited interstadial organic carbon...|$|R
5|$|Josephine, at 62, {{felt she}} was <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> travel to India, but two American {{supporters}} visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some as young as 11—were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Josephine spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.|$|E
5|$|Married couple Jared and Jerusha Hess were co-writers and {{directors}} of the 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite, and had wanted to do an animated version since the film's release. They thought animation {{was the best way}} to continue the world of Napoleon Dynamite as the original actors had grown <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> play teenage characters. Following the film's success, Fox Searchlight Pictures wanted a sequel, but the Hesses delayed due to commitments to other projects and fear that audiences would tire of the Napoleon Dynamite characters.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and {{underwent}} further refitting from 1939 to 1943. During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was anchored in Salvador as the main defense of the port, as it was <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> play {{an active part in}} the war. For the last nine years of its service life, Minas Geraes remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for scrapping in March 1954.|$|E

5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which {{he wrote a book}} to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E
5|$|Editors' own {{variation}} of dark indie guitar rock draws on influences from both older and contemporary bands. Their influences include Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, The Strokes, The Walkmen, Elbow. and R.E.M.. The band draw their musical style {{particularly from the}} latter two bands' debut albums Asleep in the Back and Murmur. While often compared to Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen by the media, the band commented that those bands are <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> {{have a major impact}} on their musical style. Upon Editors' first appearances in the British music scene, they were also heavily compared to American indie band Interpol.|$|E

5|$|Seeadler {{remained}} in East Africa {{for the next}} nine years, returning to Germany finally in January 1914. She had spent over thirteen years abroad since her 1899 modernization, the longest period of continuous overseas service of any major German warship. After arriving in Germany, she was decommissioned. She was not mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, being <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be of any fighting value. She was instead used as a mine storage hulk outside Wilhelmshaven. On 19 April 1917, her cargo of mines exploded and destroyed the ship, though there were no casualties. Her wreck was never raised for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|The Association {{itself has}} a long history, and in fact predates Manor Hall being {{originally}} formed in 1925 as the ‘Elton House Old Students’ Association’ by Winifred Armstead. In 1932, when the ladies from Elton House relocated to the newly built Manor Hall, the Association was renamed accordingly. The Association {{is run by a}} committee of volunteers and was wound up pro tem in 2005 due to incumbent committee growing <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> continue its work with members being transferred to the Wills Hall Association until such a time as new officers could be found to continue its work.|$|E
5|$|Villeneuve {{was born}} in Richelieu, a small town just outside Montreal, in the largely French-speaking {{province}} of Quebec in Canada {{and grew up in}} Berthierville. In 1970, he married Joann Barthe, with whom he had two children, Jacques and Mélanie. During his early career Villeneuve took his family on the road with him in a motorhome during the racing season, a habit which he continued to some extent during his Formula One career. He often claimed to have been born in 1952. By the time he got his break in Formula One, he was already 27 years old and took two years off his age to avoid being considered <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> make it at the highest level of motorsports.|$|E

5|$|When World War II started Jim was <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> {{be called}} up for active service, {{as well as}} having {{previously}} been disqualified on medical grounds after falling from a wall and smashing his left eardrum when 10 years old. After the cotton exchange closed {{for the duration of}} the war, Jim worked as an inspector at Napier's engineering works, which made shell cases that were later filled with explosives. He volunteered to be a fireman at night and often watched Liverpool burning from his rooftop observer's position. Between 1940 and 1942, Liverpool endured 68 air-raids, which killed or injured more than 4,500 of the population and destroyed more than 10,000 homes. After the war he worked as an inspector for Liverpool Corporation's Cleansing Department before returning to the cotton trade in 1946.|$|E
5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> be retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed {{the ending of the}} American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
5|$|At the 1860 convention, Payne {{denounced the}} right of secession, and during the Civil War that began the next year, he was a staunch {{supporter}} of the Union. Although {{he was not an}} abolitionist, he opposed the further extension of slavery. During the war, Payne used some of his wealth to help equip Ohio regiments. He was 50 years old when the war began, <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> volunteer himself, but two of his sons served in the Union Army with his blessing. After the war, Payne continued his political activity, leading the Ohio delegation to the 1872 Democratic National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Horace Greeley. He campaigned on Greeley's behalf, raising his own political profile in the process. In 1874, Payne ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from Ohio's 20th district, and was elected with a 2500-vote majority over the incumbent Republican, Richard C. Parsons.|$|E

5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{anticipated}} that Labour would legislate for two years, then seek {{a general election}} and be returned with {{a majority of the}} seats. Were this to occur, he would be 67 when that term expired, and according to him perhaps <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> hold office. With no ministerial responsibilities, he departed on a three-month tour of East Africa, hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as Colonial Secretary. As the minority Labour Government attempted to grapple with the onset of the Depression, the Conservative Party indulged in a period of internecine warfare, with Baldwin under attack in the Parliamentary Party and in the press for losing the election, and for being too moderate. Chamberlain attempted to mediate between the press lords and Baldwin, only to learn that the newspaper owners had been trying to influence local constituency organisations behind his back. During the leadership crisis, Chamberlain persuaded Conservative Party chairman John Davidson to resign to relieve the pressure on Baldwin. Chamberlain took the vacant chair himself.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after their}} {{delivery}} in 1910, both Minas Geraes and São Paulo were embroiled in the Revolt of the Lash (Revolta da Chibata), {{in which the}} crews of four Brazilian ships demanded the abolition of corporal punishment in the navy. The mutineers surrendered after four days, when a bill was passed granting amnesty to all those involved. In 1922, the two battleships were used to help put down a revolt at Fort Copacabana. Two years later, lieutenants on São Paulo mutinied but found little support from other military units, so they sailed to Montevideo, Uruguay, and obtained asylum. Minas Geraes was modernized in the 1930s, but both battleships were <b>too</b> <b>old</b> <b>to</b> participate actively in the Second World War, and instead were employed as harbor defense ships in Salvador and Recife. São Paulo was sold in 1951 to a British shipbreaker, but was lost in a storm north of the Azores while being towed to its final destination. Minas Geraes was sold to an Italian scrapper in 1953 and towed to Genoa the following year.|$|E
