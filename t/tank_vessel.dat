The hull can be seen on Google Earth just below the water's surface on a north-south orientation with the bow towards the shoreline and the stern in deeper water. In 1998 the semicircular tracks for the gun mounts were still visible in what remained of the deck.

50|$|The 1989 Exxon Valdez {{oil spill}} {{severely}} affected {{the environment of}} Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States.

Specifically, the Office of Marine Safety adopted regulations requiring <b>tank</b> <b>vessel</b> operators to submit an oil spill prevention plan for state review and approval. The United States Department of Justice led by Attorney General, Janet Reno filed suit against Washington for adopting rules {{in an area of}} law in which the United States Coast Guard had long occupied the field of regulatory activity. The basis of the suit was that the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution prohibited states from enacting legislation and rules in fields where the United States Congress intended the Coast Guard to have complete authority, particularly when such regulation could affect interstate and international commerce.|$|E
