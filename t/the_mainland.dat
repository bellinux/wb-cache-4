5|$|The King Island emu and <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> emu show few {{morphological}} differences {{other than}} their significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen {{is known to be}} variable in <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mainland</b> is {{the largest}} island of Orkney. Both of Orkney's burghs, Kirkwall and Stromness, are on this island, {{which is also the}} heart of Orkney's {{transportation}} system, with ferry and air connections to the other islands and to the outside world. The island is more densely populated (75% of Orkney's population) than the other islands and has much fertile farmland. <b>The</b> <b>Mainland</b> is split into areas called East and West Mainland. These areas are determined by whether they lie East or West of Kirkwall. The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> lies West of Kirkwall, with comparatively little land lying East of Kirkwall.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the authors}} of the 2011 genetic study, the close {{relation}} between the King Island and mainland emus indicates that the former population was isolated from the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding emu lineage that diverged from <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on <b>the</b> <b>mainland.</b> Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was isolated from the Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was initially isolated from <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> emu as is the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of the King Island emu and mainland emu. Hence, mainland emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form.|$|E
