5|$|His health declining, Baltimore's {{persistence}} over <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> finally {{paid off}} in 1632.

Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries {{to the north of}} the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay. <b>The</b> <b>charter</b> was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632.

5|$|Macdonald {{had hoped}} to award <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> for the Canadian Pacific Railway in early 1872, but {{negotiations}} dragged on {{between the government and}} the financiers. Macdonald's government awarded the Allan group <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> in late 1872. In 1873, when Parliament opened, Liberal MP Lucius Seth Huntington charged that government ministers had been bribed with large, undisclosed political contributions to award <b>the</b> <b>charter.</b> Documents soon came to light which substantiated what came to be known as the Pacific Scandal. The Allan-led financiers, who were secretly backed by the United States's Northern Pacific Railway, had donated $179,000 to the Tory election funds, they had received <b>the</b> <b>charter,</b> and Opposition newspapers began to publish telegrams signed by government ministers requesting large sums from the railway interest at the time <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> was under consideration. Macdonald had taken $45,000 in contributions from the railway interest himself. Substantial sums went to Cartier, who waged an expensive fight to try to retain his seat in Montreal East (he was defeated, but was subsequently returned for the Manitoba seat of Provencher). During the campaign Cartier had fallen ill with Bright's disease, which may have been causing his judgment to lapse; he died in May 1873 while seeking treatment in London.|$|E

5|$|About {{forty years}} after Somairle's death, a Benedictine monastery was {{established}} on Iona.

Be that as it may, there is no hard evidence linking Ragnall to the house's foundation. Since <b>the</b> <b>charter</b> reveals that the monastery received substantial endowments from throughout the meic Somairle domain, the foundation appears to have been supported by other leading members the kindred, such as Dubgall himself (if he was still alive) or his son, Donnchad. <b>The</b> <b>charter</b> placed the monastery under the protection of Pope Innocent III (died 1216), which secured its episcopal independence from the Diocese of the Isles. However, the price for the privilege of Iona's papal protection appears to have been the adoption of the Benedictine Rule, and the supersession of the centuries-old institution of Colum Cille.|$|E
