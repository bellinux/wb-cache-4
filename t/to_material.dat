5|$|A notable {{sub-type of}} coastal batik called Jawa Hokokai is not {{attributed}} to a particular region. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in early 1940, the batik industry greatly declined due <b>to</b> <b>material</b> shortages. The workshops funded by the Japanese however were able to produce extremely fine batiks called Jawa Hokokai. Common motifs of Hokokai includes Japanese cherry blossoms, butterflies, and chrysanthemums.|$|E

This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|By 2006, the {{contractor}} had encountered delays due <b>to</b> <b>material</b> and worker shortages. The initial toll rates were announced in early 2007, {{with the lowest}} toll set at 75 cents. The toll road opened on November 19 of that year. The entire cost of the expressway portion was $843 million, paid for by South Bay Expressway to own the franchise on the tolled portion of SR 125. The interchange with SR 54 was constructed with $160 million of public funding.|$|E

5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due <b>to</b> <b>material</b> excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, Rockefeller renewed {{the push}} for a parkway along the New Jersey Palisades, and teamed with {{ultimate}} PIP planner, Robert Moses, to establish and design the parkway. The plan originally {{was to have the}} PIP stretch from the Garden State Parkway, along the Hudson River, to the George Washington Bridge, and then north along its present-day route ending at the Bear Mountain Bridge. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current PIP in New York on April1, 1947. Construction on the New Jersey portion began about one year later. Construction was delayed twice due <b>to</b> <b>material</b> shortages, but that did not stop the PIP from being opened in stages during the 1940s and 1950s. The route was completed in New Jersey in 1957, and on August28, 1958, the final piece of the PIP was completed between exits5 and9 in southern Rockland County.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers <b>to</b> <b>material</b> they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Ramillies {{served as}} {{flagship}} of the Mediterranean Fleet up to 1899, and again from 1900 to 1902. After {{taking part in}} manoeuvres {{off the coast of}} Portugal, she returned to England for a refit in 1903. Upon completion, she was commissioned into the Reserve in 1905. She suffered damage while participating in combined manoeuvres the following year, and was recommissioned into the Special Service Division of the Home Fleet in 1907, becoming the Parent Ship of the 4th Division of the Home Fleet in 1910. She was relieved of that role a year later, before being reduced <b>to</b> <b>material</b> reserve at Devonport in August 1911, and stripped and laid up at Motherbank for disposal in July 1913. She was sold for scrap in October 1913 and towed to Italy to be broken up the following month.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due <b>to</b> <b>material</b> fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey work}} {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of Styx was in preparation for the mission of the unmanned New Horizons spaceprobe, which flew by the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor more bodies too small to be detected, and that the probe could be damaged by an uncharted body or ring as it traversed the system at a speed of over 13km/s; tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon Pallene, tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on <b>to</b> <b>material</b> ejected by meteoroid impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief navigational hazard. However, the New Horizons probe did not detect any smaller moons or rings, and passed through the Pluto system safely.|$|E

5|$|Calls {{from the}} local {{community}} {{to build a new}} station at 178th Street occurred as early as 1932; several of these requests came from the Jamaica Estates Association. In June 1936, the association petitioned Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia for the extension. As early as 1936, the New York City Board of Transportation (predecessor to the New York City Transit Authority and the MTA) was evaluating construction of the station along with further eastward extensions of the line, with the board's 1940 budget allocating funding for the station. Under the 1940 plans, construction of the station was set to take place between 1941 and 1945. In January 1941, city councilman James A. Burke proposed extending the line to 178th Street, in order to relieve congestion at 169th Street. Burke believed that a station could be built within the existing tunnel and trackage and cost only $100,000, while engineers from the Board of Transportation stated it would require additional tunneling and new relay tracks extending to 184th Street. In July 1941, the Board of Transportation requested funding for a new express terminal station to replace 169th Street. Construction was delayed, however, due <b>to</b> <b>material</b> shortages caused by the Great Depression, and further delayed due to the onset of World War II.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due <b>to</b> <b>material</b> failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
