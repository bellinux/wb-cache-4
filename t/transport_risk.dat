40|$|There is {{insufficient}} knowledge regarding {{the role of}} personality traits, transport-related risk cognitions and safety motivation for demand for <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> mitigation. The {{aim of this study}} is to test a model aimed to predict public demand for <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> mitigation by these psychological risk constructs. A mailed self-completion questionnaire survey was conducted in a random sample of the Norwegian population aged 18 – 65 years obtained from the Norwegian population registry (n = 1947). Results from structural equation modelling supported the hypothesis that sensation seeking, normlessness, risk cognitions and transport-related worry had mediated associations with demand for <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> mitigation through safety motivation. There were no differences in the strength of associations related to gender and age. The findings are discussed in relation to personality-entailed measures as well as the link between cognitive and emotional approaches to <b>transport</b> <b>risk.</b> (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Dangerous-goods {{shipments}} remain regulated {{despite the}} widespread {{deregulation of the}} transportation industry. This is mainly due to the societal and environmental risks associated with these shipments. One of the common tools used by governments in mitigating <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> is to close certain roads to vehicles carrying hazardous materials. In effect, the road network available to dangerous goods carriers can {{be determined by the}} government. The associated <b>transport</b> <b>risk,</b> however, is determined by the carriers' route choices. We provide a bilevel programming formulation for this network design problem.

40|$|We {{extend the}} hazmat network design problem {{to account for}} the {{time-dependent}} road closure as a policy tool in order to reduce hazmat <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> by altering carriers ’ departure times and route choices. We formulate the dynamic network design problem using an alternative-based model with each alternative representing a simultaneous path and departure time choice. A column generation-based heuristic that uses two subproblems is proposed to generate alternatives {{to be included in the}} model. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of the heuristic. The proposed framework can be used to identify alternative regulatory schemes by varying the regulator’s intervention level. Each scheme corresponds to a certain trade-off between the <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> and economic viability. To illustrate the insights that can be obtained through the use of our methodology, we present a case study based on a transportation network from Sioux Falls, South Dakota...|$|E
40|$|The {{people living}} and working around the roads used for {{hazardous}} material (hazmat) shipments face the risk of suffering undesirable consequences of an accident. The main responsibility to mitigate the hazmat <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> at a population zone belongs to the government agency with jurisdiction over that region. One of the common policy tools is to close certain road links to vehicles carrying hazmats. In effect, the road network available to dangerous goods carriers can {{be determined by the}} regulator. The <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> in the region, however, is determined by the carriers' routing decisions over the available road network. Thus, the regulator needs to make the road closure decisions so that the total risk resulting from the carriers' route choices is minimized. We provide a path-based formulation for this network design problem. Alternative solutions can be generated by varying the routing options included in the model for each shipment. Each solution corresponds to a certain compromise between the two parties in terms of <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> and economic viability. The proposed framework can be used for identifying mutually agreeable hazmat transport policies. We present two applications of the methodology to illustrate the insights that can be gained through its use: The first application focuses on hazmat shipments through the highway network of Western Ontario, Canada, whereas the second application studies the problem in a much larger geographical region that covers the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. © 2008 INFORMS...|$|E

40|$|Hazardous {{material}} {{transportation is}} one of the main concerns due to the nature of hazardous materials and their incident impacts. In general, <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> is a main attribute to develop mathematical models for hazardous material routing problem as well as network designing or improving road safety. This paper presents a chaotic-simulation based model to determine the high selected links to improve road network quality for hazardous material transportation, in which risk is considered as a chaotic variable over the network whereas a simulation technique has been applied to cover a wide range of selecting paths. A real road network, consists of fifty-nine nodes and eighty two-way edges, is used for running the mathematical model and checking validation. Due to the large amounts of hazardous material transported by trucks, the proposed methodology is focused on fuel transportation, and high selected list of edges (links) has been obtained to improve road safety. Sensitivity analysis revealed that using different seeds for generating <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> has no significant effects on finding the most frequent paths and high selected edges...|$|E
40|$|In {{the case}} of {{determining}} routes for hazardous material transportation, risk is considered as a main attribute. <b>Transport</b> <b>risk,</b> which is usually combined with other attributes such as cost or travel time, {{plays a significant role}} in determining paths for hazardous materials transportation. Since, risk is chaotically affected by road incidents, decision makers are dealing with selecting a method for defining chaotic risk factors in hazmat transportation. In this paper, <b>transport</b> <b>risk</b> has been defined as a chaotic variable using two different methods of generating chaotic patterns. In an experimental road network, which consists of eighty-nine nodes and one hundred and one two-way links, two different methods of generating chaotic variables have been used for applying the proposed procedure. In addition, results for different amounts of risk and cost have also been analyzed in case study. Results revealed that different cost and risk priorities change the frequencies of selected paths determined for hazmat transportation, but the route convergence of the route to chaos method is better than that of the logistic map equation...|$|E

40|$|Although {{transport}} outsourcing {{decision-making and}} collaborative transport management (CTM) have been “hot topics” for years, their links {{are still not}} thoroughly explored. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between them. In particular, we focus on the conflicting and complementary features of these concepts with regard to their capability to hedge against <b>transport</b> outsourcing-related <b>risks.</b> <b>Transport</b> outsourcing is often a tool for transferring part of the demand risks from the primary parties in supply chains to transport service providers. However, new relationships introduce some new risks - outsourcing contract risks. It is important to identify, estimate and compare such kinds of <b>risks.</b> <b>Transport</b> collaboration may decrease both the demand risks and the outsourcing contract risks, although the relationship with the latter is more complex.

40|$|In cargo logistics, a key {{performance}} measure is <b>transport</b> <b>risk,</b> {{defined as the}} deviation of the actual arrival time from the planned arrival time. Neither earliness nor tardiness is desirable for customer and freight forwarders. In this paper, we investigate ways to assess and forecast transport risks using a half-year of air cargo data, provided by a leading forwarder on 1336 routes served by 20 airlines. Interestingly, our preliminary data analysis shows a strong multimodal feature in the transport risks, driven by unobserved events, such as cargo missing flights. To accommodate this feature, we introduce a Bayesian nonparametric model [...] the probit stick-breaking process (PSBP) mixture model [...] for flexible estimation of the conditional (i. e., state-dependent) density function of <b>transport</b> <b>risk.</b> We demonstrate that using simpler methods, such as OLS linear regression, can lead to misleading inferences. Our model provides a tool for the forwarder to offer customized price and service quotes. It can also generate baseline airline performance to enable fair supplier evaluation. Furthermore, the method allows us to separate recurrent risks from disruption risks. This is important, because hedging strategies for these two kinds of risks are often drastically different.
