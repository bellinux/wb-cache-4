All the signals {{with the exception of}} the Down Starter (LU3) have SPT's (Signal Post <b>Telephones)</b> <b>fitted</b> to them. These allow both the driver and signalman to contact each other. Ludborough currently operates two Great Northern Railway somersault signals (LU3 down starter and LU14 Up Inner Home). These type of signals were used all over the East Lincolnshire Railway, and is appropriate for the railway's needs.|$|R

5000|$|A call {{originating}} from a <b>telephone</b> <b>fitted</b> {{with a black}} box would still be charged for by the telephone company unless some method to circumvent the call charging was deployed. Black boxes were commonly built by phone phreaks during the 1960s to 1980s (and in some places like Eastern Europe, well into the 2000s) {{in order to provide}} callers with free telephone calls. Sometimes several friends would incorporate a black box into each of their telephones to enable them to hold long conversations with each other without having to pay for them. Another use of black boxes were in the incoming modems of computers running bulletin board systems that were popular back in the 1980s and early 90s.|$|R

25|$|Telephone {{headsets}} {{connect to}} a fixed-line telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the handset of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded <b>telephones</b> are <b>fitted</b> {{with a standard}} 4P4C commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless bluetooth headsets are available, and often used with mobile telephones. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by call centre workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s {{interactive}} response systems in some industries required additional signaling beyond the ten digits. In 1968, the # key and the * key {{were added to}} the push-button dial pad, and the 2500-type telephone entered production. The additional keys were located {{on either side of the}} '0' button to fill the matrix of 4-by-3 keys. These keys were initially unused by most customers, but would later be used for vertical service codes, and voice mail menu navigation. In 1974, when modular connectors were introduced, the 2500 <b>telephone</b> was <b>fitted</b> with modular connectors for the handset cord as well as the line cord, resulting in type designations suffixed with M, e.g. 2500DM. The 2500 is still commonly encountered today and it is still produced by several companies.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{excitement}} amongst quantitative geographers about newly available datasets, characterised by high volume, velocity and variety. This phenomenon is often labelled as 'Big Data' and has contributed to methodological and empirical advances, particularly {{in the areas of}} visualisation and analysis of social networks. However, a fourth v - veracity (or lack thereof) - has been conspicuously lacking from the literature. This paper sets out to test the potential for verifying large datasets. It does this by cross-comparing three unrelated estimates of retail flows [...] - human movements from home locations to shopping centres [...] - derived from the following geo-coded sources: 1) a major mobile telephone service provider; 2) a commercial consumer survey; and 3) geotagged Twitter messages. Three spatial interaction models also provided estimates of flow: constrained and unconstrained versions of the 'gravity model' and the recently developed 'radiation model'. We found positive relationships between all data-based and theoretical sources of estimated retail flows. Based on the analysis, the mobile <b>telephone</b> data <b>fitted</b> the modelled flows and consumer survey data closely, while flows obtained directly from the Twitter data diverged from other sources. The research highlights the importance of verification in flow data derived from new sources and demonstrates methods for achieving this...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{patients}} with acute stroke, systemic thrombolysis {{needs to be}} administered within 3 hours of symptom onset. The aim {{of the present study}} was to reduce prehospital delays in a population-based intervention. Methods We performed a cluster-randomized trial with 48 zip code areas as cluster units in the catchment area of 3 inner-city hospitals in Berlin, Germany. The primary end point was time between symptom onset and hospital admission. The intervention consisted of an educational letter indicating stroke symptoms and emphasizing the importance of calling the emergency medical services. We additionally included a bookmark and sticker with the emergency medical services 9 ̆ 2 <b>telephone</b> number. We <b>fitted</b> a series of log-normal survival regression models (time to admission) with frailty terms shared by inhabitants of the same zip code area. Results: A total of 75 720 inhabitants received the intervention. Between 2004 and 2005, 741 {{patients with}} cerebrovascular events were admitted from the control areas (n = 3 D 24) and 647 from the intervention areas (n = 3 D 24). A prehospital time of 2 hours or less and 3 hours or less was achieved by 22...|$|R
50|$|Initially {{with the}} 700 series, when a {{subscriber}} (customer) ordered a wall-mounted <b>telephone,</b> the attending <b>fitter</b> {{would have to}} requisition a standard Tele. 706L, a Bracket No. 6 and a modified, stainless steel, switch-hook assembly. On site the 706 would have its case removed, the front two feet knocked out, the instrument cord removed and the dial turned round through 180 degrees. The bracket was then screwed to the wall, the baseplate mounted on the bracket and the fixed wiring, having been led in via {{a hole in the}} baseplate, was terminated in place of the instrument cord. The two metal bezels by which the case was fastened to the chassis were removed and replaced by the new switchhook assembly. This had a bridging piece, like the carrying handle, but with two large hooks to stop the handset falling to the floor. If the instrument had an early dial bezel, carrying the letters and numbers, then this too had to be rotated 180 degrees. When reassembled, the result was an untidy compromise. It looked like what it was, an upside-down 706 with its handset hanging ungainly from the bottom and the curly cord dangling beneath. It was a relief to all concerned when all the above became unnecessary with the introduction of a purpose-built instrument.|$|R
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about how {{colorectal}} cancer screening test preferences operate together with test access and navigation to influence screening adherence in primary care. Methods:We analyzed data from a randomized trial of 945 primary care patients to assess the independent effects of screening test preference for fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or colonoscopy,mailed access to FIT and colonoscopy, and <b>telephone</b> navigation for <b>FIT</b> and colonoscopy, on screening. Results: Preferencewas not associatedwith overall screening, but individualswho preferred FITweremore likely to complete FIT screening (P 0. 005), whereas those who preferred colonoscopy {{were more likely to}} perform colonoscopy screening (P 0. 032). Mailed access to FIT and colonoscopy was associated with increased overall screening (OR 2. 6,P 0. 001), due to a 29 -fold increase in FITuse. Telephone navigationwas also associated with increased overall screening (OR 2. 1, P 0. 005), mainly due to a 3 -fold increase in colonoscopy performance. We estimated that providing access and navigation for both screening tests may substantially increase screening compared with a preference-tailored approach, mainly due to increased performance of nonpreferred tests. Conclusions: Preference influences the type of screening tests completed. Test access increases FIT and navigation mainly increases colonoscopy. Screening strategies providing access and navigation to both tests may be more effective than preference-tailored approaches. Impact: Preference tailoring in colorectal cancer screening strategies should be avoided if the objective is to maximize screening rates, although other factors (e. g., costs, necessary follow-up) should also be considered.
