40|$|<b>Territorial</b> <b>Asylum</b> The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the topic of <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> as an ancient and {{withstanding}} institute of international law. The main research questions are as follows: What constitutes <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum?</b> Can it be considered a basic human right {{from the viewpoint of}} each individual? Does this right include asylum or only the opportunity to seek it? Does the state of origin have a right to respond in some way to the granting of asylum? Can it be considered an unfriendly act? This thesis is divided into six main chapters, each of which attempts to view this institute from a different perspective and answer the given questions. The first chapter separates asylum and refugee status, institutes that are often mistaken, and defines the fundamental differences between them. It also describes the historical development of asylum and the differentiation between religious, territorial, political and diplomatic asylum. The following chapter focuses on the definition of <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> and how it is described by various law dictionaries. From these definitions, society's view on <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> is conveyed. The third chapter examines the three parts of <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum,</b> which theoretically come into consideration under this institute. The three parts include: the right of the state [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Adjudication on <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> {{claims is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most difficult forms of legal decision-making, a fact which is further complicated by the lack of substantive guidance in international instruments as to minimum standards regarding the nature of the adjudicator. In this context, some States in Latin America have adopted procedures that are either carried out by their Ministries of Foreign Affairs or by inter-institutional committees where they hold prominent positions, which leads to the situation where the body charged with maintaining relations with foreign nations also has to determine whether they persecute their citizens, violate their fundamental rights or are unwilling or unable to protect them from the actions of third parties. The purpose of this article is to analyse the origins and implications of this situation and respond to the lack of research in this field, through both legal analysis and preliminary original research conducted in collaboration with NGOs working with asylum-seekers in the region. The author argues that this practice, which has recently received attention due to the Snowden case, leads to unfairness in adjudication and to the use of asylum as a foreign policy tool, consequently breaching both universal and regional legal obligations...|$|E

Introduction analyzes early history of asylum law, focusing primarily on the period of ancient Greece and Rome, and later on the asylum practice of the Church, which as an influential institution of the medieval world greatly influenced development of asylum law. To {{be able to put}} diplomatic asylum in broader context of asylum law, thesis also deals with <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> - classic form of asylum.

Thesis deals mainly with the interpretation of the necessary attributes that shaped diplomatic asylum and analyzes significant codification achievements in Latin America. A milestone in development of diplomatic asylum was the ruling of the International Court of Justice in Asylum case, put forward by Colombia and Peru, after a peruvian revolutionary, Mr. Haya de la Torre, was granted asylum in Colombian embassy in Lima, Peru in 1948.

40|$|The thesis elaborates {{upon the}} {{political}} and legal feasibility of processing asylum applications in offshore centres operated by EU member states; this shall promote legal and safe migration of asylum seekers into the European Union. The legal feasibility is determined by member states´ ability to safeguard provisions under the 1951 Geneva Convention and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The key condition for the legal feasibility of offshore asylum processing {{is the ability to}} safeguard the principle of non-refoulement. Features of member states´ initiatives for offshore processing {{as well as those of}} the operational Australian asylum system are analyzed, and their incompatibility with this principle is confirmed. Ability to fully safeguard against refoulement extra-territorially is further discussed. By analyzing the situation within the territorial Common European Asylum System, the political feasibility for creating an effective and legally feasible extra-territorial asylum procedure is assessed; this involves resettlement of confirmed refugees into the EU and readmission of failed asylum seekers. It is concluded that offshore processing of asylum applications is politically and legally unfeasible at this stage; it would require pooling of national sovereignty much beyond the extent that it now politically feasible – also, member states firstly have to address current deficiencies of the <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> system...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{basically}} concerned with asylum in European antiquity. In present day Europe {{the right to}} asylum first and foremost constitutes a complex field of political and legal discourses that are, however, rarely viewed in a larger historical perspective. Consequently, there is little academic reflection on the assumptions, components or values founding {{the basis for the}} general idea of asylum. The intention {{of this paper is to}} carry out precisely such a reflection, focusing on how asylum was originally thought out, practised and substantiated at the very outset in European culture. In this way, the motivation behind this paper stems from present circumstances, while at the same time pointing at the necessity of a historical analysis. The field of research is thus in general terms asylum i European antiquity. In recognising the broadness and complexity of the antiquity, the field of research is, however, delimited by focusing on four focal points, namely (1) the Old Testament or the Israelitic tradition, (2) Greek antiquity, (3) the New Testament and (4) Roman antiquity. Each of these focal points is being treated in separate chapters, were they are subjected to a thorough, interdisciplinary study concerned with whether and how asylum appears terminologically, philosophically, religiously as well as on a legal or in other ways practical level. In this way, the analytical scope is narrowed by delimiting the field of research to certain focal points, yet broadened by insisting on a interdisciplinary approach to the subject matter. In chapter one, dealing with the Israelitic tradition of the Old Testament, the study concludes that asylum first of all appears as a right, and is thereby linked to the legal thinking of the Pentateuch in general and to the apodictic laws in particular. More specifically, the right to asylum specified in the Pentateuch is granted to people guilty of involuntary manslaughter, protecting them against vendetta in the so-called cities of refuge. As the right to asylum is restricted to these biblical cities, the right of asylum becomes territorial. The territorial right of asylum is, however, not the only phenomenon of the Old Testament that can be linked to asylum protection; throughout the Pentateuch, the general right of the stranger is constituted through a number of commands protecting the stranger against encroachment and, in short, the stranger is thereby in many ways given the same legal status as the Israelites, as well as being included in the social teaching Yahweh demand of his people. The paper argues that the right of the stranger is closely linked to the friendship of the guest, widely acknowledged in the Mediterranean area in antiquity, and is substantiated by the vast Israelitic experience of diaspora. As such, the right of the stranger builds on a principle of reciprocity also known in the law of retaliation, lex talionis, and following the logic of reciprocity the people of Israel should thus welcome, include and treat the guest properly, because they remember (and it is their duty to remember) life in exile. In the right of the stranger, as chapter one concludes, we find an ethical obligation towards the stranger, that points towards a modern conception of asylum. Inclusion is however not the sole approach to the stranger in the Pentateuch; other passages command banishing of other peoples, intolerance and genocide. The voices of the Pentateuch concerning the stranger are thus polyphonic, but a clear voice of tolerance and inclusion are non the less identifiable. As the paper concludes in chapter two, the link between <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> and the containment of vendetta against involuntary manslaughter is rediscovered in a Greek legal context, and hence the linking is not exclusively an Israelitic phenomenon. In a Greek context, <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> is however first and foremost in post-Homeric time understood as inviolability in some Greek city states and at sacred places, denoted by the term ásylon. Inviolability is here guarantied by reference to divine jurisdiction. Beside the actual claims on territorial inviolability identified and discussed in chapter 2, asylum also appears as a distinct, literary theme in the classical Greek tragedies by respectively Aeschylos, Sophocles and Euripides. Here, the act of giving and respecting <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> in precisely city states and at sacred places constitutes a norm that reaches beyond the literary sphere, due to the mythologicalreligious character of the tragedies. It is furthermore concluded that beside denoting <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum,</b> ásylon also refers to a secular practise that is best described as personal asylum, providing inviolability to appointed citizens, typically to the so-called proxenoi representing the polis in interstate diplomacy. Finally, a few aspects from the golden age of Greek philosophy are shortly treated at the end of chapter two, first and foremost the philosophy of friendship dealt with by Aristotle and the stoics. It is concluded that the philosophical concept of friendship implicate an underlying idea about the natural fellowship of mankind, echoing the very kernel of the right of asylum, namely being committed on the well-being of - in abstract terms - the other. Having given a thorough analysis of the Greek tradition, the paper once again focuses on a Biblical context, specifically on those ethical aspects of the New Testament that most clearly implicate, or bluntly commands, other-concern. The ethics of the New Testament is initially approached by analysing the paramount reinterpretation of the Israelitic-Jewish concept of law by Jesus Christ in the Gospels, and it is made clear that the various commandments binding Israel to include, respect and love the other are fundamentally replaced (encompassed, absorbed) by the Great Commandment to love God and to love one's neighbour as oneself. By reaffirming the Great Commandment of benevolence, as well as remodelling it into the crucial point from which all morality flows, Jesus both reaffirms the teaching of the Torah and definitively breaks with the ethical position of classical, Jerusalemitic Judaism. Other-concern is hereby placed at the very centre of the ethical thinking, and as the scope of ‘the other’ is furthermore broadened by perceiving not only the neighbour, but also one’s enemy (cf. Matthew 5 : 44) as the object of Christian benevolence or unselfish love, complying with the ethical standards of the New Testament becomes first and foremost a matter of being committed to the well-being of others. In this aspect, the ethics of the New Testament can be seen as a theological completion of the philosophical thinking about a fellowship of mankind suggested in a Greek context. This thinking constitutes a radical new view on man as such, and thus becomes relevant in the analysis of asylum in especially Roman antiquity, which becomes the subject matter of the last part of the analysis in chapter four. In many ways Roman antiquity integrates the various expressions of the general idea about asylum protection identified throughout the preceding chapters of the paper. First of all it becomes clear that asylum - appears in Roman, mythological literature too - partly as Roman receptions of Biblical and Greek mythological material, partly in the dominant mythological narrative concerned with how Rome was founded. On at literary-mythological level, the paper argues, asylum constitutes a norm, and a continuation of the Greek tradition is with regard to this aspect identified. Furthermore, in the dominant mythological narrative on how Rome was founded, the Roman population is outlined from outsiders through Roman citizenship, not through ethnicity or language, and as citizenship was initially given to everyone, the borderline between Romans and ‘others’ or ‘strangers’ were from the mythological starting point blurred. The paper argues that when redirecting the perspective from mythological to historical time, the boundary between ‘Romans’ and ‘strangers’ continues to be hazy at a deeper level, as all people subjected to Rome in time were given the possibility to obtain Roman citizenship. Community is so thought of in a broader way, which is also reflected in the Roman philosophical thinking on friendship. This is clearly the case with Cicero, who builds on Aristotle and the stoics when expressing the view that man is by nature enrolled in a binding community with all other fellow human beings, a communis humani generis societas. Cicero sharpens the Aristotelian-stoic analysis of friendship and community on the basis of natural law, though still being far from the radical thinking of the New Testament where other-concern is placed before anything else. Beside reflecting on mythology, norms and community, the paper stresses that the territorial right of asylum appears in Roman antiquity too, typically denoted by the Latin term asylum. It is however made clear that one must distinguish between republican and imperial time; the paper concludes that a broadly continuation of the Greek tradition for <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> is seen in republican time, whereas the inviolability in city states and at sacred places is abandoned early in imperial time. Yet a novel variety of <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> is identified in imperial time, namely asylum in the vicinity of images of the emperor. As it was not utterly clear as to what extent this sort of ‘imperial asylum’ were provided for Roman citizens exclusively or, alternatively, thought of as a more universal means of protection, guarantying inviolability to all human beings, a discussion about the asylum right of slaves is presented at the end of chapter four. In short, the paper concludes that though criticism were definitively voiced in imperial time, slaves were - at least in theory - as non-citizens protected by the imperial asylum on equal terms with Roman citizens. Thereby the imperial asylum must be seen as an indication of the fact, that the right of asylum was in late Roman antiquity linked to human beings as such - not to citizenship - substantiated on the basis of natural law. Based on the overall analysis of asylum i European antiquity, the paper concludes that the general idea about asylum was indeed present in the antiquity, partly in different traditions (Israelitic, Greek, Roman), partly manifested within different fields (religion, mythology, literature, law). On a practical level, asylum is often put into practise by territorial rights, and though the specific minting of the rights differ in accordance with the context in which they appear - especially with regards to substantiation and scope - a structural similarity between the antique traditions studied is indeed traceable. On a more abstract level, the paper furthermore argues that the appearance of asylum in antiquity must partly be seen in relation to the development of a line of thought - be it theological or philosophical - according to which man is connected to his fellow human beings in a binding community...|$|E

40|$|The {{right of}} asylum {{is rooted in the}} history of mankind (religious {{right of asylum}} (sanctuary)) and since the {{beginning}} of the modern State it has been rooted in the sovereignty of the State itself (the right of <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum).</b> The State retains the right to grant its protection to certain non-nationals or stateless persons, as a consequence of its territorial sovereignty, once the conditions laid down by the State have been complied with. In principle, it is the sovereign State itself which decides in which circumstances a person deserves such protection. 1 Refugee status, on the other hand, is a concept which arose in international law in the 20 th century and is defined through international agreements. It protects certain persons, especially when they have had to flee from the countries of their nationality or their habitual residence owing to a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons which concern their race, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinions. 2 Despite the underlying humanitarian principles, there is no doubt that the granting of asylum is intimately connected with politics at all levels. 3 Therefore the term political asylum is also used. As far as refugee status is concerned, the treaty instruments are the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (further referred to as the 1951 Geneva Convention) 4 and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (further referred to as the 1967 New York Protocol). 5 Although there are references to asylum in the Preamble to the 1951 Geneva Convention, the granting of asylum (i. e. granting of full and lasting protection) is not dealt with further in the text of this convention or the 1967 New York Protocol. 6 The 1951 Geneva Convention was originally drafted to deal with the displacement of people as a result of the Second World War. It restricted the definition of refugees to those whose fear of persecution arose from events occurring in Europe before 1 January 1951. The 1967 New York Protocol removed the time restriction and promoted a gradual removal of the geographical restriction. However, the definition of refugee was not changed...|$|E
40|$|What is ‘political asylum’? Klaus Neumann {{explores the}} history and {{meaning of the term}} MUCH of what has {{recently}} been said or written about political asylum has been confusing. What exactly is political asylum? Is there a difference between political asylum and <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum?</b> And what about the people who are nowadays most commonly labelled asylum seekers: those who arrived in Australia on rickety boats from Indonesia and who ended up in the Port Headland, Curtin, Woomera, Baxter, Christmas Island, Nauru and Manus detention centres - were they seeking the same kind of asylum that Mr Chen sought? A great deal of the recent confusion {{is due to the fact}} that the debate about Australia’s response to asylum seekers and refugees has been largely devoid of a well-informed historical perspective, and that as a result commentators have tended to view what is happening now as the norm, rather than as the exception or as something that became the norm. I am going to say a bit more about the history of the institution of political asylum in a few minutes. There is another reason for that confusion. Following Mr Chen’s defection, the government has been busily muddying the waters. And here, ‘the government’ is for once not synonymous with the indomitable Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, but with her colleague, Alexander Downer. Of course, when Mr Chen went public with his story on 4 June, journalists turned their attention to the usual suspect. But on 6 June, Amanda Vanstone told the ABC: ‘If you want to ask about any reason why this person has not been given <b>territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> then those questions should go to the minister responsible for that, which is in fact the Minister for Foreign Affairs. ’ Vanstone was right. While her department is responsible for issuing visas to those given political (or ‘territorial’) asylum, it is her colleague, Alexander Downer, who has the executive power to grant such asylum. But when journalists put asked Downer why Mr Chen’s request had been refused, he merely obfuscated the issue. ‘Well, look there have been only [...] . two cases as far as I know in Australian history where asylum of that kind - political asylum - has been given - in the Petrov case, and I think there was one other case, a very long time ago,’ he said on 7 June in Chennai. The next day, he added: ‘Well, he [Chen] didn’t lodge a formal application at all. ’ Did Mr Chen lodge a formal application? Was he required to lodge one? Who dealt with, and declined his application? And is it true that Australia has granted political asylum only twice? Were there only two requests? And if there were more, then what happened to the unsuccessful asylum seekers? Thanks to the current Senate inquiry into asylum and protection visas, it is now well established that Mr Chen sought political asylum in a letter hand-delivered to the Immigration Department’s Sydney office on 26 May; that that letter was almost immediately faxed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra; that Minister Downer’s office was made aware of the matter that same day; that, by the next morning, Downer had decided to decline Chen’s request; and that on 3 June Mr Chen applied for a protection visa, which was granted in early July. In the course of that inquiry, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that its minister may, at his discretion, grant political asylum to anybody requesting it. A request may be made orally or in writing. There are no forms to fill in. The granting of political asylum is an executive act. Successful asylum seekers are issued with a visa by the Department of Immigration. There is a special visa category for people granted political asylum by the Minister for Foreign Affairs: subclass 800. Subclass 800 visas are, according to the migration regulations, for persons who have been granted ‘territorial asylum’. Both this term, and the term ‘political asylum’ have been used to refer to the asylum sought by Mr Chen. Both terms are correct. <b>Territorial</b> <b>asylum</b> is not some arcane privilege that is so rare that hardly anybody has ever been afforded it. It is one form of political asylum. The other is extra-territorial asylum (also sometimes referred to as diplomatic asylum). That is what the Bahktiyari boys sought - unsuccessfully - when they entered the British consulate in Melbourne a couple of years ago. That’s what Cardinal Mindszenty sought - and was granted - when fleeing to the United States embassy after the Soviet Union put down the popular uprising of October 1956 in Hungary. The processes triggered by a request for political asylum on the one hand, and by an application for a protection visa, on the other, are very different. One requires an executive decision informed by the minister’s judgment, the other sets in train a very bureaucratic process in which a person’s claim to be a refugee is assessed in the light of well-defined criteria. The minister’s decision is discretionary and non-reviewable. The immigration department’s assessment of a person’s refugee claim can be contested before the Refugee Review Tribunal. But the privileges sought by Mr Chen on 26 May, when he requested political asylum, and on 3 June, when he applied for a protection visa, are very similar. In both cases he sought Australia’s protection, including a guarantee that he would not be extradited or otherwise returned to China. You may have noticed that I have already surreptitiously introduced a historical perspective when mentioning Cardinal Mindszenty. Let me now refer to the past in a more systematic fashion. The institution of political asylum is at least two-and-a-half thousand years old. The Greek city states knew about and respected it. A citizen of, say, Sparta, who feared for his life for reasons to do with his politics, could seek, and be granted, asylum in, say, Athens. The system worked as long as the state which the asylum seeker had fled, in this case Sparta, was not powerful enough to make the harbouring state extradite the asylum seeker. In European history, the institution of asylum did not survive unchanged from the fifth-century BC to the twenty-first century AD. But, to cut a very long story very short, in nineteenth-century Europe the situation was again similar to that in fifth-century Greece. The twentieth century saw a major new development prompted by mass flights and mass expulsions. From the 1920 s, international organisations charged with representing the interests of stateless people and of refugees promoted solutions whereby refugees would be protected by international law. In 1951, several countries, including Australia, collaborated in drafting the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 1 of that convention defines those to be protected by it, namely persons who are outside their own country and unwilling to return to it ‘owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. ’ To cut another very long story very short, over the next few decades many countries acceded to the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol and incorporated their terms into domestic legislation. Australia didn’t sign the Protocol until 1973, and then waited another few years before making the terms of the Convention become part of its domestic law. But today, usually anybody in Australian territory who is seeking Australia’s protection fills in an application for a protection visa. The application is approved if, to cite the Immigration Department’s website, the applicant is ‘found to be owed Australia’s protection under the Refugees Convention’, that is if that person is outside their own country owing to well founded fear of being persecuted, etc, etc. So what happened in Australia before 1973 ? Until 1956, Australia did not have an asylum seeker policy. In large part that was a reflection of Australia’s geographical position: Australia had to deal with very few asylum seekers. They included, of course, Australia’s most famous asylum seekers, Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov, who were granted political asylum in 1954. On 16 October 1956, Cabinet approved ‘of the principle that political asylum and refuge should be available in appropriate instances to various categories of aliens namely Olympic Games visitors, members of visiting trade and other delegations, members of diplomatic and consular missions in Australia, certain other defectors and Asian leaders’. The policy was applied when several Eastern European athletes sought to stay in Australia after the conclusion of the 1956 Olympic Games. Before 1973 (in fact, until the Determination of Refugee Status Committee, DORS, was set up in 1978), requests for asylum were decided much like Mr Chen’s application of 26 May: by the foreign minister, in consultation with other relevant ministers and ASIO. Hundreds of people sought asylum in Australia or its territories before 1973. They were not required to fill in a form or to formulate their request in writing. Among those requesting political asylum before 1973 were diplomats and their dependants; seamen from Eastern Bloc countries; three naval ratings deserting a Portuguese frigate in 1961; a stowaway who feared to be deported to the People’s Republic of China; and others. In the 1960 s and early 1970 s, West Papuans crossing from Indonesian-controlled West Irian into the Australian Territory of Papua and New Guinea comprised the majority of asylum seekers. While receiving hundreds of asylum requests, the government has granted political asylum on very few occasions (although more than twice). In these high-profile cases the ‘propaganda value’ was expected to outweigh any ensuing diplomatic repercussions. They included that of Ryszard Stanislaw Zielinski, the Commercial Consul at the Polish Consulate-General in Sydney, who defected in 1961. In many other instances, the government categorically ruled out the option of granting political asylum (as it did in Mr Chen’s case), but at the same time allowed asylum seekers to remain in Australia or its territories. Many (but by no means all) West Papuan asylum seekers were granted five-year permissive residence visas. In 1965, External Affairs officers persuaded a defecting Burmese diplomat to ‘apply for permanent residence in the normal way (having been assured that his case would certainly receive sympathetic and prompt attention) ’. There were other cases, most notably those involving Eastern European athletes in 1956, where the government did not formally grant political asylum but where the Australian public understood that to have happened. So far, I have tried to sketch the historical background to two procedures: one involving a request for political asylum, the other an application for a protection visa. I have also tried to clear up some of the misunderstandings that resulted from Alexander Downer’s public statements about Mr Chen’s asylum claim. Downer was muddying the waters because he did not want to say why he had refused Mr Chen’s initial request. Governments let their decisions about refugee and asylum claims be influenced by a combination of four factors: • the so-called national interest (or, perhaps more accurately, Macchiavelli’s ragione di stato, reasons of state) • public opinion • legal obligations, and • humanitarian considerations. The national interest could come into play for several reasons: the granting of asylum potentially affects the relations between the asylum seeker’s country of origin and the country granting asylum, as it could be interpreted as an act undermining the sovereignty of the former (before Papua New Guinea became independent, West Papuan asylum seekers were never granted political asylum because External Affairs was afraid of offending the Indonesian government); some asylum seekers and refugees may be perceived to be security threats; asylum seekers may be considered an economic liability or an economic asset; the granting of asylum may be seen to subvert existing immigration policy; and finally, in some cases, a state may offer political asylum as an incentive (in the case of Vladimir Petrov, the then solicitor-general, Kenneth Bailey, suggested that asylum should not be simply offered to Petrov to ‘save his skin’ but only ‘for something we get out of it’). The second factor, public opinion, played an important role in the decision to offer asylum to Evdokia Petrova, who, unlike her husband, was not considered to be of ‘intelligence value’. In her case, the Menzies government was afraid to be accused of condoning her forced repatriation to the Soviet Union. International public opinion may also influence the decisions of governments, although arguably a country’s international reputation is a matter of national interest. During the Cold War, Western governments often considered asylum seekers from Eastern Bloc countries assets in an ideological war. When the Australian government formulated its asylum seeker policy in 1956, it was mindful of what the relevant Cabinet submission termed the ‘propaganda value’ of asylum cases. The third factor, legal obligations, is only relevant in the case of a person claiming to be a refugee in the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. But in that case, it can easily be the most important factor. The fourth factor, humanitarian considerations, is often linked to the second, public opinion, for a government may grant political asylum in cases where the domestic public strongly empathises with the asylum seekers - even if government members do not share the public’s humanitarian concerns. There is nothing wrong in principle with a government refusing a request for political asylum in the national interest - provided the asylum seeker’s interests are safeguarded. Thus it was not Alexander Downer’s decision to refuse Mr Chen asylum that was wrong, but the failure to offer him alternative protection. Instead, Mr Chen was advised of other visas (including a protection visa) he could apply for, but was told at the same time by a Foreign Affairs official that her minister had the power to veto a protection visa on foreign policy grounds. Given that that same minister had just declined a request for political asylum, presumably on foreign policy grounds, Mr Chen could have been forgiven for assuming that Downer would object to the granting of any visa for the same reason. If Minister Downer had instead sought to assure Mr Chen that the Australian government would not jeopardise his safety, the minister may have avoided some of the diplomatic fall-out that this case and the ensuing publicity have undoubtedly generated (and of which he seemed to be afraid when refusing Mr Chen’s initial request). Would it perhaps be better to have only one process, controlled by the Minister for Immigration and her department, who, after all, have ample experience in dealing with asylum seekers? Australia would do well to retain a dual system, if the granting of asylum were understood as an unbureaucratic means to offer protection to people in particularly precarious circumstances. It would because there may be situations when Australia’s national interest is better served by the swift and unbureaucratic granting of asylum (or the swift and unbureaucratic granting of permanent residence, as happened with some previous applications for political asylum), than by the issuing of a protection visa. Today it would also because the human rights of asylum seekers are often ill served by the Immigration Department’s narrow interpretation of the terms of the 1951 Refugees Convention. • Klaus Neumann is a senior research fellow at the Swinburne Institute for Social Research.

The board oversaw {{operations at}} <b>Territorial</b> insane <b>asylum,</b> reform school, and prison while McCord served as both citizen {{board member and}} purchasing agent. During his time on the board, several questionable decisions were made. The most significant was the board's approval of a contract with Eugene S.

Many in the territory were angered by the terms of the contract, and Governor Benjamin Joseph Franklin refused to honor it when he came into office. Another action was McCord's approval of $630 to purchase a [...] tract of land for the insane asylum despite the land only being worth $380 at the time.

5000|$|Governor Frederick Augustus Tritle {{gave his}} {{address to the}} session at 7:30 pm on January 9, 1883. In regards to the {{criminal}} activity in the southern sections of the territory he said, [...] "The recent feuds in Cochise County make it incumbent upon, not only officials, but all good citizens as well, to take such positive measures as will speedily rid this section of that murderous, thieving element which has made up a reproach before the world, as so seriously retarded the industry and progress of our country." [...] Much of the speech emphasized Arizona's future opportunities and sought ways to develop the territory's natural resources. The governor highlighted the facts that mine production was increasing, transportation infrastructure improving, and an ample supply of timber was available to harvest. To insure adequate future supplies, Tritle asked for restrictions on the export of timber from Arizona. To ensure needed access to water, the governor requested federal funds for construction of artesian wells. He also asked for a survey of mineral springs {{in the hope that}} some would be found to have therapeutic value. In other matters, Tritle called for recreation of the territorial attorney general position, revision of voter registration laws, and reapportionment of the territorial legislature. Finally, to end the need of sending mentally ill residents to California, the governor called for building a <b>territorial</b> insane <b>asylum.</b>|$|R

50|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Oakes Murphy as Governor of Arizona Territory, Brodie was nominated for the position and sworn into office on July 1, 1902. His first several months were spent appointing new officials and organizing his administration. An action of note prior to the convening of the 22nd Arizona Territorial Legislature was the pardon of Pearl Hart on moral grounds. At the time, the outlaw was the only female at the Yuma Territorial Prison and her presence was causing disruptions as guards and other prisoners vied for her attentions. The December 1902 pardon was made {{on the condition that}} Hart leave the territory, a condition she quickly fulfilled. Another display of the new Governor's ethical stance was his refusal to use a US$750 discretionary fund which was available for his personal use. Brodie considered the legislative appropriation which created the fund illegal as it had no oversight provisions to prevent misuse.With the start of the 22nd Legislature in January 1903, Brodie requested several changes to the territorial tax code. The first change he asked for was increasing the tax rates for mining operations which the Governor felt were not paying a fair share in comparison {{to other parts of the}} territorial economy. He also proposed an exemption from taxation of 10 years for new railroads and 9 years for hydroelectric dams to encourage additional transportation and electrical generation capabilities within the territory. Other changes to mining operations were the establishment of an eight-hour day for mine workers, with railroad workers receiving a limit of 16 consecutive hours of work, and outlawing the practice of paying miners in company scrip redeemable only at the company store. Brodie also requested the pay for the governor's secretary be increased from US$125 to US$150/year.Other legislation coming from the session were laws requiring the licensing of dentists and physicians, requiring schools to fly the United States flag during hours the school was in session, expanding the facilities of the <b>territorial</b> insane <b>asylum,</b> and authorizing school districts with 1,000 or more residents to hire music and art instructors. Brodie also took unpopular stances on two of the session's bills. The first stance was opposition to a bill granting women the right to vote. Brodie, who personally supported women's suffrage, opposed this bill on the basis that it was not permitted under the limitations of the Arizona Organic Act. The second unpopular stance was endorsing a bill supporting joint statehood with New Mexico.|$|R
