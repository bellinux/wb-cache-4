5|$|In {{three of}} the {{previous}} five years, the legislature had {{failed to meet the}} June 30 deadline. On each of <b>those</b> <b>occasions</b> an agreement had been reached by the morning of July 2. Aides to Corzine claimed that the governor felt {{he had no choice but}} to order the shutdown under the state's Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On <b>those</b> <b>occasions</b> he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E
60|$|Thus far, {{my father}} had no worse anxieties about him than <b>those</b> <b>occasioned</b> by his high spirits and his heavy debts. But when he {{returned}} home--when the debts had been paid, and it was next thought necessary to drill the free, careless energies into something like useful discipline--then my father's trials and difficulties began in earnest.|$|R

50|$|Ironically, {{ten years}} later Wests would again {{threaten}} to break a string of premiership wins - the 1962 and 1963 Magpie sides both came close to ceasing St. George's long run - but again several refereeing controversies would affect the outcome. Both the 1962 and 1963 Grand Finals have been {{said to have been}} decided by questionable calls from referee Darcy Lawler and on <b>those</b> <b>occasion</b> Wests would be on the wrong end of disputed rulings.|$|R
5|$|The Team of the Year Award {{was first}} {{presented}} in 1960, {{six years after}} the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was introduced. The first recipient of the award was the Cooper Formula One Racing team. The England national rugby union team and the Ryder Cup team have won the award the most times; both teams have won five times and have shared the award on one of <b>those</b> <b>occasions.</b> Liverpool F.C. have won the award three times. The award has been shared on two occasions—by the British women's 4x400m relay team and the British Ryder Cup team in 1969, and by the England national rugby union team and the British men's 4x400m relay team in 1991. Teams have varied greatly in size. The smallest winning team has been two members; the figure skating duo of Torvill and Dean in 1982 and 1983, and the Olympic men's coxless rowing pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in 1992 and 1996. The largest winning team was in 2012; the British representatives at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.|$|E

2500|$|Respondent {{claims that}} [...] advance two interests: {{protecting}} {{the public health}} and preventing cruelty to animals. The ordinances are underinclusive for those ends. They fail to prohibit non religious conduct that endangers these interests in a similar or greater degree than Santería sacrifice does. The underinclusion is substantial, not inconsequential. Despite the city's proffered interest in preventing cruelty to animals, the ordinances are drafted with care to forbid few killings but <b>those</b> <b>occasioned</b> by religious sacrifice. Many types of animal deaths or kills for nonreligious reasons are either not prohibited or approved by express provision.|$|R

25|$|Legislation {{to allow}} for the {{recognition}} of same-sex marriages in Northern Ireland has been debated in the Northern Ireland Assembly five times since 2012. On four of <b>those</b> <b>occasions,</b> only a minority of assembly members voted in favour of same-sex marriage, though the most recent vote on the issue in November 2015 saw a majority of MLA's vote in favour of same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|Today, both fraternities seek {{to focus}} on their own futures, and {{maintain}} a posture of civility and cooperation on <b>those</b> <b>occasions</b> where they cross paths. Considering their shared history and the economic difficulties of supporting full-time operations with a small base of chapter revenue, Phi Sigma Kappa has consistently maintained it would welcome future inquiries toward cooperation from Phi Sigma Phi and her chapters, as a homecoming.|$|E
50|$|In November 2008 {{and again}} in November 2009 {{extensive}} flooding occurred in the Hillfoots making several road bridges across the river impassable. No houses were damaged on <b>those</b> two <b>occasions.</b>|$|R

25|$|Sri Lanka's {{national}} cricket team achieved considerable success {{beginning in}} the 1990s, rising from underdog status to winning the Cricket World Cup in 1996. Since then, the team has {{continued to be a}} force in international cricket. The Sri Lankan cricket team reached the finals of the 2007 and 2011 Cricket World Cups consecutively. But they ended up being runners up in both <b>those</b> <b>occasions.</b>|$|E
25|$|Montgomerie {{has been}} the playing captain of the European team in the Royal Trophy, played against a team from Asia.

25|$|Evers {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut against Northamptonshire in early July 1936, making 35 and 33. He kept {{his place in}} the side for a while thereafter, but except for 38 against Surrey and 56 against Warwickshire he achieved little. He played only once in 1937, but made four appearances the following year, standing in as captain on the last three of <b>those</b> <b>occasions</b> in the absence of usual captain Charles Lyttelton.|$|E

5000|$|Nonnie MacInnes won {{the award}} {{three times in}} {{four years in the}} mid 1990s for his {{performances}} with Oban Camanachd. Even more exceptional was {{the fact that he was}} only on the winning side once of <b>those</b> three <b>occasions.</b>|$|R

25|$|Based on his {{experiences}} in the campaigns in Malaya and Singapore and in the Japanese conquest of Burma in early 1942, Mutaguchi dismissed British and Indian troops as inherently inferior. The troops he had met on <b>those</b> <b>occasions</b> had generally been inadequately trained and led. The Allies had by now largely overcome the administrative and organisational problems which had crippled their early efforts in Burma, and their troops were far better trained and motivated.|$|E
25|$|In 255 or 257, Gallienus {{was made}} Consul again, {{suggesting}} that he briefly visited Rome on <b>those</b> <b>occasions,</b> although no record survives. During his Danube sojourn (Drinkwater suggests in 255 or 256), he proclaimed his elder son Valerian II Caesar and thus official heir to himself and Valerian I; the boy probably joined Gallienus on campaign at that time, and when Gallienus moved west to the Rhine provinces in 257, he remained behind on the Danube as the personification of Imperial authority.|$|E
25|$|McDaid {{was born}} in Termon in County Donegal. He was educated in Saint Eunan's College, Letterkenny and University College, Galway (UCG). While at UCG he played on the {{university}} soccer team that won three national titles, with McDaid captaining the side on two of <b>those</b> <b>occasions.</b> Between 1974 and 1979 he worked at Letterkenny General Hospital, and in 1979 he went into partnership as a general practitioner in Letterkenny. He was also involved as medical officer to the Donegal county Gaelic football team.|$|E

25|$|The {{last month}} of Major League Baseball's regular season often {{included}} one or two Saturdays in which the Twins and Gophers used Metrodome on the same day. On <b>those</b> <b>occasions,</b> the Twins game would start at about 11am local time (TV announcer Dick Bremer sometimes joked that the broadcast was competing with SpongeBob SquarePants). Afterward, the conversion took place and the Gophers football game started at about 6pm. The University of Minnesota was the only school in the Big Ten that shared a football facility with professional sports teams {{for an extended period}} of years.|$|E
25|$|In Limehouse, Chang {{opened the}} Shanghai Restaurant. He lived at 13 Limehouse Causeway {{on the middle}} floor of a three-storey house, with just a kitchen and bedroom at his disposal. The bedroom was luxuriously {{decorated}} with a blue and silver design featuring dragons. Chang's customers were far more conspicuous in Limehouse, however, {{than they had been}} in the West End and a police detective noted the stream of glamorous young ladies who visited him. Chang's home was raided twice and on one of <b>those</b> <b>occasions</b> the police found two chorus girls in his bed.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northeast}} corner of the State Apartments is the ball room the Vita Havet (the White Sea) which used to be two rooms: the queen's dining hall and the hall for the trabants. The dining hall was called the White Sea, a name that was inherited for the resulting hall after the wall had been removed. In connection to dinners in the Charles XI's Gallery, the White Sea is furnished as a salon with sofas, chairs and coffee tables. On <b>those</b> <b>occasions,</b> the room is used as a drawing rooms after the dinners.|$|E

60|$|Our {{trip down}} the St. John's met with no {{obstacles}} except <b>those</b> <b>occasioned</b> by the Paying Teller's return tickets. He had provided himself and his group {{with all sorts of}} return tickets from the various points he had expected to visit in Florida. These were good only on particular steamboats, and could be used only to go from one particular point to another. Fortunately he had lost several of them, but there were enough left to give us a good deal of trouble. We did not wish to break up the party, and consequently we embarked and disembarked whenever the Paying Teller's group did so; and thus, in time, we all reached that widespread and sandy city which serves for the gate of Florida.|$|R
