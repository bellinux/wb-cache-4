5|$|At the time, Peckinpah {{wanted to}} make Emperor of the North Pole (1973), a story set during the Great Depression about a {{brakeman}} obsessed with keeping homeless people off his train. The film's producer {{made a deal with}} Paramount Pictures' production chief Robert Evans, allowing Peckinpah <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> personal project if he first directed The Getaway. The director was soon dismissed from Emperor and told that Paramount was not making The Getaway.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|His {{family moved}} to Surrey, British Columbia, in 1966, then settled in Port Coquitlam, in 1968. His parents were {{dedicated}} to their family, {{and his mother was}} especially protective of her children; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication to whatever task he committed <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>His</b> father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Terry hated to lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.|$|E

5|$|To {{compose the}} film score, Burton hired regular {{collaborator}} Danny Elfman, {{who had previously}} been set as composer when Adam Rifkin was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> remake in 1989.

5|$|According to Gary Oldman, {{very little}} was written about Oswald in the script. Stone gave him several plane tickets, {{a list of}} contacts, and told him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> own research. Oldman met with Oswald's wife, Marina, and her two daughters {{to prepare for the}} role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since the script {{contained}} few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Homer goes on {{tour with}} the festival and hangs out with The Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, and Sonic Youth. Homer {{suddenly}} finds himself living the high life: partying with big name rock stars and becoming respected among American youth, including Bart. As the tour approaches {{a stop in}} Springfield, Homer's stomach begins to hurt and he is sent to a veterinarian. The veterinarian advises Homer that if he performs his act one more time, he will die. At first he decides <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> job, {{but at the last}} second he dodges the cannonball. Consequently, he is released from the festival and, despite a warm sendoff from the rock stars, goes back to not being respected by his children.|$|E

5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk {{to the point}} that he is unable to complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the wall. On the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Orochimaru, however, craved {{more power}} than could be {{obtained}} from training with his master, and began abducting villagers of Konohagakure for various experiments with Yamato among his surviving victims. Unwilling to bring himself to harm Orochimaru upon learning of his actions, Hiruzen allowed his former pupil to escape and flee the village. In time Orochimaru joined the criminal organization Akatsuki and became partners with a fellow Rogue Ninja named Sasori. However, after his attempt to steal the body of Itachi Uchiha through a forbidden jutsu so as to gain the Sharingan failed, Orochimaru is forced to leave the Akatsuki. Orochimaru then founded his own ninja village, Otogakure, populated with ninja loyal to him who mostly serve as test subjects in his experimentation to become an ultimate being and as pawns <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> dirty work.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{has eight}} chapters, narrated {{by each of}} the three main {{characters}} in turn. Davidson narrates chapters 1, 4, and 7; Selver narrates chapters 2, 6, and 8; and Lyubov narrates chapters 3 and 5. This alternation emphasizes both the differences between the characters and their isolation within their societies. Lyubov and Davidson's chapters are narrated from a limited omniscient point of view, making their chapters seem like internal monologues. Davidson's belief in the inferiority of the Athsheans and his adversarial attitude towards the planet are directly presented to the reader, along with Lyubov's struggle <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> job dispassionately while following his personal morality. In contrast, Selver's chapters are written from a truly omniscient point of view, allowing Le Guin to give the reader information about the planet and its people. Selver has no extensive monologues; instead, several other Athsheans also feature prominently in his chapters.|$|E

5|$|The widowed Gudrun now marries Brynhild's brother, king Atli, but as {{the years}} pass by her {{memories}} of Sigurd do not fade, and she longs for vengeance. She reminds Atli of Fafnir's hoard and urges him to win it for himself. Atli invites the surviving Niblung brothers to a feast, and when they arrive he threatens them with death {{if they do not}} give him the treasure. Gunnar and Hogni defy him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> worst, and a battle breaks out in Atli's hall. The Niblung brothers are overwhelmed by superior force, tied up and killed. Atli holds a victory-feast, {{at the end of which}} he and all his court lie sleeping drunkenly in the hall. Gudrun, having lost everyone she loves, burns down the hall, kills Atli with a sword-thrust, and throws herself from a cliff to her death.|$|E
5|$|Welles hired Bernard Herrmann {{to compose}} the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in {{as few as}} {{two or three weeks}} after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had {{sufficient}} time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces for some of the montages, and Welles edited many of the scenes to match their length.|$|E
5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E
5|$|Bhairava {{then takes}} Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from God. Mithra demands Bhairava admit {{his love for}} her. When he does not respond, she upsets the sacred items they have brought for the puja and, using her own blood, paints an image on a nearby rock of Bhairava leaving his true love <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev and Sher Khan's army have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing toward them. They arrive shortly, and Sher Khan {{challenges}} Bhairava to battle his soldiers. Bhairava boldly accepts the challenge and kills a hundred soldiers, but is severely injured in the process. Sher Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart. However, Ranadev continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra fatally, but he is in turn killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he follows her and falls to his own death.|$|E
5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when he had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>his</b> medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As {{a result of this}} he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.|$|E
