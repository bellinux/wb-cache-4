Around 1896 with his business in machinery progressing, Hubbell's next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry: the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than 50%. He designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies, patented machinery to slot screw heads, a machine to assemble screws and small parts, devised tools to indicate speed, and patented a changeable speed screwdriver. Hubbell's idea was to provide convenience, safety, and control to an electric light with his new [...] "pull socket" [...] which was patented in August 1896. The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today. He built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity, and one which could be connected or disconnected, easily and safely, to a power supply in the wall. cartridge fuses and fuse block, lamp holders, key sockets - soon followed the same path Later, Hubbell's [...] "separable plug" [...] design took shape on the drawing board back in Bridgeport, and then submitted to the patent office in Washington, D.C. Additional designs based on that basic concept - separable plugs in different configurations, a single flush mounted receptacle - as well as new products for electrical circuits. One of the most successful and the one most familiar today, was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used. In 1901 Hubbell published a 12-page catalogue that listed 63 electrical products of his company's manufacture, and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as Harvey Hubbell, Incorporated , In the same year, the Company registered its trademark of [...] "...a sphere with meridian lines and the name 'Hubbell' centered within." [...] Hubbell's pace of new ideas and product design did not falter. In 1909 the company began constructing a four-floor factory and office building that woul d become the first building in New England made of reinforced concrete.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{research}} on the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> {{has shown that the}} impact on a floor depends strongly on the combined system of floor and tapping hammers. This means that in general, a particular measure to reduce the impact sound pressure level can be advantageous with one impact source and disadvantageouswith another. Conversion from one impact source to another has to be made for each floor individually, provided there is a sufficient knowledge of the dynamic properties of the source and floor. So, if the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is to be used to characterise a floor with respect to walking noise, the only simple way out of the problem is to make it 'behave like a walker'. That means it should have the same source impedance. Investigations at the Fraunhofer-Institut f√ºr Bauphysik Stuttgart showed that this could be achieved by small modifications to the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> Comparisons using a concrete floor and a wooden joist floor have proved that results using such a modified <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> are much closer to walking noise than the results using the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Impact sound {{insulation}} {{is one of}} the most important aspects when assessing {{sound insulation}} of floor constructions in buildings. For assessing the impact sound insulation of aconstruction, a standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is used as a sound source. However, the use of the current standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> has been criticised, especially with regard to measurement of wooden joist floors since the noise spectrum generated by a <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> differs from the spectrum generated by actual footfall. There are insufficient low frequency components in the noise spectrum produced by the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and it does not, therefore, accurately reflect low frequency noise from the construction. Reduce impact sound level from wooden joist floors are the main object of our study. It is important to be able to predict the sound insulation properties of wooden joist constructions at the design stage. To reduce the noise level in the receiving room, the input power transmitted through the construction must be estimated where the appropriate sound- and vibration-insulation can be designed. This study has investigated the waveform and frequency spectra of human footfall (walking, rum- ingand jumping); of the dropping of sand balls, sand bags and tires; and of the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The impact sound power radiation from a wooden joist construction while applying different impact sources, such as actual footfall and the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine,</b> have also been studied. Research was also carried out regarding the development of a practical impact sound insulation calculation method for wooden joist floor constructions. The characteristics with regard to mechanical properties of floor construction was calculated using the impedance method. The impact sound level inside the sound receiving room was determined.

40|$|Multi-storey timber {{buildings}} up to 6 {{and more}} floors are increasingly built in many European countries. The challenge with these buildings {{can be that}} with traditional intermediate floor constructions in timber {{it can be difficult}} to fulfill the standard requirements and even when they are met, low frequency transmission can still cause complaints. Additionally it is difficult to develop appropriate light weight floor constructions since it is well known that the correlation between the standardized evaluation methods using the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and the human perception of impact noise can be poor, especially in buildings with light weight structures. In the AcuWood project, measurements and recordings on different intermediate timber floor constructions in the laboratory and the field were performed covering a wide range of modern intermediate timber floor constructions.

The standardized <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> leads also to an acceptably high determination coefficient between the descriptor and the subjective ratings.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have posed {{the question of}} whether the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> simulates the impedance of real sources well enough to properly judge the impact sound insulation performance of a floor. Proposed solutions such as the modified <b>tapping</b> <b>machine,</b> the bang machine, and ball were results of these investigations. Recent data collected on bare (wood and concrete) floors, suggest that in the low frequency range, the impedance of the source has no influence on the power injected into the floor. This is presumably due to the fact that the bare floors have much higher impedances than most common sources, meaning only the blocked force of the source influences the injected power. This furthermore suggests that modifying or redeveloping the source is not necessary, and that through use of an appropriate weighting curve a single number rating that correlates well with subjective measurements can be defined.

Ease of installation, high accuracy and lightness of such buildings has attracted builders and designers. Sweden, having a large coverage of renewable forests has an increasing interest in multi-storey wooden buildings. However noise and vibration in wooden buildings is an issue of concern especially low frequency impact sound due to footsteps. Impact sound insulation of floors can be measured based on ISO 140 - 7 using standardized <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> as excitation source. Experience has shown that in many cases the results obtained by this method do not correlate with annoyance experienced by inhabitants.
