5|$|The Israeli {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located {{along the northern}} side of the town's built-up area, within m of houses in 'Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration {{to the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{some other}} West Bank localities, {{unemployment}} {{is a minor}} issue in Jifna. However, the average income is low because of the unstable political situation in the Palestinian territories, Israeli checkpoints, <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> barrier and the 2006 freezing by Israel of funds to the Palestinian territories—although the latter no longer applies to <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank.</b>|$|E

5|$|Palestinian groups used to {{initiate}} few attacks on Israeli targets from both <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> and Jordan before the Six-Day War, {{some of which}} caused Israel to retaliate which {{became known as the}} Reprisal operations. Following the seizure of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> from Jordan in the June 1967 Six-Day War, Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group Fatah networks there. In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the Jordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.|$|E

5|$|The Austrian Coalition's Army of the Lower Rhine {{included}} 90,000 troops. The 20,000-man right wing, first under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg, then Wilhelm von Wartensleben, {{stood on}} the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River, observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The garrisons of Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress included 10,000 more. The remainder of the Imperial and Coalition army, the 80,000-strong Army of the Upper Rhine, secured <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> behind the Nahe River. Commanded by Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser, this force anchored its right wing in Kaiserslautern on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> while the left wing under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to Switzerland. The original Austrian strategy was to capture Trier and to use their position on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> to strike {{at each of the}} French armies in turn. After news arrived in Vienna of Napoleon Bonaparte's successes, however, Wurmser was sent to Italy with 25,000 reinforcements, and the Aulic Council gave Archduke Charles command over both Austrian armies and ordered him to hold his ground.|$|E

5|$|At 10:40, Gonen ordered Adan {{to cross}} to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> and Sharon {{to move towards}} Suez City.

Gonen consented, but Sharon would not comply, and consequently several critical positions would be lost to the Egyptians later on.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00p.m., two {{anti-tank}} teams {{joined the}} Sa'iqa {{company on the}} firing ramp. Both teams, along with the company, were ordered to advance eastward and seize the crossroads. At around 5:00p.m., the Israeli Air Force began attacking Egyptian forces in the fort and on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> of the canal. One group of four aircraft attempted to bomb the fort; the first aircraft dropped its payload of seven bombs, then descended to a low altitude to escape anti-aircraft fire. An anti-air platoon at the Kilometer 17 mark soon shot down an Israeli aircraft (either a Mirage III or an A-4 Skyhawk) with a Strela 2 missile, destroying it. Between 6:00 and 7:00p.m. all bunkers and troop shelters inside the fort were cleared, and the Egyptians transferred 26 Israeli prisoners to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> of the canal, and thereafter transferred them to Port Said for intelligence gathering. The Israelis concentrated heavy artillery fire against the fort, once they were sure it had been captured by the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|At around 4:00 PM on October 17, the {{pontoon bridge}} had been fully assembled, opening the first Israeli {{bridge across the}} canal. The roller bridge was laid soon after at dawn on October 18, and by afternoon, Adan's {{division}} crossed to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> followed by Kalman Magen's division. Adan, supported by Magen, {{would go on to}} reach Suez after the failure of a United Nations ceasefire, thereby cutting off two infantry divisions of the Egyptian Third Field Army. Sharon also crossed with part of his division, simultaneously trying to defend and expand the Israeli corridor to the Suez Canal—as well attacking northwards on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> to Ismailia in an attempt to similarly cut off the Second Army. His efforts bogged down, and he was unable to reach Ismailia (see Battle of Ismailia), while attempts to seize critical positions and expand the Israeli corridor on the east bank saw little to no success.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Rhine Campaign of 1796, Austria had two armies in Germany, the Army of the Upper Rhine under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and the Army of the Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. The left wing of the 80,000-man Army of the Upper Rhine guarded the Rhine River from Mannheim to Switzerland under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé while its right wing was on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> around Kaiserslautern. The Army of the Lower Rhine had a 20,000-strong right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg on the east bank observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf. The archduke's remaining 70,000 troops lay on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> along the Nahe River with powerful garrisons in Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, other {{difficulties}} were surfacing. Sharon {{reported to}} Southern Command that {{one section of}} the roller bridge, being towed by Erez's brigade, had been damaged and that the engineers needed a few hours to repair it. He also requested additional forces to help secure the corridor, noting the stiff resistance facing Reshef's brigade. Sharon's report prompted Bar-Lev to alert Adan to prepare to open the corridor with his division. Sharon argued for Adan's division to cross the canal on rafts and to proceed with Operation Abiray-Lev without waiting for the bridges. Both Gonen and Bar-Lev rejected Sharon's suggestion since, without a secure corridor to the canal, Israeli forces on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> would be threatened with encirclement. Subsequently, Bar-Lev ordered that no more Israeli forces or equipment would cross to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> until the bridges had been laid.|$|E
