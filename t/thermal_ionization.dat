500|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the GTAW system depends {{largely on}} the type of metal being welded. [...] Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) is often employed when welding steels, nickel, titanium, and other metals. It can also be used in automatic GTAW of aluminum or magnesium when helium is used as a shielding gas. The negatively charged electrode generates heat by emitting electrons, which travel across the arc, causing <b>thermal</b> <b>ionization</b> of the shielding gas and increasing the temperature of the base material. The ionized shielding gas flows toward the electrode, not the base material, and this can allow oxides to build {{on the surface of the}} weld. Direct current with a positively charged electrode (DCEP) is less common, and is used primarily for shallow welds since less heat is generated in the base material. Instead of flowing from the electrode to the base material, as in DCEN, electrons go the other direction, causing the electrode to reach very high temperatures. To help it maintain its shape and prevent softening, a larger electrode is often used. As the electrons flow toward the electrode, ionized shielding gas flows back toward the base material, cleaning the weld by removing oxides and other impurities and thereby improving its quality and appearance.|$|E

The contribution to the continuum opacity of the universe due to the observed quasar absorption line clouds (QALC'S) were included.

A self-consistent treatment of the <b>thermal</b> and <b>ionization</b> history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) must take account of the growth of structure in the universe, since the mean density of the IGM corresponds primarily to the time-varying uncollapsed fraction of the baryon-electron component of the matter, and the collapsed fraction, in turn, can have a feedback effect on this uncollapsed fraction by releasing ionizing radiation and thermal energy and by contributing to the opacity of the universe.

40|$|We {{explore the}} ways in which {{primordial}} magnetic fields influence the <b>thermal</b> and <b>ionization</b> history of the post-recombination universe. After recombination the universe becomes mostly neutral resulting also in a sharp drop in the radiative viscosity. Primordial magnetic fields can then dissipate their energy into the intergalactic medium (IGM) via ambipolar diffusion and, for small enough scales, by generating decaying MHD turbulence. These processes can significantly modify the <b>thermal</b> and <b>ionization</b> history of the post-recombination universe. We show that the dissipation effects of magnetic fields which redshifts to a present value B_ 0 = 3 × 10 ^- 9 Gauss smoothed on the magnetic Jeans scale and below, can give rise to Thomson scattering optical depths τ 0. 1, although not in the range of redshifts needed to explain the recent WMAP polarization observations. We also study the possibility that primordial fields could induce the formation of subgalactic structures for z 15. We show that early structure formation induced by nano-Gauss magnetic fields is potentially capable of producing the early re-ionization implied by the WMAP data.
