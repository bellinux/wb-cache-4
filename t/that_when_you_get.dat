This means <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to a hard section, your only choice is to do {{it over and over again}} until you get to the next checkpoint. After playing the exact same level for the 30th time, this can get frustrating." [...] However, he concluded, [...] "the non-frustrating times in MDK 2 are simply tons of fun. The game is genuinely funny, has great voices and a terrific comic book flair." ...|$|E
2500|$|Corry was {{a staunch}} {{advocate}} of Irish republicanism, strongly opposed to Partition, antipathetic to the United Kingdom, and sometimes bluntly outspoken within the Dáil chamber. In 1928, he criticised the Cumann na nGaedheal government's expenditure on the diplomatic corps, stating [...] "These salaries of £1,500 {{have to be}} paid so that they might squat like the nigger when he put on the black silk hat and the swallow-tail coat and went out and said he was an English gentleman." [...] His opposition to the Blueshirts in the early 1930s provoked an attempt to burn down his house. In the 1938 debate on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement which ceded the Treaty Ports to the Irish state, Corry expressed regret that Northern Ireland remained excluded, suggesting [...] "I personally am in favour of storing up sufficient poison gas, so <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the wind in the right direction you can start at the Border and let it travel, and follow it." [...] In a 1942 debate on exporting food to Great Britain during World War II, Corry remarked about food shortages there that [...] "They have no more rabbits to get, and now they are on the crows", and [...] "I would not like to see too many crows going out to feed them. I think the crows are too good for them". Patrick Giles called Corry a [...] "", and Alfie Byrne persisted in demanding an apology for the [...] "unchristian" [...] comments to the point of himself being suspended from the chamber.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the back of your neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E

With {{songs such as}} [...] "'I'm Still in Love with My Ex" [...] and [...] "Better Without You" [...] inspired by Rowland's former relationship with American football player Roy Williams, most of the tracks Rowland recorded were relationship-driven, something {{she said she was}} not hesitant about discussing.

In May 2013, Disney released concept art and rendered footage of San Fransokyo from the film. San Fransokyo, the futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo, was described by Hall as [...] "an alternate version of San Francisco. Most of the technology is advanced, but much of it feels retro … Where Hiro lives, it feels like the Haight. I love the Painted ladies. We gave them a Japanese makeover; we put a cafe on the bottom of one. They live above a coffee shop." [...] According to production designer Paul Felix, [...] "The topography is exaggerated because what we do is caricature, I think the hills are 1½ times exaggerated.

5000|$|An early {{incarnation}} involved Morty and Summer {{going about}} frozen {{time when they}} are confronted a time policeman—which evolved into the time-traveling testicle monsters. These characters were originally inspired by Stephen King's miniseries The Langoliers. This version was cut because they deemed it too [...] "basic" [...] with nowhere {{to go for a}} potential second act. One deleted element of the splitting time was referring to it as a [...] "time quake"; an early version featured Rick berating Morty for wearing [...] "shorty shorts", which caused time to split. The reason for the fractured time was ultimately re-developed into something more specific to the characters. At first, chaos as a whole was responsible for the split time, but they decided on uncertainty as a cause solely to serve a joke about flathead/Phillips head screwdrivers. [...] "When you're talking about how to define chaos, let alone uncertainty, <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into a semantic spiral," [...] producer Ryan Ridley said. Harmon felt it a suitable source for the time split because uncertainty was [...] "an intersection between quantum physics and the human condition." [...] The team was happy when they created the joke that Rick believes his parallel self is plotting to kill him, because it [...] "felt like we were writing a cartoon." ...|$|R

If he had not done so I should have told her all about it myself. I considered all along that you had acted like a young fool, and I should have done what I thought best for you. As it was I can tell you that mischief very nearly came of our holding our tongues. However, things are put straight now; and though Dorothy does not say much I am sure she has been fretting ever since she heard of that affair at New Orleans. My advice to you is to come home at once. Of course, if you have arranged this affair all the better, but I don't anticipate that you will succeed in <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> back Hawtrey will write to her and offer her a round sum and a promise that no steps shall ever be taken in the matter if she will sign a confession. You had better get the name and address of some solicitor at Sacramento, to act as Hawtrey's agent in the matter. I have told Dorothy that I am going to write to you, and asked if she had any message to send. She said she had not, but she laughed and coloured, and I should not be at all surprised if you get a note from the young woman {{at the same time that}} you receive this. I know she heartily regrets her folly before you went away. I must tell you, my dear boy, that I have made some pecuniary arrangements regarding you; and that if Dorothy is willing to take you, you will meet with no objection on the part of her father.' ...|$|E
