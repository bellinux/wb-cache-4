5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>and</b> AFL merged in 1970, the Patriots {{were placed}} in the American Football Conference (AFC) East division, where they still play today. The {{following}} year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which would serve as their home for the next 30 years. As a result of the move, they announced they would change their name from the Boston Patriots to the Bay State Patriots. The name was rejected by <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>and</b> on March 22, 1971, the team officially announced they would change its geographic name to New England.|$|E

5|$|While heavily recruited, Campbell {{narrowed his}} choices to Houston, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Baylor. After in-home visits from Barry Switzer from Oklahoma and Darrell Royal from Texas, Campbell {{ultimately}} chose Texas.

5|$|After Tatum {{resigned}} to coach {{at his own}} alma mater, North Carolina, Tommy Mont was appointed as his replacement. In his first season, Maryland was riddled with injuries and posted a disappointing 2–7–1 record. Mont had great difficulty recruiting to the same standard that his predecessor had, but managed to secure Rod Breedlove, a highly touted guard prospect. Breedlove later went on to play eight years in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>and</b> made a Pro Bowl appearance.|$|E
5|$|After {{two seasons}} in the NBA, Grant decided to end his {{professional}} basketball career. He contacted the Philadelphia Eagles of <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>and</b> agreed {{to play for the}} team during the 1951 NFL season. In his first season with the Eagles, Grant played as a defensive end and led the team in sacks (an unofficial statistic at the time).

5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in <b>the</b> <b>NFL,</b> <b>and</b> was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
5|$|Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, the 2000 {{winner of}} the Heisman Trophy, awarded to the player deemed most {{outstanding}} in college football, was selected in the fourth round by the Carolina Panthers. After being a regular starter for the Panthers in his first season, during which Carolina posted a 1–15 record, Weinke played only 12 games over his final five seasons before being released. The last player selected, who traditionally receives the unofficial title Mr. Irrelevant, was Tevita Ofahengaue of Brigham Young University, who was chosen by the Arizona Cardinals. Ofahengaue never played in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>and</b> in 2011 was charged with stealing gasoline from a construction company in Salt Lake City.|$|E

Its teams competed with NFL franchises for fans' attention and player talent – the Dons shared a city with the NFL's Los Angeles Rams. By late 1949, team owners came to an agreement under which the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts joined <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>and</b> {{the rest of the}} league's teams, including the Dons, folded.|$|E

5|$|McBride and his {{partners}} sold the team {{to a group of}} Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive Art Modell. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back Jim Brown. The Browns won the championship in 1964 and reached the title game the following season, losing to the Green Bay Packers. The team subsequently reached the playoffs three times in the late 1980s, but fell short of playing in the Super Bowl, the inter-league championship game between <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>and</b> the rival American Football League (AFL) that started in 1966.|$|E

He has asserted, moreover, that “ports marketing fundamentally is about the selling of hope. Fans have the hope of their favorite team trading for the right player, drafting the right player, winning a game, winning the season, winning the world championship.” And furthermore that, “he World Series of Poker offers a brand of hope that is infinitely more accessible” insofar as anyone can enter the tournament and have a chance to play at the final table.|$|E
5|$|The AAFC's Baltimore Colts signed Humble in 1947, but the Browns {{acquired}} {{him in a}} trade {{before the}} season. Humble became an anchor on Cleveland's offensive line, helping the team win three straight AAFC titles in the late 1940s. When the AAFC dissolved in 1949, Cleveland moved to <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>and</b> won another championship in 1950. Humble, who remained in the Marine Reserves, was called into service in the Korean War after the season. He was expected to return to Cleveland the following year, but head coach Paul Brown traded him to the Texans before the 1952 season began. He retired after one year in Dallas.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{had another}} losing season in 1996, {{finishing}} 6–10.

The Giants' offense {{was one of the worst}} in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>and,</b> unlike in previous years, the defense was unable to carry the team.
