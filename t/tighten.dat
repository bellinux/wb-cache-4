40|$|<b>Tightening</b> {{method for}} flange joints {{proposed}} by ASME PCC [...] 1 specifies that bolts are <b>tightened</b> by the cross-pattern sequence and <b>tightening</b> torque is raised with several steps. On the other hand, new <b>tightening</b> method {{has been proposed}} by Japan BFC committee, in which bolts are <b>tightened</b> in the clockwise-pattern sequence and <b>tightening</b> torque is 100 % of the target torque in all steps after an install step with some snug torque. <b>Tightening</b> tests using flanges with various nominal sizes, performed in this study, show that the new <b>tightening</b> method achieves comparable uniformity in bolt preloads and in flange alignment with ASME PCC- 4 procedure. This new <b>tightening</b> method is able to reduce both the work volume in the <b>tightening</b> operation {{and the possibility of}} human errors like missing the <b>tightening</b> order in it. Stepqike increment of the bolt tension under the rep ated <b>tightening</b> with small increment of the <b>tightening</b> torque is also discussed. Experimental results show that continuous control of the bolt tension by the repeated <b>tightening</b> is impossible. The step-like increment of the bolt tension is observed in the <b>tightening</b> process of the actual bolted flange joints so that the excessive it ration of the repeated <b>tightening</b> round hardly improves the uniformity of the bolt preloads. 1...|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>tightening</b> speed on the torque coefficient in lag screw timber joints with steel side plates, <b>tightening</b> tests were conducted on main timber members made from Cryptomeria japonica, Chamaecyparis obtusa and Pseudotsuga menziesii, under four <b>tightening</b> speed conditions (1, 4, 10, and 20  rpm). Major stick-slip behavior was observed in C. obtusa based {{on the relationship of}} <b>tightening</b> angle with clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque at <b>tightening</b> speeds of 1 and 4  rpm. In addition, <b>tightening</b> speed’s effects on the torque coefficient (K) varied depending on the wood species of the main member. In P. menziesii, K was not affected by the <b>tightening</b> speed: the ratio of torque expended on <b>tightening</b> was 25 % on average, and the ratio of torque expended on bearing surface friction was higher than the ratio of torque expended on thread friction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Plastic region <b>tightening</b> {{is widely}} used in {{critical}} bolted joints in internal combustion engines {{in order to reduce}} the engine weight by maximizing the use of load-carrying capacity of bolt. Mechanical behavior of bolt <b>tightened</b> in plastic region under external axial tensile load is investigated for various friction conditions using three dimensional finite element analysis. The behavior of bolt <b>tightened</b> in elastic region as well as that in tensile test are investigated for comparison. <b>Tightening</b> process is simulated by rotating the bolt in order to examine the friction effect realistically. It is revealed that the bolt <b>tightened</b> in plastic region can carry more external load until the joint is opened, and yields at lower bolt load than the bolt <b>tightened</b> in elastic region. The friction coefficient has effect on the yield load, but not on the load-carrying capacity. Moreover, the scatter in the bolt preload due to friction begins with plastic deformation of bolt in the angle <b>tightening</b> control, whereas it begins with the onset of <b>tightening</b> in the torque <b>tightening</b> control. The observations are interpreted with the residual torsional stress in the bolt generated during the <b>tightening...</b>|$|R

Barnes passed the ball to Collymore in a space on the left flank; Collymore kicked it past Srníček to score his second goal of the game, which prompted jubilant scenes in the Liverpool Kop.

30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} typical {{relationships}} obtained for <b>tightening</b> angle versus clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque. In C. japonica, <b>tightening</b> torque and thread torque follow {{the profile of}} clamp force: first rising, then falling after reaching a peak value. The initial, sharp rise in <b>tightening</b> torque and thread torque is likely the initial driving torque when the lag screw head pressed against the bearing surface. Similar behavior was observed in P. menziesii at all <b>tightening</b> speeds and in C. obtusa at <b>tightening</b> speeds of 10 and 20  rpm. In all test specimens of C. obtusa at <b>tightening</b> speeds of 1 and 4  rpm, however, jagged, ‘sawtooth’ patterns are apparent in the relationships between <b>tightening</b> angle and clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque. During the experiments, the wooden members were heard to creak, suggesting these fluctuations were due to stick-slip behavior between the lag screw thread and the main member. When major stick-slip occurs, the resultant clamp force is predicted to be highly variable, even if a torque control method were applied.|$|R

Duncan Smith also felt the press gave the young pilot too much attention. Nevertheless, the two maintained a cordial relationship. In his short time as wing commander of Hornchurch, Finucane made a few alterations to the formation.

5|$|Perturbed {{by those}} who betrayed fellow members to the French and the {{problems}} this behaviour caused, Học convened a meeting to <b>tighten</b> regulations in mid-1929 at the village of Lac Dao, along the Gia Lam–Haiphong railway. This was also the occasion for a shift in strategy: Học argued for a general uprising, citing rising discontent among Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army. More moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature, and cautioned against it, but Học's stature meant he prevailed in shifting the party's orientation towards violent struggle. One of the arguments presented for large-scale violence was that the French response to the Bazin assassination meant that the party's strength could decline in the long term. The plan was to provoke a series of uprisings at military posts around the Red River Delta in early 1930, where VNQDD forces would join Vietnamese soldiers in {{an attack on the}} two major northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. The leaders agreed to restrict their uprisings to Tonkin, because the party was weak elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Sose {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast. A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to <b>tighten</b> to surface pressure gradient {{well to the}} south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds. In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough. At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone's circulation, causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection. Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening, and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined. Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate. The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335km (210mi) northeast of Norfolk Island. TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12. The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea, where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand.|$|E
