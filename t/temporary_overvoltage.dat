For extended cable/overhead MV distribution networks with ungrounded neutral, in case of low resistance faults at critical stretch of overhead lines, in [1] it has been evidenced that the <b>temporary</b> <b>overvoltages</b> on healthy phases can be very large, much higher than 3 p. u.

40|$|Arrester is used {{to protect}} high voltage {{equipment}} or electric power lines from permanent or <b>temporary</b> <b>overvoltage.</b> It is imperative to perform a frequent monitoring {{on the condition of}} the arrester as this device will prevent damage to the power system. When there is an AC operating voltage applied across the arrester body, there is a small leakage current flowing to the ground terminal of the arrester. Currently, the third harmonic component of the leakage current has been used to identify the condition of the arrester whether it is still safe to be used. However, measurements of the leakage current and its harmonic components pose some difficulties. Moreover, the usage of a new technique based on thermal condition in monitoring the performance of arrester has been studied widely. The thermal condition of an arrester can be used to support the efficiency of the monitoring process. This research proposes to investigate the correlation between two variables, namely the third harmonic leakage current, and the arrester housing surface temperature (representing the thermal condition of the arrester) using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network analysis. In addition, this research also studies the effect of ambient temperature on the correlation between the two variables. The leakage current values were measured using a current shunt and a digital storage oscilloscope, and then analyzed using Fast Fourier Transform to obtain its harmonic component. The surface thermal profile of the arrester body was captured using a thermal camera and then further analyzed to obtain several key representative parameters including the maximum, minimum, average, and standard deviation temperatures. These temperature parameters, together with the ambient temperature, were used as input variables while the third harmonic leakage current magnitude as a target to the proposed radial basis function neural network. The ambient temperature was then omitted in a repeated computation. From the radial basis function analyses, the two mentioned variables are positively correlated. Also, the ambient temperature has an effect on this correlation, whereby it is advisable also include the ambient temperature in the ANN computation to minimize the error. The results from all experimental data (500 training, 61 testing) show that a 97 % accuracy in categorizing the arrester condition (either good or bad) is successfully achieved. Thus, it can be concluded that there is a good correlation between the third harmonic leakage current and the thermal image of an arrester which means the thermal image can be used as an alternative technique for zinc oxide surge arrester monitoring without the need to measure the leakage current...|$|E

A joint failure in that cable system and recorded voltage and current wave-forms by the protective equipment that showed significant <b>temporary</b> <b>overvoltages</b> in another cable route have been the reason to analyze the switching surges in this EHV cable with shunt compensation. The cable model set up has been verified by comparison of field measurements and the digital simulations at first step.

Analytical formulas of cable length-loading relationship are presented to this purpose. The study shows that, in optimal operating conditions, most of the ampacity of such long underground cable lines can be exploited for active power transmission. Non-optimal operating envelopes are studied, showing the effect of terminal voltages and line losses on cable utilization and evidencing limited derating under realistic hypotheses. A parametric analysis of loading limits and possible voltage violations along the cable is shown; a simple criterion for optimal utilization of lossy cable lines is also proposed.

However the introduction of very long HV cable system can cause significant interaction between the existing network and the cable system itself. Most recent literature focuses about two main issues: •	Switching transients, mainly due to the distributed nature of the line. •	Low-order harmonic resonances, mainly due to the interaction of the cable capacitance with the (inductive) network impedance. Even if the first issue could be counteracted by proper selection of line-end surge arresters (SAs), the latter could result in <b>temporary</b> <b>overvoltages,</b> typically as a consequence of switching manoeuvres, especially troublesome to above mentioned SAs. The relative weakness of one or both interconnected networks, in terms of short circuit current, exacerbates the above issues; very long cable lines connecting weak nodes (such as offshore windfarms or small isolated networks) should thus be investigated by means of time and frequency domain studies, also due to the current lack of information about operating results of similar projects, most of which are presently under construction.

The effectiveness of PV-STATCOM is demonstrated even if the solar farm is located 30 km away from wind farm on a common distribution line. The PV-STATCOM utilizes the entire inverter capacity in the nighttime and the inverter capacity remaining after solar power generation during daytime.

40|$|Traditionally, extra {{high voltage}} (EHV) {{transmission}} systems consist exclusively of overhead lines (OHL) {{but in the}} recent years the utilization of high voltage AC (HVAC) power cables is increasing due to environmental, political and operational aspects. To study the impact of HVAC power cables on <b>temporary</b> <b>overvoltages</b> and slow front transients, a simulation model of the large-scale network is required. Guidelines concerning the modeling detail for the surrounding network need to be established to ensure sufficient accurate results. Existing guidelines for purely OHL transmission networks may not be adequate since the integration of HVAC power cables shift the harmonic impedance of the network to lower frequencies and that can affect the extent of the needed simulation model. Much effort can be saved from obtaining detailed data for an extensive but proper model, but a less detailed model might not describe the network behavior with sufficient accuracy. In this study, simplification options are considered, for which the time to construct and analyze a simulation model can be reduced. The simplification options are compared with the reference model (full detail), and judged based on three indicators for the level of accuracy: frequency and amplitude of the main resonance, and maximum over-voltage.

To that end, a model for PV array is developed to study the mismatch power loss in different PV array interconnection methods, especially during the partial shading condition. Further, a two-MPPT structure is proposed to reduce the mismatch power loss in centrally structured PV systems. Then, a single-stage VSC-based system is proposed to utilize the two-MPPT structure for better efficiency. The proposed system also doubles the DC-link voltage while respecting the safety standards, which in turn, increases the capacity and the efficiency of the central inverter. To further improve capacity and efficiency, a two-stage system is proposed in which the variable MPP voltage of smaller sub-arrays are regulated, by dedicated DC-DC boost converters, at the inverter DC-side terminals. This lets the inverter use the full DC voltage permissible rating and reduces the ohmic loss in DC and AC wirings and in the transformer. The system employs a three-level NPC inverter which generates output with better power quality, facilitates the adoption of two-MPPT structure, and permits utilizing low-voltage (half-rated) switches. The system also promotes the modular/distributed structure which improves the efficiency under partial shading and enables the possibility of utilizing PV modules of different types, ratings, and alignments. Finally, a mitigation technique is proposed in the inverter and grid-interface structures to prevent formation of damaging <b>temporary</b> <b>overvoltages,</b> which sometimes are produced in power systems by distributed generations including PV.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{attention}} towards underground cables (UGCs) has been {{stimulated by the}} development and performance enhancement of XLPE-insulated cables at HV and EHV level. The liberalisation of the energy market with the related need to connect new power plants and strengthen the grid, in conjunction with public opposition {{to the construction of}} new overhead lines, are increasingly prompting the installation of underground HV and EHV a. c transmission lines. The possibility of integrating power transmission and other services (i. e. railway and highway transport, bridges, galleries) in the same corridor or in the same "structure" is another significant technical challenge favouring underground technologies. This field has been advocated by Cigré which has investigated the topic by means of several working groups [1 - 4]. The paper analyzes some issues related to the electrical behaviour of long EHV a. c. cable lines both in steady-state and in transient conditions. In particular, the paper deals with the choice of the shunt reactive compensation degree from a twofold standpoint, that is, steady-state operation and network transients. The capability charts are a useful tool for highlighting the steady-state operating characteristics of a cable link, giving an immediate outlook of admissible active and reactive power flows along the link. The same charts also show regimes associated to undesirable voltages, and can be used to estimate the needed shunt compensation. The size of shunt compensation, lumped and equally shared at cable line terminals, can be evaluated in closed-form, based on steady-state line no-load energization/load rejection constraints. The paper points out that the rated line- and cable-charging breaking current of standard EHV circuit breakers should be checked as it may set significant minimum shunt compensation requirements, even in powerful meshed networks. It is also of interest to perform transient analyses of the cable line, aimed at verifying shunt reactor preliminary rating and determine other required characteristics of shunt reactors. With the increasing use of cables in the EHV network the likelihood of low-order harmonic resonance, owing to the large cable capacitance, is becoming of more concern. The low order harmonic resonance can give rise to <b>temporary</b> <b>overvoltages,</b> dangerous to line apparatuses due to their sustained nature. Notably, the energy absorption withstand capability of commonly adopted surge arresters can be exceeded.

40|$|REDUCTION OF TRANSIENT OVERVOLTAGES RESULTING OF THE HARMONIC INTERACTION IN SYSTEMS WITH HIGH POWER CONVERTERS AND DRIVES Background: <b>Temporary</b> <b>overvoltages</b> hamper {{the normal}} {{operation}} of electrical, control and communication systems. Generation of overvoltages in industrial systems with modern converters and drives is produced due to various mechanisms {{that have been}} studied under this project. Given that ecstatic converters inject harmonics to the feeding network, harmonic filters must usually be designed and installed {{in order to control}} distortion levels in levels that are safe for a productive operation and that abide by the established regulation (e. g. IEEE-Std. 519 - 92). However, these filters are voluminous, expensive, produce energy losses and besides, side effects that could harm the reliable operation of the electrical system are introduced. In fact, filters are constituted by capacitances, inductances and resistances that add natural oscillation modes to the already complex electrical system. For entire harmonics, multipulse converters are commonly used for cancellation of harmonics and filters tuned to reduce low-order harmonics. However, in installations with high power cycloconverters or current inverters (LCI), interharmonics are produced. For this reason, special and complex filters must be installed to reduce such interharmonics. However, these filters may provide natural ways that might contribute to harmful resonances that favour the production of overvoltages. Applying configurations of Active-Front-End (AFE) converters may help reducing this problem. It must be noted that for weak electrical systems, such as those used in Chilean mining industry, there are no unique solutions or robust design criteria. Modelling and understanding complex problems proposed in this project will contribute with new approaches to improve reliability of electrical systems with high-power drives and converters, adapted to Chile’s reality. Objectives: This project has studied the transient overvoltages phenomena resulting from the harmonic interaction in systems with modern high-power drives and converters together with configurations of converters, reduced filters and control methods that allow reducing such overvoltages, operating in weak electrical systems. Experimental prototypes have been designed and implemented for validating theoretical models developed. It is expected to produce a specific scientific impact in the development of knowledge and contributions in design applications for industrial electrical systems oriented towards service quality and reliability of high-power systems used in the mining industry in Chile, thus contributing to technological and process competitiveness. Other achievements: The project has also resulted in a significant contribution by increasing international presence in the most important conferences of this area, such as PESC' 04, PESC' 05 and soon PESC' 06, IAS' 04, IAS' 05 and soon IAS' 06.
