5|$|In 1945 Moore {{accompanied}} the British 11th Armoured Division when they liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. He {{spent three days}} sketching and painting {{the state of the}} camp, its prisoners and their captors, including Fritz Klein. It was suggested by one soldier <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> believe the portrayals, prompting Moore to also photograph the scenes as proof.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
5|$|During {{cleaning}} {{day at the}} Simpsons' house, Bart wins a KBBL radio contest {{after the}} station's DJs, Bill and Marty, call him up. They give Bart the choice of two prizes: $10,000 in cash or a full-grown African elephant. Bart chooses the elephant. This surprises Bill and Marty, who believed <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> ever choose an elephant, and thus have no elephant to give away. They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, prompting their boss to give them a choice: either arrange for delivery of the elephant, or lose their jobs. They decide on the former option.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{liberating}} {{element to}} saying something <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> {{say in a}} civilized environment. Being disgusting or politically wrong {{in front of an}} audience can surprise and shock an audience. e.g. jokes about paedophiles.|$|R
60|$|I replied {{there was}} not much {{advantage}} in George's coming, seeing he was a bachelor, and <b>that</b> therefore <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> be much benefited by his absence. But a woman never understands satire. Ethelbertha merely remarked it would look unkind leaving him behind. I promised to put it to him.|$|R

5|$|Archbishop Robert excommunicated Palatine Denis and put Hungary {{under an}} interdict on 25 February 1232, because the {{employment}} of Jews and Muslims continued despite the Golden Bull of 1231. Since the archbishop accused the Muslims of persuading Andrew to seize church property, Andrew restored properties to the archbishop, who soon suspended the interdict. Upon Andrew's demand, Pope Gregory sent Cardinal Giacomo Pecoraria as his legate to Hungary and promised <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> be excommunicated without the pope's special authorization. Although Andrew departed for Halych to support his youngest son in a fight against Daniel Romanivich, he continued his negotiations with the papal legate. On 20 August 1233, in the forests of Bereg, he vowed {{that he would not}} employ Jews and Muslims to administrate royal revenues, and would pay 10,000 marks as compensation for usurped Church revenues. Andrew repeated his oath in Esztergom in September.|$|E
5|$|In {{part because}} of {{pressure}} from Buddhist protests, Khánh removed the Catholics Phát and Đức from the posts of Interior Minister and IV Corps commander, respectively. They responded with a coup supported by the Catholic-aligned Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng, as well as General Trần Thiện Khiêm, a Catholic who had helped Khánh to power. Having captured the radio station, Phát then made a broadcast promising to revive Diệm's policies. Khánh managed to evade capture and, during {{the first stage of}} the coup, there was little activity as most senior officers failed to support either side. Throughout the day, Khánh gradually rallied more allies and the U.S. remained supportive of his rule and pressured the rebels to give up. With the backing of Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, commander of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, and General Nguyễn Chánh Thi, Khánh was able to force Phát and Đức to capitulate the next morning, September 14. Đức, Kỳ and Thi then appeared at a media conference where they denied that any coup had taken place and put on a choreographed display of unity, claiming <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> be prosecuted over the events.|$|E
25|$|No Alfa Romeo, a {{supporting}} cast of privateer Lago-Talbot entries {{and an almost}} undriveable, unreliable BRM would make Ferrari effectively invincible. The FIA was in an embarrassing position as it had already announced that current Formula One regulations would last until 1954 before switching to 2.5-litre atmospheric engines. Major manufacturers were already working to develop cars for the future regulation and it was obvious <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> develop a new car for only two years. The promoters of the World Championship Grands Prix, mindful {{of the lack of}} serious competition for the Alfettas, eventually all adopted Formula Two regulations for two years. However, Ferrari's dominance went on with the light 4-cylinder powered 500s, bringing Italian Alberto Ascari his two championships in the 1952 and 1953 seasons. Ferrari's Formula One cars continued to race very successfully in non-Championship Formula One and Formule Libre races through this period. Ironically, during this period the only World Championship race for which Formula One cars were eligible was the Indianapolis 500. In 1952 Ferrari entered four Formula One 375s with Alberto Ascari as lead driver, but with little success.|$|E

60|$|Then {{came the}} tea at Miss Lang's--a stately meal, {{when the two}} ladies were grand; Lord Northmoor became shy and frozen, monosyllabic, and only spasmodically able to utter; and Mary felt it in all her nerves and {{subsided}} into her smallest self, under the sense <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> ever <b>would</b> do him justice.|$|R

25|$|Attorney-General, Arthur Rylah, {{rejected}} a second plea to refer Ryan's {{case to the}} Full Court under Section 584 of the Crimes Act. A third attempt to save Ryan, {{in the form of}} a petition presented at the Crown Solicitor's office pleading for clemency, was also rejected. Close secrecy surrounded all government moves on the Ryan case. That evening, a former Pentridge prisoner, Allan John Cane, arrived in Melbourne from Brisbane in a new bid to save Ryan. An affidavit by Cane, which was presented to Cabinet, says he and seven prisoners were outside the cookhouse when they saw and heard a prison warder fire a shot from the No. 1 guard post at Pentridge Prison the day Hodson was shot. Police had interviewed these prisoners but none were called on at the trial to give evidence. Cane was immediately rushed into conference with his solicitor, Bernard Gaynor, who tried to contact cabinet ministers informing them of Cane's arrival. Gaynor telephoned Government House seeking an audience with the Governor, Sir Rohan Delacombe. However, Gaynor was told by a Government House spokesman <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> be answering calls until 9am (one hour after Ryan's scheduled execution). Gaynor said Cane's mission had failed.|$|E
500|$|Dredd's {{resignation}} was {{a significant}} event in the build-up to [...] "Necropolis" [...] (besides being inherently momentous in its own right). Chief Judge Silver ordered a news blackout on Dredd's resignation and then faked Kraken's execution after reimposing sentence of death for Kraken's crimes {{in the service of}} Judd. Reviving Kraken in secret, Silver overturned Dredd's verdict on him and made him a full judge, but on the condition that he impersonated Dredd, so <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> know that Dredd had left. Silver believed that Dredd had become such a symbol of law and order to the citizens that news of his departure would provoke a crimewave.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} years of the French Revolution, the leaders of the French National Constituent Assembly decided to {{introduce}} a completely new system of measurement based on the principles of logic and natural phenomena. [...] Specifically, the metre was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator, and the kilogram as the mass of one thousandth of a cubic metre of pure water. [...] Although these definitions were chosen so <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> [...] "own" [...] the units, they could not be measured with sufficient convenience or precision for practical use. [...] Instead copies were created in the form of the [...] and [...] which were a [...] "best attempt" [...] at fulfilling these principles.|$|E
2500|$|Adam Fergusson {{pointed out}} that in 1923, during the great Inflation in the Weimar Republic Gresham's Law began to work in reverse, as the {{official}} money became so worthless <b>that</b> virtually <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> take it. This was particularly serious because farmers began to hoard food. [...] Accordingly, any currencies backed by any sorts of value became the circulating mediums of exchange. In 2009, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe began to show similar characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|By September 2007, {{the number}} of plaintiffs in the case reached 10,000.

5000|$|Later in 2009, Love denied {{rumors that}} she had signed a deal with Custard Records.

[...] Love hired Stoked PR to handle her public relations across the U.K. and Europe {{in an attempt to}} raise awareness of the upcoming release of Nobody's Daughter.

500|$|The {{demolition}} companies, on the {{day prior}} to the implosion, advised the public to stay away for health and safety reasons, and watch the proceedings on TV or the internet. Several television stations had live streams of the event, and The Press announced that they would post a video on their website shortly after the implosion. An exclusion zone {{was put in place}} to ensure <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> be within approximately [...] of the building. Despite the advice, thousands of onlookers filled the street on the morning of 5 August, a Sunday. Punctually at 8am, a series of short explosions were heard, followed by another series a couple of seconds later. The building collapsed towards the north as planned, and the implosion manager from Controlled Demolition, Inc. said that it went a bit further than he had hoped, so he was lucky. The explosions were heard around Christchurch.|$|E
500|$|McMahon {{wrestled}} James Farwell in January 1878; Falwell won {{a controversial}} victory to retain {{his status as}} champion of the Pacific Coast. After McMahon's main rival, Colonel J.H. McLaughlin, retired, McMahon ceased to compete as well. The two had never faced each other, {{but there was a}} dispute as to who would win if such a match took place. McMahon returned to Virginia City to open a saloon. In October of that year, McLaughlin offered a bet <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> be able to defeat Robert Wright, one of his trainees. McMahon accepted the bet, defeated Wright, and arranged a match against McLaughlin. He defeated McLaughlin in a best-of-three match on November 23, 1878. A rematch took place, which McLaughlin won. The third and final contest between the two took place in March 1879 and ended in a draw. On May 12 of that year, McMahon defeated Australian [...] "Professor" [...] William Miller in a best-of-three match before a crowd of over 2000 spectators in Gilmore's Garden in New York.|$|E
500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people." ...|$|E
60|$|He put {{his hands}} up feebly to his {{throbbing}} brow. This was a ghastly idea--a ghastly accusation.

He never bore <b>that</b> unsullied name. <b>Nobody</b> <b>would</b> know he was a Kelmscott of Tilgate.|$|R
60|$|Then Mr. Plomacy {{declared}} his apprehension that the Honourable Johns and Honourable Georges {{would come in}} a sort of amphibious costume, half-morning, half-evening, satin neck-handkerchiefs, frock-coats, primrose gloves, and polished boots; and that, being so dressed, they would decline riding at the quintain, or taking part in any of the athletic games which Miss Thorne had prepared with so much fond care. If the Lord Johns and Lord Georges didn't ride at the quintain, Miss Thorne might be sure <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> else <b>would.</b>|$|R

500|$|Some {{months later}} Lucan moved again, {{to a larger}} rented flat in nearby Elizabeth Street. Despite an early attempt by his wife at reconciliation, by that point all Lucan wanted from the {{marriage}} was custody of his children. In an effort to demonstrate that Veronica was unfit to look after them, he began to spy on his family (his car was regularly seen parked in Lower Belgrave Street), later employing private investigators to perform the same task. Lucan also canvassed doctors, who explained {{that his wife had}} not [...] "gone mad", but was suffering from depression and anxiety. Lucan told his friends <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> work for Veronica (she sacked the children's long-term nanny, Lillian Jenkins, in December 1972). Of the series of nannies employed in the house, one, 26-year-old Stefanja Sawicka, was told by Veronica that Lucan had hit her with a cane and had, on one occasion, pushed her down the stairs. The countess apparently feared for her safety and told Sawicka not to be surprised [...] "if he kills me one day." ...|$|E
500|$|Orlando, {{a former}} {{professional}} singer, had had two top-40 {{hits in the}} USA in 1961, but later moved into the music publishing business; in 1967 Columbia Records chose him to manage their publishing division, April-Blackwood Music. When Medress approached Orlando, {{he was reluctant to}} perform on a Bell Records single, as {{he did not want to}} jeopardize his job at Columbia. Medress reassured him by saying they would use a band name for the release, and <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> know who the singer was. Orlando finally agreed, partly because he believed the song would be unsuccessful and would not attract any attention. He went into a studio with Appell and Medress, and sang his lead vocal over prerecorded tracks. Background vocals were done by Wine and the Tokens' Jay Siegel; Orlando was not present when these were recorded. By different accounts, additional background singers may have included Ellie Greenwich, Robin Grean, Leslie Miller, and Linda November. Phil Margo and Siegel played instruments on at least one of the versions of the song. The music of Orlando's version has been described as having [...] "a lilting, sing-along groove".|$|E
500|$|Smith visited Britain and the United States in November 1982, {{and spoke}} scathingly about Zimbabwe to reporters, {{claiming}} that Mugabe was turning {{the country into}} a totalitarian Marxist–Leninist dictatorship. Government retribution was immediate. On Smith's return home, police raided an art exhibition hosting him as guest of honour in Harare (as Salisbury had been renamed in April 1982) and took all the attendees in for questioning, ostensibly because of suspicions it might be an illegal political meeting. A week later, police seized his passport, according to a government statement because his criticism of Zimbabwe while abroad constituted [...] "political bad manners and hooliganism". Police meticulously searched his Harare house and Gwenoro over the next week, confiscating firearms, personal papers and a diary. Smith told reporters all this was [...] "part of the game to intimidate me and so demoralise the whites". Some RF MPs left the party to sit with ZANU–PF or as independents, feeling that constantly confronting Mugabe was ill-advised and unnecessary. Smith, however, remained convinced <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> stand up for white Zimbabweans {{if they did not}} stick together and defend their interests in parliament.|$|E
60|$|Laura did not, {{like her}} brother and sister, seek for {{consolation}} from Mr. Ross or Mary. She went on her own way, saying little, fulfilling her household cares, writing all the letters <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> write, providing for Charles's ease, and looking thoroughly cast down and wretched, but saying nothing; conscious that {{her brother and}} sister did not believe her affection for Guy equal to theirs; and Charles was too much dejected, and too much displeased with Philip, to try to console her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not going," [...] {{returned}} Rachel, {{an announcement}} that electrified her auditors, {{for the family}} quota of books being quite insufficient for her insatiable appetite, she was a subscriber on her own account, and besides, this was the grand annual gathering for disposing of old books, when she was relied on for purchasing all the nuts <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> crack. The whole affair {{was one of the}} few social gatherings that she really tolerated and enjoyed, and her mother gazed at her in amazement.|$|R

500|$|In {{his final}} years, Elgar {{experienced}} a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival {{of his works}} to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when {{it was out of}} fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished works. He asked Reed to ensure <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> [...] "tinker" [...] with the sketches and attempt a completion of the symphony, but at other times he said, [...] "If I can't complete the Third Symphony, somebody will complete it – or write a better one." [...] After Elgar's death, Percy M. Young, in co-operation with the BBC and Elgar's daughter Carice, produced a version of The Spanish Lady, which was issued on CD. The Third Symphony sketches were elaborated by the composer Anthony Payne into a complete score in 1998.|$|E
500|$|Writer David Wolstencroft {{decided that}} Tom Quinn would use IT as his cover story for Ellie Simm, because IT has, {{according}} to Wolstencroft, [...] "something {{that has an}} enormous amount of thought and technical fact behind it <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> really understand," [...] and according to series producer Jane Featherstone, has people reluctant to be asking questions about. A scene where a cat escaped during Zoe's operation to bug Kane's cottage, and the ensuing search in the rain mirrored an experience during Wolstencroft's early career. It was also intended that the episode established that although spies plan heavily before operations, things can go wrong. Among the main cast, Peter Firth was attracted to appearing on Spooks after hearing of Howard Brenton's involvement in the series. The cast were advised by ex-MI5 officers in order to help give insight into how the characters operate in the spy world and how their personal lives would be affected by it. The character Maisie Simm (Heather Cave), Ellie's daughter, was created because Featherstone believed that [...] "children are the best spies of all"; Maisie is often seen [...] "spying" [...] on Tom throughout the episode and first series. Megan Dodds guest starred as Christine Dale; the producers were sufficiently impressed with her performance that she would later return as Dale in the second series.|$|E
2500|$|However, Humayun {{after he}} won back the Empire had renamed Salimghar Fort as [...] "Nurghar" [...] {{since the first}} ruler of Sur Dynasty, Sher Shah Suri (father of Salim Shah Suri who had built the fort) had earlier usurped his Kingdom in 1540 AD. He had, therefore, decreed <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> use its {{original}} name in his court.|$|E
60|$|Now {{you must}} know that, years ago, this very mill had been {{occupied}} by a wicked old miser, who died there, leaving--so it was rumoured- -all his money hidden somewhere about the place. Naturally enough, every one who had since come to live at the mill had tried to find the treasure; but none had ever succeeded, and the local wiseacres said <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> ever <b>would,</b> unless the ghost of the miserly miller should, one day, take a fancy {{to one of the}} tenants, and disclose to him the secret of the hiding-place.|$|R
25|$|Arthur's father {{insists that}} Arthur {{has to get}} the play {{published}} so that Arthur, Dana, and their mother can profit immensely from it. He wants Arthur to claim the quarto was found by Sil in an attic in the 1950s, and to verify <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> have a claim to the text (namely, the estates of the printer and publisher, William White and Cuthbert Burby). A.E.H. Phillips reveals that he is dying, and, with Dana and Petra's encouragement, Arthur agrees {{to carry out this}} last request in spite of his lifelong distrust of his father.|$|R
2500|$|Her first {{contract}} {{allowed her}} to record compositions only by Four Star writers, which Cline found limiting. Later, she expressed regret over signing with the label, but thinking <b>that</b> <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> have her, she took the deal. Her first record for Four Star was [...] "A Church, A Courtroom & Then Good-Bye," [...] which attracted little attention, although it led to appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. As these performances were not [...] "records" [...] per se, they were not governed by her contract, and she could sing what she wanted, within reason.
