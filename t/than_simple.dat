5|$|The manuscripts are {{all thought}} {{to derive from}} a common original, but the {{connections}} between the texts are more complex <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> inheritance via copying. The diagram at right gives {{an overview of the}} relationships between the manuscripts. The following is a summary of the relationships that are known.|$|E
5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, counting symmetry is more restrictive <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E
5|$|Palaces {{are usually}} {{arranged}} around {{one or more}} courtyards, with their façades facing inwards; some examples are adorned with sculpture. Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers. There is abundant evidence that palaces were far more <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> elite residences, and that a range of courtly activities took place in them, including audiences, formal receptions, and important rituals.|$|E

5000|$|Confirmatory {{tests are}} the tests {{required}} {{to confirm the}} analysis. Confirmatory tests cost more <b>than</b> <b>simpler</b> presumptive tests so presumptive tests are often done to see if confirmatory tests are necessary.|$|R
5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and saw it as more <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged. They have not spoken since.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperative}} gameplay {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation <b>than</b> <b>simple,</b> verbal instructions.|$|E
25|$|Endosymbiotic gene transfer, {{the process}} of genes that were coded in the {{mitochondrial}} genome being transferred to the cell's main genome likely explains why more complex organisms, such as humans, have smaller mitochondrial genomes <b>than</b> <b>simpler</b> organisms, such as protists.|$|R
30|$|As {{the optimal}} {{pagination}} algorithm has {{a wider range}} of available solutions to search <b>than</b> <b>simpler</b> pagination strategies, it is able to select a solution that is more homogeneous (according to the objective function from (1)), where the content is well distributed over the document pages.|$|R
50|$|The {{equation}} {{is often used}} to derive a precise temperature of a thermistor since it provides a closer approximation to actual temperature <b>than</b> <b>simpler</b> equations, and is useful over the entire working temperature range of the sensor. Steinhart-Hart coefficients are usually published by thermistor manufacturers.|$|R
25|$|The {{effects of}} priming {{can be very}} salient and long lasting, even more so <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> {{recognition}} memory. Unconscious priming effects can affect word choice on a word-stem completion test long after the words have been consciously forgotten.|$|E
25|$|In heating mode, {{heat pumps}} are {{three to four}} times more {{effective}} at heating <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> electrical resistance heaters using the same amount of electricity. Typically installed cost for a heat pump is about 20 times greater than for resistance heaters.|$|E

25|$|Smart meters go a {{step further}} <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> AMR (automatic meter reading). They offer {{additional}} functionality including a real-time or near real-time reads, power outage notification, and power quality monitoring.

25|$|However, {{systematic}} sampling is {{especially vulnerable to}} periodicities in the list. If periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used, the sample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population, making the scheme less accurate <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> random sampling.|$|E
25|$|Keynesian {{economics}} has two successors. Post-Keynesian economics also {{concentrates on}} macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. Research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on real-life practices rather <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> optimizing models.

25|$|In {{principle}} {{once the}} orbital elements {{are known for}} a body, its position can be calculated forward and backwards indefinitely in time. However, in practice, orbits are affected or perturbed, by other forces <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> gravity from an assumed point source (see the next section), and thus the orbital elements change over time.|$|E
25|$|Atoms {{sticking}} together in molecules or crystals {{are said to}} be bonded with one another. A chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them. More <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.|$|E
25|$|Petroski {{notes that}} most {{engineering}} failures {{are much more}} involved <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> technical mis-calculations and involve {{the failure of the}} design process or management culture. However, not all engineering failures involve ethical issues. The infamous collapse of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, and the losses of the Mars Polar Lander and Mars Climate Orbiter were technical and design process failures.|$|E

50|$|One set of {{techniques}} for AI-based crowd simulation is to model crowd behavior by advanced simulation of individual agent motivations and decision-making. Generally, this means each agent is assigned some set of variables that measure various traits or statuses such as stress, personality, or different goals. This results in more realistic crowd behavior though {{may be more}} computationally intensive <b>than</b> <b>simpler</b> techniques.|$|R
25|$|From the {{phosphonium}} salts, these reagent {{are formed}} more readily, requiring only NaOH, {{and they are}} usually more air-stable. These are less reactive <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> ylides, and so they usually fail to react with ketones, necessitating {{the use of the}} Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction as an alternative. They usually give rise to an E-alkene product when they react, rather than the more usual Z-alkene.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the root affects {{the way in which}} verbs {{conjugate}}. Consonant-initial roots conjugate differently than vowel-initial roots, for example, and causative verbs conjugate differently <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> verbs. Prefix vowels may be lost or merged with the root vowel, epenthetic vowels and consonants may be found, and root vowels may be affected. The following example shows the aspectual inflection of three verbs in Mitla Zapotec.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} {{states that}} a continuous probability distribution must possess a density, or equivalently, its {{cumulative distribution function}} be absolutely continuous. This requirement is stronger <b>than</b> <b>simple</b> continuity of the cumulative distribution function, {{and there is a}} special class of distributions, singular distributions, which are neither continuous nor discrete nor a mixture of those. An example is given by the Cantor distribution. Such singular distributions however are never encountered in practice.|$|E
50|$|The texture can be {{compared}} to Mozzarella, Feta or a Mizithra, since it does not melt easily. Akkawi can be stored up to a year. The texture and flavor is a result of its specific culturing from its curds that are kept together for a prolonged period longer <b>than</b> <b>simpler</b> tasting curd cheese such as Syrian cheese when akkai is transformed into cheese.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{algorithms}} designed to perform dithering. One of the earliest, and {{still one of}} the most popular, is the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm, which was developed in 1975. One of the strengths of this algorithm is that it minimizes visual artifacts through an error-diffusion process; error-diffusion algorithms typically produce images that more closely represent the original <b>than</b> <b>simpler</b> dithering algorithms.|$|R
