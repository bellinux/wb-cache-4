2500|$|James' {{instructions}} {{included several}} requirements {{that kept the}} new translation familiar to its listeners and readers. The text of the Bishops' Bible would serve as the primary guide for the translators, and the familiar proper names of the biblical characters would all be retained. If the Bishops' Bible was deemed problematic in any situation, the translators were permitted to consult other translations from a pre-approved list: the Tyndale Bible, the Coverdale Bible, Matthew's Bible, the Great Bible, and the Geneva Bible. In addition, later scholars have detected an influence on the Authorized Version from the translations of Taverner's Bible and the New Testament of the Douay–Rheims Bible. It {{is for this reason}} that the flyleaf of most printings of the Authorized Version observes that the text had been [...] "translated out of the original tongues, and with the former translations diligently compared and revised, by His Majesty's special commandment." [...] As the work proceeded, more detailed rules were adopted as to how variant and uncertain readings in the Hebrew and Greek source texts should be indicated, including the requirement that words supplied in English to 'complete the meaning' of the originals should be printed in a different <b>type</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

60|$|Those Far Eastern {{paintings}} {{which have}} to do with man fall for the most part under one of two heads, the facetious and the historical. The latter implies no particularly intimate concern for man in himself, for the past has very little personality for the present. As for the former, its attention is, if anything, derogatory to him, for we are always shy of making fun of what we feel to be too closely a part of ourselves. But impersonality has prevented the Far Oriental from having much amour propre. He has no particular aversion to caricaturing himself. Few Europeans, perhaps, would have cared to perpetrate a self-portrait like one painted by the potter Kinsei, which was sold me one day as an amusing tour de force by a facetious picture-dealer. It is a composite picture of a new kind, a Japanese variety of <b>type</b> <b>face.</b> The great potter, who was also apparently no mean painter, has combined three aspects of himself in a single representation. At first sight the portrait appears to be simply a full front view of a somewhat moon-faced citizen; but as you continue to gaze, it suddenly dawns on you that there are two other individuals, one on either side, hob-nobbing in profile with the first, the lines of the features being ingeniously made to do double duty; and when this aspect of the thing has once struck you, you cannot look at the picture without seeing all three citizens simultaneously. The result is doubtless more effective as a composition than flattering as a likeness.|$|E

Using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), tomography was carried out on sagittal sections corresponding to the four upper incisors.

The measurements were processed using analysis of variance and Tukey's test. At the upper central incisors, short <b>face</b> <b>type</b> patients presented a greater alveolar bone thickness than long <b>face</b> <b>type</b> patients. In short <b>face</b> <b>type</b> and norm <b>face</b> <b>type</b> subjects the root apex of the upper incisors was farther away from the lingual cortex than in the long <b>face</b> <b>type</b> patients.
