5000|$|In Norway, {{the problem}} with <b>tipping</b> grit <b>bins</b> over have been solved by making them {{large enough to hold}} about 500 kg of grit, and to {{continually}} keep it topped up.|$|R
50|$|Side loaders {{are loaded}} from the side, either manually, {{or with the}} {{assistance}} of a joystick-controlled robotic arm with a claw, used to automatically lift and <b>tip</b> wheeled <b>bins</b> into the truck's hopper.|$|R
50|$|The Grootegeluk plant uses {{horizontal}} belt {{vacuum filtration}} to dewater fines.The mine has the world’s largest coal beneficiation facility, with six plants that upgrade 8,000 tonnes per hour of run-of-mine coal.The new plant installed to extract and process coal {{for the new}} Medupi Power Station {{will be the first}} in the world to use mobile <b>tipping</b> <b>bins</b> and crushers in the pit near the benches.This equipment will advance as the mine advances.To minimize production stoppages, there will be run-of-mine stockpiles between the pit and the plant.Stockpiles will also be used between the plant and the discard dump stackers.The plant will use dry screening to avoid having to pump tailings to tailings dams.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically-powered shaft-hoisting {{equipment}} replaced whips and whims in {{the larger}} mines. The rope from a steam winding-engine (generally housed in a simple building nearby) passed over a pulley {{on top of the}} headframe and carried a hook on the end to which a cage, bucket, or other item could be attached for raising or lowering in the shaft. The brace provided a platform for handling both mullock and ore, the mullock being trammed to the mullock heap and the ore being <b>tipped</b> into <b>bins</b> for gravity-loading into either tramway trucks or horse- drawn drays.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of chopper harvesters solved the loading problem. These harvesters chop the cane stalks into short lengths or billets. The billets are {{ejected from the}} harvester directly into bins towed by motor vehicle alongside the harvester. The bins are towed to the rail siding where they are transferred onto tram or rail wagons. Alternatively, the billets are <b>tipped</b> into <b>bins</b> on the wagons. By the mid-1960s, chopper harvesters had almost completely superseded whole stalk harvesters. The extant cane lifts probably all predate this time and some could date to the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Since {{some in the}} U.S. {{government}} {{claimed that}} they had caught bin Laden without Pakistani help, numerous allegations were made {{that the government of}} Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the very close proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the US chose not to notify Pakistani authorities before the operation and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. US government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were <b>tipping</b> off <b>bin</b> Laden every time US forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops.|$|R
5|$|Australian ravens are {{intelligent}} birds, {{and like}} many other corvids have innovative methods of seeking out food. Foraging {{takes place in the}} early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead, or by walking along and looking. However, they occasionally feed in trees—Australian ravens forage eucalypt foliage for Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus), and devote a substantial amount of time to look for nests and eggs to eat. They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs. Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over, or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to store it. They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue. Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas, such as school playgrounds, rubbish <b>tips,</b> <b>bins</b> outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards. In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers. Australian ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.|$|R

5000|$|There {{has been}} debate {{in recent years}} over whether to {{consider}} them a pest or a possibly endangered species. Birds in tourist areas of Sydney such as Darling Harbour, the Royal Botanic Gardens, or Centennial Park have been a problem due to their strong smell. Populations in the latter two areas have been culled.The birds have also come {{to be regarded as}} a problem species in Victoria {{as a result of their}} scavenging activities, scattering rubbish from <b>tips</b> and <b>bins</b> in the process. They are even known to snatch sandwiches from picnickers. Such behaviour, together with their propensity to build nests in [...] "inappropriate" [...] places, and competition with captive animals, led to surplus birds being relocated from Healesville Sanctuary to Sale. However, the birds returned in a few days.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries Arab and Swahili traders visited Mwata Kazembe {{to trade}} in copper, ivory and slaves. Trade routes such as that from Zanzibar via Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika were well established, and the Sultan of Zanzibar's name carried weight. Livingstone was held up {{southeast}} of Lake Tanganyika by a conflict between Tippu <b>Tip</b> (Ahmed <b>bin</b> Mohamed, whom Livingstone called Tipo Tipo) and a local chief. When he reached Mwata Kazembe's he found a trader named Mohamad Bogharib had arrived {{a few days before}} seeking ivory, and Mohamad bin Saleh (also known as Mpamari), a trader who had been there for ten years, as Mwata had refused to let him leave. Despite their involvement in the slave trade, Livingstone travelled with and was helped by them; he claimed to have used his influence to get Mohamed bin Saleh released.|$|R
5|$|Accounts of how bin Laden {{was located}} by U.S. {{intelligence}} differ. The White House and CIA director John Brennan {{stated that the}} process began with a fragment of information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of investigation. This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S. began intensive multiplatform surveillance. According to journalist Seymour Hersh and NBC News, however, the U.S. was <b>tipped</b> off about <b>bin</b> Laden's location by a Pakistani intelligence officer who offered details of where the Pakistani Intelligence Service held him in detention {{in exchange for a}} bounty.|$|R
500|$|The film's retitling by AIP {{caused a}} minor fracas in Hong Kong. A group of British sailors {{had seen the}} movie at the base cinema under its {{original}} title and one week later unwittingly saw the movie again in a local cinema, playing under the American release title. They immediately demanded their money back and, when the manager refused, they <b>tipped</b> over litter <b>bins,</b> threw popcorn at the screen, and [...] "almost tore the theatre apart."

5000|$|Mpororo Kingdom {{remained}} {{more famous}} than its successor states. In 1887, Henry Morton Stanley was denied permission to cross Mpororo. Stanley's {{view of the}} Bahororo was unfortunate: [...] "I had {{to negotiate with the}} people of Mpororo who were absolutely savage and never before came into contact with the stranger besides being in perpetual blood feud." [...] Stanley's fellow traveller was Sheikh Ahmed bin Ibrahim, a Muslim trader. The Sheik claimed, [...] "The Wanya-Ruanda-Bahororo are great people but they are covetous, malignant, treacherous and utterly untrustworthy. They have never yet allowed Arabs to trade in their country. There is plenty of ivory there during the last eight years. Khamis <b>Bin</b> Abdullah, Tippu <b>Tip,</b> Sayid <b>bin</b> Habib and myself have frequently attempted to enter there but none of us has ever succeeded. You cannot proceed through Mpororo for the people are Shaitan (Satanic) and the Wanya-Ruanda-Bahororo are wicked and because something happened when the Wangwana (bad people) tried to go there, the natives never tolerated stranger people and are full of guile verily." ...|$|R
40|$|This article maps four {{different}} types of cross-cultural experience in contemporary historical novels about colonial Africa (colonialist, exoticist, intercultural, and transcultural) before focusing on Buch’s Sansibar Blues (2008) {{as a case study}} in German postcolonial memory and the literary use of transcultural voices. Together with Ilja Trojanow’s Der Weltensammler (2006) Sansibar Blues marks a new departure in the history of writing cross-cultural experience and representing the Other, but unlike Trojanow Buch uses partially authentic non-European voices that draw on the autobiographies of two prominent nineteenth-century figures in the linked histories of Zanzibar and Germany, Emily Ruete alias Princess Sayyida Salme of Oman and Zanzibar and ivory dealer Tippu <b>Tip</b> alias Hamed <b>bin</b> Mohammed. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of Buch’s adaptation of these sources...|$|R
40|$|The point-free {{relational}} calculus {{has been very}} successful as a language for discussing general programming principles. However, {{when it comes to}} specic applications, the calculus can be rather awkward to use: some things are more clearly and simply expressed using variables. The combination of variables and relational combinators such as converse and choice yields a kind of nondeterministic functional programming language. We give a semantics for such a language, and illustrate with an example application. 1 Introduction The following question appeared on a rst year exam in algorithm design: The data type of trees is given by data Tree a = <b>Tip</b> a j <b>Bin</b> (Tree a) a (Tree a) : That is, a tree is a tip labelled with an element, or it consists of node that contains two subtrees and a label.

50|$|There are {{considerations}} {{which need}} {{to be taken into account}} when determining which mode is optimal for sampling for a given application. It has been shown that sampling in contact mode with very soft samples can damage the sample and render it useless for further studies. Sampling in non-contact mode is less destructive to the sample, but the tip is more likely to drift out of contact with the surface and thus it may not record data. Drifting of the tip is also seen due to piezo hysteresis, which causes displacement due to molecular friction and polarization effects due to the applied electric field.It is important to note the correlation between resolution and curvature of tip radius. Early STM <b>tips</b> used by <b>Binning</b> and Rohrer were fairly large, anywhere between some hundred nm to 1 µm in radius. In more recent work, the tip radius of curvature was mentioned as 10-40 nm. By reducing the radius of curvature of the tip, it allows for the enhanced detection of deviations within the OPVs surface morphology. Tips often {{need to be}} replaced due to tip rounding, which leads to a decrease in the resolution. Tip rounding occurs due to the loss of outermost atoms present at the apex of the tip which can be a result of excessive force applied or character of the sample.|$|R
