5|$|In the United States, {{the first}} Wing Coaster to be {{announced}} was X-Flight, which opened at Six Flags Great America on 16 May 2012. Dollywood's Wild Eagle actually opened earlier on 24 March 2012, making it the first Wing Coaster in North America. On 13 August 2012, Cedar Point announced {{plans to build a}} new Wing Coaster called GateKeeper, which set new records for a Wing Coaster including longest <b>track</b> <b>length,</b> fastest speed and drop height. The first Wing Coaster in Asia, Parrot Coaster, opened at Ocean Kingdom on 25 January 2014. Thorpe Park announced that the last two rows of The Swarm would be turned backwards – a first for a Wing Coaster – for the 2013 season. On 24 July 2014, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari announced Thunderbird, the first launched Wing Coaster.|$|E

40|$|During {{the postwar}} period, many {{countries}} have de-tracked their secondary schools, {{based on the}} view that early tracking was unfair. What are the e ¢ ciency costs, if any, of de-tracking schools? To answer this question, we develop a two skills- two jobs model with a frictional labour market, where new school graduates need to actively search for their best match. We com-pute optimal <b>tracking</b> <b>length</b> and the output gain/loss associated to the gap between actual and optimal <b>tracking</b> <b>length.</b> Using a sample of 18 countries, we 8 ̆ 5 nd that: a) actual <b>tracking</b> <b>length</b> is often longer than optimal, which might call for some e ¢ cient de-tracking; b) the output loss of having a <b>tracking</b> <b>length</b> longer or shorter than optimal is sizeable, and close to 2 percent of total net output...|$|R
25|$|As of the Fourth Quarter (Q4) of 2013, {{the average}} weekday {{ridership}} on the San Diego Trolley system was 119,800, {{making it the}} fourth busiest Light rail system in the United States. Taking overall <b>track</b> <b>length</b> into consideration, the San Diego Trolley transported 2,239 daily passengers per route mile in Q4 2014, making it the twelfth busiest Light rail system on a per mile basis over this time period. Weekday ridership on the Trolley has been relatively high since Q3 2013 (see table at right).|$|E
25|$|Tornadoes vary in {{intensity}} regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with <b>track</b> <b>length</b> and duration also varies, although longer track (and longer lived) tornadoes {{tend to be}} stronger. In the case of violent tornadoes, {{only a small portion}} of the path area is of violent intensity; most of the higher intensity is from subvortices. In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger).|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{most cities}} {{once had a}} {{streetcar}} system, but today the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) is the only traditional operator of streetcars, and maintains the Western Hemisphere's most extensive system in terms of <b>track</b> <b>length,</b> number of cars, and ridership. The city has added two new streetcar lines in recent years (510 Spadina in 1990, and 509 Harbourfront in 2000), and is upgrading its other lines.

25|$|The first trams in Bratislava {{started in}} 1895, {{and the system}} {{currently}} has 8 metre-gauge lines in service with a <b>track</b> <b>length</b> of 39.5km. A new tram line is being built across the river Danube to the Petrzalka suburb on the right bank. Cars in service include PCCs from CKD-Tatra of type T3SUCS, with modernised variations of T3SU-M, T3CS-M, T3G, T3S, T3AS, T3Mod and T3P, K2S (which are modernised CKD-Tatra K2s), type T6A5 and the newest additions 30x Skoda ForCity 29T and 30x Skoda ForCity 30T. The original T3SUCS trams {{are no longer in}} regular service, but are held in reserve. There are multiple plans for expanding the network, but funding is currently unclear.|$|E
25|$|The world's first {{commercial}} maglev system was a low-speed maglev shuttle that ran between the airport terminal of Birmingham International Airport {{and the nearby}} Birmingham International railway station between 1984 and 1995.

It operated for 11 years and was initially very popular with passengers, but obsolescence problems with the electronic systems made it progressively unreliable as years passed, leading to its closure in 1995. One of the original cars is now on display at Railworld in Peterborough, together with the RTV31 hover train vehicle. Another is on display at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E

Western Railway local trains leaving from Churchgate railway station go up to Dahanu Road railway station {{in the district}}. Central Railway local trains leaving from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus go up to Kalyan, Ulhasnagar, Ambarnath, Badlapur, Karjat and Kasara. In 1994, a new connection made from Diva Junction to Vasai. This connection joined Central Railway and Western Railway networks and its length is 41.96km. Konkan Railway network also passes through a part of the district.

There are several buttons, allowing the user to love, skip, or ban a song. The love button adds the song to the user's loved tracks list; the ban button ensures that the song will not be played again. Both features affect the user's profile. The skip button does not. Other buttons allow the user to tag or recommend the currently playing track. Other features offered by the application are: minor editing of the user's profile including removing recently played artists and songs from the loved, banned, or previously played track lists; lists of friends and neighbours, lists of tags and a list of previously played radio stations. Users can also open their full Last.fm profile page directly from the player.|$|E
25|$|The ride's {{superstructure}} {{is entirely}} timber in construction, the timber being fir and pine; and is completely clad in painted sheets of steel. It measures around 460ft {{in length and}} 100ft in width. The highest point of the track is 70ft above ground level. It has a long <b>track</b> <b>length</b> of 3,223.10 feet (982.40 meters) - the second longest scenic in the world. The actual track is wooden and the running rails are in a trough with walkways either side. The ride is often called a side-friction coaster, which is misleading as the train makes no contact with the side walls of the track; the running wheels are simply flanged like those of railway vehicles (hence the name scenic railway). The ride features two large drops, the first {{one of which is}} a 'headchopper' where the train dives under some of the support structure of the ride. There are also other large drops and a bunnyhop sequence which gives very good air-time both at the front and back of the train. In total there are nine drops. A typical ride time is 3:05, but can vary depending on the styles of the particular brakemen.|$|E
