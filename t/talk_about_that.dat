[...] Davis {{said that the}} song's concept deals with his childhood, saying [...] "People think 'Daddy' was written because my father abused me, but that's not what the song's about. When I was a kid, I was being abused by someone else. I don't really like to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song."

Durand was determined to create [...] "the best album yet", and set up dates and recording sessions with Chase and Schlesinger to work on what would become All Hours. The album explored new genres for Ivy, including EDM and electronic music, something Chase stated [...] "seem natural and ma sense".|$|E
500|$|In 1982, {{an investigative}} {{reporter}} named Gary Moore from the St. Petersburg Times drove from the Tampa area to Cedar Key looking for a story. When he commented to a local on the [...] "gloomy atmosphere" [...] of Cedar Key, and questioned why a Southern town was all-white when {{at the start of}} the 20th century it had been nearly half black, the local woman replied, [...] "I know what you're digging for. You're trying to get me to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> massacre." [...] Moore was hooked. He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother. Moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history: [...] "After a week of sensation, the weeks of January 1923 seem to have dropped completely from Florida's consciousness, like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet".|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really like to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album {{where the majority of}} the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E

500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. I would <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> with financiers, and I could see them glaze over." ...|$|E
500|$|There are {{frequent}} references to Star Wars in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens. There is also reference to Star Wars when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. In [...] "The Head and the Hair", Liz tells Jenna that [...] "The Head" [...] asked her out and says [...] "I had to say yes. I mean he looked at me with those handsome guys eyes. It was like the Death Star tractor beam when the Falcon was...", until Jenna interrupts her and says [...] "No Liz, do not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> stuff on your date. Guys like that do not like Star Trek", to which Liz corrects [...] "Wars!". Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to executive producer and writer Robert Carlock, whom she described as [...] "the resident expert".|$|E
500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, to get to that place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and I think with these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E

500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E

2500|$|Facing forward, Moore {{could not}} see Sanchez miss the handoff, but he recalls that [...] "You could feel it, you knew {{something}} wasn't right." [...] When the fumble occurred, Moore was not aware that his buttocks had caused it; he learned of his role only after the game. When asked about the play, Moore answered, [...] "Why do I need to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> I don't understand why y’all keep asking about that play. ... I {{think it was a}} miscue with the handoff." [...] After consulting Sanchez and his assistant coaches, Jets head coach Rex Ryan echoed the analysis: [...] "My understanding is, I thought [...] reversed out the wrong way. That's what happened. It was a mental mistake and then he just tried to slide. When he did, he actually ran into Brandon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perry, whose {{performance}} {{was seen as}} an improvement over past debates, attacked Romney because he hired a lawn service using illegal immigrants; Perry said, [...] "The idea that you stand here before us and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> you're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy." [...] Romney replied that after they found out the company used illegal immigrants, they let them go, criticising Perry's tuition credit for the children of illegal immigrants, adding that [...] "If there's someone who has a record as governor with regards to illegal immigration that doesn't stand up to muster, it's you, not me.". Romney also remarked that upon discovering that illegal immigrants were working on his property, he told the contractor, [...] "you can't have any illegals working on our property, that's... I'm running for office, for Pete's sake! I can't have illegals." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a December 3, 2009, {{interview}} with Rusty Humphries, Palin {{was asked about}} President Barack Obama's birth certificate. [...] She stated, [...] "I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't {{have a problem with}} that. I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." [...] When asked if people had a legitimate reason to question the certificate, she stated, [...] "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game." [...] She also stated that the questions were 'fair play' because, [...] "the weird conspiracy theory freaky thing that people <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Trig isn't my real son– 'You need to produce his birth certificate, you need to prove that he's your kid,' which we have done. [...] Maybe we can reverse that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, {{band members}} {{continued}} with the sentiment {{that it was}} possible, depending mostly on everyone's schedule. In a November 2011 interview, Patrick said {{of the future of}} the band: Those guys are amazing, it's basically this simple: Robert has a studio in his basement where he can totally do his old-fashioned kind of classic sound. They can write and record at any moment in time, they can get Ray Luzier in to play drums and I can take it {{for a week or two}} and write vocals or sing it. So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still come up to me and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Army of Anyone record". And I think that I honestly could probably do a way better job just 'cause of what I've learned lately as a singer...I think the best Army of Anyone record is still to come, it's still totally doable and could be even better.|$|E

2500|$|Leslie then {{produced}} {{her entire}} album, {{which is a}} mix of pop and R Cassie described her sound as [...] "mellow, chill, and easy to relate to. This album represents what I've always wanted to do." [...] She said in another interview, [...] "I rap, I sing, I do my R, I do my slow songs and stuff that the girls will love, I have a down South joint, I have a rock song that I did with my girls–this band called Pretty Boys. [...] It has some funk, some old stuff, it's really fun." [...] She paid tribute to her Filipino culture by incorporating OPM sounds into some of the ballads. While describing the process of working with Leslie, she stated, [...] "I will talk about situations that I was going through at the time and we'll <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and it comes straight from the heart that's why it works out well between us," [...] continuing about her songwriting input, [...] "I was just kind of going along with it trying to get the vibe. I'm starting to get into it and I'm excited to write." [...] Cassie also mentioned [...] "Not With You" [...] was one of her favorite songs, [...] "It's slow, it's simple, and you get to really hear me as opposed to all the synthesizers and everything in the background," [...] and compared the second single, [...] "Long Way 2 Go," [...] to Vanity 6's vibe. [...] "I'm hoping to show I can do a wide range of things," [...] concluding, [...] "The whole album really just goes back to love songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 2003, Zuckerberg told Cameron Winklevoss in {{an email}} {{that he did}} not expect {{completion}} of the project to be difficult. Zuckerberg writes: [...] "I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night." [...] The next day, on December 1, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. [...] "I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional." [...] On December 4, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: [...] "Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set." [...] On December 10, 2003: [...] "The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway." [...] A week later: [...] "Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with." [...] On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading “Harvard Connection,” however, this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was [...] "completely swamped with work [...] week" [...] but had [...] "made some of the changes ... and they seem to be working great" [...] on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [...] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.|$|E
