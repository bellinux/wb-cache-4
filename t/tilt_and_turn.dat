40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} standing posture and performance of concurrent cognitive tasks in subjects confronted by whole field visual motion. Movements {{of the head and}} centre of pressure (COP) were recorded in 12 subjects who performed modified Brooks spatial and verbal tasks when in quiet stance viewing a chequerboard pattern, planar, visual field, moving with uniform velocity (25 °/s, 50 °/s and 76 °/s). Eight subjects were also tested seated to control for the effect of stance. Task load was monitored by heart rate and eye movements were recorded to ensure viewing compliance. Subjects rated their quotidian susceptibility to visual disorientation on a validated scale. In both lateral and antero-posterior directions there were small amplitude but significant increases in COP sway path length and standard deviations of both COP and head sway during exposure to visual motion in proportion to visual flow speed. Performing cognitive tasks during visual motion attenuated sway S. D. The effects on sway of task and visual flow were independent. Visual motion induced a slight <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> of the head and body in the direction of flow together with slight neck flexion. Errors on both verbal and spatial tasks increased > 250 % during visual motion both when standing and when seated. Ratings of subjects’ susceptibility to disorientation were un-related to either verbal or spatial task error rates. A current hypothesis is that the enhancement of sway by visual motion is destabilisation. We propose an alternative explanation that sway enhancement could be exploratory ‘testing of the ground’ movements to check for self motion. Hence decrease in sway magnitude during a cognitive task could be caused by a reduction in exploratory movement because attention is diverted from postural control to a secondary task. Mere passive viewing of a moving visual field may interfere with cognitive tasks possibly because the threat of disorientation by whole field motion diverts attentional resources...|$|E

40|$|Windows {{and doors}} are {{essential}} elements of buildings. These seemingly simple components have become increasingly complex over the last decades. They have to fulfil an increased number of functions which ask for contradictory solutions and need to comply {{with more and more}} severe requirements. Windows and doors need to be transparent to allow vision and passage of light, they need to open for ventilation and at the same time, they have to resist external conditions such as wind loads, sound transmission, thermal transmittance, air and water infiltration. Additionally, windows and doors need to fulfil user requirements such as ease of operation and allowance for cleaning. Due to contradicting functions, windows and doors have become complex assemblies in which sub-components are brought together to fulfil various requirements. Performance of the assembly as a whole is determined by the composition of the sub-components and quality of manufacturing and installation. The level of accomplishment of requirements essentially influences {{the health and safety of}} the occupants as well as the indoor air quality. The methods for performance determination of windows and doors are regulated by the European harmonized standard "EN 14351 : Windows and doors – Product standard, Performance characteristics''. The first part of this standard lists twenty-two material independent performance requirements of which seventeen require full scale tests. Furthermore, windows and doors are highly customized and are not produced in large series to meet specific requirements of building design and their occupants. Thus, the performance determination procedures and consequent extensive testing require allocation of manufacturers’ resources. Another major problem is caused by the current methods for performance assessment by physical testing. Every test is afflicted with uncertainties due to sampling and measurement methods. Yet, little is known about the extent and effect of these test-related uncertainties on the reliability of the performance assessment. Therefore, effective and resource efficient performance assessment methods are needed by the window industry in Europe. This research proposes an approach towards the use of assessment models for performance determination of windows and doors. The developed assessment models focus on the window performances in terms of their resistance against wind load, watertightness and air permeability because (1) these three performance characteristics are commonly classified as “essential characteristics” in most national regulations due to their significant influence on product durability and health and safety of users; (2) very few parametric studies have addressed their determination with methods other than testing; (3) the three performance characteristics are consecutively determined with a single test setup and therefore, the performance assessment for wind load, watertightness and air permeability is traditionally perceived as one single performance determination process. In order to develop assessment models, the relevant parameters have to be identified which govern the three above mentioned performance characteristics. For this scope, tests were carried out to assemble test data and information on the variation of test results. Within this study, sixty-one window specimens have been tested in three laboratories to provide data for development and verification of assessment models where required. The window configurations included in this study were single and multiple casement units representing <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> <b>turn,</b> vertical and horizontal sliding and pivot operating mechanisms. The tests have been carried out in a controlled laboratory environment in accordance with EN 14351 - 1. A large variance was observed in repeated watertightness tests. This indicates a low reproducibility of the current test method. The test results of air permeability and resistance against wind load, were reproducible and produced reliable test data. Further testing schemes have been developed to investigate the reliability of the test results for each performance criterion. With the test results together with expert knowledge, it could be shown that for each performance characteristic, a particular modelling approach had to be chosen. A mechanical model was developed to assess the relative frontal deflection of frame members during wind load. Air permeability is determined with a two-stage regression approach. In the first stage, the amount of air loss is analysed by a multiple linear regression model and in the second stage, air permeability classes are defined by an ordinal logistic regression model. The failure mechanism of a window against water penetration and the probability of occurrence of such a failure are determined by a probabilistic model. This research showed that operation and casement configurations are influential aspects to consider in assessment of window and door performances. Operation and casement configuration prescribe a certain functional system with specific component sets; therefore the performance for each of those differs. This study measured large variations between performances of different window configurations. The hardware system, specifically the maximum distance between fixing points, the number of fixing points along the window perimeter and stiffness of the casement frame profiles, are other parameters that have been indicated as performance determinants in modelling. The modelling outcomes were verified with the available test results in order to evaluate the prediction quality of the assessment models. The verification of model results proved to be satisfactory for all studied performances. This research provides conclusions on the parameters that affect the performance of windows. Moreover the assessment models developed in this study enable virtual prototype testing. The window performance can be assessed and improved at the design and prototype stage and innovation processes can be accelerated. Additionally, the results of this study can be used for policy advice with respect to product performance declaration processes for windows and doors in the countries that adopt European harmonised standards. Declarations of performances with indication of variance of results can be given and definitions and methods provided in product and test standards can be improved.

40|$|ABSTRACT−Narrow {{commuter}} vehicles {{can address}} many congestion, parking and pollution {{issues associated with}} urban transportation. In making narrow vehicles safe, comfortable and acceptable to the public, active tilt control systems are likely to play a crucial role. This paper focuses {{on the development of}} an active direct tilt control system for a narrow vehicle that utilizes an actuator in the vehicle suspension. A simple PD controller can stabilize the tilt dynamics of the vehicle to any desired tilt angle. However, the challenges in the tilt control system design arise in determining the desired lean angle in real-time <b>and</b> in minimizing <b>tilt</b> actuator torque requirements. Minimizing torque requirements requires the <b>tilting</b> <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> of the vehicle to be synchronized as closely as possible.

Second, a nonlinear control system that utilizes feedback linearization is developed and found to be effective in reducing torque.

The pervasive usage of mobile devices, i. e., smartphones and tablet computers and their vast amount of sensors represent a plethora of side chan-nels posing a serious threat to the user’s privacy and se-curity. While recent advances in this area of research focused on the employed motion sensors and the cam-era as well as the sound, we investigate a less obvious source of information leakage, namely the ambient light. We successfully demonstrate that minor <b>tilts</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> of mobile devices cause variations of the ambient-light sensor information. Thus, we are the first to show that this sensor leaks sensitive information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these variations leak enough informa-tion to infer a user’s personal identification number (PIN) input based on a set of known PINs. Our results show that we are able to determine the correct PIN—out of a set of 50 random PINs—within the first ten guesses about 80 % of the time. In contrast, the chance of finding the right PIN by randomly guessing ten PINs would be 20 %. Since the data required to perform such an attack can be gathered without any specific permissions or privileges, the presented side channel seriously jeopardizes the se-curity and privacy of mobile-device owners. ...|$|R

If an auxiliary shutter is present, it may perform the function of the lens cap. After the exposure the dark slide is replaced to protect the exposed plate from stray light. The plate holder is either turned for a second photo, or brought to the darkroom for plate development and copying. The camera would be supplied with a number of plate holders, each usually holding two plates, one on either side.|$|R

The camera passes by the closed, neon-lit stores, and locks onto the shopwindow of [...] "Parisienne Bridalwear" [...] where a seemingly perfectionist designer is busy adjusting the garments of waxy-looking mannequins of bride and groom. The bride dummy, played by Bextor, suddenly starts to blink and roll its eyes. The designer finally decides to move the groom, played by Swedish recording artist Jonas Myrin, away from Bextor and places it beside the other bride-doll. The Bextor-dummy starts to sing and performs clumsy movements of its various body parts, <b>tilting</b> <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> its head, trying axial hand-rotation, but all these remain unnoticed by the designer who leaves the scene. Bextor's motion becomes gradually smoother, as the doll keeps singing and is getting more and more alive.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} possibility of controlling a simple biped having {{two degrees of freedom}} only. The biped robot walked on large feet. Having large feet enabled the robot to stand on one leg stably. At any time, the robot’s center of gravity remained above the area covered by one of the feet. Two servos actuated the two degrees of freedom tilting the robot to the side or moving the legs forward and backward. The biped moved by alternately <b>tilting</b> <b>and</b> striding. <b>Turns</b> were produced by dragging the feet along the ground. As the feet dragged, the friction generated under the feet created a turning moment that rotated the robot. Thus, the robot was able to step <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> on a flat surface. A control algorithm was developed to attempt trajectory tracking with the biped. Trajectories along a surface can be defined in terms of linear and angular velocities. In this research, it was assumed that a high level controller had transformed a desired trajectory into discrete steps of linear and angular velocities. Motion tests showed how various settings of the servos affected the step length <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> angle of the robot.

The tray was divided into two halves which were transferred one after the other. Silicone: Futar-D/Memosil. The trays had not been segmented and were transferred as a whole. Ten trays were made from each material. In the in-vitro-study at every transfer seven of the brackets were bonded on a cast which replaced the patient. Before and after the transfer the positions of the brackets were optically measured from a steady camera position at two different levels which formed a known correlating angle. For each bracket position and each level one sagittal data and one transversal data were determined in a 2 -D coordinate system. The vertical bracket position was calculated from the coordinates of both levels. The following results had been ascertained: The maximum bracket difference occurred with all three materials in a vertical levels. The average mistake in the vertical level presented similar results in all three methods. At the sagittal level bigger mistakes had significantly been ascertained at the thermoplastic trays.

Based on 6 – 12 pieces of AS-OCT images at different directions, the <b>tilt</b> angle <b>and</b> decentration values were shown, respectively. The method of the surface fitting to the IOL surface can accurately analyze the IOL’s location, and six pieces of AS-OCT images at three pairs symmetrical directions are enough to get <b>tilt</b> angle <b>and</b> decentration value of IOL more precisely...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive optics {{systems can}} measure {{high-order}} aberrations using an artificial laser beacon {{without the need}} for a relatively bright object near the object being imaged. Unfortunately, <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus measurements are difficult to obtain from a laser beacon. One solution is to use light from the object being imaged to measure <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus. Through analysis, I estimate the performance of using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with 2 by 2 sub-apertures for measuring <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus. Specifically, I discuss implementing this scheme for the sodium beacon adaptive optics upgrade to the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) 3. 5 m telescope. I use wave-optics simulation tools to evaluate the performance of the <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> focus sensor in the SOR sodium beacon system. 1...|$|R
