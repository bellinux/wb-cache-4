5|$|Bubbles (born April 30, 1983) is {{a common}} chimpanzee, known for being the {{one-time}} companion animal of American recording artist Michael Jackson, who bought the primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s. The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led <b>to</b> <b>media</b> mockery and, among other factors, a public perception of Jackson as eccentric. During the Bad world tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan, where they both drank tea with the mayor of Osaka.|$|E
5|$|Contrary <b>to</b> <b>media</b> {{reports and}} {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the United States, based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines {{for the management of}} natural fires.|$|E

40|$|Why {{is it so}} {{difficult}} to resist the desire <b>to</b> use social <b>media?</b> One possibility is that frequent social media users possess strong and spontaneous hedonic reactions <b>to</b> social <b>media</b> cues, which, in turn, makes it difficult <b>to</b> resist social <b>media</b> temptations. In two studies (total N = 200), we investigated less frequent and frequent social media users’ spontaneous hedonic reactions <b>to</b> social <b>media</b> cues using the Affect Misattribution Procedure - an implicit measure of affective reactions. Results demonstrated that frequent social media users showed more favorable affective reactions in response <b>to</b> social <b>media</b> (vs. control) cues, whereas less frequent social media users' affective reactions did not differ between social media and control cues (Studies 1 and 2). Moreover, the spontaneous hedonic reactions <b>to</b> social <b>media</b> (vs. control) cues were related to self-reported cravings <b>to</b> use social <b>media</b> and partially accounted for the link between social media use and social media cravings (Study 2). These findings suggest that frequent social media users' spontaneous hedonic reactions in response <b>to</b> social <b>media</b> cues might contribute to their difficulties in resisting desires <b>to</b> use social <b>media...</b>|$|R

The message accompanied the announcement of an Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which had been subject <b>to</b> <b>media</b> speculation since February 2007. Both Windows and Wii versions of the game are to be republished using the new title.|$|E
5|$|Netball gained Olympic {{recognition}} in 1995 after 20 years of lobbying.

Some funding sources became available with {{recognition in}} 1995, including the International Olympic Committee, national Olympic committees, national sport organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E

5|$|Eagle Boys {{was founded}} in Albury, New South Wales by {{businessman}} Tom Potter in 1987. Since 1992, Eagle Boys national headquarters have been located in Annerley, Queensland. In 2007 NBC Capital, a Queensland-based venture capital group, bought Eagle Boys from Potter. At the chain's peak, in 2013, more than 340 Eagle Boys stores were operating across Australia. Outlet numbers fell drastically {{between the end of}} 2013 and the end of 2014 to around 170. In July 2016, fewer than 130 stores remained open and administrators were brought in to the head office to identify restructuring options ahead of a potential sale of the business, although the move did not extend to franchisee-operated outlets. In November 2016, Pizza Hut announced <b>to</b> <b>media</b> that it had merged with Eagle Boys. As at that date, 114 Eagle Boys stores operated throughout Australia; making it the fourth largest pizza chain in the country, with less than 10% share of the country's pizza market.|$|E

5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According <b>to</b> <b>media</b> reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, {{the project}} was called into {{question}} when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due <b>to</b> <b>media</b> and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film. Scott rewrote the script {{in an attempt to}} reduce the film's budget by $20 million, but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns, and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott's last three films, , White Squall, and G.I. Jane. Likewise, Schwarzenegger's recent films at the time (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio's latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative, as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project, with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions, but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{disclosed}} in an FCC filling {{that it was}} unable to find buyers for the three affected stations, requiring changes to its transaction. In Harrisburg, Sinclair chose to retain WHP-TV, and divest WHTM <b>to</b> <b>Media</b> General. However, in Charleston and Birmingham, the company proposed to shut down stations entirely (rather than selling them to other buyers that would also handle their operational responsibilities) so it could maintain legal duopolies; surrendering the licenses for WCIV and the full-powered repeaters of WBMA-LD (WJSU and WCFT), and moving their ABC programming to Sinclair's existing stations WMMP and WABM respectively – which would shift their existing MyNetworkTV programming to digital subchannels. After nearly a year of delays, Sinclair's deal to acquire Allbritton was approved by the FCC on July 24, 2014.|$|E
