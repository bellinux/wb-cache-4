5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> <b>the</b> safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E

5|$|Further controversies have {{occurred}} {{because of the}} company's involvement in the Middle East. The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli-occupied territories led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise; the dispute eventually erupted into a geopolitical conflagration involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law. The case eventually elicited reactions from {{the members of the}} 22-nation Arab League; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King's business licenses within the member states' territories. A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of Canon Law, Shariah, regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity, and, with the former example, posed a larger question about the lengths that companies must go <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> <b>the</b> smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve.|$|E

In response Yasser Arafat denounced the hijacking and offered to assist in negotiating for a peaceful conclusion to the incident.

At Port Said, Egypt, these two joined the PLO representative from Cairo – Zohdi al-Qoudra.

25|$|Trøndelag Flygeselskap {{remained}} in business until 1950. A new airline, A/S Trønderfly, was established on 11 July 1950 {{and bought a}} single aircraft, serving the uncovered market in the surge of the first company's failure. Trønderfly bought only a single aircraft, which it chose not <b>to</b> <b>insure.</b> <b>The</b> company folded after it crashed the following year. Widerøe thus established itself with a Seabee at Lade in 1951. In addition to the taxi, scenic and ambulance flights, Widerøe also conducted aerial photography, at first using a Fairchild Cornell.

25|$|In the {{following}} {{months after the}} creation of provisional government in Thessaloniki in late August, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified.

On the other hand, the king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognise Venizelos' provisional government or further support it, guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected, and a promise that any war material surrendered to the Allies would be returned after the war.|$|E
25|$|On December 19, {{the cost}} of credit default swaps <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> <b>the</b> debt of Ford was 68 percent the sum insured for five years in {{addition}} to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8million paid upfront to insure $10million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year. In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt for equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position. These actions yielded Ford a $2.7billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years.|$|E

25|$|The overall {{dimensions}} {{and weight of}} the BMD-3 are diminutive in comparison to its counterparts. The crew consists of a driver, a vehicle commander, and a gunner and holds four passengers. There are seats for mounted infantrymen {{in the middle of}} the hull, with one stowage rack for three 9M111 or 9M113 ATGMs. There are also three racks for ammunitions boxes and a filter-ventilation unit. The commander's seat is on the right of the turret and has a cupola with a hatch cover that opens forward, while the gunner's seat is on the left and has a single-piece hatch cover that opens to the front. Of the four passengers, two are seated at the front with the other two near behind the turret. A firing port is provided on each side of the BMD-3. Additional infantry can be seated for short distances to the immediate rear of the turret with the roof hatch open. The seats of the combat crew are fastened to the roof of the combat compartments to improve protection from IEDs and mines. The engine compartment is located towards the rear of the BMD-3 consisting of a 450hp (horsepower) 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine, main clutch, gearbox, final drives and brakes. A collective NBC protection system was provided by over-pressurization of the combat compartment via a filter-ventilation unit <b>to</b> <b>insure</b> <b>the</b> survivability of the crew in an environment contaminated by nuclear fallout.|$|E
