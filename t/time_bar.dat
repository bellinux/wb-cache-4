25|$|The channel {{originally}} {{featured a}} lower display line (LDL) {{similar to that}} seen on TWC at the bottom one-tenth of the screen, to display continuous weather information and inform viewers of current and forthcoming segments in tab form (the tab highlighting the segment being aired at the time cycled between the segment's title and a countdown clock). The national feed's LDL showed current conditions (denoting the sky condition, and cycling through the temperature, wind data and if applicable, apparent temperature) and daypart forecasts for 20 major U.S. cities, and the current time in all four time zones in the Contiguous U.S. The localized versions – which were keyed over the national LDL – cycled through current conditions and forecasts for cities within proximity of the metropolitan area, with the <b>time</b> <b>bar</b> corresponding to the local time zone. As part of a graphical overhaul on February 20, 2017, the LDL {{was replaced by a}} progress bar counting down the runtime of the current segment, which had previously appeared atop the LDL.|$|E
500|$|Parasite Eve is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game. Movement in the [...] "world map" [...] (which is {{a map of}} Manhattan) is limited to specific destinations." [...] Upon the player walking over a [...] "hot spot", there's a chance of a random encounter. Enemies materialize and attack players on the same screen that they move Aya around on, with no battle mode or screen being used. In battle, the game uses a pausable real-time combat system with an Active <b>Time</b> <b>Bar</b> (ATB) that sets the time that must be waited till the player can take their next action. While waiting for her turn, the player character Aya can be moved around to dodge enemy attacks. Upon each turn, the player may choose between attacking with their equipped weapon by pressing the attack button, using PE (Parasite Energy) for defense, assistance, or attack, using items, changing weapon or armor, or escaping the battle. If the player chooses to attack, the battle briefly pauses and a dome/sphere symbolizing {{the range of the}} weapon appears, allowing the player to target an enemy within range. [...] Parasite Energy recharges during battle but the more players use it, the slower it refills.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the help}} of a fairy known as Wanda (who can create bombs) and Birdo (who {{provides}} encouragement for Toad), Toad must rescue the Mushroom Kingdom from Wario's greed and power. When Toad's <b>time</b> <b>bar</b> runs out, Birdo is replaced by Wario, who occasionally lowers the ceiling, and Wanda is replaced by a pigeon, who spawns monsters insteadof bombs. Birdo and Wanda replace them after Toad's <b>time</b> <b>bar</b> runs out again, ad infinitum. Toad's job is to take the bombs and line them up with the enemies of the woods, to defeat Wario's monsters. If Toad clears enough monster-packed sections of the forest (including various mini-bosses), he'll go up against Wario himself. After defeating Wario the first time, it is then revealed to Toad that the villain that he had just defeated was a [...] "False Wario", and that the real Wario in the meantime had prepared for the final battle by inflating himself to a massive size. Upon defeating the real Wario, the antagonist soon shrinks back to his regular size and is soon chased out of the woods by the victorious Toad; thus, allowing peace to finally be restored to the woods. The ending to the SNES version of Wario's Woods is slightly different as it instead involves Toad destroying Wario's Castle {{through the use of a}} large bomb which as a result causes the castle to go crumbling down and puts an end to Wario's rule and spell over the Mushroom Kingdom and its inhabitants.|$|E
2500|$|Day's {{argument}} {{was characterized by}} the Court as relying primarily on Habeas Rule 4, which requires district courts to [...] "promptly examine" [...] petitions and dismiss [...] "if it plainly appears...that the petitioner is not entitled to relief." [...] Day argued that this limited a court's ability to raise AEDPA's limitation sua sponte to the preanswer, initial screening stage, and that after that point, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governed the proceedings. [...] Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c), {{the statute of limitations}} defense is forfeited if it is not asserted in its answer, or an amendment thereto, just as the State of Florida failed to do. [...] However, the Court believed that were it to accept Day's position, courts would rarely be positioned to raise AEDPA's <b>time</b> <b>bar</b> sua sponte because information essential to the time calculation is often absent until the State has filed, along with its answer, copies of documents from the state-court proceedings, {{as was the case in}} Day's proceedings.|$|E

60|$|There {{are some}} {{exceedingly}} useful words in this language. SCHLAG, for example; and ZUG. There are {{three-quarters of a}} column of SCHLAGS in the dictonary, and a column {{and a half of}} ZUGS. The word SCHLAG means Blow, Stroke, Dash, Hit, Shock, Clap, Slap, <b>Time,</b> <b>Bar,</b> Coin, Stamp, Kind, Sort, Manner, Way, Apoplexy, Wood-cutting, Enclosure, Field, Forest-clearing. This is its simple and EXACT meaning--that is to say, its restricted, its fettered meaning; but there are ways by which you can set it free, so that it can soar away, as on the wings of the morning, and never be at rest. You can hang any word you please to its tail, and make it mean anything you want to. You can begin with SCHLAG-ADER, which means artery, and you can hang on the whole dictionary, word by word, clear through the alphabet to SCHLAG-WASSER, which means bilge-water--and including SCHLAG-MUTTER, which means mother-in-law.|$|E
6000|$|Bar was a sight wondrous to behold, {{and full}} of matter, when, jauntily waving his double eye-glass by its ribbon, and jauntily {{drooping}} to an Universe of jurymen, he, in the most accidental manner ever seen, found himself at Mr Merdle's shoulder, and embraced that opportunity of mentioning a little point to him, on which he particularly wished to be guided {{by the light of}} his practical knowledge. (Here he took Mr Merdle's arm and walked him gently away.) A banker, whom we would call A. B., advanced a considerable sum of money, which we would call fifteen thousand pounds, to a client or customer of his, whom he would call P. q. (Here, as they were getting towards Lord Decimus, he held Mr Merdle tight.) As a security for the repayment of this advance to P. Q. whom we would call a widow lady, there were placed in A. B.'s hands the title-deeds of a freehold estate, which we would call Blinkiter Doddles. Now, the point was this. A limited right of felling and lopping in the woods of Blinkiter Doddles, lay in the son of P. Q. then past his majority, and whom we would call X. Y.--but really this was too bad! In the presence of Lord Decimus, to detain the host with chopping our dry chaff of law, was really too bad! Another <b>time!</b> <b>Bar</b> was truly repentant, and would not say another syllable. Would Bishop favour him with half-a-dozen words? (He had now set Mr Merdle down on a couch, side by side with Lord Decimus, and to it they must go, now or never.) ...|$|E
60|$|Long after Bar got made Attorney-General, {{this was}} told {{of him as}} a master-stroke. Lord Decimus had a reminiscence about a pear-tree {{formerly}} growing in a garden near the back of his dame's house at Eton, upon which pear-tree the only joke of his life perennially bloomed. It was a joke of a compact and portable nature, turning on the difference between Eton pears and Parliamentary pairs; but it was a joke, a refined relish of which would seem to have appeared to Lord Decimus impossible to be had without a thorough and intimate acquaintance with the tree. Therefore, the story at first had no idea of such a tree, sir, then gradually found it in winter, carried it through the changing season, saw it bud, saw it blossom, saw it bear fruit, saw the fruit ripen; in short, cultivated the tree in that diligent and minute manner before it got out of the bed-room window to steal the fruit, that many thanks had been offered up by belated listeners for the trees having been planted and grafted prior to Lord Decimus's time. Bar's interest in apples was so overtopped by the wrapt suspense in which he pursued the changes of these pears, from the moment when Lord Decimus solemnly opened with 'Your mentioning pears recalls to my remembrance a pear-tree,' down to the rich conclusion, 'And so we pass, through the various changes of life, from Eton pears to Parliamentary pairs,' that he had to go down-stairs with Lord Decimus, and even then to be seated next to him at table in order that he might hear the anecdote out. By that <b>time,</b> <b>Bar</b> felt that he had secured the Foreman, and might go to dinner with a good appetite.|$|E
