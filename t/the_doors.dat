5|$|Arriving at the Necromanteion, the reunited crew is {{attacked}} by Clytius, Pasiphaë, {{and a group}} of their minions. Each of the demigods uses some aspect of their newly strengthened powers or identities to help defeat these monsters; for example, Hazel's new power and alliance with Hecate helps her defeat Pasiphaë and Clytius. During the questers' journey in the mortal world, Percy and Annabeth have been travelling through Tartarus {{to the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> of Death, aided by the Titan Iapetus (Bob) and a few other beings. As the other demigods fight in the world above, Percy and Annabeth's group reaches <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> and fights the personification of Tartarus to destroy the chains holding <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> in place. Bob stays behind amongst hordes of angry monsters to defend <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> while Percy and Annabeth escape. Once the full quest group is safely reassembled in the mortal world, Reyna arrives on her dying Pegasus. Annabeth says that Reyna, as a Roman, should bring the Athena Parthenos (in the Argo IIs hold) back to Camp Half-Blood to appease both the Greeks and Romans, with Nico and Coach Hedge volunteering to accompany her.|$|E

5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and flashlight, {{albeit with}} slightly altered usage. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> {{can only be}} closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{are built}} {{on top of a}} {{standard}} door closer. To open <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>the</b> operator forces the closer in the opening direction. Then, the closer closes <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> user may open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> manually, using just <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closer. In case of power failure while <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is open, <b>the</b> closer itself closes <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

5|$|Huston {{designed}} the large bronze {{doors at the}} capitol's main entrance. They were modeled by sculptor Otto Jahnsen and were both cast in one piece using the lost wax method of casting by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> are decorated with scenes {{from the history of}} Pennsylvania, such as the arrival of William Penn and his peace treaty with the Lenape. Busts of people who were important {{in the construction of the}} capitol, like Governor Pennypacker, Boies Penrose, and Matthew Quay, decorate the edges of <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> The bust of Huston hides the doors' keyhole.|$|E
5|$|Located {{near the}} retablo {{is a large}} room called the ante-sacristy, a storage room for church {{utensils}} and decorations. This room is connected to either the convent or the main sacristy which stores the church's liturgical vestments. Several wooden chests inside the sacristy carries the flaming heart, {{a symbol of the}} Augustinian order and okir motifs. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> leading to both the ante-sacristy and sacristy is similar to <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of another Jesuit church, the Maragondon Church. The sacristy was also built at that same time with the baptistry in 1852.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> typically until a timeout occurs and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closes. <b>The</b> {{operation of}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working {{door open and}} door close buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open and door close buttons are used to manually open or close <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some door close buttons immediately closing <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so <b>the</b> <b>door</b> cannot be closed until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close button has no effect. However, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so <b>the</b> <b>door</b> won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close will immediately close <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a <b>door</b> open push. <b>The</b> minimum timeout for automatic <b>door</b> closing in <b>the</b> US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} is {{designed in the}} Italianate style, with the specialty leanings demanded by a schoolhouse. The front facade, which faces southwest today, is adorned with three doorways—left, right, and center— which span a front porch beneath the bell tower. When the school was open, the use of <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> was restricted. The left and right doors were used by boys in first through eighth grades while the middle door was earmarked as an entry for girls of all ages. Each of <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> feature transoms topped with cornices.|$|E

5|$|The train {{doors were}} {{originally}} designed to be opened and closed automatically and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator doors do. Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying to}} close <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, {{runs out of}} time, runs {{off the edge of}} the floor he is on, or if all <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> are open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular Mario series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos and their variations.

50|$|A third {{strategy}} is to equip <b>the</b> <b>door</b> itself with a stopping mechanism. In this case, a short metal bar capped with rubber, or another high friction material, {{is attached to a}} hinge near the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opposite <b>the</b> <b>door</b> hinge and on the side of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which is in the direction that it closes. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is to be kept open, the bar is swung down so that the rubber end touches the floor. In this configuration, further movement of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> towards being closed increases the force on the rubber end, thereby increasing the frictional force which opposes the movement. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is to be closed, the stop is released by pushing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> slightly more open which releases the stop and allows it to be flipped upwards. A newer version of equipping <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with <b>the</b> stopping mechanism is to attach a magnet to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on <b>the</b> side which opens outward which then latches onto another magnet or magnetic material on the wall or a small hub on the floor. The magnet must be strong enough to hold the weight of <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but weak enough to be easily detached from the wall or hub.|$|R

5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
5|$|By 14 March 2012, all {{elevated}} {{stations have}} been retrofitted with <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and are operational. These doors prevent suicides and unauthorised access to restricted areas.

5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is hung {{at the top}} {{from two}} points, it also needs a bottom track/stay roller {{to prevent it from}} {{swinging}} sideways.

A groove is cut into the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which runs over this guide, preventing lateral movement of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> With a glass <b>door</b> <b>the</b> panel runs through the guide as illustrated.Because <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is always engaged in the guide, when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is open <b>the</b> floor is clear, hence 'clear threshold' ...|$|R
