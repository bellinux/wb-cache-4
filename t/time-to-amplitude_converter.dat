50|$|A ramp-compare ADC {{produces}} a saw-tooth signal that ramps {{up or down}} then quickly returns to zero. When the ramp starts, a timer starts counting. When the ramp voltage matches the input, a comparator fires, and the timer's value is recorded. Timed ramp converters require the least number of transistors. The ramp time is sensitive to temperature because the circuit generating the ramp is often a simple oscillator. There are two solutions: use a clocked counter driving a DAC and then use the comparator to preserve the counter's value, or calibrate the timed ramp. A special advantage of the ramp-compare system is that comparing a second signal just requires another comparator, and another register to store the voltage value. A very simple (non-linear) ramp-converter can be implemented with a microcontroller and one resistor and capacitor. Vice versa, a filled capacitor can be taken from an integrator, <b>time-to-amplitude</b> <b>converter,</b> phase detector, sample and hold circuit, or peak and hold circuit and discharged. This has the advantage that a slow comparator cannot be disturbed by fast input changes.|$|E

Repeating this process many times will give a decay profile. Pulsed lasers or LEDs {{can be used as a}} source of excitation.

The light emitted by the sample molecule is passed through a monochromator to select a specific wavelength. The light then is detected and amplified by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The emitted light signal as well as reference light signal is processed through a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) which eliminates timing jitter. After passing through the CFD, the reference pulse activates a <b>time-to-amplitude</b> <b>converter</b> (TAC) circuit. The TAC charges a capacitor which will hold the signal until the next electrical pulse. In reverse TAC mode the signal of [...] "sync" [...] stops the TAC. This data is then further processed by an analog to digital converter (ADC) and multi-channel analyzer (MCA) to get a data output. To make sure that the decay is not biased to early arriving photons, the photon count rate is kept low (usually less than 1% of excitation rate).|$|E

40|$|Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) {{is a very}} {{effective}} measurement technique to perform the analysis of extremely weak and fast, periodical light signals. Based on the detection of single photons and on the measure of their arrival time within {{the period of the}} signal, TCSPC technique is increasingly widespread in a large number of fields, from medicine to chemistry and biology, and in a large number of applications such as single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence imaging, and laser scanning microscopy. Nowadays, most of the high-performance TCSPC systems are focused on single channel applications and the use of multiple parallel acquisition chains is necessary to obtain a multidimensional system,, with very high costs and large occupied areas. It is therefore necessary to develop new acquisition systems based, on the one hand, on detectors with high quantum efficiency and suitable for parallel operation, and, on the other hand, on electronics intrinsically designed to simultaneously acquire data from multiple channels. Concerning the first aspect, Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) proved to be a valid alternative to PMTs in many applications, from quantum cryptography to astrophysics and biology. Recent systems for single-photon timing applications typically present a trade-off between number of channels and performance: the higher the number of channels, the poorer the obtained performance on each channel. In order to overcome this trade-off, in this work we present the development of the detector and the electronics necessary to develop photon timing systems featuring a large number of channels in conjunction with high performance. Starting from the SPAD developed in our lab in the last years, it is important to develop all the integrated electronics to extract and elaborate the timing information. First of all, a circuit capable of reading directly the avalanche current coming from the detectors is of the utmost importance in order to achieve a very high temporal resolution while minimizing the crosstalk between adjacent channels. Thus, a fully integrated trans-impedance stage has been designed in 180 nm Si-Ge with a gigahertz bandwidth in order to obtain few tens of picoseconds full width at half maximum resolution and negligible crosstalk between different channels. Secondly, a fully integrated array of high performance <b>time-to-amplitude</b> <b>converters</b> (TAC) has been designed. In fact, in any TCSPC application {{one of the most important}} section in the acquisition chain is the time measurement block. Three main performances are required in the time measure to reconstruct the analyzed signal without introducing distortions: a high temporal resolution (in the order of few tens of picoseconds), a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of few percent of the histogram channel width and a high measurement rate (in the Megahertz order). Finally, in order to develop a fully parallel and compact TCSPC system, resource sharing is mandatory. To achieve this goal an integrated chip capable of routing the signal coming from the trans-impedance stage towards the time measurement circuit has been designed in 180 nm Si-Ge technology. Since the probability of detecting a photon during one excitation cycle in any TCSPC measurement is far less than one, we have designed the routing logic to connect the SPAD to one of the TAC converters only if a photon has been detected, thus allowing the system to have a number of TAC converters lower than the detectors one. The design of these three main blocks in conjunction with fully custom high efficiency SPAD arrays opens the way to the development of a TCSPC acquisition system that can feature both a very high number of parallel channels and very high performance...|$|R

The fast TAC (F-TAC) makes it possible to operate the system towards the upper limit of detector count rate capability (∼ 80 Mcps) with reduced pile-up losses, addressing one of the historic criticisms of TCSPC. Preliminary measurements on the F-TAC are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} years an always growing {{interest}} has arisen about the measurement technique of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), since {{it allows the}} analysis of extremely fast and weak light waveforms with a picoseconds resolution. Consequently, many applications exploiting TCSPC have been developing in several fields such as medicine and chemistry. Moreover, the use of multianode PMT and of single photon avalanche diode arrays {{led to the development}} of multichannel acquisition systems, employed in even more applications. Since TCSPC basically consists of the measurement of the arrival time of a photon, a high resolution and high linearity time measurement block is of the utmost importance, and in order to realize multidimensional systems, it has to be integrated to reduce both cost and area. We have designed and fabricated a 4 channel fully integrated <b>time-to-amplitude</b> <b>converter</b> (TAC), built in 0. 35 μm Si-Ge technology, characterized by a very good time resolution (less than 50 ps), low differential nonlinearity (better than 2 % peak-peak and less than 0. 1 % rms), high counting rate (16 MHz), low and constant power dissipation (50 mW), and low area occupation (2. 58 x 1. 28 mm 2). Moreover our measurements show a very little crosstalk between the converters integrated on the same chip; this feature together with low power and low area make the fabricated converter suitable for parallelization, so it can be the starting point for future large scale multi-channel acquisition chains...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting (TCSPC) has {{increasingly}} been used in many different scientific applications (e. g. : single molecule spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging, diffuse optical tomography). Many of these applications are calling for new requests {{on the development of}} instrumentation that operates at higher and higher conversion rates and that is able to resolve optical signals not only in the time domain, but also in wavelength, polarization and position. To exploit the potential of parallel analysis over multiple acquisition channels, a new generation of TCSPC devices is needed that is characterized by low size and costs. The core block of TCSPC instrumentation is the time-interval measurement section, which can be implemented with a <b>Time-to-Amplitude</b> <b>Converter</b> (TAC); the converter can be integrated on a single chip {{in order to reduce the}} overall size and cost of the system. This paper presents a monolithic TAC that has been designed to achieve the high resolution, good differential linearity and fast counting rate required in modern applications. The TAC here described is built on a commercial 0. 35 µm CMOS technology, and is characterized by resolution better than 60 ps, differential nonlinearity limited to 0. 5 % rms and short dead-time of 80 ns. The low area occupation (1. 4 x 1. 8 mm) and minimal need for external components allow the realization of very compact instruments with multiple acquisition channels operating simultaneously at very high count rates...|$|E
40|$|The Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) {{technique}} {{has reached a}} prominent position among analytical methods employed in {{a great variety of}} fields, from medicine and biology (fluorescence spectroscopy) to telemetry (laser ranging) and communication (quantum cryptography). Nevertheless the development of TCSPC acquisition systems featuring both a high number of parallel channels and very high performance is still an open challenge: to satisfy the tight requirements set by the applications, a fully parallel acquisition system requires not only high efficiency single photon detectors but also a read-out electronics specifically designed to obtain the highest performance in conjunction with these sensors. To this aim three main blocks have been designed: a gigahertz bandwidth front-end stage to directly read the custom technology SPAD array avalanche current, a reconfigurable logic to route the detectors output signals to the acquisition chain and an array of time measurement circuits capable of recording the photon arrival times with picoseconds time resolution and a very high linearity. An innovative architecture based on these three circuits will feature a very high number of detectors to perform a truly parallel spatial or spectral analysis and a smaller number of high performance <b>time-to-amplitude</b> <b>converter</b> offering very high performance and a very high conversion frequency while limiting the area occupation and power dissipation. The routing logic will make the dynamic connection between the two arrays possible in order to guarantee that no information gets lost...|$|E
