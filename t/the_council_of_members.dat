500|$|One {{former police}} detective, Frank Chauvin, {{along with a}} Catholic anti-abortion activist, filed suit against the Order of Canada Advisory Council, {{demanding}} that the {{minutes of the meeting}} relating to Morgentaler be made public. The appointment of Morgentaler prompted former Liberal Member of Parliament Clifford Lincoln to write that the workings of the Advisory Council were [...] "mysterious", citing what he theorized to be inbuilt partiality and conflict of interest as reasons why Margaret Somerville, whom Lincoln had twice nominated to the Advisory Council, was turned down for appointment, yet Morgentaler was accepted. Journalist Henry Aubin in the Montreal Gazette opined that the council's rejection of Somerville, her personal opposition to same-sex marriage, and the acceptance of Brent Hawkes, Jane Rule, and Jean Chrétien, all regarded as supporting same-sex unions, as well as the appointment of a controversial figure such as Morgentaler, were all signs that the Advisory Council operated with partisan bias. Aubin also pointed to the presence on <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> of the Royal Society of Canada, an organization into which Somerville was received.|$|E
