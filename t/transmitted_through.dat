40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTo {{explore the}} role of mass media on {{knowledge}} generation and counter the misconceptions about tuberculosis (TB) transmission in Nepal. MethodsA cross-sectional study was performed in the largest referral hospital in Nepal. The quota sampling technique was used to recruit 283 subjects into the sample. ResultsA total of 235 (83. 0 %) respondents correctly replied that TB <b>transmits</b> <b>through</b> air by coughing or sneezing. A total of 29 (10. 2 %) respondents had correct knowledge about TB transmission without having misconceptions. Similarly, regarding the misconceptions about TB transmission, 157 (55. 5 %) replied that TB <b>transmits</b> <b>through</b> utensils, 163 (57. 6 %) respondents replied that TB <b>transmits</b> <b>through</b> sharing clothes/bed sheets/towel, 62 (21. 9 %) respondents replied that TB <b>transmits</b> <b>through</b> touching a person with TB, 142 (50. 2 %) respondents replied that TB <b>transmits</b> <b>through</b> food, 88 (31. 1 %) respondents replied that TB <b>transmits</b> <b>through</b> sexual contact.

5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another.

5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are <b>transmitted</b> <b>through</b> the substrate as well as using chemical signals.

5|$|The three {{ossicles}} transmit {{sound from}} the outer ear to the inner ear. The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are <b>transmitted</b> <b>through</b> the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is <b>transmitted</b> <b>through</b> skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E

He gave the principle of Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called Jain Agamas.

5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, and age influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually <b>transmitted</b> <b>through</b> heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} <b>transmitted</b> <b>through</b> unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E

They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E

5|$|Lemur {{communication}} can be <b>transmitted</b> <b>through</b> sound, sight, {{and smell}} (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped {{behaviors such as}} scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures are probably more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face {{as well as a}} submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E

5|$|In Virginia and Carolina, the Palladian {{manner is}} epitomised in {{numerous}} Tidewater plantation houses, such as Stratford Hall or Westover Plantation, or Drayton Hall near Charleston. These examples are all classic American colonial {{examples of a}} Palladian taste that was <b>transmitted</b> <b>through</b> engravings, {{for the benefit of}} masons—and patrons, too—who had no first-hand experience of European building practice. A feature of American Palladianism was the re-emergence of the great portico, which again, as in Italy, fulfilled the need of protection from the sun; the portico in various forms and size became a dominant feature of American colonial architecture. In the north European countries the portico had become a mere symbol, often closed, or merely hinted at in the design by pilasters, and sometimes in very late examples of English Palladianism adapted to become a porte-cochere; in America, the Palladian portico regained its full glory.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles {{retain the}} lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, {{but this is}} lost in {{terrestrial}} adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess electroreceptors {{that allow them to}} locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular eardrum lies {{on the surface of the}} head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is <b>transmitted</b> <b>through</b> a single bone, the stapes, to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism. There is a patch of specialized haircells, called papilla amphibiorum, in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals. The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.|$|E
5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be <b>transmitted</b> <b>through</b> saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E
