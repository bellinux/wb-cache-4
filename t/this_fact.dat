5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} squares must include two squares that meet edge-to-edge. None of the squares in the Pythagorean tiling meet edge-to-edge, but <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> does not violate Keller's conjecture because the tiles have different sizes, so they are not all congruent to each other.|$|E
5|$|According to Plateau's laws, the {{circular}} arcs in two-dimensional soap bubble clusters meet at 120° angles, the same angle {{found at the}} corners of a Reuleaux triangle.

5|$|According to some sources, {{the church}} could be {{identified}} with San Salvatore de Bordonia; a bordone was the staff borne by pilgrims coming to St. Peter's. These would have left their staffs in San Giacomo before entering Saint Peter, exactly as they did after completing the Way of St. James, and <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> would explain also the late dedication to Saint James.|$|E
5|$|After Wallis had {{finished}} the initial manuscript for The Road to Total Freedom, he provided representatives of Scientology leadership with a copy. Wallis negotiated with the Scientology leaders, and it was agreed upon that certain sections of the book would be edited.

5|$|Although Swift {{knew that}} the Duchess of Kendal was {{responsible}} for selling the patent to Wood, he rarely mentions <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> in the Letters.

50|$|From <b>this</b> <b>facts</b> {{it can be}} {{reasoned}} that the ERAN relies on neural resources related to syntactic processing (Koelsch 2008).

5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to <b>this</b> <b>fact,</b> the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
5|$|Eshmun was {{identified}} with Asclepius {{as a result}} of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC. <b>This</b> <b>fact</b> is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the Awali river which was dubbed Asclepius fluvius, and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.|$|E

Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great burst {{of creativity and}} wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> and considered it a good omen.|$|E
