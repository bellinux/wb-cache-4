2500|$|Since all {{fiction is}} {{essentially}} untrue, Martin believes {{it needs to}} reflect reality at least in its core. He agrees with William Faulkner's statement in his Nobel Prize speech that [...] "the human heart in conflict with itself" [...] {{is the only thing}} worth writing about, regardless of the genre. He thus tried to give the story a little more historical fiction feel than a fantastic feel like previous authors' books, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more emphasis on swordplay and battles and political intrigue. The Atlantic noted that the series attempts <b>to</b> <b>mash</b> together fantasy and realism as two seemingly contradictory genres of literature, and Martin's books are generally praised for their realism. The Atlantic saw the realist heart of the Ice and Fire books in that [...] "magic lingers only {{on the periphery of the}} world in which the characters dwell, and is something more terrifying than wondrous. [...] It's a fantasy story that defies expectations by ultimately being less about a world we'd like to escape, at times becoming uncomfortably familiar to the one we live in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{said that}} the nucleus of their idea for Orange Man came as a {{reaction}} to cause and effect advertising, and that he and the team decided to focus on word of mouth as their media, which w{{as a reaction to}} Coca-Cola's big budget dominance in soft drink advertising. He told Channel 4 in 2000 that the advertisement was [...] "meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time", comparing it to coffee advertisements where [...] "they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom," [...] noting that Orange Man decided to [...] "express this in an really OTT fashion". The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling [...] "We said how brilliant it would be if you had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened." [...] The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided <b>to</b> <b>mash</b> the two ideas together, a [...] "cardinal sin in adland." [...] One commentary considered the advertisement to be a [...] "riff on the sort of sports commentary Andy Gray with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time." ...|$|E

6000|$|At the turn-table, {{near the}} {{northern}} extremity {{of the fifth}} gallery, [...] two big piles of rubbish had forced their way through from the fifth [...] gallery, and {{from the looks of}} the timbers, more was about to come. [...] These beams are solid--eighteen inches square; first, a great beam [...] is laid on the floor, then upright ones, five feet high, stand on [...] it, supporting another horizontal beam, and so on, square above [...] square, like the framework of a window. The superincumbent weight [...] was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>mash</b> the ends of those great upright beams fairly [...] into the solid wood of the horizontal ones three inches, compressing [...] and bending the upright beam till it curved like a bow. Before the [...] Spanish caved in, some of their twelve-inch horizontal timbers were [...] compressed in this way until they were only five inches thick! [...] Imagine the power it must take to squeeze a solid log together in [...] that way. Here, also, was a range of timbers, for a distance of [...] twenty feet, tilted six inches out of the perpendicular by the [...] weight resting upon them from the caved galleries above. You could [...] hear things cracking and giving way, and it was not pleasant to know [...] that the world overhead was slowly and silently sinking down upon [...] you.

A wanderer was once swept into the great, still back-water that divides the loaferdom of Upper India--that is to say, Calcutta and Bombay--from the north-going current of Madras, where Nym and Pistol are highly finished articles with certificates of education.

So the waif died in the bazaar, and the Barrack-master Sahib gave orders for his burial.
