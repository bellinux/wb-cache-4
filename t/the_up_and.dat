5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke. Contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which depresses the wing while contraction of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible for developing the needed power for <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down strokes.|$|E
5|$|The XrossMediaBar, {{originally}} {{used on the}} PSX, is a graphical {{user interface}} currently used for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, {{as well as a}} variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally across the screen. Navigation moves the icons instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available to the user. When an icon is selected on the horizontal bar, several more appear vertically, above and below it (selectable by <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down directions on a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3. Although the capacity to play users' own music in-game was added with this update, the feature is dependent on game developers who must either enable the feature in their games or update existing games.|$|E

5|$|The highest numbers {{used for}} highway designations include M-553 in <b>the</b> <b>UP</b> <b>and</b> Interstate 696 (I-696) {{running along the}} {{northern}} Detroit suburbs. The lowest numbers in use are M-1 along Woodward Avenue in the Detroit area and US Highway 2 (US2) across the UP. Most M-numbered trunkline designations are in the low 200s or under, but some have been designated in the low 300s. MDOT has not assigned a designation outside the Interstate System in the 400s at this time. No discernible pattern exists in Michigan's numbering system, {{although most of the}} M-numbered routes lower than 15 are typically located in or around the major cities of Detroit and Grand Rapids.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} what became US2 {{was used as}} part of two Indian trails before European {{settlers}} came to <b>the</b> <b>UP,</b> <b>and</b> {{as part of the}} Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King's International Highway auto trails in the early 20th century. The state later included these trails as part of M‑12 when the first state highway trunklines were designated in 1919. Most of M‑12 was redesignated as part of US2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926. Since the 1930s, several changes have reshaped the highway's routing through the UP. One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley, Wisconsin, and others pushed an originally inland routing of US2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline. With the creation of the Interstate Highway System, part of US2 was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate 75 (I‑75), though in the 1980s, the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I‑75 freeway, resulting in today's basic form.|$|E

25|$|Although isospin {{symmetry}} is very slightly broken, SU(3) symmetry is more badly broken, due to {{the much}} higher mass of the strange quark compared to <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down. The discovery of charm, bottomness and topness could lead to further expansions up to SU(6) flavour symmetry, but the very large masses of these quarks make such symmetries almost useless. In modern applications, such as lattice QCD, isospin symmetry is often treated as exact while the heavier quarks must be treated separately.|$|E

25|$|In quantum mechanics, when a Hamiltonian has a {{symmetry}}, that symmetry {{manifests itself}} through {{a set of}} states that have the same energy; that is, the states are degenerate. In particle physics, the near mass-degeneracy of the neutron and proton points to an approximate symmetry of the Hamiltonian describing the strong interactions. The neutron does have a slightly higher mass due to isospin breaking; {{this is due to the}} difference in the masses of <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down quarks and the effects of the electromagnetic interaction. However, the appearance of an approximate symmetry is still useful, since the small breakings can be described by a perturbation theory, which gives rise to slight differences between the near-degenerate states.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down {{fluctuation}} of the {{arterial pressure}} {{results from the}} pulsatile nature of the cardiac output, i.e. the heartbeat. Pulse pressure {{is determined by the}} interaction of the stroke volume of the heart, the compliance (ability to expand) of the arterial system—largely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteries—and the resistance to flow in the arterial tree. By expanding under pressure, the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat. In this way, the pulse pressure is reduced from what it would be if the aorta were not compliant. The loss of arterial compliance that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Daniel Pecáut, {{the creation}} of the Patriotic Union took the guerrillas' political message to a wider public outside of the traditional communist spheres of influence and led to local electoral victories in regions such as Urabá and Antioquia, with their mayoral candidates winning twenty-three municipalities and their congressional ones gaining fourteen seats (five in the Senate, nine in the lower Chamber) in 1988. According to journalist Steven Dudley, who interviewed ex-FARC as well as former members of <b>the</b> <b>UP</b> <b>and</b> the Communist Party, FARC leader Jacobo Arenas insisted to his subordinates that the UP's creation did not mean that the group would lay down its arms nor a rejection of the Seventh Conference's military strategy. Pecáut states that new recruits entered the guerrilla army and its urban militia units during the period, also claiming that FARC did not stop kidnapping and continued to target regional politicians for assassination.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} isospin {{symmetry}} and related {{methods such as}} the Eightfold Way come from the observation that families of particles with similar masses tend to correspond to the invariant subspaces associated with the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra 𝖘𝖚(2). In this context, an invariant subspace is spanned by basis vectors which correspond to particles in a family. Under {{the action of the}} Lie algebra 𝖘𝖚(2), which generates rotations in isospin space, elements corresponding to definite particle states or superpositions of states can be rotated into each other, but can never leave the space (since the subspace is in fact invariant). This is reflective of the symmetry present. The fact that unitary matrices will commute with the Hamiltonian means that the physical quantities calculated do not change even under unitary transformation. In the case of isospin, this machinery is used to reflect the fact that the strong force behaves the same under the exchange of <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down quark (and by extension the exchange of the proton and the neutron).|$|E

500|$|The quark flavors {{were given}} their names for several reasons. <b>The</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down quarks are named after <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down {{components}} of isospin, which they carry. Strange quarks were given their name {{because they were}} discovered to be components of the strange particles discovered in cosmic rays years before the quark model was proposed; these particles were deemed [...] "strange" [...] because they had unusually long lifetimes. Glashow, who coproposed charm quark with Bjorken, is quoted as saying, [...] "We called our construct the 'charmed quark', for we were fascinated and pleased by the symmetry it brought to the subnuclear world." [...] The names [...] "bottom" [...] and [...] "top", coined by Harari, were chosen because they are [...] "logical partners for up and down quarks". In the past, bottom and top quarks were {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "beauty" [...] and [...] "truth" [...] respectively, but these names have somewhat fallen out of use. While [...] "truth" [...] never did catch on, accelerator complexes devoted to massive production of bottom quarks are sometimes called [...] "beauty factories".|$|E
500|$|The word [...] "fox" [...] {{comes from}} Old English, which derived from Proto-Germanic *fuhsaz. Compare with [...] West Frisian foks, Dutch vos, and German Fuchs.

The bushy tail also {{forms the basis}} for the fox's Welsh name, llwynog, {{literally}} 'bushy', from llwyn 'bush'. Likewise, [...] from rabo 'tail', Lithuanian uodẽgis from uodegà 'tail', and Ojibwa waagosh from waa, which refers to <b>the</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down [...] "bounce" [...] or flickering of an animal or its tail.|$|E

[...] Insufficient draft can cause deformation or damage. The draft required for mould release is primarily dependent on {{the depth of the}} cavity; the deeper the cavity, the more draft necessary. Shrinkage must also be taken into account when determining the draft required. If the skin is too thin, then the moulded part will tend to shrink onto the cores that form while cooling and cling to those cores, or the part may warp, twist, blister or crack when the cavity is pulled away.|$|E
