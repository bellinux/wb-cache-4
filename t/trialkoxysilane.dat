An organic moiety containing a functional group that allows the attachment to an inorganic network, e.g. a <b>trialkoxysilane</b> group, can act as a network modifier because in the final structure the inorganic network is only modified by the organic group. Phenyltrialkoxysilanes are an example for such compounds; they modify the silica network in the sol-gel process via the reaction of the <b>trialkoxysilane</b> group without supplying additional functional groups intended to undergo further chemical reactions to the material formed. If a reactive functional group is incorporated the system is called a network functionalizer. The situation is different if two or three of such anchor groups modify an organic segment; this leads to materials in which the inorganic group is afterwards an integral part of the hybrid network. The latter type of system is known as network builder ...|$|E

This has been explained by competitive weak ionic interactions between functional carboxyl groups and sulfate ions with cement grains. In this study, SPs including <b>trialkoxysilane</b> functional groups have been synthesized. Adsorption and dispersing properties of these SPs were evaluated {{in the presence of}} different concentrations of Na(2) SO(4) added in aqueous solution. It appeared that a partial substitution of carboxyl groups by <b>trialkoxysilane</b> in the polymer makes them more resistant to sulfate ions. We suggested that the high adsorption capacity of these SPs results from the formation of strong bonds between hydroxysilane groups and calcium silicate hydrate phases.

These polymers are composed of a monomer repeat unit, [R-SiO{sub 1. 5 }]{sub n}, with a single silicon atom attached to other repeat units in the polymer through one to three siloxane bonds. The remaining substituent is an organic group attached to the silicon through a silicon-carbon single bond. Silsesquioxanes {{have been the subject of}} intensive study in the past and are becoming important again as a vehicle for introducing organic functionalities into hybrid organic-inorganic materials through sol-gel processing. Despite all of this interest, there has not been a systematic study of the ability of <b>trialkoxysilanes</b> to form gels through the sol-gel process. In fact, it has been noted that silsesquioxanes are generally isolated as soluble resins rather than the highly crosslinked network polymers (gels) one would expect from a tri-functional monomer.

The silicon-containing fluoromonomers were prepared from a three-step reaction in a good overall yield. The first one dealt with the addition of ClCF 2 CFClI to allyl acetate, whereas the next phase consisted of the dehalogenation/deiodoacetalization of ClCF 2 CFClCH 2 CHICH 2 OAc into 1, 1, 2 -trifluoro- 1, 4 -pentadiene by the use of zinc dust under sonication. Finally, the syntheses of both original monomers were carried out by a hydrosilylation reaction with <b>trialkoxysilane</b> in the presence of Karstedt or Speier platinum catalysts with the obtained trifluorodiene. The copolymerizations of these silicon-containing fluoromonomers with VDF were initiated by organic peroxide and led to original poly(vinylidene fluoride) bearing pendant <b>trialkoxysilane</b> functions.
