5|$|By the 1930s, the Boddington family {{shareholding}} had {{dwindled to}} around 40 per cent. On the 22 December 1940, <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> water tanks {{were hit by}} bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> had to be closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes Brewery. <b>The</b> <b>brewery</b> was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the time, {{and was the first}} in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats. In 1961, the brewer Whitbread took a 13 per cent stake in the company. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke & Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public houses to the firm.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, Stones {{acquired}} the fourteen tied houses of Chambers’ Brunswick Brewery in Sheffield. In 1919, The Crown Inn opposite the Cannon Brewery was purchased and rebuilt {{to serve as}} <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> tap.

5|$|In 1954, William Stones {{partnered with}} Tennant Brothers {{to acquire the}} Sheffield Free Brewery, closing <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> and {{dividing}} the estate between themselves. In the same year, the company purchased Mappin's Brewery of Rotherham, and <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> was closed down the following year. The takeover added around 100 public houses to their tied estate, to make a total of 300. As a result, Stones had the second largest tied estate in Sheffield after Tennant's.|$|E
5|$|Stones Bitter has {{suffered}} a decline in sales since the closure, {{and a member of}} the Bass board of directors that took the decision to close <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> has admitted that, given the subsequent resurgence in golden ales and local provenance in beer, the decision to close <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> was the wrong one. Retrospectively, he argues that Bass should have backed Stones over Worthington.|$|E

5|$|By 1982 16 {{per cent}} of Yorkshire's public houses {{were tied to}} Stones. Bass closed the Cannon Brewery in April 1999 {{with the loss of}} 57 jobs. Bass blamed the closure on the steep decline in sales of cask {{conditioned}} beers (nationally there had been a 14 per cent decline in sales of cask beer over the previous 12 months) which <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> produced. The brewer realised £1 million in efficiency savings by closing <b>the</b> <b>brewery.</b> The Campaign for Real Ale blamed the brewery's closure on Bass' failure to promote their cask conditioned products. As well as Stones Bitter, the Cannon brewed the small scale Bass Special, Bass Light and Bass Mild brands from the mid-1990s as declining Stones volumes left <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> with spare capacity. Bass Light and Bass Mild had been sold in the Sheffield area as Stones Mild and Stones Dark Mild respectively.|$|E

By 1889, <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> was producing 150,000 barrels annually. In 1889, the company's first scientifically-trained head brewer was appointed, Percy Clinch, son of Charles Clinch of the Eagle Brewery in Witney. In 1892, the partnership became a limited company called John Smith's Tadcaster Brewery Company Limited, with Henry Herbert Riley-Smith as chairman. In 1899 the company acquired Simpson & Co of Market Weighton, with 51 public houses, and converted <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> into a maltings.|$|E

5|$|Strangeways Brewery {{was founded}} in 1778 by two grain merchants, Thomas Caister and Thomas Fry, just north {{of what is now}} Manchester city centre. Their {{principal}} customers were the cotton workers of Manchester, then a burgeoning mill town. Henry Boddington, born in 1813 in Thame, Oxfordshire, joined <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> in 1832 as a travelling salesman when <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> was in the possession of Hole, Potter and Harrison. Like most Manchester breweries at the time, it was a modestly sized operation. Boddington had become a partner by 1848, alongside John and James Harrison, and by this time the company went under the name John Harrison & Co. In January 1853, Boddington borrowed money to become its sole owner. Between Boddington's takeover until 1877, the brewery's output increased tenfold from 10,000 to 100,000 barrels a year, making it not only Manchester's largest brewery but {{one of the largest in}} the North of England, with over 100 tied houses. By 1883 Henry Boddington & Co. was a limited liability company. Henry Boddington's estate was valued at almost £150,000 when he died in 1886.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brewery</b> brews 3.8 million hectolitres {{annually}} (1.8 {{million of}} which is John Smith's beer), and employed around 300 people in 2008.

5|$|The {{last of the}} company's dray horses was {{retired in}} 1947. Horses had {{delivered}} beer to all the areas surrounding <b>the</b> <b>brewery,</b> as far afield as Pateley Bridge. From 1948 the company exported beer to Belgium where it was bottled and distributed by Tilkens brewery. In 1950 {{there was a general}} strike in Belgium, and John Smith's hired two Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber aircraft to carry 7 ton loads twice-daily of their beers into the country in order to ensure supply. In 1953 the firm became a public company, with fixed assets of around £5 million, 1,000 licensed premises and around 1,100 employees. In 1958, Whitworth, Son & Nephew of Wath-upon-Dearne was acquired with 165 licensed houses, and <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> was immediately closed down. In 1959 the company began to bottle imported Alken lager at Tadcaster, in response to growing customer demand. In 1961 the company also began to bottle Carlsberg lager. By 1960 the company had an estate of 909 public houses.|$|E

5|$|William McEwan {{opened the}} Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, then a suburb on the {{outskirts}} of Edinburgh, in 1856, using £2,000 loaned by his mother and his uncle. The area and <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> are named after the spring waters from the vicinity, which, in addition to its proximity to the Caledonian railway line and the Union Canal, determined the location of <b>the</b> <b>brewery.</b> McEwan had employed geologists to identify the prime location for a supply of well water. Beforehand, McEwan had engaged in industrial espionage at Bass and Allsopp's breweries in order to learn techniques and assay costs. After establishing a market share in the industrial regions of the Scottish lowlands, from the early 1860s McEwan built up a successful colonial export trade by exploiting his family's shipowning connections. It was during this time that McEwan's India Pale Ale, the beer that was the foundation for much of the company's reputation, was first labelled Export.|$|E

Beer is also a consumed drink and the Palestinian town of Taybeh in the central West Bank contains one of the few breweries in Palestine. In addition to regular beer, <b>the</b> <b>brewery</b> produces non-alcoholic beer for observant Muslims. The nearby town of Birzeit is also home to Shepherds Brewery.|$|E
