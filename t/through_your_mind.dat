2500|$|Rafferty {{was fired}} from the band on 31 January 2008, {{after a series of}} {{absences}} due to illness and long-standing rumours about his place in the band; drug addiction was also quoted as {{one of the reasons for}} his departure. Rafferty subsequently refuted these claims, saying that he had been fired from the band because he [...] "didn't think Konk was very good, and I said that." [...] Dan Logan, bassist with a local Brighton band Cat the Dog, was drafted in as a temporary replacement for Rafferty. After the departure of Rafferty, the band had considered splitting up. Singer Luke Pritchard had told The Sun's Something for the Weekend that [...] "Splitting does go <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> It's hard to let go of something you care about so much. We have fans to think of." [...] Pritchard also discussed the possibility of Dan Logan joining the band as their new bassist, [...] "It's been really strange for us but it's something that had to happen. Dan hasn’t joined the band properly yet. We're trying him out, but I love playing with him." [...] In October 2008, Peter Denton - who had previously filled in for Rafferty during the Inside In/Inside Out touring cycle - was chosen as the permanent bassist.|$|E

She spoke with dignity and looked straight at Grandcourt, whose long, narrow, impenetrable eyes met hers, and mysteriously arrested them: mysteriously; for the subtly-varied drama between man and woman is often such as can hardly be rendered in words put together like dominoes, according to obvious fixed marks. The word of all work, Love, will no more express the myriad modes of mutual attraction, than the word Thought can inform you what is passing <b>through</b> <b>your</b> neighbor's <b>mind.</b> It {{would be hard to}} tell on which side--Gwendolen's or Grandcourt's--the influence was more mixed. At that moment his strongest wish was to be completely master of this creature--this piquant combination of maidenliness and mischief: that she knew things which had made her start away from him, spurred him to triumph over that repugnance; and he was believing that he should triumph. And she--ah, piteous equality in the need to dominate!--she was overcome like the thirsty one who is drawn toward the seeming water in the desert, overcome by the suffused sense that here in this man's homage to her lay the rescue from helpless subjection to an oppressive lot.|$|R

Chanakya pointed at the lake. As the soldier removed his armour to jump into the lake, Chanakya took his sword and killed him. When Chandragupta came out of the water, Chanakya asked him, [...] "What went <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> when I disclosed your location to the enemy?"

On another occasion, Chanakya similarly escaped the enemy by chasing away a washerman, and disguising himself as one. Once, he cut open the belly of a Brahmin who had just eaten food, and took out the food to feed a hungry Chandragupta.|$|E

[...] Therefore, he {{believed that}} we have to study those patterns and discover what they mean. [...] He also believed that artwork is visual thinking and a means of expression, not just putting shapes and colors together that look appealing. [...] Art is a way to help people understand the world, and a way to see how the world changes <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> [...] Its function is to show the essence of something, like our existence. [...] Arnheim’s writing and thinking were most important to him, and his goal was to understand things for himself. [...] Arnheim maintained that vision and perception are creative, active understanding, and that we organize perceptions into structures and form with which to understand them. [...] Without order we wouldn’t understand anything, so the world is ordered just by being perceived. [...] Overall, he wrote fifteen books about perceptual psychology and art, architecture, and film.|$|E
