5|$|The {{other major}} factor {{that helped the}} All Blacks to success was their {{superior}} fitness. In New Zealand each half was 45 minutes, not 35 like in Britain. As well as that, the All Blacks spent much time on fitness. This enabled them to play with speed much longer than <b>their</b> <b>opposition.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{a victory}} over Spen Valley District, the team {{travelled}} west to play Somersetshire, Devonshire, Taunton, and Gloucestershire, and won all five games. The victory over Somerset was the New Zealanders' largest of the tour; they scored nine tries in a 17–4 victory. Half-back Keogh played outstandingly for the Natives, while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to <b>their</b> <b>opposition.</b> Devonshire and Tauton suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders, before a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed. After defeating Midland Counties, the Natives returned to London.|$|E

In 1917, Berkman and Goldman were sentenced {{to two years in}} jail for conspiracy against the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> to the Soviet's use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries. In 1925, he published a book about his experiences, The Bolshevik Myth.|$|E

Two days later they drew with Batley Bulldogs, despite <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> scoring five tries. Their next match was against Yorkshire, who {{were one of}} the strongest counties in the country, and {{went on to win the}} inaugural County Championship that season. Yorkshire fielded a weakened team, and were subsequently defeated 10–6 by the Natives, who scored six tries. After a further two victories, the team travelled to Wales, where they lost 3–0 to Llanelli, before facing Wales on 22 December.|$|E
5|$|Alexander and {{his paper}} vocally {{supported}} the old governing {{class of the}} former Confederate States of America and were rabid in <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> to the policies of Reconstruction imposed upon the South by the Northern-based Republican Party.

Alexander was forced to liquidate his stake in his money-losing newspaper in 1868.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of interaction during a public meeting, this article considers how people argue in sequential environments where direct interaction is precluded. The meeting in question was organized so the turns of audience speakers and local authority representatives were produced during different periods; initial actions and <b>their</b> <b>oppositions,</b> counters, etc., could be separated by anything up to 25 minutes. The article describes how speakers adapt their language practices to construct arguing turns and series of action-opposition pairs in social settings thus organized. ...|$|R

While he was away, however, <b>their</b> <b>oppositions</b> sent Maria and his family away from Athens and, when he returned, {{he was arrested and}} sent to the Sultan, who imprisoned him. He suffered the same fate upon another mission to the Sultan, which he undertook on behalf of the Despot of the Morea, Constantine Palaiologos.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{these attacks}} and {{those from the}} extreme left, the ECSC found {{substantial}} public support, {{and so it was}} established. It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in <b>their</b> <b>opposition.</b> The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Houphouët married Kady Racine Sow (1913–2006) in Abengourou; {{their union}} was {{controversial}} {{because he was}} a practising Catholic and she was the daughter of a wealthy Muslim from Senegal. The families of the two eventually overcame <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> and accepted the interfaith union, the first ever celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire. The couple had five children: Felix (who died in infancy), Augustine, Francis, Guillaume and Marie, all raised as Catholics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina, biographer Robert D. Crassweller {{claims that the}} English-speaking nations of North America and Europe largely {{misunderstood}} Argentina's response {{to the death of}} Perón as well as the ornate funeral she was granted. Crassweller attributes this misunderstanding to the unique cultural makeup of the Peróns and Argentina, saying that the Peróns were of the Hispanic tradition and that <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> was largely of British ancestry.|$|E

5|$|On 17 September 1595 Clement VIII had {{accepted}} the decision of Henry IV of France to convert to the Catholic Church, which Henry had previously made to secure the French monarchy, and presided over a ceremony of papal absolution. This removed the excommunication order placed on him by Sixtus V. The Spanish faction had previously opposed the pope taking these actions, but the French negotiators had talked {{of the possibility of}} schism, which along with Henry's victories in the French Wars of Religion, overcame <b>their</b> <b>opposition.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E

Must not the virtue of modern Individualism, continually enlarging, usurping all, seriously affect, perhaps keep down entirely, in America, the like of the ancient virtue of Patriotism, the fervid and absorbing love of general country? I have no doubt myself that the two will merge, and will mutually profit and brace each other, and that from them a greater product, a third, will arise. But I feel that at present they and <b>their</b> <b>oppositions</b> form a serious problem and paradox in the United States.|$|R

5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} <b>their</b> <b>opposition</b> to what {{later became the}} United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was {{originally}} controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E
