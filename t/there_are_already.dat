5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation so {{they are able to}} compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{can bind to}} troponin C to act as troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> multiple troponin activators {{that bind}} to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has been tested in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes the fact that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is {{having a hard time}} making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They {{and the rest of the}} crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

25|$|Celestial {{marriage}} is {{an instance of}} the LDS Church doctrine of sealing.

25|$|Nanotechnology has the {{potential}} to reshape the entire world, Kurzweil exclaims. Assembling materials molecule by molecule could solve energy problems, cure cancer and other diseases, strengthen our bodies, and produce self-assembling food, clothing, and buildings. Kurzweil admits that nanotechnology carries a big risk; a self-replicating substance, without the constraints of a living organism, might grow out of control and consume everything. However he points out that today <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> technologies which pose grave risks, for example nuclear power or weapons, and we have managed to keep them relatively safe, so he feels we can probably do the same with nanotechnology.|$|E
25|$|Visitations {{from members}} of other colonies occur {{frequently}} in P. alternata. A few known reasons for visitations can include becoming a new, often non-related helper, sharing of food, stealing eggs or abdominal substance, and feeding on drops of fluid on patches. When <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> a lot of female residents, the reaction of rejection increases. P. alternata females utilize different nest defense tactics against intruders such as Liostenogaster flavolineata. If the wasps suddenly land, the nest residents may leave and return {{after a few moments}} and fight who ever remains. Although some Steronigastrinae wasps partake in antennal combat, P. alternata rarely use this fighting method and instead initiate falling fights. By nesting in clusters, P. alternata improves the collective defense against predation or social parasitism.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in May 2007 that local Conservative councillors were investigating the possibility of securing a grant to reconstruct the pier. Councillor Richard Fulford-Brown believes that if the circumstances regarding the pier's demolition were an issue today, it would be considerably more difficult {{to follow through with}} it and takes the view that a pier visitor attraction offers something interesting for residents and visitors alike. A similar suggestion had previously been made by a local architect, who proposed an eco-friendly boardwork complete with a viewing station. As of 2007, Lytham St Annes Civic Society were opposed to any reconstruction proposal {{on the grounds that the}} town centre should be protected, especially as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> piers in nearby St Annes-on-the-Sea and Blackpool (North and Central) respectively.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} a secular court {{considers}} the validity of this marriage, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> multiple spouses. In English law, for example, §2 Immigration Act 1988 prohibits certain polygamous wives from exercising their right of abode {{with the result that}} any application from such a wife has to be considered in accordance with paragraphs 278 to 280 of the Immigration Rules, which contain provisions to restrict settlement in most cases to one wife. But, for less controversial purposes, most states are willing to recognise actually polygamous marriages as valid so long as the parties had the capacity to enter into such relationships and the ceremonies were effective under the lex loci celebrationis. In Canada, Ontario province recognizes polygamous marriages if they occurred in a foreign country whom Canada recognizes as permitting polygamy.|$|E
25|$|RolePlay was {{the play}} written as the afterthought, but {{turned out to}} be the most {{successful}} play of the three. The play centres on a dinner party held by Justin Lazenby and Julie-Ann Jobson, where they intend to announce their engagement. Before the dinner begins, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> signs of tension: Julie-Ann gets overly frantic about making the meal perfect for her parents (her father, it later turns out, is a right-wing bigot), and Justin's alcoholic mother is clearly going to arrive paralytic. However, the biggest complication turns out to be when Paige Petite climbs onto the balcony, on the run from her violent boyfriend. Trapped in the flat by her minder, Justin and Julie-Ann are forced to keep up appearances during the dinner whilst the stand-off is played out.|$|E
25|$|Whether or {{not this}} or indeed any so called 'super-dairy' is ever built, this {{controversy}} {{is likely to have}} a lasting impact on Britain's future dairy policy. Supporters claim large scale farming offers opportunities to meet food security and climate change challenges of the future. Research by opponents counter this hypothesis with an argument that the economics of the system are unsustainable in a report titled: ''; however, the figures used in this report have also been heavily criticised by the industry's leading providers of economics data DairyCo, part of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, saying that the different systems are not being compared on a like for like basis and are ‘astonishingly naïve’. However, there are concerns that any similar proposal, if successful, would set a precedent for the development of large-scale farming systems more commonly associated with the US where such units are known as CAFOs - although with the definition of a dairy CAFO being over 750 cows, , the dairy industry's levy and advisory body, says <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> at least 12 such farms operating successfully and without issues - as proven by the lack of media interest in these farms - in England.|$|E
