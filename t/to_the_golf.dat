The hospital was well equipped, with motor ambulances donated by organisations in Australia, a pathology laboratory {{and the only}} X-ray unit in the area. A day after it opened on 29 October, it began receiving patients from the First Battle of Ypres. Much of the unit's tents which accommodated the male personnel of the hospital were lost in a blizzard on 11 November 1914, and the men moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golf</b> club house of the Hôtel du Golf et Cosmopolite in Wimereux, which was eventually leased by the hospital, and became its officers' mess.|$|E
5|$|Intentionally {{set at a}} {{low level}} {{at the time the}} {{cemetery}} and railway opened, in later years the fixed fares offered a very substantial saving over main line tickets to Brookwood (in 1902 the 4s LSWR third class fare to Brookwood was twice the cost of the LNC's equivalent). Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> course which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery. The fixed fares prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885, as rival undertakers were not given access to the LNC's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR's cargo rate (24shillings in 1885) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium.|$|E

25|$|On August 26, 1990, Vaughan {{performed}} {{two shows}} with Eric Clapton at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin. Some {{of the musicians}} boarded four Chicago-bound helicopters, which were waiting on a nearby golf course. Vaughan, along with three members of Eric Clapton's entourage (agent Bobby Brooks, bodyguard Nigel Browne, and assistant tour manager Colin Smythe), boarded the third of the four helicopters—a Bell 206B Jet Ranger—flying to Meigs Field. In Clapton: The Autobiography, Clapton explains that, contrary to rumors, his seat was not given to Vaughan, but three members of Clapton's entourage were on board with Vaughan. According to a witness, there was haze and fog with patches of low clouds. The helicopter took off at about 12:50 am (CDT) on August 27 and, despite the conditions, turned left towards a 150-foot ski hill adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> course.

500|$|Wilbur Clark was {{the first}} to build a home on the golf course in the 1950s. Additional homes were added to the Desert Inn Country Club Estates from the 1960s on. During his {{ownership}} of the hotel, Howard Hughes built 100 residential units on the property. After Steve Wynn purchased the resort in 2000 and announced that the real estate was too valuable to leave as a golf course, homeowners were forced to sell their properties to Wynn and his property developer Irwin Molasky. Molasky bought homes closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> course for $2 million each, and homes on the perimeter of the resort for $900,000 to $1.2 million each.
