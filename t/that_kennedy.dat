5|$|True Compass, {{the memoir}} <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> worked on {{throughout}} his illness, was published {{three weeks after}} his death. It debuted atop the New York Times Best Seller list and by mid-December 2009 had total sales of some 400,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Kennedy was {{substantially}} behind Humphrey in convention delegate support, but many believe <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary. Only thirteen states held primaries that year, meaning that most delegates at the Democratic convention could choose a candidate based on their personal preference. Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., and others have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and charisma would have been sufficiently convincing at the 1968 Democratic National Convention to give him the nomination. Historian Michael Beschloss believed, however, <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> would not have secured the nomination. Humphrey, after a National Convention in Chicago marred by violence in the streets, was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground. He ultimately lost the general election to Republican Richard Nixon by the narrow popular vote margin of 43.4% to 42.7%. Nixon won by a more decisive 301-191 margin in the electoral vote.|$|E
5|$|He {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1972–73 season, his confidence and form suffered as defenders marked him more closely and poor diet saw his weight rise to over 14 stone. Captain Frank McLintock remarked to the management <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was only operating at 60% capacity, and Kennedy was fined £200 before he began to shed weight and rediscover his form. Arsenal finished the season in second place, and he scored just nine league goals throughout the campaign. Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Sunderland.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has become}} {{tradition}} <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> old band Altan headline {{every year at}} the festival, but other well-known musicians have played at the school: ...|$|R
5000|$|Lookism {{has been}} an issue in {{politics}} for centuries, with a long tradition in the United Kingdom of [...] "mercilessly exaggerating" [...] the physical flaws of politicians in newspaper cartoons. In the 1960 Presidential race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, it was often believed <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> more conventionally handsome appearance contributed to his winning more approval in their first televised debate, but some researchers have challenged this widespread idea and argued <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> appearance {{had little or no}} influence.|$|R
50|$|Across {{their three}} albums {{it has been}} noted <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> vocal style has shifted from deathcore scream/growl vocals to a strict throaty growl and that his voice has become much clearer.|$|R
5|$|He {{was a close}} {{political}} ally of President John F. Kennedy, a {{fact that}} disturbed some North Carolina Democrats suspicious of Kennedy's Catholicism. According to Kennedy's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, Sanford would have been Kennedy's choice for vice president on the 1964 Democratic ticket if Kennedy had lived. In her 1968 book Kennedy and Johnson she reported <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> told her that Lyndon B. Johnson would be replaced as Vice President.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 2008, Kennedy {{suffered}} a seizure, {{and then another}} one as he was rushed from the Kennedy Compound to Cape Cod Hospital and then by helicopter to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Within days, doctors announced <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> had a malignant glioma, a type of cancerous brain tumor. The grim diagnosis brought reactions of shock and prayer from many senators of both parties and from President Bush.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, April 16, 1948, the Leaf players were greeted by thousands of Toronto fans as they got off the train from Detroit. They then rode open cars through a cascade of multi-coloured paper and ticket tape through Toronto's business district {{to arrive at a}} civic reception at City Hall. Speaking to the huge crowd, Conn Smythe announced <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was succeeding Syl Apps as captain who was retiring.|$|E
50|$|On June 18, 2012, the Miami Beach, Florida police {{department}} confirmed to news media <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> {{body had been}} found in her home on June 13. She was 42 years old. Kennedy's cause of death has never been publicly announced.|$|R
5000|$|A Herald Sun article {{published}} on 28 November 2006 headed [...] "Pals protect mate" [...] reported <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> friends Bert Newton, Noeline Brown {{and her husband}} TV writer Tony Sattler were [...] "refusing to help producers of a telemovie about his life." ...|$|R

5|$|The contest {{affects their}} sleep, and the {{remaining}} contestants suffer insomnia. Only the eliminated Kramer can sleep peacefully. Elaine shares a cab ride with Kennedy, and she tells him that she lives Uptown near Jerry in order to extend the ride. She then learns <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> wants to see her, and says he'll drop by Jerry's apartment. Eventually, the pressure becomes {{too much for her}} and she is the second person to be knocked out of the contest.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E
5|$|Strauss, Teller, Borden, and Robb {{would never}} escape the public {{identification}} {{of them with}} the case. In a 1962 television interview, Eric F. Goldman asked Teller whether he favored restoring Oppenheimer's security clearance. Teller was struck dumb, unable to find an answer. The question was deleted from the version that was aired, but the news got out and made headlines. President John F. Kennedy decided that {{the time had come}} to rehabilitate Oppenheimer. Teller nominated Oppenheimer for the 1963 Enrico Fermi Award. The nomination was unanimously approved by the GAC and AEC, and announced on April 5, 1963. On November 22, the White House confirmed <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> would personally present the award, but he was assassinated later that day. The award was presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson instead. Oppenheimer died of cancer on February 18, 1967.|$|E
50|$|Veteran US {{official}} Alexander Haig {{told the}} filmmaker <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> successor, Lyndon B Johnson, believed Cuba {{was to blame}} and feared a pronounced swing to the right if the truth were known that would keep the Democrats out of power for a long time.|$|R

50|$|One {{conspiracy}} {{theory suggests that}} a secret or shadow government including wealthy industrialists and right-wing politicians ordered the assassination of Kennedy. Peter Dale Scott has indicated <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> death allowed for policy reversals desired by the secret government to escalate the United States' military involvement in Vietnam.|$|R
5|$|At the OVW tapings on May 10, Kennedy {{returned}} to in-ring action facing the Heavyweight Champion, CM Punk, in a title match <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{was unable to}} win. Kennedy made his return to SmackDown! on the June 9 episode with a victory over Scotty 2 Hotty after using the Kenton Bomb. On the July 14 episode of SmackDown!, Matt Hardy used a roll-up to defeat Kennedy, ending Kennedy's streak of never being defeated by pin or submission. On the July 21 episode of SmackDown!, Batista put out an open challenge to find an opponent for The Great American Bash, as his original opponent, Mark Henry, had been injured. Kennedy accepted the challenge and won the match by disqualification, however, he suffered a severe injury during the match after being thrown headfirst into the steel steps, resulting in an exposed cranium laceration which required twenty stitches to close. He then entered into a short feud with Batista, defeating him by countout in their second match, but losing via pinfall in the third. Kennedy helped The McMahons (Vince and Shane) in their feud with D-Generation X (DX), appearing at both SummerSlam and the August 28 episode of Raw to attack DX.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E
5|$|When the Cuban Missile Crisis {{erupted in}} October 1962, Kennedy {{chose not to}} consult with Diefenbaker before making {{decisions}} on what actions to take. The US President sent former Ambassador Merchant to Ottawa to inform the Prime Minister as {{to the content of}} the speech <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was to make on television. Diefenbaker was upset at both the lack of consultation {{and the fact that he}} was given less than two hours advance word. He was angered again when the US government released a statement stating that it had Canada's full support. In a statement to the Commons, Diefenbaker proposed sending representatives of neutral nations to Cuba to verify the American allegations, which Washington took to mean that he was questioning Kennedy's word. When American forces went to a heightened alert, DEFCON 3, Diefenbaker was slow to order Canadian forces to match it. Harkness and the Chiefs of Staff had Canadian forces clandestinely go to that alert status anyway, and Diefenbaker eventually authorized it. The crisis ended without war, and polls found that Kennedy's actions were widely supported by Canadians. Diefenbaker was severely criticized in the media.|$|E
50|$|The film's {{post-production}} {{was done}} at a friend's apartment in North Melbourne, with Wilson and Kennedy editing the film in the small lounge room on a home-built editing machine <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> father, an engineer, had designed for them. Wilson and Kennedy also performed sound editing there.|$|R
50|$|At the 1960 Methodist General Conference in Denver, Colorado, Crowson {{presented}} a resolution aimed at discrediting the presidential aspirations of then-candidate John F. Kennedy, {{on the grounds}} <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> Catholicism caused fundamental problems for American sovereignty. The resolution was overwhelmingly rejected, and Crowson was strongly rebuked by fellow ministers.|$|R
50|$|Vacationing in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Khrushchev was {{reported}} to be angered by Kennedy's speech. John Jay McCloy, Kennedy's disarmament adviser, who {{happened to be in the}} Soviet Union, was invited to join Khrushchev. It is reported that Khrushchev explained to McCloy <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> military build-up threatened war.|$|R
25|$|Another candidate, Harold See, {{ran against}} Mark Kennedy, an {{incumbent}} Democratic {{justice and the}} son-in-law of George Wallace. The race included charges <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was mingling campaign funds with those of a non-profit children's foundation he was involved with. A former Rove staffer reported that some within the See camp initiated a whisper campaign <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was a pedophile. Kennedy won by less than one percentage point.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 Melbourne {{newspapers}} reported <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{was engaged}} to 28-year-old Australian singer Lana Cantrell, who became a successful New York lawyer.|$|E
25|$|In his 2006 book King and I: My Life with Graham Kennedy, {{published}} by celebrity agent Anthony Zammit, broadcaster Rob Astbury stated <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{and he had}} been lovers. Kennedy is portrayed as homosexual in the 2007 biopic The King.|$|E
50|$|In October 1962, Salinger briefed {{the press}} about what had been learned about Soviet {{missiles}} being stationed in Cuba. He later said <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> actions during <b>that</b> crisis {{were among the most}} incredible things a president had ever done in the 20th century and noted how close the countries were to nuclear war.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965 Wecht {{presented}} a paper critiquing the Warren Commission {{to the meeting}} of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. In 1972 Wecht was the first civilian ever given permission to examine the Kennedy assassination evidence. It was Wecht who first discovered <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy’s</b> brain, and all related data in the killing, had gone missing.|$|R
25|$|Historians {{often use}} 1979-80 to date a {{philosophical}} realignment within the American electorate away from Democratic liberalism and toward Reagan Era conservatism. However, some liberals hold a minority view {{that there was}} no real shift and <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> defeat was merely by historical accident caused by his poor campaign, international crises and Carter's use of the incumbency.|$|R
25|$|The park {{is part of}} a 70-acre tract <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{purchased}} in 1948, recorded restrictive covenants setting aside land in perpetuity as a wildlife refuge, and the following year subdivided, subsequently selling all but his own 4 acre parcel.|$|E
25|$|John F. Kennedy {{secured the}} Democratic presidential {{nomination}} in 1960. In the 1960 election, Kennedy faced accusations {{that as a}} Catholic president he would do as the Pope would tell him to do, a charge <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> refuted in a famous address to Protestant ministers.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy</b> dropped out, WPIX-TV and the Albany Times Union {{reported}} that Governor Paterson was expected to announce he was appointing Kirsten Gillibrand. The Governor made the official announcement of Gillibrand's appointment {{at a press conference}} in Albany on January 23, 2009.|$|E
50|$|In 1959, {{he built}} the {{foundation}} for Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign by touring the United States. O'Brien was appointed in 1960 by Kennedy to serve nationally {{as the director of}} his presidential campaign. His election planning in key primary states such as Wisconsin and West Virginia convinced many in the party <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> Catholicism was not a problem.|$|R
500|$|Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol {{spoke as}} well, noting <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> memory {{would be kept}} alive by this {{memorial}} [...] "not only {{as a friend of}} Israel but also {{as a symbol of the}} lofty ideals of his country and of all humanity," [...] dedicating the memorial to [...] "the man who opened new frontiers of international relations and human friendships." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Texas, Kennedy {{defeated}} Nixon by a 51 to 49% margin, or 46,000 votes. Some Republicans {{argued that}} Johnson's formidable political machine had stolen enough votes in counties along the Mexican border to give Kennedy the victory. Kennedy's defenders, {{such as his}} speechwriter and special assistant Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., have argued <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> margin in Texas (46,000 votes) was simply too large for vote fraud {{to have been a}} decisive factor. Russell D. Renka, a former political science professor at Southeastern Missouri State University, acknowledged that it was more than likely that Johnson's political machine in the state's lower Rio Grande Valley counties, including the notorious Duval County, could have [...] "managed to produce a significant number of forged votes" [...] for Kennedy. However, Renka also acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> margin in the state's initial tally [...] "made it far too difficult to prove that voter fraud had determined who won Texas" [...] and that [...] "any recount would also have been hard to conduct." ...|$|R
