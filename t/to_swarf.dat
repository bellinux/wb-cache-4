40|$|It {{has long}} been known in the machine tool {{industry}} that hydrostatic bearing technology has several unique advantages over rolling element bearings. The thin fluid film between the bearing pads and the rail provides virtually infinite motion resolution due to lack of static friction, very low straightness ripple, high squeeze film damping, potentially infinite bearing life, immunity to fretting, tolerance <b>to</b> ceramic <b>swarf,</b> and superior shock load capacity. However, a major impediment to the use of hydrostatic bearings is that there are no standard, pre-engineered designs that are commercially available, and custom design-ing a bearing is often prohibitively expensive and time consuming. In light of the opportunity just mentioned, the goal of this thesis is to present and demon-strate the feasibility of a family of novel modular hydrostatic bearings which are well suited for mass production and are designed to be bolt-for-bolt compatible with modular rolling element bearings.

40|$|Abstract. Diamond {{grinding}} wheel {{is used in}} high precision grinding process, when work piece has a very high hardness. For a specific grinding interval, the wheel must be properly dressed, in order <b>to</b> remove <b>swarf,</b> sharpen the worn diamond grits, open up new diamond protrusions, and recondition the bond material. Dressing of diamond {{grinding wheel}} by alumina dressing tool has been simulated in a pin-on-disk machine in the research. Sharpening of the wheel is indicated by the increase of its roughness value, and surface microstructure with protruding sharp diamond grits. It was found that increasing of sliding distant from 100 to 500 m will increase the roughness of the wheel. The increase of contact load from 10 to 20 N will also increase roughness of the wheel, and the severity of wheel wear, indicated by high values of friction coefficient. A proper dressing of this nickel bonded SD 1200 diamond wheel is by sliding against alumina dressing tool for at least 300 m under 10 N load. Sliding velocity between 0. 1 to 0. 3 m/s has minimal effect to the results. A too large sliding distant and load will cause severe damage to wheel surface, and severe wheel wear, indicated by its large mass loss...|$|R
40|$|Objective: John Sauer, Gleenglass principal, {{asked for}} {{research}} into innovative uses for a reclaimed glass slurry, also referred <b>to</b> as <b>swarf.</b> Through our research {{we were to}} determine a product and a market that could be manufactured using this fully recycled glass swarf. Background: Mr. Sauer receives the swarf from major glass manufacturers as a fine powder glass suspended in an organic dispersant and water. The swarf is produced through an industrial glass cutting process that results in the glass powder dispersed in water and recyclable glass disks; both {{are used in the}} project. Mr. Sauer's swarf studio testing has yet to produce any product with a value great enough to justify processing the swarf. Many of these limitations were believed to be due to the unknown composition and characteristics of the swarf as well as the limited lab testing ability of Mr. Sauer in his studio space. Deliverables: 1. The valuable characteristics of the swarf. 2. Products that can be produced with the swarf. 3. Market for developed products. 4. Capital investment needed to create developed product. 5.

40|$|Radioisotopes are {{radioactive}} {{versions of}} the natural chemical elements, differing from these only in their nuclear mass and {{in their ability to}} emit radiations. They are produced mainly by neutron bombardment of ordinary materials in a nuclear reactor. The most important radiations are beta particles (fast electrons of nuclear origin) and gamma rays (penetrating electromagnetic radiations). These are detected with ionization chambers, Geiger counters or scintillation counters. In production control, the absorption or scattering of radiations is used as a measure of material thickness, and in some cases, of its atomic number. Radioactive tracers aid in production research in rapid determination of mixing efficiencies and hold-up times. Tracers are also used in the non-destructive testing of materials and components and in more basic research into alloy structure. In this latter research, photographic films are used to produce autoradiographs which show the micro-scopic distribution of radioactively labelled constituents. Radioactivation by neutron irradiation enables certain impurities to be assayed at sub-microgram levels without chemical separation. The wear of engine parts can be measured, in a fraction of the time taken for orthodox methods, by making the parts in question radioactive and measuring the worn radioactive debris in circulating lubricant. Cutting tools can be measured similarly by assaying radio-active debris attached <b>to</b> the <b>swarf.</b> For many purposes gamma radiography supplements X-radiography or replaces it as a cheaper alternative. The greater manoeuvrability of gamma-ray sources is of especial advantage in the radiography of assembled engines...|$|R

Some machine tool manuals proscribe this practice both for safety and for the preservation of way wipers and bearing seals.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for machining MgO crystal blocks into forms for containing metallic and silicate liquids at temperatures up to 2, 400 C, and pressures up to at least 320 kilobars. Possible custom shapes include tubes, rods, insulators, capsules, and guides. Key differences in this innovative method include drilling along the crystallographic zone axes, use of a vibration minimizing material to secure the workpiece, and constant flushing of material swarf with a cooling medium/lubricant (water). A single crystal MgO block is cut into a section. 5 mm thick, 1 cm on a side, using a low-speed saw with a 0. 004 blade. The cut is made parallel to the direction of cleavage. The block may be cut to any thickness to achieve the desired length of the piece. To minimize drilling vibrations, the MgO block is mounted {{on a piece of}} adhesive putty in a vise. The putty wad cradles {{the bottom half of the}} entire block. Diamond coring tools are used to drill the MgO to the desired custom shape, with water used to wet and wash the surface of swarf. Compressed air may also be used <b>to</b> remove <b>swarf</b> during breaks in drilling. The MgO workpiece must be kept cool at all times with water.

40|$|Since {{more and}} more of the wells in the North Sea are meeting their end of lifetime, plug and {{abandonment}} is of great present interest. When a well reaches its end of production, the well can be permanently abandoned, or the slot and upper part of the well can be re-used to drill towards another target. This can be done by making a sidetrack from the original wellbore. Plug and abandonment operations may be problematic and therefore time consuming. Extra time consumption results in a lot of extra costs, and budgets are exceeded. In addition, plug and abandonment operations may cause well control situations, which is a safety and envi-ronmental risk. The main intention with this project was to highlight and find the operations during plug and abandonment of wells that have caused most downtime and well control issues. The most problematic situations needed to be found and evaluated, and a proposal for improvements should be given. The study showed that retrieval of casing and section milling was the most challenging opera-tions during plug and abandonment (P&A). Cutting and pulling of casing and completion is time consuming, and represents an uncertainty regarding well control. Section milling results in a lot of steel swarf in the well and deposits inside equipment like the BOP. When the annulus behind casings are logged, there is limited time to interpret logs if an effec-tive operation shall be maintained. The poor quality of the logs makes the interpretation job even harder, especially logging of annulus with several layers of casings in the cross section. Through present investigation a need of improved logging has been revealed, and thus avoid stuck casing by having a clear indication of what components are present in the annulus. Pre-ventive measures are to clean the well properly during the drilling operation to avoid a lot of cuttings in the well, and to log the casing annulus after cementing. Another idea is to displace the annulus behind casings to brine to avoid settling of barite. For milling operations, the well should be cleaned properly if there is any suspicion that swarf in the well could cause prob-lems for later operations. Alternatively, new methods could be used <b>to</b> leave <b>swarf</b> downhole in the well. The SwarfPak that is discussed later in this report is one such development. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatability}} {{study to}} macroencapsulate radioactively contaminated lead and steel swarf (cuttings and/or chips) and chunks, {{a low level}} mixed waste, from the dismantlement of excess surplus uranium fuel handling and transfer casks was successful. Macroencapsulation is the land disposal restriction treatment standard for this waste form per 40 CFR 268. 42 Table 3. An epoxy-based thermoset system was employed due to cracking failures {{of other types of}} thermoset systems. Bench scale tests were performed with a two-part epoxy (resin and hardener) using cast iron chips as a surrogate waste media. A two stage encapsulation process was employed in treating the swarf. Two liters of epoxy were added to a 2. 8 {ell} (3 qt) container of swarf under 51 K Pa vacuum (- 15 -inch of Hg) during the first stage of the process. In this stage each individual particle or chip was wetted by epoxy and allowed to harden into an initial monolith. The second stage encapsulated the initial monolith with a secondary layer of epoxy forming a larger final monolith. By evacuating the air from the swarf and epoxy during the initial monolith encapsulation, a higher density (higher <b>swarf</b> <b>to</b> epoxy ratio) was achieved. Tensile and compressive strength tests were performed on samples and without any media (cast iron chips). The coupons were prepared from a series of monoliths featuring various mixtures ratios and vacuum levels. The tensile strength of epoxy without chips averaged 41 M Pa (6000 psi) and 1. 4 M Pa (2000 psi) with cast iron chips. Compression strengths averaged 140 M Pa (20, 000 psi) without chips and 66. 2 M Pa (9600 psi) with cast iron chips...|$|R
5000|$|A {{serrated}} edge, such as on a saw or a bread knife, concentrates force {{onto the}} tips of the serrations which increases pressure as well as allowing soft or fibrous material (like wood, rope, bread, vegetables) to be expand into the spaces between serrations. Whereas pushing any knife, even a bread knife, down onto a bread loaf will just squash the loaf as bread has a low elastic modulus (is soft) but high yield strain (loosely, can be stretched or squashed by a large proportion without breaking), drawing serrations across the loaf with little downward force will allow each serration to simultaneously cut the bread with much less deformation of the loaf. Similarly, pushing on a rope tends to squash the rope while drawing serrations across it sheers the rope fibres. Drawing a smooth blade is less effective as the blade is parallel to the direction draw but the serrations of a serrated blade are at an angle to the fibres. Serrations on knives are often symmetric allowing the blade to cut on both the forward and reverse strokes of a cut, a notable exception being Veff serrations which are designed to maximise cutting power while moving the blade away from the user. Saw blade serrations, for both wood and metal, are typically asymmetrical so that they cut while moving in only one direction. (Saws act by abrading a material into dust along a narrow channel, the kerf, whereas knives and similar act by forcing the material apart. This means that saws result in a loss of material and the serrations of a saw also serve <b>to</b> carry metal <b>swarf</b> and sawdust out of the cut channel.) ...|$|R
40|$|In the North Sea, {{the average}} field age is {{increasing}} {{and a large}} number of wells needs to be plugged and abandoned in the future. P&A is regarded as an operation with no financial returns and is associated with significantly high costs. With a continuous {{increase in the number of}} wells that require abandonment and a falling oil price, the major focus for the oil industry is reducing costs while ensuring safe and reliable plugging of wells. The conventional method for placing a plug in a cased hole with no external barrier has required section milling of the casing, underreaming the open hole, and placing a balanced cement plug. The conventional method is time-consuming and costly, and is associated with several challenges and risks concerning Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). To reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of P&A operations, more attention has been directed towards the subject of P&A in recent years. This thesis has examined and presented the conventional section milling technology along with its limitations and challenges, and compared it with new technology‚Äôs with respect to time and scope. The main focus has been the new perforate, wash and cement (PWC) technology developed by HydraWell, and its advancement in the P&A operation. A case study comparing the conventional section milling operation with the PWC operation has been performed. Other investigated alternatives include reverse/upward section milling and plasma-based milling. This thesis also gives an insight into the process of plugging a well, including regulations and requirements, plugging materials, placement techniques, cement evaluation tools and challenges with the P&A process. The main findings revealed that most of the challenges with the section milling operation can be led back <b>to</b> the generated <b>swarf.</b> The case study revealed that the installation of the reservoir and secondary barrier was the most time-consuming part of the P&A operation. It also revealed that by applying the PCW technology, the operational time used to install the reservoir and secondary barrier could potentially be reduced by 73 % compared to the section milling operation. Considering the impressive scope ahead, the PWC technology has potential to reduce cost significantly for operating companies and national authorities in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this report is "Effect of Drilling Fluid Content on Directional Drilling - Shielding of Directional Magnetic Sensor in MWD Tools" {{and it has been}} {{prepared}} {{as a part of the}} course TPG 4910 Petroleum Engineering - Drilling Engineering, Master Thesis at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The magnetic property of the drilling fluid is one of the substantial error sources for the determination of azimuth while drilling deviated wells. These errors may be in the range of 1 - 2 [2] causing errors of 1 - 200 meter when drilling long, deviated intermediate sections. Therefore, these effects represent a significant cost to be mitigated. The error becomes even more pronounced if drilling occurs in arctic regions close to the magnetic North pole. Added clays, weight materials and tubular wear are anticipated to distort the geomagnetic field at the location of the magnetometers. The effect on the magnetometer readings is obviously linked to the amount of magnetic material in the drilling fluid. The problem has been studied both by laboratory experiments and analyses of down hole survey data. However, there are several inconsistencies in the results, and the phenomenon is not fully understood. In the present report it is shown how the magnetic distortion relates to some drilling fluid additives. A series of experiments have been conducted to increase the understanding of the effects. First a series of fresh water based bentonite drilling fluids were investigated to see the effect of bentonite on magnetic shielding. Thereafter, a series of fresh oil based drilling uidswere evaluated to observe the magnetic shielding effect of organophilic clays. Eroded steel (swarf) collected from the ditch-magnet of an offshore drilling location was added to the oil based drilling fluid <b>to</b> investigate how <b>swarf</b> and steel fines content of drilling fluids affects magnetic shielding. Finally, used oil and water based drilling fluids were investigated. The measurements done on the water based bentonite drilling fluid showed a shielding effect for the whole series of fluids. The highest shielding effect was 2. 2 %. This is high enough to cause significant errors on the magnetic survey azimuth calculations [3]. Ferreous components in the bentonite clay are the main suspects in causing shielding of the earth's magnetic field in the fresh water based drilling fluid. The measurements done with the oil based drilling fluid showed little or no shielding effect for the series of fluids tested. The shielding effect peaked at 0. 22 %, considerably less than for the water based bentonite drilling u-ids. The synthetically made organophilic hectorite clay in the oil based fluidis believed to contain little or no ferreous components capable of magnetic shielding. However, when swarf from an offshore drilling location was added to the oil based drilling fluid the shielding effect was 25 %. This is a consider-able shielding effect of the earth's magnetic field, likely to cause substantial errors on the directional magnetic sensor in MWD tools. For the used oil based drilling fluid, the measurements showed a small, close to negligible, shielding effect on the earth's magnetic field. The shielding was 0. 26 %, a result similar to the fresh oil based drilling fluid. None of the used water based drilling fluids showed any signs of affecting the earth's magnetic field. </p...|$|R
