5|$|Beer {{ranges from}} less than 3% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv, though this {{strength}} can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process. The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall {{in the range of}} 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4% abv. Some beers, such as <b>table</b> <b>beer</b> are of such low alcohol content (1%–4%) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools.|$|E

5000|$|Explanations of {{the origin}} of the name Schafkopf vary.

[...] A third theory, from the author Wolfgang Peschel, states that in earlier times the game was generally played on the top (head, Kopf) of wooden beer casks (middle high German: Schaff = cask). To this day, such casks are used as <b>tables</b> at <b>beer</b> stands and beer halls.|$|R
5000|$|Ale, {{along with}} bread, was an {{important}} source of nutrition in the medieval world, particularly small beer, also known as <b>table</b> <b>beer</b> or mild beer, which was highly nutritious, contained just enough alcohol to act as a preservative, and provided hydration without intoxicating effects. Small beer would have been consumed daily by almost everyone, including children, in the medieval world, with higher-alcohol ales served for recreational purposes. The lower cost for proprietors combined with the lower taxes levied on small beer led to the selling of beer labeled [...] "strong beer" [...] that had actually been diluted with small beer. [...] In medieval times, ale may have been safer to drink than most water (the germ theory of disease was unheard of, and the sterilizing properties of boiling unknown); however, there is no period evidence that people were aware of this nor that they chose to drink ale for this reason. The alcohol, hops, and some ingredients in gruit used to preserve some ales may have contributed to their lower load of pathogens, when compared to water. However, ale was largely safer due to the hours of boiling required in production, not the alcoholic content of the finished beverage.|$|E

Incidence geometry can be found almost everywhere in mathematics, since it {{is related to the}} most basic and elementary mathematical structures. The idea progressively emerged from the work of nineteenth-century geometers like Pasch and von Staudt, but it is usually credited to Hilbert. In his masterpiece Die Grundlagen der Geometrie (1899) he set up a system of axioms with different levels concerning undefined concepts like point, line, plane, lie on, betweenness, congruence, etc., pointing out that points, lines, and planes could be replaced by chairs, <b>tables,</b> and <b>beer</b> mugs, or other objects—their true nature and our mental representation of them being irrelevant. The first level consists of connection axioms, e. g., “for each two points there is one line which lies on these two points”.
