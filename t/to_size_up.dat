25|$|When public administrators perform {{emotional}} labor, {{many scholars}} argue administrators {{are dealing with}} significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The {{reason for this is}} because they are {{on the front lines of}} the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing <b>to</b> <b>size</b> <b>up</b> the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.|$|E

2500|$|Hazlitt and Moore shared many left-wing {{political}} views; however, Hazlitt's critical {{stance against}} much of Moore's poetry {{and some of}} his actions later distanced the two men. One of these actions was Moore's discouraging his friend Byron from joining Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt in Hunt's new left-leaning political journal, The Liberal. Also Moore harshly criticised the personal life of one of Hazlitt's favorite writers, Rousseau, and simultaneously disparaged Rousseau's literary accomplishments, later angrily defended by Hazlitt against Moore.
