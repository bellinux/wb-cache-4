5|$|During operations, the He 111Z did {{not have}} enough power to lift a fully loaded Me 321. Some He 111s were {{supplemented}} by rocket pods for extra takeoff thrust, but this was not a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added 500kg (1,100lb) in weight. <b>The</b> <b>pods</b> were then released by parachute after takeoff.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} pods {{introduced}} to IndyCar in 2012 {{intended to prevent}} cars from becoming airborne when hitting another in the rear proved to be ineffective as there were major crashes resulting from such contact during the 2013 race in Houston involving Dario Franchitti and the 2017 Indianapolis 500 involving Scott Dixon. In addition <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> were often ripped from cars from light contact, placing hazardous debris on the track. As a result the rear pods were eliminated for 2018.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E
5000|$|The {{literacy}} rate was 72.1, the male one 83.5 {{and the female}} one 59.9. There is a clear Hindu majority.

5000|$|The Kantrowitz {{limit is}} a {{fundamental}} concept in the Hyperloop, a recent high-speed transportation option proposed by Elon Musk for rapid transit between populous city-pairs about 1000 mi apart. The Hyperloop moves passengers in sealed pods through a partial-vacuum tube at high-subsonic speeds. As {{the air in the}} tube moves into and around the smaller cross-sectional area between <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> and tube, <b>the</b> air flow must speed up due to the continuity principle. If <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> is travelling through the tube fast enough, the air flow around <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> will reach <b>the</b> speed of sound, and the flow will become choked, resulting in large air resistance on <b>the</b> <b>pod.</b> <b>The</b> condition that determine if the flow around <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> chokes is <b>the</b> Kantrowitz limit. The Kantrowitz limit therefore acts a [...] "speed limit" [...] - for a given ratio of tube area and pod area, there is a maximum speed that <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> can travel before flow around <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> chokes and air resistance sharply increases.|$|R

5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia fistula.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the show was that each main event match was to be contested as an Elimination Chamber match. The Elimination Chamber is a {{circular}} steel cage, consisting of chains and girders, that surrounds the ring. Four 'pods' are enclosed within the chamber, one behind each ring post, which are on a steel platform surrounding {{the outside of the}} ring. Six wrestlers compete in the match; four are enclosed within <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> and released at random at specific time intervals, and two start the match. Wrestlers can only be eliminated via pinfall or submission, and the last wrestler left is the winner. For the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, both WWE world championships, the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship, were to be defended in separate Elimination Chamber matches.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} break through the speed limit set by the Kantrowitz limit, there are two {{possible}} approaches. The first would increase the diameter of the tube in order to provide more bypass area for the air around <b>the</b> <b>pod,</b> preventing <b>the</b> flow from choking. This solution is not very practical in practice however, as the tube would have to be built very large, and logistical costs of such a large tube are impractical. Another possible solution as proposed by Elon Musk in his 2013 Hyperloop Alpha paper would have a compressor at the front of <b>the</b> <b>pod.</b> <b>The</b> compressor actively sucks in the high-pressure air in front of <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> and transfers it through <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> to either power a low-friction air-bearing suspension system or simply bypass the flow behind <b>the</b> <b>pod.</b> <b>The</b> inclusion of a compressor in <b>the</b> Hyperloop <b>pod</b> to circumvent <b>the</b> Kantrowitz limit would allow <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> to travel at speeds over 700 mph, avoiding the Kantrowitz limit.|$|R
25|$|The team {{says with}} air {{pressure}} at 140 Pascals, <b>the</b> <b>pod</b> could accelerate at 2.4 G and have 2 Newton aerodynamic drag when traveling at 110m/s.

5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} <b>the</b> <b>pods,</b> most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E
25|$|Loading <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> was {{accomplished}} {{on a set}} of parallel railway tracks, two tracks {{on either side of the}} aircraft. The front and back halves of <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> were positioned at the end of the tracks on loaders, with <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> below the line of the wings.

25|$|Although it is {{beneficial}} {{to feed on}} seeds, larvae do not enter <b>the</b> <b>pods</b> immediately after they hatch.
