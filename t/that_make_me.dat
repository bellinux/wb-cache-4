Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011. In 2014 she topped People annual best dressed list. In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards, and ranked first in Maxim Hot 100 list.|$|E

2500|$|Searching for the Young Soul Rebels was {{released}} to positive reviews from music critics. Melody Maker named {{it one of}} the best albums of 1980 in its year-end list, while NME named it the tenth best album of the year. David Hepworth, however, reviewing the album in Smash Hits, was dismissive and felt that [...] "potentially good songs are dragged down by mannered vocals and would-be epic arrangements". Calling it [...] "a weird record", Robert Christgau wrote: [...] "Never have soul horns sounded remotely as sour, and Kevin Rowland can't carry a tune to the next note. There are horn interjections <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> laugh out loud at their perfectly timed wrong rightness, and with Kevin Rowland quavering through his deeply felt poesy and everybody else blaring away, I enjoy it {{in much the same way}} I enjoy a no wave band on a good night".|$|E
2500|$|.....under no {{circumstances}} whatever will I be in connexion with Mr Pitt. It {{is sufficient for}} a man's life to have been duped once. I hesitate no less to say that I will never hold communication with the Duke of Portland until he has made that amende honorable to those...whose weight and consideration in Ireland he has made subservient to his own purposes and views in this country. ...my inclinations, my private attachments, the habits of my life, all combine to make me anxious to see the moment when I {{may be able to}} give the members of opposition honourable assistance. ... But in stating this it certainly is not in my contemplation to become again an active member of an opposition. Those days are over—circumstances have happened <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> think that I can be no more usefully so...but, in one word, should circumstances ever present to me the opportunity of doing essential injury to Mr Pitt's power, or of rendering effectual service to Mr Fox, I will not fail to seize it.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{not having}} the Republican nomination, Lindsay {{was still on the}} ballot as the {{candidate}} of the New York Liberal Party. In his campaign he said [...] "mistakes were made" [...] and called being mayor of New York City [...] "the second toughest job in America." [...] Two television advertisements described his position: In one he looked directly into the camera and said, [...] "I guessed wrong on the weather before the city's biggest snowfall last winter. And that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more cops on the streets. And that was no mistake. The school strike went on too long and we all made some mistakes. But I brought 225,000 more jobs to this town. And that was no mistake... And we did not have a Detroit, a Watts or Newark. And those were no mistakes. The things that go wrong are what make this the second toughest job in America. But the things that go right are those things <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> want it." [...] The second opened with a drive through the Holland Tunnel from lower Manhattan toward New Jersey and suggested that, [...] "Every New Yorker should take this trip at least once before election day..." [...] followed by video of Newark, New Jersey which had been devastated by race riots.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{called his}} {{garments}} [...] "my honor." [...] Rabbi Aha bar Abba said in Rabbi Johanan's name that [...] "And he shall put off his garments, {{and put on}} other garments," [...] teaches that a change of garments {{is an act of}} honor in the Torah. And the School of Rabbi Ishmael taught that the Torah teaches us manners: In the garments in which one cooked a dish for one's master, one should not pour a cup of wine for one's master. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba said in Rabbi Johanan's name that it is a disgrace for a scholar {{to go out into the}} marketplace with patched shoes. The Gemara objected that Rabbi Aha bar Hanina went out that way; Rabbi Aha son of Rav Nachman clarified that the prohibition is of patches upon patches. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba also said in Rabbi Johanan's name that any scholar who has a grease stain on a garment is worthy of death, for Wisdom says in [...] "All they that hate me ( [...] , mesanne'ai) love (merit) death," [...] and we should read not , mesanne'ai, but , masni'ai (<b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> hated, that is, despised). Thus a scholar who has no pride in personal appearance brings contempt upon learning. Ravina taught that this was stated about a thick patch (or others say, a bloodstain). The Gemara harmonized the two opinions by teaching that one referred to an outer garment, the other to an undergarment. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba also said in Rabbi Johanan's name that in [...] "As my servant Isaiah walked naked and barefoot," [...] "naked" [...] means in worn-out garments, and [...] "barefoot" [...] means in patched shoes.|$|E
2500|$|The United Daily {{newspaper}} {{referred to}} the Taiwan crossing paintings as [...] "a joy to view." [...] In the January 2006 issue of The Artist’s Magazine, which featured Yim’s Lady in Shimmering Light as its cover, Yim’s painting {{is described as a}} “stunning work” which has a “classic quality that crosses geographic and cultural boundaries.” [...] The prominent writer Li Ao, one of Taiwan's foremost public intellectuals, heaped similar praise on Yim's Mackay Practicing Medicine in a supplement to the Yangcheng Evening News in 2008 and also on his television show. [...] Lin Yong, former President of the Guangdong Artists' Association, waxes poetic in a memorable passage: [...] "Yim Mau-Kun has spent decades quietly, calmly, diligently and thoughtfully painting. [...] I don't know how many drawings and paintings he's created, and I don't know how many books he has read. [...] But over the decades, whenever we talk he often has impressive insights; he has never stopped thinking. [...] It's his diligence in studying, thinking, and articulating his thoughts <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> {{think of him as a}} Confucian scholar. [...] His insights have been very beneficial for me. [...] I see deep wrinkles in an old tree, ripples in a river, a rock unmoved by thunder and storms, a massive tree that remains unbent, and I see in Yim Mau-Kun a refreshing spring breeze." [...] Liang Jiang—former Deputy Director of the [...] National Art Museum of China and former Director of the Art Institute of China Army Academy—in the essay [...] "True to Himself" [...] for Taiwan's Arts and Literature Daily celebrates at length Yim's still lifes, landscapes, as well as Crossing the Stormy Strait and Reaching Shore. [...] Ned Jacob, nationally renowned artist and teacher at the Scottsdale Artists' School, in the foreword to A Classical Guide to How to Draw the Head speaks of [...] Yim as [...] "a craftsman of surpassing ability and sensibility," [...] a [...] "brave and vociferous champion of the classical legacy," [...] whose works [...] "resonate [...] virtuosity and boldness of handling[...] [...] [...]Treasures such as these – sacredly kept – will comfort us in those hours when fears and doubts come calling." ...|$|E
