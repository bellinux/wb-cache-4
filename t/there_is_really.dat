Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. In this point of view, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> one sort of mathematics that can be discovered; triangles, for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.|$|E
25|$|The 'Man on the throne' in {{the vision}} of Ezekiel descriptively {{represents}} God, who is controlling everything {{that goes on in}} the world, and how all of the archetypes He set up should interact. The 'Man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when one looks at the way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act.|$|E

500|$|To Stanford's regret, many of {{his pupils}} who {{achieved}} eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke's conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of what some of these rebels have since achieved, {{one is tempted to}} wonder whether <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> anything better a teacher can do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, and to some extent elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that Descartes explained the problem cogently, few later philosophers have been happy with his solution, and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed. [...] However, no alternative solution has gained general acceptance. [...] Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories: [...] dualist solutions that maintain Descartes' rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and monist solutions that maintain that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects. [...] Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants. [...] The two main types of dualism are substance dualism (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed {{by the laws of}} physics) and property dualism (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind). [...] The three main types of monism are physicalism (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), idealism (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and neutral monism (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them). [...] There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought.|$|E

He would have deserved it even if he had not made this discovery. But everyone recognized that the splitting of the atomic nucleus merited a Nobel Prize."

I don't want to give the producers the impression that I'm sitting waiting." [...] It was later revealed that Serkis would also serve as second unit director on the films. Serkis stated, [...] "I think I understand Peter's sensibility and we have a common history of understanding Middle-earth.

2500|$|Portrait of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge is {{the first}} {{official}} portrait of the Duchess. Emsley, originally of South Africa and a 2007 recipient of the BP Portrait Award, had previously painted portraits of Nelson Mandela and Naipaul. In a video interview for The Daily Telegraph, Emsley suggested that beginning he was thrilled to receive the commission. [...] "Slowly" [...] he says he realized {{the importance of the}} project was, not just for himself, but for many others, making him slightly nervous. He was keen to capture Catherine's [...] "charm, serenity and intelligence" [...] and [...] "sparkling green eyes". The Duchess sat for him twice—for a day's session in May at the artist's studio in Bradford-upon-Avon, and a brief session in June at Kensington Palace, where he did quick drawings and took more photographs—and he used photographs to assist him. He describes her during the process as [...] "quite amenable". According to Emsley, Catherine had asked for herself to be painted naturally, as opposed to her official self." [...] It shows Catherine wearing a bottle green pussy bow blouse, looking straight out from the picture, smirking, rather than grinning. The artist noted that, if too defined, smiling portraiture occasionally may [...] "look like caricatures". Emsley darkened the eyes slightly to match her tunic; the background is also shaded in a similar hue of dark green. Emsley was also keen {{to draw attention to the}} rich texture of her hair. Talking to the BBC after criticism of his work, he noted that he didn't want to overwhelm her face. Emsley said, [...] "I don't have lots of things in the background. I do like large faces, I find them strong and contemporary. I'm interested in the landscape of the face, the way in which light and shadow fall across the forms. That's really my subject matter. To have anything else in <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> just an interference."
