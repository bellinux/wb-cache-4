5|$|During Godwin's exile, Robert {{is said to}} {{have been}} sent by the king on an errand to William, Duke of Normandy. The reason for the embassy is uncertain. William of Jumièges says <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> went to tell Duke William that Edward wished William to be his heir. The medieval writer William of Poitiers gives the same reason, but also adds <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> took with him as hostages Godwin's son Wulfnoth and {{grandson}} Hakon (son of Sweyn). The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is silent on the visit however, so it is uncertain whether Robert visited Normandy or not, or why he did so. The entire history of the various missions which Robert is alleged to have made is confused, and complicated by propaganda claims made by Norman chroniclers after the Norman Conquest in 1066, leaving it unclear if Robert visited Normandy on his way to receive his pallium or after Godwin was in exile, or if he went twice or not at all.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> Hamilton, an archaeologist {{who worked on the}} Temple Mount after the 1927 Jericho earthquake, had discovered remains under al-Aqsa mosque that he did not publish in his book on the excavations. These included a mosaic like those used in Byzantine churches, and a Jewish mikveh from the Second Temple period.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{died after}} 1174, and was {{probably}} buried in his priory. His successor was Philip of Oxford, {{who was in}} office by 1180. Besides his theological works, Robert also searched throughout England for Hebrew texts {{of the works of}} Josephus, according to Gerald of Wales, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> had a knowledge of the Hebrew language.|$|E
5|$|Robert died on 27 February 1167. William fitzStephen, one of Becket's supporters, wrote <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> died {{of grief}} {{because he was}} unable to visit Becket in exile. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral. Robert enjoyed a good {{reputation}} on the continent, for his knowledge and teaching ability, as well as for his personal qualities. Before his appointment to Hereford, John of Salisbury had praised him, but Robert's conduct during the Becket controversy soured John's attitude towards his old teacher.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Scout uniform {{was based}} on the uniform <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> Baden-Powell designed for the South African Constabulary, a paramilitary force established to police the conquered Boer republics following the Anglo-Boer War. The current South African Scout uniform is in fact still based on the uniform worn by the South African Constabulary.|$|E
50|$|In July 2009, {{the parole}} board {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>Roberts</b> still posed a public risk and should continue to serve time at Littlehey prison in Cambridgeshire, where {{he worked in the}} library.

2500|$|In 1997, Fasold was {{involved}} in an Australian case against a creationist named Allen Roberts who reproduced some of Fasold's artwork without permission. A co-plaintiff was Australian Humanist and skeptic Ian Plimer. [...] Plimer sued Roberts's organization Ark Search, claiming <b>that</b> <b>Roberts</b> and Ark Search made false and misleading claims about the Durupinar site. [...] Plimer argued <b>that</b> <b>Robert's</b> speech was not protected free speech, but instead he sued under the Fair Trading Act, claiming <b>that</b> <b>Roberts</b> was misleading the public. [...] The case was promoted by the media around Australia and {{the world as a}} second Scopes Monkey Trial. [...] Plimer's action failed; Judge Ron Sackville said [...] "Courts should not attempt to provide a remedy for every false or misleading statement made in the course of public debate on matters of general interest." [...] Judge Sackville accepted <b>that</b> <b>Roberts</b> had infringed Fasold's copyrights, but Fasold described the award of $2,500 Australian dollars in damages as [...] "a slap in the face," [...] pointing out that he had won more in two similar cases in the United States.|$|R

5|$|The {{historian}} Katharine Keats-Rohan records {{his death}} as occurring in 1157 or 1158. Robert's successor as dean, Robert Butevilain, is first securely attested as dean on 6 May 1158, {{and the last}} secure date for his holding his previous office is 13 December 1157, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> of Ghent died in between those dates, or shortly before the earlier date.|$|E
5|$|William was re-elected to York after Murdac's {{death in}} 1153. When William {{attempted}} to enter York on 9 May 1154, Robert, along with Osbert de Bayeux, tried to prevent his entry, but their attempt was unsuccessful and they {{then went to}} Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and appealed in vain against William's actions. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> feared that William would remove Robert from the deanship. After William's death, Robert, once more acting with Osbert, pressured the cathedral chapter of York to elect Stephen's choice of Roger de Pont L'Évêque as the new Archbishop of York. Osbert was later accused of poisoning William, and was deprived of his office and clerical status when he could not clear himself from the accusation. Although Robert was associated with Osbert's opposition to William, {{there is no evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> was ever thought to {{have been involved in the}} possible poisoning of William.|$|E
5|$|A Norman medieval chronicler claimed <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> {{travelled}} to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 {{and told}} Duke William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, that Edward wished {{for him to}} become his heir. The exact timing of Robert's trip, and whether he actually made it, {{have been the subject}} of debate among historians. The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055. Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England, the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor, now known as Westminster Abbey. Robert's treatment by the English was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} {{that they have}} lost Prestige Direct, Jim, Dwight and Harry retreat outside for a coffee break. They end up having a conversation over {{what they would do}} with their lives, if they were not working for Dunder Mifflin. Jim jokingly says that he would be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> will be the ruin of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E
5|$|Although Robert {{refused to}} consecrate Spearhafoc, {{there is little}} {{evidence}} that he was interested in the growing movement towards Church reform being promulgated by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform, initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony. In 1049 Leo IX declared that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric, hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement. It was against this backdrop <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, although there is no other evidence <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> embraced the reform position, and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform. There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin, and his appointment was meant as a quid pro quo for the non-appointment of Æthelric. If true, Robert's refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl.|$|E
5|$|Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) confides in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{that she}} {{suspects}} her husband, Robert (Jack Coleman)—who is secretly having {{a relationship with}} Oscar—of cheating on her. Oscar thinks <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> may be seeing another man besides him and convinces Angela that they should spy on Robert at his yoga class. They hide outside of the class and watch as Robert spends time with a younger woman who later {{turns out to have}} a boyfriend. Oscar then notices Robert spending most of the yoga practice with a young man, which he finds suspicious. After the class, Robert phones Oscar, and his phone goes off. Oscar panics and silences the phone, and Angela immediately realizes why.|$|E
50|$|Later {{that year}} on August 28, Roberts fell ill during {{a flight from}} Atlanta to Las Vegas where he was {{scheduled}} to attend a birthday event for fellow wrestler Nick Cvjetkovich. First reports indicated <b>that</b> <b>Roberts</b> had fallen unconscious, however his manager/lawyer, Kyle P. Magee, confirmed <b>that</b> <b>Roberts</b> was alert and awake during the flight and notified the flight attendant of pain and shortness of breath. Magee said <b>that</b> <b>Roberts</b> was induced to a 'coma-like' state in order to treat pneumonia. Roberts was diagnosed with the flu two weeks earlier and ignored doctors advice of rest and continued to travel to events. Upon arrival at the ICU in Las Vegas, Roberts was diagnosed with double pneumonia. Doctors also found an abnormality on Roberts' brain which they felt could be a result of all the bumps Roberts took over his long career.|$|R

5|$|Doggett and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) try to {{get more}} help from Hayes. He tells them that the killer {{they are looking for}} is a {{criminal}} linked to organized crime. The two agents later meet up with Nicholas Regali, a former mobster who claims he is looking for a job in the area. They later find out that Hayes's intuition about Regali was correct. Meanwhile, Hayes returns to his apartment complex where walls are covered with crime scene photos related to the death of Luke Doggett. Eventually, Doggett asks Hayes for help solving the case about his son's death. Hayes tells Doggett that he believes <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> Harvey was behind the kidnapping of Luke, but that Regali killed him.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln, Old Bob was again brought out of retirement. During the cortège preceding the funeral in Springfield, Old Bob was caparisoned in a black mourning blanket trimmed with silver fringe and tassels. Henry Brown, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and friend of the Lincoln family, led Old Bob, whose spot in the procession was immediately behind the hearse {{and in front of}} the carriage carrying Robert Todd Lincoln. It has been said <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> Lincoln and Old Bob were the only members of Lincoln's family present at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In late 1077 {{or early}} 1078 trouble began between William and his eldest son, Robert. Although Orderic Vitalis {{describes}} it as starting with a quarrel between Robert and his two younger brothers, William and Henry, including a story that the quarrel was started when William and Henry threw water at Robert, {{it is much more}} likely <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> was feeling powerless. Orderic relates that he had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuffed. The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men, many of them the sons of William's supporters. Included among them was Robert of Belleme, William de Breteuil, and Roger, the son of Richard fitzGilbert. This band of young men went to the castle at Remalard, where they proceeded to raid into Normandy. The raiders were supported by many of William's continental enemies. William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard, but King Philip gave them the castle at Gerberoi, where they were joined by new supporters. William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079. After three weeks, the besieged forces sallied from the castle and managed to take the besiegers by surprise. William was unhorsed by Robert and was only saved from death by an Englishman. William's forces were forced to lift the siege, and the king returned to Rouen. By 12 April 1080, William and Robert had reached an accommodation, with William once more affirming <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> would receive Normandy when he died.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> had a falling out with Stephen {{in the last}} months of the king's reign– Stephen died in October 1154. Stephen besieged Drax Castle in the summer of 1154, which had earlier been given to Robert's nephew Robert. The younger Robert may have objected to giving up his castle to the previous owners and the elder Robert may have taken offence at these events. This would explain why Robert does not appear on Stephen's charters after the Lincoln charter of 1154, but this theory is just speculation by one of Robert's biographers. Robert was replaced as chancellor by Becket shortly after Henry II's coronation on 19 December 1154 and before January 1155.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 1865, Booth {{heard the}} news <b>that</b> <b>Robert</b> E. Lee had {{surrendered}} at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that he {{was done with the}} stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was Venice Preserv'd. Weichmann did not understand the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.|$|E
