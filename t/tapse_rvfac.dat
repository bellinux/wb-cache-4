40|$|BackgroundOperative risk of tricuspid {{regurgitation}} (TR) {{surgery is}} currently based on right ventricular (RV) systolic function assessment while biological markers of RV congestion are under used. The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the additive value of biological markers of RV congestion in predicting postoperative mortality after TR surgery. MethodsThirty-seven patients (age 69 ± 13 years) referred for surgical correction of isolated severe TR (n= 13) or TR associated with a left-side heart valve disease were included. RV congestion was assessed preoperatively using natremia, uremia, creatinin and bilirubin. RV systolic function was assessed by echocardiography using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and RV fractional area change (RVFAC). Outcome was defined as early postoperative mortality (< 30 days). ResultsBefore surgery, 70 % (n= 26) patients had moderate to severe TR, 30 % (n= 11) had RV dysfunction (TAPSE< 15 mm), and 20 % (n= 7) both. Bili-rubin level correlated with TAPSE (r= 0. 43, P= 0. 04) and inferior vena cava diameter (r=– 0. 46, P= 0. 01) but not with TR severity. After cardiac surgery, one patient had persistent moderate to severe TR and 7 patients died. Pre-operative natremia was lower and uremia (20 ± 11 vs. 9 ± 4 mmol/L, P= 0. 0001), creatinin and biliburin were greater in death than survival patients, while no difference was observed for <b>TAPSE,</b> <b>RVFAC,</b> EuroSCORE-II and the severity of TR. Finally, multivariate analysis showed that only uremia (P= 0. 01) was associated with post-operative mortality. ConclusionsIn patients referred for TR correction, uremia that probably reflects RV congestion appears superior to RV parameters by echocardiography to identify postoperative mortality...|$|E
30|$|There {{are various}} {{measurement}} methods for RV function, such as {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), echocardiography, and the thermodilution method, which uses a pulmonary artery catheter. Resolution and analysis methods are advancing and have become useful {{for the assessment of}} cardiac function [3, 7, 10, 11]. RV systolic function has been evaluated with several parameters, namely, RV index of myocardial performance, <b>TAPSE,</b> <b>RVFAC,</b> tissue Doppler–derived tricuspid lateral annular systolic velocity (S′), and longitudinal strain and strain rate (J). RV contraction comprises the following: (1) movement of the RV free wall toward the interventricular septum; (2) projection of the interventricular septum toward RV with curvature radius reduction of the interventricular septum during left ventricular contraction; (3) traction of the RV free wall with left ventricular contraction at the holdfast of the interventricular septum; and (4) RV contraction in the long axis direction [12]. RV has a complicated shape and contracts in three dimensions. Furthermore, the movement is affected by the interventricular septum and left ventricle. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the volume and ejection fraction of RV in two dimensions. In addition, {{it has been reported that}} the accuracy of 2 D analysis methods such as TAPSE and S′ are insufficient compared with that of MRI [4]. 3 DE allows direct measurement of the RV volume without relying on geometric assumptions regarding RV shape, resulting in more accurate and reproducible measurements of RVEF. In addition, 2 D measurements are inaccurate in cases of arrhythmia or impaired diastolic dysfunction, whereas 3 D methods allow measurement of RV function in these cases [3, 7, 10, 11, 13]. Nonetheless, RVFAC is correlated with RVEF. Although 2 D measurements were not able to capture the recovery of RV function, 3 D measurements did in our case. RVEF of 44 % or more is considered normal [7], but it was decreased in this case. Quantitative analysis was performed using newly dedicated software for our case (4 D RV Function 2.0; TomTec Imaging Systems), which provided measurement values of RV volumes and EF using the speckle-tracking technology. Compared with MRI, the new software is fast, reproducible, and accurate over a wide range of RV sizes and functions [11]. It allowed us to perform rapid assessments and led to RVAD withdrawal. Although several reports showed that TEE predicted successful withdrawal of VAD [5, 14], they have not mentioned about 3 D TEE. This may provide more accurate evaluations regarding withdrawal than does 2 D TEE.|$|E
40|$|Background: Many echocardiographic {{parameters}} {{have been}} proposed to evaluate right ventricular (RV) systolic function. We comprehensively assessed {{a wide range of}} quantitative echocardiographic parameters in a single cohort compared with same-day cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Methods and results: 92 subjects were examined prospectively: Group 1 consisted of 46 healthy controls (21 males, 33. 4  ±  11. 4  years), Group 2 consisted of 46 patients (20 males, 38. 5  ±  18. 9  years) undergoing RV functional assessment by CMR (1. 5  T). Echocardiography was performed on the same day as CMR; fractional area change (RVFAC), myocardial performance index via spectral Doppler (RVMPI), RVMPI via Doppler tissue imaging (RVMPI-DTI), peak systolic myocardial velocity by DTI (RVSm), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), speckle tracking strain, and three dimensional right ventricular ejection fraction (3 DE-RV). Linear regression, Bland–Altman and receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. At ROC analysis, the most predictive echocardiographic methods were; RVFAC (AUC =  0. 892), RVMPI (AUC 0. 785), TAPSE (AUC 0. 849) and 3 DE-RV (AUC 0. 909). 3 DE-RV appeared the most accurate compared to CMR, although underestimated true RV volumes. Conclusion: As compared to CMR; 3 DE-RV, <b>RVFAC,</b> <b>TAPSE</b> and RVMPI were the most reliable predictors of RV function. These parameters can be recommended for clinical use...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic accuracy and variability of 3 semi-quantitative (SQt) methods for assessing right ventricular (RV) systolic function from cardiac MRI {{in patients with}} acquired heart disease: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV fractional-shortening (RVFS) and RV fractional area change (RVFAC). METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients were enrolled. Reference RV ejection fraction (RVEF) was determined from short axis cine sequences. <b>TAPSE,</b> RVFS and <b>RVFAC</b> were measured on a 4 -chamber cine sequence. All SQt analyses were performed twice by 3 observers with various degrees of training in cardiac MRI. Correlation with RVEF, intra- and inter-observer variability, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed for each SQt method. RESULTS: Correlation between RVFAC and RVEF was good for all observers and did not depend on previous cardiac MRI experience (R range = 0. 716 - 0. 741). Conversely, RVFS (R range = 0. 534 - 0. 720) and TAPSE (R range = 0. 482 - 0. 646) correlated less with RVEF and depended on previous experience. Intra- and inter-observer variability was much lower for RVFAC than for RVFS and TAPSE. ROC analysis demonstrated that RVFAC < 41 % could predict a RVEF < 45 % with 90 % sensitivity and 94 % specificity. CONCLUSIONS: RVFAC {{appears to be more}} accurate and reproducible than RVFS and TAPSE for SQt assessment of RV function by cardiac MRI...|$|R
