5|$|The poem is {{critical}} of the corruption Coleridge sees within his own government, but it still displays his loyalty and devotion to England. The poem operates in a circular pattern with its beginning and ending at the Stowey dell. By introducing the historically real possibility of an invasion of England, the narrator announces his determination to protect his family and the dell, along with his fellow Britons. Throughout the poem, {{there is also an}} emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>life</b> and the narrator desires to return to his previous idyllic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine writers {{held the}} Slavs in low regard for <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>life</b> they led {{and also for}} their {{supposedly}} limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already {{a threat to the}} Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length {{on how to deal with}} the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as saying in the last quarter of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius.|$|E

Indeed, it is said that the concept of the Hermitage as a retreat was suggested to Catherine by that advocate of <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>life,</b> Jean Jacques Rousseau. In reality, it was another large palace in itself, connected to the main palace by a series of covered walkways and heated courtyards in which flew rare exotic birds. Noted for its fine portico and attention to details of a delicate nature, it was richly furnished with an ever-growing art collection.|$|E
25|$|Sarada lived <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>life</b> of an Indian village girl. As a child Sarada—then {{known as}} Saradamani—was fascinated by {{traditional}} Hindu folklore and narratives. As {{in the case}} of most girls of rural upbringing, she did not receive any formal education but learned to serve others as she helped her mother run a large household and looked after her younger brothers. During the terrible famine of 1864, Sarada worked ceaselessly as her family served food to hungry people. She was interested in the clay models of goddesses Kali and Lakshmi, which she worshiped regularly. She is said to have started meditating from her childhood and traditional accounts recount her mystic visions and experiences. According to Sarada Devi, she used to see a bevy of eight girls of her age coming from an unknown place and escorting her in her chores during her childhood.|$|E
25|$|Bored with {{monotonous}} Bostonian life, the men {{set sail}} with a Swiss female companion, to {{the settlement of}} Machias, located on the northeastern tip of the Maine frontier. At Machias, Gallatin operated a bartering venture, in which he dealt {{with a variety of}} goods and supplies. He enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>life</b> and the natural environment surrounding him. During the winter of 1780–81, Gallatin served in the defense of his new country and even commanded a garrison in Maine for a time. Gallatin and Serre returned to Boston in October 1781, after abandoning their bartering venture in Machias. Gallatin supported himself by giving French language lessons. Soon afterward, he sent a letter to Mademoiselle Pictet, offering a frank account of the troubles he was having in America. Pictet sensed this would be the case, and she had already contacted Dr. Samuel Cooper, a distinguished Bostonian patriot, whose grandson was a student in Geneva. With Cooper's influence, Gallatin was able to secure a faculty position in July 1782 at Harvard College, where he taught French.|$|E

As soon as people become at all refined they look down upon what is their own as something vulgar. But it is peculiarly so with us.

500|$|As {{a result}} of the relationship, Goldstein {{appeared}} in a 2005 episode of Punk'd, where Richie {{was the subject of a}} practical joke, and that same year he featured in an episode of <b>The</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Life,</b> a reality TV show focusing on Richie and Paris Hilton. Goldstein and Richie announced their engagement in February 2005, but broke up in late 2006. Goldstein was a guest DJ on an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show in May 2006. He was an avid sneakerhead, owning more than 1,000 pairs of sneakers by 2007. This led to him being offered a cameo as himself purchasing a pair in the 2006 TV series Entourage episode [...] "What About Bob?". That same year, Goldstein also began working at Caesars Palace, becoming the resident DJ of their nightclub Pure. He was contracted to the club for the year for $1 million, which was considered to be an unprecedented amount for a DJ at the time. By 2007, he was also being paid between $10,000 and $25,000 per event as a solo DJ. Goldstein scratched on albums for Papa Roach, Will Smith and Babyface. He played at private events for celebrities including Jennifer Lopez, Ben Stiller and Leonardo DiCaprio. Goldstein dated singer Mandy Moore for two months in 2007 and remained close friends with her after separating. Later in 2007, he was romantically involved with model Jessica Stam.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{creating}} a reality series originated in 2006 when Kris Jenner showed an interest in appearing on a television show together with her family. Jenner commented: [...] "Everybody thinks that [...] could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even have to think about. It would be natural." [...] Producer Ryan Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, having the popular family-based show The Osbournes in mind. He hired a camera man to visit the Kardashian's family home to film them having a Sunday barbeque: [...] "They were all together [...] as crazy and as fun as loving as they are," [...] Seacrest described the family after seeing the tape. He later initiated the series by sharing the tape with E!, an American cable network which features mostly entertainment-related programming, and reality television series; the show was eventually picked up. In August 2007, {{it was announced that}} the Kardashian and Jenner families would star in a yet-to-be-titled reality show on E! described as a [...] "new non-scripted family sitcom", being produced by Ryan Seacrest and Bunim/Murray Productions. The series' announcement came one week after Paris Hilton and her friend Nicole Richie announced that their popular E! series, <b>The</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Life,</b> was ending.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to taking songwriting classes, Kesha was also {{taught how to}} write songs by Pebe, and they would often write together when she returned home from high school. Kesha began recording demos which Pebe would give to people she knew. Kesha was also in a band with Lagan. Kesha and Pebe co-wrote the song [...] "Stephen" [...] together when Kesha was 16, Kesha then tracked down David Gamson, a producer that she admired, from Scritti Politti who agreed to produce the song. She {{dropped out of school}} at 17, after being convinced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin to return to Los Angeles to pursue a music career, and earned her GED after. Around this time, Pebe answered an ad by reality series <b>The</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Life,</b> looking for an [...] "eccentric" [...] family to host Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. The episode aired in 2005. Luke and Martin had received one of Kesha's demos from Samantha Cox, senior director of writer/publisher relations at Broadcast Music Incorporated, and were impressed.

Dr. Luke stated in an interview for the story that it was the latter track that caught his attention, saying [...] "when you're listening to 100 CDs, that kind of [...] and chutzpah stand out." ...|$|E
