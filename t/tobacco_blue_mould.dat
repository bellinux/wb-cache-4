40|$|Blue mould [Peronospora hyoscyami f. sp. tabacina (Adam) Skalicky 1964] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} foliar diseases of tobacco that causes significant losses in the Americas, south-eastern Europe and the Middle East. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the mechanisms employed by this oomycete pathogen to colonize its host, with emphasis on molecular aspects of pathogenicity. In addition, key biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in tobacco resistance to blue mould are discussed. Taxonomy: Kingdom: Chromista (Straminipila); Phylum: Heterokontophyta; Class: Oomycete; Order: Peronosporales; Family: Peronosporaceae; Genus: Peronospora; Species: Peronospora hyoscyami f. sp. tabacina. Disease symptoms: The pathogen typically causes localized lesions on tobacco leaves that appear as single, or groups of, yellow spots that often coalesce to form light-brown necrotic areas. Some of the leaves exhibit grey to bluish downy mould on their lower surfaces. Diseased leaves can become twisted, such that the lower surfaces turn upwards. In such cases, the bluish colour of the diseased plants becomes quite conspicuous, especially under moist conditions when sporulation is abundant. Hence the name of the disease: <b>tobacco</b> <b>blue</b> <b>mould.</b> Infection process: The pathogen develops haustoria within plant cells that are thought to establish the transfer of nutrients from the host cell, and may also act in the delivery of effector proteins during infection. Resistance: Several defence responses have been reported to occur in the Nicotiana tabacum-P. hyoscyami f. sp. tabacina interaction. These include the induction of pathogenesis-related genes, and a correlated increase in the activities of typical pathogenesis-related proteins, such as peroxidases, chitinases, ÃŸ- 1, 3 -glucanases and lipoxygenases.

40|$|Bananas, rice, {{tobacco and}} {{vegetables}} {{are some of the}} crops that may benefit from a new concept in plant protection. The revolutionary method for crop disease control uses an 'activator' known as CGA 245705 which has been developed by Ciba-Geigy. This innovative approach, known scientifically as 'systemic activated resistance' (SAR), induces natural resistance when sprayed on a crop. The induced response is comparable to immunisation in humans and livestock. The SAR technique is fundamentally different from other methods of crop protection as it does not act on the disease organisms themselves, but stimulates the plant to activate its own defence mechanisms. The idea is to apply CGA 254704 to trigger plants to produce these defence mechanisms before any likelihood of infection can occur. The product helps protect rice from leaf blast, <b>tobacco</b> from <b>blue</b> <b>mould,</b> bananas from black and yellow sigatoka and some vegetable crops from downy mildew. The efficacy of CGA 245704 varies between plants species. Monocotyledons, such as wheat and rice, can be protected for the whole season with a single application at the seedling stage and trials have shown that rice seedlings can be treated before they are transplanted out in the field. Dicotyledons such as tobacco, and perennial crops such as bananas, have to be sprayed at regular intervals throughout the season. CGA 245704 is at an advanced stage of development. Trials in the UK {{over the last three years}} have shown yield results using SAR at least equivalent to levels using conventional disease control methods. The advantage with SAR however, is that the technique uses much lower doses than conventional fungicides. Applications degrade rapidly and have very short persistence in the environment.

The symptomatology, history and distribution, nomenclature and economic importance of <b>blue</b> <b>mould</b> (Peronospora tabacina) site are discussed. Epidemiology of <b>blue</b> <b>mould</b> was studied with particular reference to the relationship between disease occurrence in tobacco fields, diseased transplants and weather, especially rainfall. Surveys showed that the first appearance of <b>blue</b> <b>mould</b> was not related to a particular plant growth stages or time of year. An increase in the percentage of diseased plants could be related to rain on two of three consecutive days. There was an interval of 2 - 5 weeks from first appearance to maximum percentage of diseased plants, the shorter period occurred when more than 25 % of plants were diseased at the first record. Soil conditions that produced lush growth, combined with weather which favoured sporulation and infection early in the season were the main factors that influenced disease severity. Although the disease could be be destructive on leaves, basal stem infection caused the greatest Ioses. A relationship between benzol vapour concentration in covered seed beds, temperature and wind speed was established. Higher concentrations of benzol vapour were maintained under wet covers than under dry.

Resistance to these pathogens in commercial apple cultivars has not been documented in the literature.

40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>mould</b> {{caused by}} Penicillium expansum {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to loss of marketable fruit during storage. Damage is also aggravated by the prohibition of postharvest fungicides in many countries, and in organic production everywhere. Robust data on levels of resistance to this disease are crucial for further research and for breeding of improved cultivars. Inoculation of fruit with fungal spores and estimation of the diameter of resulting lesions after cold storage demonstrated significant variation among cultivars. In addition, cultivars with high firmness at harvest and little softening, i. e., loss of firmness during storage, had less susceptibility, as also did late-ripening cultivars. In another part of the study, a possible association between lesion diameter and chemical contents in fruit flesh and fruit peel of 23 cultivars was investigated. Content of different quercetins and procyanidin B 2 was positively associated with the level of tolerance. Samples taken after inoculation showed stronger association with the chemical contents than did samples of control fruit, suggesting that disease development had triggered a defence reaction. In a third part of the study, gene regulation in apple fruit after inoculation was evaluated in two relatively resistant and two relatively susceptible cultivars using an AryANE chip covering 60 K apple transcripts. Validation of the most highly up-and down-regulated genes was undertaken using qPCR.
