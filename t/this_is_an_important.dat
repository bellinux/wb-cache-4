5|$|Athens is {{near the}} Blue Ridge Mountains area of North Georgia; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> region in the {{development}} of several varieties of folk music, including the Appalachian bluegrass style and the Piedmont blues. North Georgia's bluegrass heritage {{can be traced back to}} the 19th century, when bluegrass was a nascent style throughout Appalachia and North Georgia was home to major fiddling contests, beginning in the 1880s. A 1983 recording expedition by Art and Margo Rosenbaum documented the continued existence of many forms of folk music, including work songs, string bands, African American hymns and spirituals, banjo tunes and unaccompanied ballads; the collection includes a chapter devoted to Doc and Lucy Barnes of Athens. Athens' modern contributions to the field of bluegrass include the Packway Handle Band and BlueBilly Grit.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue to fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E
5|$|Some animals' colours and {{patterns}} resemble a particular natural background. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling parakeets are mainly green; woodcocks {{of the forest}} floor are brown and speckled; reedbed bitterns are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animal's coloration matches the hues of its habitat. Similarly, desert animals are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the gerbil or fennec fox, birds such as the desert lark or sandgrouse, or reptiles like the skink or horned viper.Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example khaki uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.Many moths show industrial melanism, including the peppered moth which has coloration that blends in with tree bark. The coloration of these insects evolved between 1860 and 1940 to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas. This is taken by zoologists as evidence that camouflage is influenced by natural selection, as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.|$|E

25|$|Proteolytic venom is also dual-purpose: firstly, it is {{used for}} defense and to {{immobilize}} prey, as with neurotoxic venoms; secondly, many of the venom's enzymes have a digestive function, breaking down molecules in prey items, such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> adaptation, as many vipers have inefficient digestive systems.|$|E
25|$|The Station's main {{objective}} is to monitor Greece's seismic activity, record and analyze the earthquakes that occur in 24-hour base, and inform the public when necessary. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> task given that Greece has powerful seismic activity.

25|$|Dimethyl sulfate also methylates adenine in {{single-stranded}} {{portions of}} DNA (e.g., those with proteins like RNA polymerase progressively melting and re-annealing the DNA). Upon re-annealing, these methyl groups interfere with adenine-guanine base-pairing. Nuclease S1 {{can then be}} used to cut the DNA in single-stranded regions (anywhere with a methylated adenine). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> technique for analyzing protein-DNA interactions.|$|E

25|$|Earthquakes {{not caused}} by fault {{movement}} have quite different patterns of energy radiation.
