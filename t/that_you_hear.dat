It contains covers of old hardcore punk and heavy metal bands, including Cryptic Slaughter, Massacre, Kreator, Sepultura, Siege and Discharge. Due to personal problems, Jesse Pintado did not play on either Order of the Leech or Leaders Not Followers: Part 2, and left the band in early 2004. Nevertheless, Pintado stated that he left because he grew tired of Napalm Death and wanted to start something new. The two guitars <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> is Mitch over-dubbing.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like. It's not something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In pouring rain, the Hard Rain {{recordings}} {{for television}} {{and most of}} the live album were made outdoors at Colorado State University's Hughes Stadium in 1976 at Fort Collins, Colorado. The show was [...] "triumphant" [...] and well received, one reviewer calling [...] "Idiot Wind" [...] the [...] "most passionate and emotional live performance" [...] Dylan had ever made. Stoner said, [...] "everybody is playing and singing for their lives, and that is the spirit <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> on that record." [...] Due to low ticket sales, the Rolling Thunder Revue ended two days later in Salt Lake, Wyeth's final concert with Dylan and this band.|$|E

60|$|One thing I {{have enjoyed}} at Munich very much, {{and that has}} been the music. The German band <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> in the square in London while you are trying to compose an essay on the civilising {{influence}} of music, is not the sort of band <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> in Germany. The German bands that come to London are bands that have fled from Germany, in order to save their lives. In Germany, these bands would be slaughtered at the public expense and their bodies given to the poor for sausages. The bands that the Germans keep for themselves are magnificent bands.|$|E
