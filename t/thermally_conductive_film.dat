40|$|Background and aim: Thermal {{discomfort}} often affects prosthesis wearers {{and could}} be addressed by increasing liner thermal conductivity. This note explores a liner made from <b>thermally</b> <b>conductive</b> silicone and two additional alternative liner designs. Technique: <b>Thermally</b> <b>conductive</b> silicone was {{used to create a}} conductive liner and a hybrid liner. Additionally, one with open elements was made. These were compared with a plain silicone liner and a no liner scenario. Scaled down liner prototypes were used due to the high-cost of the <b>thermally</b> <b>conductive</b> silicone.
