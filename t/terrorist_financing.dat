25|$|Regardless of the {{difficulty}} in measurement, {{the amount of money}} laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of <b>terrorist</b> <b>financing</b> in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come from, and <b>terrorist</b> <b>financing</b> relating to where the money is going to).|$|E

The report made recommendations on how to address money laundering and <b>terrorist</b> <b>financing</b> in ways that safeguard personal privacy rights and data protection laws. In the United States, groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have expressed concern that money laundering rules require banks to report on their own customers, essentially conscripting private businesses [...] "into agents of the surveillance state".|$|E

2500|$|The {{financial}} services industry {{has become more}} vocal about the rising costs of anti-money laundering regulation and the limited benefits that they claim it brings. One commentator wrote that [...] "ithout facts, [...] legislation has been driven on rhetoric, driving by ill-guided activism responding {{to the need to}} be [...] "seen to be doing something" [...] rather than by an objective understanding of its effects on predicate crime. The social panic approach is justified by the language used—we talk of the battle against terrorism or the war on drugs". The Economist magazine has become increasingly vocal in its criticism of such regulation, particularly with reference to countering <b>terrorist</b> <b>financing,</b> referring to it as a [...] "costly failure", although it concedes that other efforts (like reducing identity and credit card fraud) may still be effective at combating money laundering.|$|E
