5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international consensus on risk assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification <b>to</b> <b>intermediate</b> risk category.|$|E

5|$|Nico Rosberg {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} on Friday, {{ahead of the}} two Red Bull cars of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. The session started on a very wet track, but with no more rain falling, it dried out as the practice progressed, with drivers soon switching <b>to</b> <b>intermediate</b> tyres. Lewis Hamilton was fifth fastest, behind Carlos Sainz Jr.. Despite going off the track late in the session, Fernando Alonso was ninth fastest in the McLaren with the new power unit. A gearbox problem meant that Pastor Maldonado was unable {{to take to the}} track, while at Sauber, Raffaele Marciello replaced Felipe Nasr, ending the session three-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Marcus Ericsson.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about Silverthrone’s eruptive history. However, as at other calderas, eruptions at Silverthrone are {{explosive}} in nature, involving viscous magma, glowing avalanches of hot volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows. The source magma of this rock is classified as acidic, having high <b>to</b> <b>intermediate</b> levels of silica, as in rhyolite, dacite, and andesite. Andesitic and rhyolitic magma are commonly associated with the two forms of explosive eruptions called Plinian and Peléan eruptions. Silverthrone is considerably younger than its nearest prominent neighbour Franklin Glacier Volcano to the east-southeast.|$|E
5|$|Vettel pitted {{from first}} {{position}} on lap18. Kovalainen, Webber and Massa pitted fourlaps later. Light rain {{began to fall}} on lap26, though only lasted five minutes. Glock, Trulli, Räikkönen and Hamilton completed their first pit stops over the following laps. Coulthard was the first driver to try intermediate wet-weather tyres when he pitted on lap28. He lost grip in the wet and went straight through the first chicane. Alonso, Heidfeld, Kubica and Piquet took their only pit stops for the race soon after, all changing <b>to</b> <b>intermediate</b> tyres. By lap36 {{the majority of the}} field were running on intermediate tyres. Webber was passed at turneight by Massa on lap35. The Australian spun after the corner, though managed to retain seventhposition. A lap later, however, Hamilton outbraked Webber at turnthree and demoted the Red Bull driver to eighth.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key {{is computed by}} using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys <b>to</b> <b>intermediate</b> values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.|$|E

5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit {{stops to}} change <b>to</b> <b>intermediate</b> tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button {{moved up to}} eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the {{following}} lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at the Spoon Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time deficit by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E
5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated <b>to</b> <b>intermediate</b> pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E

5|$|The Trinity is {{a popular}} {{whitewater}} rafting and kayaking river. Dam releases for fish restoration have incidentally increased {{the amount of water}} available for boating year-round. The river has three main whitewater runs, all known for their scenery and wildlife. The Pigeon Point section, alongside Highway 299, contains Class II-III (beginner <b>to</b> <b>intermediate)</b> rapids. Below the takeout at Cedar Flat, the Trinity flows through the extremely hazardous Class V Burnt Ranch Gorge, which was first run in 1971 by three kayakers, one of whom {{died of a heart attack}} soon after finishing the run, due to the arduous work of portaging many rapids. This gave the area a bad reputation for many years; it was not until 1983 when commercial trips began on this section of the river. The lower Trinity, much of which flows through the Hoopa Valley Reservation, is a Class II river with gentler and lower gradient despite having a greater volume of water flow.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied in the early 19th century to metals that floated on water (sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals. Earlier usage in mineralogy, to describe a mineral having a metallic appearance, can be sourced to as early as 1800. Since the mid-20th century {{it has been used}} to refer <b>to</b> <b>intermediate</b> or borderline chemical elements. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) previously recommended abandoning the term metalloid, and suggested using the term semimetal instead. Use of this latter term has more recently been discouraged by Atkins et al. as it has a different meaning in physics—one that more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance rather than the overall classification of an element. The most recent IUPAC publications on nomenclature and terminology do not include any recommendations on the usage of the terms metalloid or semimetal.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} resumed on lap 13 and Button, who had changed <b>to</b> <b>intermediate</b> tyres before the safety car period, {{was given a}} drive-through penalty for {{speeding}} behind the safety car, emerging in 15th place. Vettel began to enlarge his lead over Alonso and Massa in second and third. Alonso and the Mercedes pitted for intermediate tyres, leaving Massa in second and Kobayashi in third by lap 17. Barrichello, who switched for intermediates as the safety car came in, began setting times at the same pace as the leaders, and gained 15th position as the drivers in front changed tyres. On lap 19, a rain storm arrived at the circuit, forcing the drivers on intermediate tyres to switch back to full wets. Alonso and Button, who were in fifth and eighth respectively, fell to ninth and eleventh, while the drivers on the full wet tyres began pitting for fresh wet tyres. The safety car was brought out on lap 20 due to {{the intensity of the}} rain, and Vettel, Webber, Massa and Buemi, who had not changed tyres, went to the pitlane for fresh full wets. After six laps under the safety car, the conditions were getting worse, and the race was suspended.|$|E
