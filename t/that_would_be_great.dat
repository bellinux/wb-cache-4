The remaster cleans and sharpens the sound of tracks, and contains a slightly different track listing. [...] "They'd already sold 60,000 copies of Cheshire Cat, and I thought, 'Man, if I can sell just 10% of that <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> for the label,' {{and of course it}} sold a lot more because they went on to be superstars," [...] said Escalante. In 2001, the label had reportedly sold 300,000 copies of Buddha. [...] "At this point it's not even the money," [...] Secor said at the time. [...] "It's {{the fact that there is}} no mention of my work anywhere; no credit has been given to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in the 2007 playoffs, Selänne became Anaheim's all-time leading playoff scorer when he {{recorded}} his 30th point as a Duck with an assist on April 13 against the Minnesota Wild. The Ducks defeated the Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Detroit Red Wings {{to reach the}} Final; {{it was the first}} time in Selänne's career that he played in the NHL's championship series. As the sentimental favourite to win the Stanley Cup, his teammates motivated themselves to win the title for his benefit; Ducks goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère noted, [...] "We don't have any better teammate. He's a guy who always has fun. He deserves this and if we can help him along the way, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> I'd just love to see Teemu win this thing." [...] Selänne finished the playoffs with 15 points in 21 games, and after 14 NHL seasons, the 36-year-old Selänne raised the Stanley Cup with his teammates after defeating the Ottawa Senators in five games.|$|E
500|$|The group {{wrote and}} {{performed}} children's music {{that was different}} from {{what had been done}} previously; as Cook stated, [...] "we didn't just go down the route of what people think is kids' music". [...] They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook {{was one of the first}} guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. [...] Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, [...] "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> I think it would be really nice if in 15years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [...] Wiggles". [...] In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band [...] "they got into".|$|E

These firms are responsible for shipping large numbers of American information technology jobs to India and other countries." [...] In an interview with Vox he stated his opposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:...a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States...you're doing away {{with the concept of}} a nation-state. [...] What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> for them. I don’t believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have {{to do everything we can}} to create millions of jobs.|$|E
2500|$|In early October 2010, it was {{confirmed}} by the studio that Martin Freeman had officially been cast {{in the role of}} Bilbo Baggins. It was revealed that he had earlier been approached by the producers {{to play a role in}} the films, but was forced to turn it down because of scheduling conflicts with the BBC television series Sherlock. At the time, Freeman was quoted as saying, [...] "f something could be worked out, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> I did it [...] with a heavy heart, definitely." [...] On his casting, Peter Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Despite the various rumours and speculation surrounding this role, there has only ever been one Bilbo Baggins for us. There are a few times in your career when you come across an actor who you know was born to play a role, but that was the case as soon as I met Martin Freeman. He is intelligent, funny, surprising and brave—exactly like Bilbo and I feel incredibly proud to be able to announce that he is our Hobbit." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Bitterglass" [...] {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} songs written for the album, while being one of Grant's {{favourite}} songs it is also seen by him as one of the darker songs on the record, and refers to the events of Jon Lee's suicide although Grant noted that it is also uplifting and gives an optimistic feeling in its chorus, while also giving a hypnotic feel alongside stating that the piano in the verses gives [...] "a kind of haunting melody". Other tracks on the album that did not see a single release such as [...] "Morning Life" [...] was a track Grant wanted to be [...] "very atmospheric", and [...] "something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> when you are driving around in your car", while also wanting it to have a [...] "cinematic intro". Grant later claimed that [...] "Morning Life" [...] was a track many of the band's fans started to [...] "pick up on" [...] after buying the album, and also said [...] "another version is a possibility". [...] "Pilgrim Soul", the eighth track on the album was described by Grant as its most heaviest and said it will appeal to older fans. He said the album needed the track to [...] "give it a lift {{at the end of the}} record" [...] and that the [...] "sing-a-long chorus" [...] is what makes a song work. The chorus was explained as positive and the verses as dark, with the answer to the verses revealed in the chorus.|$|E

[...] Gouvernail said, [...] "Lord, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> shame to you as well as to him." [...] And Sir Tristram said, [...] "Yea, it is great shame."

6000|$|... "Rogers, I'd like to {{have been}} with you. Next time I'll volunteer. You had action--a run for your money. That's what I enlisted for. Standing still--doing nothing but wait--that drives me half mad. My years of {{football}} have made action necessary. Otherwise I go stale in mind and body.... Last night, before you went on that scouting trip, I had been on duty two hours. Near midnight. The shelling had died down. All became quiet. No flares--no flashes anywhere. There was a luminous kind of glow in the sky--moonlight through thin clouds. I had to listen and watch. But I couldn't keep back my thoughts. There I was, a soldier, facing No Man's Land, across whose dark space were the Huns {{we have come to}} regard as devils in brutality, yet less than men.... And I thought of home. No man knows what home really is until he stands that lonely midnight guard. A shipwrecked sailor appreciates the comforts he once had; a desert wanderer, lost and starving, remembers the food he once wasted; a volunteer soldier, facing death in the darkness, thinks of his home! It is a hell of a feeling!... And, thinking of home, I remembered my girl. I've been gone four months--have been at the front seven days (or is it seven years?) and last night in the darkness she came to me. Oh yes! she was there! She seemed reproachful, as she was when she coaxed me not to enlist. My girl was not one of the kind who sends her lover to war and swears she will die an old maid unless he returns. Mine begged me to stay home, or at least wait for the draft. But I wasn't built that way. I enlisted. And last night I felt the bitterness of a soldier's fate. All this beautiful stuff is bunk!... My girl is a peach. She had many admirers, two in particular that made me run my best down the stretch. One is club-footed. He couldn't fight. The other is all yellow. Him she liked best. He had her fooled, the damned slacker.... I wish I could believe I'd get safe back home, with a few Huns to my credit--the Croix de Guerre--and an officer's uniform. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> How I could show up those fellows!... But I'll get killed--as sure as God made little apples I'll get killed--and she will marry {{one of the men who}} would not fight!" ...|$|E

EMI Music/Capitol Records EVP/marketing and promotion Greg Thompson told Billboard that, [...] "if it goes to No. 1, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great,</b> If not, we still have a Katy song on the radio in fourth quarter", presumably boosting sales for Teenage Dream in the Christmas season.
