40|$|Squirrel monkeys, {{initially}} trained under {{a schedule}} of electric shock postponement and then under fixed-interval schedules of electric shock presentation, were studied under multiple fixed-interval fixed-ratio and under fixed-ratio schedules of shock presentation. Under the fixed-interval (10 -min) component of the multiple schedule, a pause {{was followed by a}} gradual increase in responding to a rate maintained until shock presentation; under the fixed-ratio (3 -, 10 -, or 30 -response) component of the multiple schedule, a brief pause was typically followed by a relatively high and uniform rate of responding until shock was presented. When the 60 -sec <b>timeout</b> <b>periods,</b> which usually followed shock presentation, were eliminated from the multiple schedule for one monkey, responding was only transiently affected. In the one monkey studied, responding was maintained under a fixed-ratio schedule alone (with <b>timeout</b> <b>periods),</b> but rates of responding were lower than under the fixed-ratio component of the multiple schedule. Characteristic patterns of responding, similar to those engendered under schedules of food presentation or shock termination, can be maintained under fixed-ratio schedules of shock presentation; further, patterns of responding can be controlled by discriminative stimuli in multiple schedules...|$|R

40|$|Episodic and {{sustained}} increases in {{heart rate and}} mean arterial blood pressure can occur with recurring patterns of schedule-controlled behavior. Most previous studies were conducted under fixed-ratio schedules, which maintained a consistent high rate of responding that alternated with periods of no responding during times when the schedule was not in operation. The present study examined changes in heart rate and blood pressure under fixed-interval schedules which maintained a range of rates that varied from little or no responding {{at the beginning of}} the fixed interval to high rates at the end of the interval. The relations of cardiovascular function to rate of responding were examined. Squirrel monkeys prepared with arterial catheters were trained to respond under fixed-interval schedules of electric-shock presentation. The duration of the interval was varied across sessions and cardiovascular parameters were examined. Local rates of responding were typically near zero during <b>timeout</b> <b>periods,</b> low at the beginning of each fixed-interval cycle, and then increased as the fixed interval progressed. At most schedule durations, arterial blood pressure and heart rate levels were lowest {{at the beginning of the}} interval cycles, increased as the rate of responding increased, and then decreased during the <b>timeout</b> <b>periods.</b> At all parameters studied, there was a direct relationship between changes in response rate within fixed-interval cycles and changes in heart rate and blood pressure.

40|$|A {{token based}} {{algorithm}} for distributed mutual exclusion is presented. It uses a distributed counter to tolerate faults due to site failures and communication failures. This {{eliminates the need}} for expensive election protocols that are commonly employed in existing token-based algorithms. As in many existing fault-tolerant mutual exclusion algorithms, timeouts are used to detect failures. Our algorithm has the unique property that even if <b>timeout</b> <b>periods</b> are incorrectly assumed, the safety requirement of mutual exclusion is still guaranteed. It is, therefore, suitable for highly asynchronous distributed environments. Performance analysis shows that the algorithm is also efficient in terms of the average number of messages required per critical section, and the average time delay to enter the critical section. Finally, we show how to obtain a bounded algorithm from the basic unbounded algorithm...|$|R

50|$|Assignment to a {{particular}} server might {{be based on a}} username, client IP address, or be random. Because of changes of the client's perceived address resulting from DHCP, network address translation, and web proxies this method may be unreliable. Random assignments must be remembered by the load balancer, which creates a burden on storage. If the load balancer is replaced or fails, this information may be lost, and assignments may need to be deleted after a <b>timeout</b> <b>period</b> or during periods of high load to avoid exceeding the space available for the assignment table. The random assignment method also requires that clients maintain some state, which can be a problem, for example when a web browser has disabled storage of cookies. Sophisticated load balancers use multiple persistence techniques to avoid some of the shortcomings of any one method.|$|E

Response rates controlled by food and by brain stimulation were equalized on a multiple schedule by adjusting the stimulating current.

When components were shortened from 10 to 2 minutes, responding maintained by either food or brain stimulation showed a similar temporal pattern of suppression preceding each shock, but responding in the component involving food remained significantly more suppressed. Explanations for the attenuated suppression during brain stimulation based on neural disruption, stimulus blocking, and analgesic properties were questioned.

50|$|A12 Authentication (Access Authentication for 1xEV-DO) is a CHAP-based {{mechanism}} {{used by a}} CDMA2000 Access Network (AN) {{to authenticate}} a 1xEV-DO Access Terminal (AT). A12 authentication occurs when an AT first attempts to access the AN and is repeated after some authentication <b>timeout</b> <b>period.</b> The element in the AN that performs this authentication is the Radio Network Controller (RNC) using its Access Network AAA (AN-AAA). In order to support A12 authentication, matching A12 credentials (i.e., an A12 Network Address Identifier (NAI) and A12 CHAP key) must be provisioned into the AT and the userâs home AAA server. Since these credentials are only shared between the AT and its home AAA, the AN-AAA forwards A12 challenge responses received from an AT to its home AAA {{to determine whether they}} are correct. A12 authentication is separate from packet data authentication that may occur later when a data session is being established.|$|E
50|$|Finally fault {{tolerance}} {{among members of}} the distribution tree is accomplished through the use of timeouts and keepalives with actual data transmissions doubling as keepalives to minimize traffic. If a child node does not hear from its parent for a while, it routes a new subscribe message toward the root node of the tree, reattaching itself wherever it bumps into the tree for that topic. If a parent doesn't hear from a child for a <b>timeout</b> <b>period,</b> it drops the child from its list of children. (If this action causes its child list to become empty, the parent stops acting as a forwarder altogether.) The only remaining failure point is that of the root node, and Pastry itself automatically overcomes this. Because Pastry duplicates keys among the few nodes closest to the key's actual value, the root node already has mirrors set up, lying dormant. If the root node goes offline, again detected through timeouts, the next-closest Pastry node will begin acting as the root node. When the creator of the topic tries to publish new material the old root node will be unreachable. The publisher will then fall back on the Pastry network and use it to route its publish message to the new root node. Once this has been done, the publisher caches a copy of the new root node's IP address to reduce the use of the Pastry network for future transmissions.|$|E

Heterogeneous interactions can be abstractly represented by client-service, publish-subscribe and tuple space middleware connectors that are interconnected via bridging mechanisms providing interoperability among the services. In this paper, we {{make use of the}} eXtensible Service Bus (XSB), proposed in the CHOReOS project as the connector enabling interoperability among heterogeneous choreography participants. XSB models transactions among peers through generic post and get operations that represent peer behavior with varying time/space coupling.

By precisely studying the related timing thresholds using timed automata models, we verify conditions for successful transactions with XSB connectors. Furthermore, we statistically analyze through simulations, the effect of varying lease and <b>timeout</b> <b>periods</b> to ensure higher probabilities of successful transactions.

Current codes typically require a maximum 30 -minute timeout or delay following the last detected occupancy before switching lights off.
