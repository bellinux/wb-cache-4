5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and focuses on naval battles during the Battle of Midway, which is initiated {{in response to the}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. The player commands three American task forces; two United States Navy forces and one United States Air Force unit, which are stationed on Midway Atoll. The objective of the game is to defeat three attacking Imperial Japanese naval forces. Each American task force has an aircraft carrier, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>have</b> four. The player begins the game with two American search aircraft used to locate and track the attacking Japanese forces.|$|E

5|$|Wewak was {{captured}} on 10 May 1945, and the 16th Brigade began pursuing <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> defenders that <b>had</b> withdrawn inland. They continued until 11 August, when offensive operations ceased after word was received that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>had</b> entered into ceasefire talks. The battalion {{was in the}} Mount Shiburangu area on 15 August when news came that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>had</b> surrendered following <b>the</b> atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The battalion's losses during its final campaign were 51 killed and 76 wounded.|$|R
2500|$|The {{decisive factor}} was <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> lack of supplies. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> 31st Division <b>had</b> begun the {{operation}} {{with only three}} weeks' supply of food. Once these supplies were exhausted, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>had</b> to exist on meagre captured stocks and what they could forage in increasingly hostile local villages. (Shortly before the siege of Kohima began, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>had</b> captured a huge warehouse in Naga Village with enough rice to feed the division [...] "for three years", but it was immediately bombed and the stock of rice was destroyed.) The British 23rd LRP Brigade, which had been operating behind <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> division, cut <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> supply lines and prevented them foraging in the Naga Hills {{to the east of}} Kohima. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>had</b> mounted two resupply missions, using captured jeeps to carry supplies forward from the Chindwin to 31st Division, but they brought mainly artillery and anti-tank ammunition, rather than food.|$|R

500|$|Although the United States and Japan {{have been}} strong allies {{since the end}} of World War II, the {{accident}} involving Ehime Maru showed that the relationship is not always completely harmonious, especially with regard to incidents in which U.S. military personnel or assets injure or kill Japanese citizens or damage their property. In response to crimes committed by U.S. servicemembers against Japanese citizens, such as the 1995 Okinawan rape incident, Japanese citizens and some Japanese government officials have questioned the equality of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and the issue of responsibility and accountability by the U.S. government concerning the actions of its military members in Japan. [...] In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>have</b> questioned the U.S. commitment to safe operations of its military assets in light of several accidents, including aircraft crashes and other ship collisions that have injured or killed Japanese citizens.|$|E
500|$|Bond is {{introduced}} to Tanaka—and to the Japanese lifestyle—by an Australian intelligence officer, Dikko Henderson. When Bond raises {{the purpose of}} his mission with Tanaka, it transpires that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>have</b> already penetrated the British information source and Bond has nothing left to bargain with. Instead, Tanaka asks Bond to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, who operates a politically embarrassing [...] "Garden of Death" [...] in an ancient castle; people flock there to commit suicide. After examining photos of Shatterhand and his wife, Bond discovers that [...] "Shatterhand" [...] {{and his wife are}} Tracy's murderers, Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Irma Bunt. Bond gladly takes the mission, keeping his knowledge of Blofeld's identity a secret so that he can exact revenge for his wife's death. Made up and trained by Tanaka, and aided by former Japanese film star Kissy Suzuki, Bond attempts to live and think as a mute Japanese coal miner in order to penetrate Shatterhand's castle. Tanaka renames Bond [...] "Taro Todoroki" [...] for the mission.|$|E

50|$|The {{wreck of}} a {{submarine}} {{can be seen}} off the beach during low tide. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>had</b> examined this submarine and stated {{that it did not}} belong to them. However, a subsequent underwater study by German divers reported that it belonged to <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> <b>having</b> wrecked when <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> intended to destroy the strategically important Panama Canal in 1942. It was conjectured that the submarine was abandoned by its crew due to technical problems and the crew had taken refuge on the island.|$|R
50|$|These {{losses to}} <b>the</b> already outnumbered <b>Japanese</b> {{fleet air arm}} were irreplaceable. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>had</b> spent <b>the</b> {{better part of a}} year reconstituting their carrier air groups, and the American Fast Carrier Task Force had {{destroyed}} 90% of it in two days. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>had</b> only enough pilots left to form the air group for one of their light carriers. As a consequence, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, four months later, their carriers were used merely as decoys.|$|R
500|$|For the Australians, the Battle of Isurava has {{sometimes}} been described as [...] "Australia's Thermopylae". The battle has come to form {{a key part of}} the Anzac legend with Kingsbury's actions, as well as numerous other acts of bravery from both Japanese and Australian troops, being highlighted in various accounts of the fighting which have been characterised as part of an epic battle of national survival. In the early post-war years, the efforts of the Australian force in holding up the Japanese for a period of four days were seen as representing a significant feat of arms, fought against a greatly superior force on which the Australians inflicted heavy casualties in a tactically successfully action which delayed the Japanese and allowed the Australians time with which to bring up further reinforcements. While elements of this narrative continue to resonate, recently the magnitude of Japanese losses has been re-evaluated and this analysis has been called into question. As wider strategic goals of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>have</b> been re-cast, and the number of Japanese engaged in the battle has been found to be significantly less than the Australians had thought at the time, the performance of the Australian defenders, and the decisions of their commanders, have also been re-evaluated. Indeed, author Peter Williams, as part of his thesis about the myths of the Kokoda Track campaign, has described the battle as a [...] "defeat with few redeeming features", going on to state that [...] "Horii defeated Maroubra Force but failed to destroy it".|$|E
500|$|One {{significant}} {{achievement for}} the resistance in Visayas was {{the capture of}} the [...] "Koga Papers" [...] by Cebuano guerrillas led by Lt. Col. James M. Cushing in March 1944. Named after Admiral Mineichi Koga, these papers contained vital battle plans and defensive strategies of the Japanese Navy codenamed the [...] "Z Plan", information on the overall strength of the Japanese fleet and naval air units, and most importantly that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>have</b> already deduced MacArthur's initial plans to invade the Philippines through Mindanao. These papers came into the possession of the Filipino guerrillas when the seaplane of Admiral Koga, which was en route to Davao, crashed into the coast San Fernando, Cebu, killing Koga and many others. After Koga's body and many surviving Japanese were washed ashore, the guerrillas found them and captured 12 high-ranking officers including Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukodome. The papers were inside a briefcase which was fished {{out of the sea}} by Cebuano fishermen before being handed down to the guerrillas. The Japanese ruthlessly hunted down the documents and their captured officers; burning villages and detaining civilians in their search. The guerrillas were ultimately forced to release their captives in order to stop the aggression, but unknown to the Japanese Cushing managed to request for a submarine to take the documents to Allied headquarters in Australia. The discovery of the papers allowed MacArthur to move his invasion from Mindanao to Leyte and also aided the Allies in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.|$|E
