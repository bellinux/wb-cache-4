2500|$|... "Berlin", set {{later in}} the season, {{features}} Tony and Ziva departing for Germany to track down Ilan Bodnar, her father's killer. Before the episode aired, Glasberg disclosed that they would share a slow dance while there, resulting in [...] "a very personal moment of vulnerability where her guard goes down and she lets herself melt into his arms". De Pablo added, [...] "You also see [...] as a man Teddy Bear — like, a very sweet but manly man, a guy who's really {{taking care of a}} situation and really wants to make it better, a guy who's not looking for the joke or is uncomfortable staring at a woman or reaching out to hold her hand." [...] This is highlighted in the closing scenes as the two of them drive home from the airport, and Ziva explains her animosity towards Orli Elbaz (Marina Sirtis), the new director of Mossad: Elbaz was the reason her parents split up. She tells Tony, [...] "If it were not for Orli, things would be different. I would be a different person." [...] Tony then <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> and Ziva intertwines their fingers together. Tony replies, [...] "Then I should catch her before she leaves, you know, and thank her." [...] The episode ends with a cliffhanger when an unknown vehicle crashes into them, leaving their fates unknown.|$|E
