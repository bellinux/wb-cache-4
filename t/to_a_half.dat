5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} {{the abandonment of}} villages from the bubonic plague of 1348, the Black Death, which killed a third <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the Breckland of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as Leicestershire were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in Gloucestershire can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air.|$|E
5|$|About a third <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} {{occurs in}} 4.6–8.0 per 1000 {{people with diabetes}} annually. Rates among those with type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E

5|$|Following White's retirement, the Oak Room {{continued}} to operate under Reid, albeit {{with a new}} menu where the prices were reduced by between a third <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> The majority of the staff remained with Reid, with Jeff Galvin installed as the new head chef, until he left to run the restaurant L'Escargot in May 2000. MPW Criterion was wound up on 11 September 2001; by which time planning was already underway to close the Oak Room, which took place on 15 February 2002. By this time, there were 15 other kitchen staff, and a further 15 front of house staff. There was some added difficulty for calculating the redundancy packages for the staff since {{none of them had}} written contracts, and were only calculated from the period when the restaurant was owned by the MPW Criterion company; this reduced Reid's total service from nine years to four.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult {{survival}} probability, and an unusually long lifespan {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey for the big cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles can also be a threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1938, Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley {{named the}} 37-year-old Hartnett as the team's player-manager, {{replacing}} Charlie Grimm. When Hartnett {{took over as}} manager, the Cubs had been in third place, six games behind the first place Pittsburgh Pirates led by Pie Traynor. By September 27, with one week left in the season, the Cubs had battled back to within a game and a half game of the Pirates in the National League standings as the two teams met for a crucial three-game series. The Cubs won {{the first game of}} the series with a 2 to 1 victory by Cubs pitcher Dizzy Dean, cutting the Pirates' lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> game and setting the stage for one of baseball's most memorable moments.|$|E

5|$|The Great Famine of 1315 began {{a number}} of acute crises in the English agrarian economy. The famine centred on a {{sequence}} of harvest failures in 1315, 1316 and 1321, combined with an outbreak of murrain, a sickness amongst sheep and oxen in 1319–21 and the fatal ergotism, a fungus amongst the remaining stocks of wheat. Many {{people died in the}} ensuing famine, and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses, dogs and cats as well as conducted cannibalism against children, although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations. Poaching and encroachment on the royal forests surged, sometimes on a mass scale. Sheep and cattle numbers fell by up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> significantly reducing the availability of wool and meat, and food prices almost doubled, with grain prices particularly inflated. Food prices remained at similar levels for the next decade. Salt prices also increased sharply due to the wet weather.|$|E

25|$|Setting a {{fixed value}} for the Stelo meant that, as of a certain date, its {{purchasing}} power would thereafter remain the same {{and would not be}} subject to inflation.

25|$|King Sebastian of Portugal, {{enacting}} a law on June 18, 1571, had {{an important}} role in censorship legislation defining the civil penalties for Index infractors. He defined a fine of from a fourth <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of the infractors' legal possessions, plus the penalty of exile in Brazil or an African colony. Death sentences were also not uncommon. Apprehended books were burned and burnings were supervised by clerics.|$|E

25|$|As mentioned, one {{variant of}} SPI uses single {{bidirectional}} data line (slave out/slave in, called SISO) {{instead of two}} unidirectional ones (MOSI and MISO). This variant is restricted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> duplex mode. It tends {{to be used for}} lower performance parts, such as small EEPROMs used only during system startup and certain sensors, and Microwire. Few SPI master controllers support this mode; although it can often be easily bit-banged in software.|$|E
25|$|Semester: Half a lunar year. Eclipses {{will repeat}} exactly one {{semester}} apart at alternating nodes in a cycle that lasts for 8 eclipses. Because it is close <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> integer of anomalistic, draconic months, and tropical years, each solar eclipse will alternate between hemispheres each semester, {{as well as}} alternate between total and annular. Hence {{there can be a}} maximum of one total or annular eclipse each in a given year.|$|E

25|$|Plague of Justinian, from 541 to 750, was {{the first}} {{recorded}} outbreak of the bubonic plague. It started in Egypt, and reached Constantinople the following spring, killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler Procopius) 10,000 a day at its height, and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. The plague went on to eliminate a quarter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of the human population that it struck throughout the known world. It caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between 550 and 700.|$|E
25|$|In late 2016 {{and early}} 2017, some {{significant}} steps {{were taken by}} Edward Lampert, president, chief executive officer and top shareholder of Sears Holding Corp.

25|$|Later, Bernadotte {{claimed to}} have fought 12,000 or more Prussians, while Soult {{estimated}} there were between 5,000 and 6,000 enemies. Petre, who gives no casualty figures, suggested that the Prussians had only about 2,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry available, in addition <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> battery of horse artillery, plus regimental guns. Since a Prussian horse battery comprised six 6-pound guns and two 7-pound howitzers, Yorck's half-battery must have had four guns. Gunther E. Rothenberg states that the fusilier battalions did not use regimental guns in 1806.|$|E
