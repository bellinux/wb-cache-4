50|$|The first method, stand {{hunting is}} the most common method in wooded terrain. This is done by waiting where deer are likely to <b>travel.</b> <b>Stand</b> hunting is {{commonly}} done in an elevated tree stand, but it can be done in a blind on the ground. Hunting blinds allow more cover for the hunter thereby masking the hunter's movement and blocking the hunter's scent from contaminating the air and alerting the deer. Tree stands are usually placed 8 to 30 feet above the ground. Climbing tree stands are also used for the benefit of portability. The stands are made of metal or wood. Stands are often placed at the edge of fields of crops such as corn, wheat, buckwheat, alfalfa, clover, soybeans, cotton and many others. Often, hunters plant crops in strategic locations solely for the purpose of attracting deer. Food plots are very effective while hunting deer because deer spend the majority of their time eating getting the nutrients and the fats that they need to survive the winter. Without good feeding ground the deer will travel for miles if needed to find good feeding sources, this is why planting food plots is effective. Food plots keep the deer close by and improves the chances of harvesting quality deer. Some states allow bait to be placed near these stands to attract deer. Bait stands are legally distinct from planting food crops. The most common bait is corn. Another method of drawing deer within range of a stand is to use scents and decoys to draw bucks into range for a successful shot. This can be very effective during the rut, which is the deer breading season. Hunters use doe in estrus scent to pique a buck's interest and decoys to fix the visual interest of the buck away from the hunter, who is often concealed in a blind or tree stand. Bow hunters often rely heavily on scents to draw deer into the close ranges required for a successful hunt.|$|R

40|$|The {{service sector}} is not {{traditionally}} {{seen as an}} emission intensive sector with a great environmental impact. The service sector is, however, economically a large and fast-growing sector and consequently the absolute emissions will grow. Even though a shift to a more service-oriented economy decreases the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity per unit GDP it does not in itself imply that the GHG emissions would decrease in absolute terms. To improve the environmental performance of service oriented companies, the negative environmental impacts must be identified and measured. A framework mentioned in several guidelines for studying the environmental impact, is the life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. Based on the LCA framework, a methodology called carbon footprinting has been developed to assess the environmental impact. The carbon footprint methodology is broadly used by companies and organisations to examine and understand the GHG emissions occurring from products, services and processes. The overall objective {{of the study is}} to get an overview of the environmental impact of service oriented companies, focusing on climate change. The aim is to find the relevant components for calculating the carbon footprint of a service oriented company and determine which activities and variables that stand for most of the emissions. The methodology used in this study is the life cycle assessment (LCA). Two applications of the methodology; input-output LCA (IO-LCA) and hybrid LCA, have been applied. The assessment follows the GHG protocol for boundary definition and guidelines. A case study was performed on one digital service creation company located in Helsinki, Finland. The included environmental impacts are limited to climate change and CO 2 equivalents, which is the definition and unit of carbon footprint in this study. The study compares three different LCA models and analyses the difference between national and international models. Additionally, the relationship between costs and emissions are analysed. Previous research suggests that the service sector should focus on office premises and business travel as these in general are perceived to cause most of the emissions. This study, however, shows that such generalisation cannot be made for service oriented companies as they represent a large variety of businesses. The three different models gave surprisingly similar results, mostly due to modest sized office premises and lack of detailed process information for the hybrid LCA. In the case study company business <b>travel</b> <b>stands</b> for most of the emissions (29 %). Commuting does not cause significant emissions and the remaining categories have similar magnitudes of emissions. The total emissions are approximately 1 400 tCO 2 eq. Compared to previous studies the studied company’s emissions are lower than average. No direct correlation between costs and emissions was found...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} perceived travel possibilities (or subjective choice-sets, consideration-sets) of car {{and train}} travellers {{on the main}} corridors {{to the city of}} Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and associations with traveller and trip characteristics. We conducted secondary analysis on a survey sample consisting of 7950 train and 19, 232 car travellers. Forty-five percent of train travellers had a car in their objective choice-set, 27 % of them would however never use it for this trip. Trip destination city centre, trip purpose, paying for the trip, public transport commitment, traffic congestion and parking problems were associated with consideration of car as alternative. Forty-two percent of car travellers had public transport in their subjective choice-set. The ratio between perceived public transport and objective car <b>travel</b> time <b>stood</b> out as determinant of consideration-sets, next to destination city centre, trip purpose, travel time and private versus company car ownership. On average, car travellers' perceptions of public transport travel time exceeded objective values by 46 %. We estimated that if perceptions would be more accurate, two out of three car travellers that currently do not see public transport as an alternative would include it in their choice-set, and use it from time to time. This effect has strong theoretical and policy implications. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
