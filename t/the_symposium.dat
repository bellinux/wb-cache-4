5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes.

According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>symposium</b> in the Macedonian {{and wider}} Greek realm was a banquet for the nobility and privileged class, an {{occasion}} for feasting, drinking, entertainment, and sometimes philosophical discussion. The hetairoi, leading members of the Macedonian aristocracy, were expected to attend such feasts with their king. They were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for the acquisition of game meat {{as well as for}} sport.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of ArchelausI in the 5th century BC, the ancient Macedonian elite was {{importing}} customs and artistic traditions from other regions of Greece while retaining more archaic, perhaps Homeric, funerary rites connected with <b>the</b> <b>symposium</b> that were typified by items such as the decorative metal kraters that held the ashes of deceased Macedonian nobility in their tombs. Among these is the large bronze Derveni Krater from a 4th-centuryBC tomb of Thessaloniki, decorated with scenes of the Greek god Dionysus and his entourage and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career. Macedonian metalwork usually followed Athenian styles of vase shapes from the 6thcenturyBC onward, with drinking vessels, jewellery, containers, crowns, diadems, and coins among the many metal objects found in Macedonian tombs.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> LaFontaine-Baldwin <b>Symposium</b> is a Canadian forum {{created through}} the joint effort of John Ralston Saul and the Dominion Institute.

5|$|The ANC {{decided to}} send Mandela as a {{delegate}} to the February 1962 meeting of the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Leaving South Africa in secret via Bechuanaland, on his way Mandela visited Tanganyika and met with its president, Julius Nyerere. Arriving in Ethiopia, Mandela met with Emperor Haile Selassie I, and gave his speech after Selassie's at the conference. After <b>the</b> <b>symposium,</b> he travelled to Cairo, Egypt, admiring the political reforms of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{and then went to}} Tunis, Tunisia, where President Habib Bourguiba gave him £5,000 for weaponry. He proceeded to Morocco, Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal, receiving funds from Liberian President William Tubman and Guinean President Ahmed Sékou Touré. Leaving Africa for London, England, he met anti-apartheid activists, reporters, and prominent politicians. Returning to Ethiopia, he began a six-month course in guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being recalled to South Africa by the ANC's leadership.|$|E
25|$|Two other {{important}} dialogues, <b>the</b> <b>Symposium</b> and the Phaedrus, {{are linked to}} the main storyline by characters. In the Apology (19b, c), Socrates says Aristophanes slandered him in a comic play, and blames him for causing his bad reputation, and ultimately, his death. In <b>the</b> <b>Symposium,</b> the two of them are drinking together with other friends. The character Phaedrus is linked to the main story line by character (Phaedrus is also a participant in <b>the</b> <b>Symposium</b> and the Protagoras) and by theme (the philosopher as divine emissary, etc.) The Protagoras is also strongly linked to <b>the</b> <b>Symposium</b> by characters: all of the formal speakers at <b>the</b> <b>Symposium</b> (with the exception of Aristophanes) are present at the home of Callias in that dialogue. Charmides and his guardian Critias are present for the discussion in the Protagoras. Examples of characters crossing between dialogues can be further multiplied. The Protagoras contains the largest gathering of Socratic associates.|$|E

The analysis revealed the dominant failure characteristics to be the individual initiation and growth behaviour of many minor cracks in Stage I, and their subsequent coalescence in Stage II. Increasing the strain range increases the number of minor cracks and promotes the process of minor crack coalescence.

25|$|One critic, James Arieti, {{considers}} that <b>the</b> <b>Symposium</b> resembles a drama, with emotional and dramatic events occurring especially when Alcibiades crashes the banquet. Arieti {{suggests that it}} should be studied more as a drama, with a focus on character and actions, and less as an exploration of philosophical ideas. This suggests that the characters speak, as in a play, not as the author, but as themselves. This theory, Arieti has found, reveals how much each of the speakers of <b>the</b> <b>Symposium</b> resembles the god, Eros, that they each are describing. It may be Plato’s point to suggest that when humankind talks about god, they are drawn towards creating that god in their own image.|$|E
