25|$|Anne Catherine Emmerich {{said that}} as a child she had visions in which she talked with Jesus, saw the souls in Purgatory and {{witnessed}} {{the core of the}} Holy Trinity in the form of three concentric interpenetrating full spheres. The largest but dimmest of the spheres represented the Father core, the medium sphere the Son core and the smallest and brightest sphere the Holy Spirit core. Each sphere of omnipresent God is extended toward infinity beyond God's core placed in heaven. The Brentano compilation tells that during an illness in Emmerich's childhood, she was visited by a child (suggested as being Jesus), who <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> plants she should ingest in order to heal; among these was morning glory, a plant containing LSA, a weaker analog of LSD, which can induce visions of phosphenes and cause delusions or hallucinations.|$|E

500|$|Duane L. Weber was a World War II Army {{veteran who}} served time {{in at least}} six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for {{burglary}} and forgery.

Afterwards, Johnson stayed with the Thrales for 17 years until Henry's death in 1781, sometimes staying in rooms at Thrale's Anchor Brewery in Southwark. Hester Thrale's documentation of Johnson's life during this time, in her correspondence and her diary (Thraliana), became an important source of biographical information on Johnson after his death. Oliver Goldsmith <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> one illness that Johnson had [...] "he owed his recovery to her attention".

500|$|Macdonald's {{speech was}} seen as a {{personal}} triumph, but it did little to salvage the fortunes of his government. With eroding support both in the Commons and among the public, Macdonald went to the Governor General, Lord Dufferin on 5 November and resigned; Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the second Prime Minister of Canada. Following the resignation, Macdonald returned home and told his wife Agnes, [...] "Well, that's got along with", and when asked what he meant, <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> his resignation, and stated, [...] "It's a relief to be out of it." [...] He is not known to have spoken of the events of the Pacific Scandal again.

Harlan had even written to Goebbels volunteering for military service in order to avoid making the film.

According to Harlan, Goebbels screamed at him, [...] "I can crush you like a bug on the wall!" [...] When Harlan asked Riefenstahl to intercede for him with Goebbels, she demurred citing her own conflicts with the propaganda minister. Instead of intervening on his behalf, Riefenstahl advised Harlan to move to Switzerland; however, Harlan expressed fear for his life and the impact it would have on his wife.|$|E
500|$|Seacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, {{where she}} asked for a bed for the night, because she {{intended}} to travel to Balaclava {{the next day to}} join her business partner.

A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently [...] "saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava," [...] but no further meetings are recorded in the text.|$|E

May asked her mother to contact American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did; American Airlines was already aware of the hijacking.

She reported that the passengers, including the pilots, had been moved to the back of the cabin and that the hijackers were unaware of her call. A minute into the conversation, the call was cut off. Theodore Olson contacted the command center at the Department of Justice, and tried unsuccessfully to contact Attorney General John Ashcroft. About five minutes later, Barbara Olson called again, told her husband that the [...] "pilot" [...] (possibly Hanjour on the cabin intercom) had announced the flight was hijacked, and asked, [...] "What do I tell the pilot to do?" [...] Ted Olson asked her location and she reported the plane was flying low over a residential area. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>of</b> the attacks on the World Trade Center.
