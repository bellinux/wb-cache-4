50|$|Medieval Christians read Virgils poem as a prophecy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ. <b>The</b> Augustan Age, {{although}} pre-Christian, {{was viewed}} as a golden age preparing <b>the</b> world for <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> Christ. <b>The</b> great poets <b>of</b> this age were viewed as a source of revelation and light upon the Christian mysteries to come.|$|R

5|$|At first, Prester John was {{imagined}} {{to reside}} in India; tales of the Nestorian Christians' evangelistic success there and of Thomas the Apostle's subcontinental travels as documented in works like the Acts of Thomas probably provided the first seeds of the legend. After <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mongols to the Western world, accounts placed the king in Central Asia, and eventually Portuguese explorers convinced themselves that they had found him in Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginning}} of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Western Railway and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses. During that period, the town grew rapidly as a manufacturing centre.|$|E
5|$|After the Gadsden Purchase, {{southern}} Arizona's social elite, {{including the}} Estevan Ochoa, Mariano Samaniego, and Leopoldo Carillo families, remained primarily Mexican American until <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railroad in the 1880s. When the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company opened silver mines in southern Arizona, {{it sought to}} employ educated, middle-class Americans who shared a work ethic and leadership abilities to operate the mines. A biographical analysis of some 200 of its employees, classed as capitalists, managers, laborers, and general service personnel, reveals that the resulting work force included Europeans, Americans, Mexicans, and Indians. This mixture failed to stabilize the remote area, which lacked formal social, political, and economic organization in the years from the Gadsden Purchase to the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{built the}} Willow Run Expressway to carry workers from Detroit {{to the defense}} plants at Willow Run Airport. This {{expressway}} was numbered {{as a part of}} US112 initially. During the 1950s, additional highways were converted to freeways before <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Interstate Highway System in 1957. The first highway renumbered as an Interstate was US24A in the southeastern corner of the state, which became part of Interstate 75 (I-75) in 1959.|$|E
5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, {{and there were a}} number of mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners who worked in the difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. <b>The</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E
5|$|For {{the shot}} of the levitating truck, which {{was used in the}} film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena brought on by <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E

5|$|Frances died in 1986, and Elsie in 1988. Prints {{of their}} {{photographs}} of the fairies, {{along with a few}} other items including a first edition of Doyle's book <b>The</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fairies, were sold at auction in London for £21,620 in 1998. That same year, Geoffrey Crawley sold his Cottingley Fairy material to the National Museum of Film, Photography and Television in Bradford (now the National Science and Media Museum), where it is on display. The collection included prints of the photographs, two of the cameras used by the girls, watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie, and a nine-page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Morales {{appeared}} in the miniseries Spider-Men, in which he encounters the Spider-Man of the mainstream Marvel universe. In June 2013, the character {{appeared in}} the climax of Age of Ultron #10, which was also written by Brian Michael Bendis. Though mostly set in the mainstream Marvel universe, or Earth-616 {{as it is known}} in dialogue, the story depicts major changes to the space-time continuum {{as a result of the}} time travel on the part of characters, resulting in Miles witnessing <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainstream Marvel Galactus, an entity that consumes planets, to Earth.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Francesca Tinti {{has arrived}} at a {{different}} conclusion, arguing instead that Hemming's work, {{more so than the}} Liber Wigorniensis, came to serve very real needs, and that these specifically concerned the monastic community at Worcester. Although the Prefatio is silent about monks, the Enucleatio is explicit that Bishop Wulfstan had commissioned the work to defend the estates assigned for the sustenance of the monks (ad victum monachorum). She relates these concerns to the rapid growth of the community during Bishop Wulfstan's episcopate {{in the second half of}} the 11th century. <b>The</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman newcomer, Samson, who had been involved in the dissolution of Westbury-on-Trym, would have given the enlarged community a particular incentive to safeguard its property and rights.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} pieces is a large dish weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the Last Supper.

Made by London goldsmith Henry Greenway in 1664 for the Duke of York and later acquired by CharlesII, it stands on the high altar during the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian cuisine {{consists}} of foods from or commonly eaten by Palestinians—which includes {{those living in}} Palestine, Israel, Jordan, refugee camps in nearby countries {{as well as by}} the Palestinian diaspora. The cuisine is a diffusion of the cultures of civilizations that settled in the region of Palestine, particularly during and after the Islamic era beginning with the Arab Ummayad conquest, then the eventual Persian-influenced Abbasids and ending with the strong influences of Turkish cuisine, resulting from <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Turks. It is similar to other Levantine cuisines, including Lebanese, Syrian and Jordanian.|$|E
5|$|The 5th century saw the {{withdrawal}} of Imperial Roman support from Britain, and the succeeding centuries, the Dark Ages, witnessed {{the emergence of a}} national identity and of kingdoms. The area which would become the Rhondda lay within Glywysing, an area that incorporated the modern area of Glamorgan, ruled by a dynasty founded by Glywys. This dynasty was later replaced by another founded by Meurig ap Tewdrig whose descendant Morgan ap Owain would give Glamorgan its Welsh name Morgannwg. With <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman overlords after the 1066 Battle of Hastings, south-east Wales was divided into five cantrefi. The Rhondda lay within Penychen, a narrow strip running between modern day Glyn Neath and the coast between Cardiff and Aberthaw. Each cantref was further divided into commotes, with Penychen made up of five such commotes, one being Glynrhondda.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Western Canal ran between Taunton in Somerset and Tiverton in Devon in the United Kingdom. The canal had {{its origins}} in various plans, going back to 1796, to link the Bristol Channel and the English Channel by a canal, {{bypassing}} Lands End. An additional purpose of the canal was the supply of limestone and coal to lime kilns along with {{the removal of the}} resulting quicklime, which was used as a fertiliser and for building houses. This intended canal-link was never completed as planned, as <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railways removed the need for its existence.|$|E
5|$|The Sleaford Navigation was a 12.5 mile (20.1km) {{canalisation}} of the River Slea in Lincolnshire, England, {{which opened}} in 1794. It ran from a junction with the River Witham, near Chapel Hill {{to the town of}} Sleaford through seven locks, most of which were adjacent to mills. Lack of finance meant that it stopped short of its intended terminus, but it gradually grew to be successful financially. <b>The</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railways in 1857 led to a rapid decline, and it was officially abandoned by an act of Parliament in 1878, but remained open for a further three years. The lower part of it remained navigable until the 1940s, when it was blocked by a sluice.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshire Dales Railway to Threshfield in 1902 {{opened up}} Hebden as a {{destination}} for day visitors and holiday makers.

It passed into private hands in 1960, and continued as a holiday centre until 1990, mainly catering for school parties. It was demolished in 2016 and replaced with a private residence.|$|E
