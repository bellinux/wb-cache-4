30|$|The {{different}} {{characteristics of}} a reservoir seepage field in the high water cut period are taken into consideration, and the different adjustment measures are put forward {{with the objective of}} flow field balance. For the ineffective water circulation area, we closed the water wells or converted the development to reduce the flow intensity in the region. For the non-producing reserves area, we expanded the fluid sweep region through increasing the number of wells. We maintain <b>the</b> current displacement <b>speed</b> development in <b>the</b> low <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> low potential area. By improving <b>the</b> displacement <b>speed</b> properly, <b>the</b> low <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> high potential area can be maintained with efficient development. For <b>the</b> high <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> low potential area, it is necessary to reduce <b>the</b> displacement <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> maintain economic and effective development {{in the case of the}} formation of a predominant percolation channel. A stable and effective flow field can be formed by reducing <b>the</b> displacement <b>speed</b> properly in <b>the</b> high <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> high potential area. Through the above adjustment method, the aim of balancing the flow field and improving the development effect is achieved.|$|R

The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E

5|$|The first {{motorised}} snowplows {{were developed}} in 1913, based on truck and tractor bodies. These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labor required for snow removal and increasing <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> efficiency of the process. The expansion of the aviation industry also acted {{as a catalyst for}} the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected snow fences around airfields to prevent snowdrifts, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in heavy weather.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> quality of the AC welding of aluminum, and also {{make it easier to}} strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the propagation of plane waves in an isotropic two-temperature generalized thermoelastic solid half-space in context of Green and Naghdi theory of type II (without energy dissipation). The governing equations in x – z plane are solved to show the existence of three coupled plane waves. The reflection of plane waves from a thermally insulated free surface is considered to obtain the relations between the reflection coefficients. A particular example of the half-space is chosen for numerical computations of <b>the</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>and</b> reflection coefficients of plane waves. Effects of two-temperature and rotation parameters on <b>the</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reflection coefficients of plane waves are shown graphically...|$|R
30|$|The {{wind power}} {{prediction}} error probability distribution is very complex {{due to the}} nonlinear relationship between <b>the</b> wind <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> wind power: when <b>the</b> wind <b>speed</b> {{is less than the}} cut-in wind, the wind power is 0; when <b>the</b> wind <b>speed</b> is between <b>the</b> cut-in wind <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rated wind <b>speed,</b> <b>the</b> wind power will be the smooth output; when <b>the</b> wind <b>speed</b> is between <b>the</b> rated wind <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cut-out wind, the wind power will maintain its maximum power; when <b>the</b> wind <b>speed</b> is greater than <b>the</b> cut-out wind <b>speed,</b> <b>the</b> wind power will be 0.

5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver.

5|$|Despite DuPont's grand {{boulevard}} {{not coming}} to fruition, he was a visionary who implemented key practices before they became standard in the decades after he initiated his project. After his death in 1930, DuPont was recognized for foreseeing that traffic on highways would approach <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> volume of railroads and planning with provisions for future needs. Based on that vision, he designed his highway with a wide right-of-way and curves and grades adequate for high-speed traffic. The DuPont Highway was also innovative {{as one of the}} earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but not directly through them, a development that was more convenient for through traffic and less disruptive to a town's residents. Up to that point, the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads. South of Milford, the DuPont Highway was constructed entirely on new alignment except from Bedford Street north of Georgetown to Old State Road at Redden. The portion of the highway north of Milford, which DSHD designed, mostly overlaid the existing MilfordDover highway. The two exceptions were through Frederica, where the State Road used Market Street, and between Milford and Frederica, where the State Road followed Jenkins Pond Road, Reynolds Road, Pritchett Road, and Milford Neck Road.|$|E
5|$|Hersing {{attacked}} {{a convoy of}} fifteen merchant ships escorted by fourteen destroyers in August south-west of Ireland. He took U-21 {{between two of the}} escorting destroyers and briefly used his periscope to gauge <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> course of the transports before firing two torpedoes and diving. Hersing reported both torpedoes hit and the destroyers immediately rushed to begin their depth charge attacks. After a five-hour hunt, the destroyers withdrew to rejoin the convoy. The experience led Hersing to change tactics in future attacks on escorted convoys; instead of attacking the ships {{from as far away as}} possible, he chose to fire his torpedoes at closer range and then dive under the transport ships, where the destroyers would be unable to launch their depth charges for fear of damaging the transports. As of 1918, she was assigned to the III U-boat Flotilla. Later in 1918, the submarine was used as a training boat for new crews. She survived the war, but on 22 February 1919, she accidentally sank in the North Sea while under tow to Britain, where she would be formally surrendered.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, the Norwegian Parliament {{decided to}} build the first {{high-speed}} railway in Norway, from Oslo via the new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen to Eidsvoll. This line would run parallel to the Hoved Line, increasing <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> capacity along the route. Fast express and regional trains could run along the new section, while slower commuter trains used the old tracks and could make many stops without disturbing other traffic. Projects were launched during the 1990s to create similar high-speed bypasses from Oslo to Ski, and from Skøyen (west of Oslo) to Asker. Construction of the latter—christened the Asker Line—started in 2001, and the first section from Asker to Sandvika opened in 2005, while the second section is expected to open in 2011.|$|E

On 12 December, Cambridge were favourites to win but Poulton captained Oxford to victory, {{in front of a}} crowd of 10,000. Geen's form coming into the game was suspect but he proved his worth. However, Poulton suffered a hamstring injury early on and his replacement Eric Thomas, a forward, lacked <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> skills to combine effectively with Geen. Nevertheless, he came close to scoring, but, as he had done in the previous year's match, he dropped the ball over the tryline. He was to repeat the error the following year.|$|E
5|$|The first European emigrants {{travelled}} in the holds {{of sailing}} cargo ships. With {{the advent of}} the age of steam, an efficient transatlantic passenger transport mechanism was established {{at the end of the}} 1860s. It was based on huge ocean liners run by international shipping lines, most prominently Cunard, White Star, and Inman. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> capacity of the large steamships meant that tickets became cheaper. From the Swedish port towns of Stockholm, Malmö and Gothenburg, transport companies operated various routes, some of them with complex early stages and consequently a long and trying journey on the road and at sea. Thus North German transport agencies relied on the regular Stockholm—Lübeck steamship service to bring Swedish emigrants to Lübeck, and from there on German train services to take them to Hamburg or Bremen. There they would board ships to the British ports of Southampton and Liverpool and change to one of the great transatlantic liners bound for New York. The majority of Swedish emigrants, however, travelled from Gothenburg to Hull, UK, on dedicated boats run by the Wilson Line, then by train across Britain to Liverpool and the big ships.|$|E
