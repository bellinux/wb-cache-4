Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop thermocouples which can stably measure temperature in these harsh environments. Refractory metal and ceramic thin film thermocouples are well suited for this task since they have chemical and electrical stability at high {{temperatures in}} oxidizing atmospheres, they are compatible with thermal barrier coatings employed on engine components, have higher sensitivity than conventional wire thermocouples, and they are non-invasive to the engine environment. In this masters thesis, thin film combinatorial chemistry for materials discovery and characterization was the primary tool used to optimize <b>thermo-element</b> materials for thin film thermocouples. The resulting sensors based on ceramics, such as indium oxide and indium tin oxide, as well as others based on refractory metals, such as platinum and palladium, exhibited remarkable stability for many cycles at temperatures above 1000 °C. ...|$|E

As an electrical generator system, TE has several advantages i. e not noisy, easy maintenance, relatively small, lightweight and environmentally friendly {{because it does not}} produce pollution. In this paper, the research about the performance of TE modules that used for electric generator has been done. TE modules utilize low temperature waste-heat from a solar cell that simulated with a combination of a bulb and a collector plate. TE modules which tested are single and double modules, in which for double modules, connectivity Thermal-Series was used. Parameters of performance such as output power generated are determined by measuring the temperatures difference and the voltages difference at the test module as well as using several equations. The results show that the distance of heat source and load applied will greatly affect the performance of thermoelectric generator (TEG) modules. The results showed that the number of modules and loading will greatly affect the performance of TEG modules. The use of heat pipes generate a far greater power 4 - 6 times on the single TE Module (0. 84 mW) than without heat pipe (0. 14 mW), and a double TE modules that uses heat pipe will became 4 times larger (1. 48 mW) than without heat pipe (0. 37 mW) ...|$|E

Present efforts on measuring temperature from operating SOFC stacks measure only gas channel temperature and do not reveal the cell level temperature distribution, which is more important for understanding cell’s performance and its temperature-related degradation study. Authors propose a cell integrated multi-junction thermocouple array for in-situ cell surface temperature monitoring from an operating SOFC.

Hence, it causes far less disturbance to the cells’ performance during sensing.

The thermocouple array was tested in a furnace covering the entire operating temperature range of a typical SOFC.

This work presents a novel method to synthesize thermoelectric materials to print scalable thermoelectric generator (TEG) devices in a cost effective way. The main focus of this work is performance advancements of dispenser printed composite thermoelectric materials and devices. Thermoelectric device design for condition monitoring applications, novel composite thermoelectric materials and cost effective and scalable manufacturing methods are foundational aspects of this work. WSNs are a promising technology for ubiquitous, active monitoring in residential, industrial and medical applications. A current bottleneck for widespread adoption of WSNs is the power supplies. While the power demands can be somewhat alleviated through novel electronics, any primary battery will have a finite lifetime. This can pose a major problem if the network is large or the nodes are located in difficult to reach areas. Battery replacement is thus undesirable, costly, and inefficient for large–scale deployments of WSNs. Thermal energy is an attractive option to power WSNs due to the availability of low–grade ambient waste heat sources. TEGs provide solid–state energy by converting temperature differences into usable electricity. These solid–state TEGs have great appeal due to their silent nature, have no moving parts and are CO 2 emission free. In order to be used for powering the condition monitoring WSNs, the TEG should be able to provide certain average power at desired voltage levels. Based on heat transfer TEG design, high voltage output requires large number of couples packed in a small area in addition to high Seebeck coefficient and high temperature difference across the device. The performance of TEGs devices depends on both material properties and device geometry The efficiency of TEG is governed by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, which depends on material properties. It has been challenging to increase ZT beyond 1 for commercial thermoelectric materials like Bi 2 Te 3 as n–type and Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3 as p–type, since the thermoelectric parameters of ZT are generally interdependent. There are challenges on the device design side as well. The electrical resistance and the temperature difference across the device depend on the element length of the device. Electrical resistance increases with increase in element length resulting in lower power output. Temperature difference across the device increases with increase in element length resulting in higher power output. Therefore, a trade–off occurs between device element length and power output, which ultimately depend on the TEG application. Therefore, an application specific optimized device length is required to maximize power output. Devices, utilizing waste heat to generate power, should be low cost in order to be competitive. Traditional pick and place methods to manufacture TEG devices are labor, materials and energy intensive. Whereas, the micro–fabrication technology involves expensive and complicated processes like lithography and thin-film deposition and is limited to micro–scale regime. These methods have limited cost-effective scalability for manufacturing of application–specific TEGs. The limitations of the commonly used manufacturing technologies provide an opportunity for additive manufacturing methods such as direct-write printing. Printing utilizes additive processing steps, thus reducing materials waste and cost per unit area. It is an automated process that can be used to print high–aspect–ratio devices with minimum labor. Printing of high–aspect–ratio TEG devices requires thermoelectric materials that are readily synthesized, air stable, and solution–process able to create patterns on large areas. In this regard, polymer thermoelectric composites are very attractive, as they require relatively simple manufacturing processes. While the ZT of inorganic composite materials may be lower than that of conventional materials, the reduction of manufacturing costs associated with printing is significant. As a result, the cost of energy generated from TEGs is improved through printed manufacturing. In this work, we utilize a custom developed dispenser printer to print high–aspect–ratio planar single–element TEGs. Off the shelf, Bi 2 Te 3 and Sb 2 Te 3 were chosen as the starting thermoelectric material because of high ZT values at room temperature. The maximum ZT at room temperature for an n–type Bi 2 Te 3 –epoxy composite and p–type Sb 2 Te 3 –epoxy composite cured at 250 °C was 0. 16 and 0. 18. Mechanical alloy and additives helped to improve the ZT for n and p–type thermoelectric composite materials to 0. 2 and 0. 18 respectively. Single element n–type planar prototype device was printed on a custom designed flexible polyimide substrate to form a TEG. The device produced 25 μW at 0. 23 mA and 109 mV for 20 K temperature difference. These results indicate an areal power density of 130 μW/cm 2, which is quite close to ideal power density 135 μW/cm 2. Similarly p–type planar prototype device produced 20. 5 μW power at 0. 15 mA and 130 mV for 20 K temperature difference and areal power density of 150 μW/cm 2. We have explored Bi as n–type thermoelectric composite material as it is easily and cheaply available and its toxicity is less as compared to commonly used thermoelectric materials like Bi 2 Te 3. We present a unique way of fabricating circular TEGs using dispenser–printing methods, which can be easily mounted on hot surface or wrapped around pipe carrying hot fluid to generate electricity to power condition monitoring sensors. In order to realize practical thermoelectric devices, both p–type and n–type elements connected in series are essential to achieve reasonable efficiency. Therefore, Bi–epoxy has been used as n–type composite thermoelectric material and MA Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3 with 8 wt% extra Te epoxy composites as p–type thermoelectric material to print circular TEGs. The maximum power output of 130 μW at 70 K temperature difference is achieved for a 10 –couple device that resulted in measured power density (1230 μW/cm 2). The TEG device design was designed based on n and p–type composite thermoelectric film properties and optimized <b>thermo–element</b> leg length obtained was 3. 5 mm. The Flexible PCB consisting of nickel and gold plated copper traces on a flexible polyimide substrate was built by Rigiflex Technology Inc. Thick gold plated nickel and copper metal contacts resulted in reduced electrical contact resistance between metal contacts and printed TE elements. Flexible polyimide has low thermal conductivity that helps to maintain temperature difference across the device, electrical insulation helps to separate the gold contacts and high temperature tolerance make curing feasible for printed elements at high temperature. The 50 –couple prototype device produced a power output of 33 μW at 0. 75 mA and 43 mV for a temperature difference of 20 K resulting in a device areal power density of 280 &# 956;W/cm 2. TEGs were mounted on hot surface pipes and without controlling the cold side temperature; power measurements with variable load resistance were done. At 100 °C hot surface temperature, 33 μW of maximum power has been obtained. Power generated by these TEG devices is sufficient to charge batteries used in condition monitoring WSNs on the hot surfaces of equipment. While the efficiency of printed thermoelectric composites is not as high as that of some state–of–the–art materials with high figure of merit, the results are encouraging. The ease of processing and device fabrication with printed materials provides deployment advantages over such materials...|$|E
40|$|The cross-plane mobility, in the {{direction}} perpendicular to the planes of a superlattice, is critical for the computation of the figure of merit (ZT) in a thermoelectric device. The measurement of cross-plane mobilities in thermoelectric superlattice structures cannot be performed by conventional techniques such as the van der Pauw method. Therefore, alternative techniques must be used to obtain this important parameter. Magnetoresistance is the increase in material resistivity due to a lengthened path for charge carriers in a perpendicular magnetic field. The magnetoresistance {{is related to the}} magnetic field strength as ({mu}B) 2 in the standard configuration, but the field dependence is also influenced by device geometry.

This resulting mesa structure has a 100 -mm-square contact metallization. Technical issues related to the sample preparation for the measurement are discussed. The magnetoresistance effect is expected to be small due to the anticipated low mobilities in Bi 2 Te 3 -based materials.
