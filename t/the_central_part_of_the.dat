5|$|De Iniusta is {{actually}} a composite work. The account of the trial itself, often termed the Libellus, is <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, and is probably the original account.

5|$|Every {{year the}} Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts {{a series of}} surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WSDOT calculated that as few as 2,000cars traveled through <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway, and as many as 2,500cars at the interchange with SR22.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations {{in other parts of the}} gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the very}} {{northern}} {{reaches of the}} Briar Creek watershed, the bedrock {{is made up of}} sandstone. South of the sandstone layer, there is a section of the watershed where the bedrock is mudstone. In <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed, the bedrock is siltstone. In {{the southern part of the}} watershed, the bedrock is mostly shale, including the part of the watershed in Berwick, which it has bedrock of calcerous shale.

5|$|Much of {{the land}} {{near the mouth of}} Mahoning Creek is developed. A strip of land {{crossing}} the watershed in its central section is also developed. The southernmost part of the watershed is largely agricultural land. North of this is an area of mostly forested land and <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed is mostly agricultural land. The northern part includes both forested and agricultural land. The fastest development in Montour County is occurring in the watershed of the creek.|$|E

5|$|Various {{parts of}} the main volcano have been {{subjected}} to hydrothermal alteration. The Azufrera stage edifice was subject to the most alteration; especially in the summit area and between the Angulo and Azufrera summits lie sulfur rich talus deposits. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex is heavily altered by fumarole activity. Hydrothermal alteration may be driven by the formation of a deep magma reservoir and resulting hydrothermal circulation in overlying rocks.|$|E

5|$|During the war era, Nguyễn Ánh had {{maintained}} an embryonic bureaucracy {{in an attempt}} to prove his leadership ability to the people. Due to the incessant warfare, military officers were generally the most prominent members of his inner circle. This dependency on military backing continued to manifest itself throughout his reign. Vietnam was divided into three administrative regions. The old patrimony of the Nguyễn formed <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire (vùng Kinh Kỳ), with nine provinces, five of which were directly ruled by Gia Long and his mandarins from Huế.|$|E
5|$|Green Creek rises near Waller {{and heads}} roughly south to Rohrsburg {{and on to}} Orangeville, where it joins Fishing Creek. It drains <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fishing Creek watershed. Little Fishing Creek starts just in Lycoming County near the Columbia County Line. It winds through rural areas before {{reaching}} Pennsylvania Route 42, which it runs parallel to {{for the remainder of}} its length. It drains {{the western part of the}} Fishing Creek watershed. Four covered bridges cross Little Fishing Creek; these are the Wanich Covered Bridge No. 69, the Sam Eckman Covered Bridge No. 92, the Jud Christie Covered Bridge No. 95, and the Creasyville Covered Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Highway16 is {{a provincial}} paved highway in the Canadian {{province}} of Saskatchewan. It is the Saskatchewan {{section of the}} Yellowhead Highway, and also the Trans-Canada Highway Yellowhead section. The main purpose of this highway is to connect Saskatchewan with Canadian cities such as Edmonton and Winnipeg. The highway runs from the Alberta boundary in Lloydminster (50thAvenue or Highway17) to the Manitoba boundary near Marchwell. Major cities it passes through are Saskatoon, North Battleford in <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province, Yorkton {{in the far east}} and Lloydminster to the far west.|$|E

5|$|In 2005 {{an island}} {{was found in}} <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. Then, in January 2006, the {{discovery}} of two nearby smaller lakes under the ice cap was published; they are named 90 Degrees East and Sovetskaya. It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial lakes may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling glaciologists propose {{that many of the}} subglacial lakes of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of water through the solid ice.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is flat, with a {{slope of}} 0 to 3 percent. There {{are two major}} lines of hills in the watershed, {{one of which is}} in the northern part and the other of which is in <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed. These lines of hills have a slope of 3 to 8 percent. In both of the lines of hills, there are patches where the slope is 8 to 15 percent and in the northern line of hills, there is an area with a slope of over 15 percent.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine is the band's primary songwriter. He {{develops}} songs {{starting with}} a particular riff that, with modifications, becomes <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song. He has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them. Drummer Shawn Drover stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs {{over the years and}} that some recent material is based on those demo recordings. Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and that making a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles. The lyrics are usually written after the music is arranged. Discussing the band's lyrics, Mustaine said that many of the themes are derived from literature, such as the novels of George Orwell.|$|E
