40|$|Many {{central banks}} often focus on {{underlying}} measures of inflation when assessing inflation trends. This paper compares {{the accuracy of}} underlying measures of inflation relative to <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> rates by using Australia data. It is found that the underlying measures did have smaller errors in predicting the long-term trend in inflation than <b>the</b> quarterly <b>headline</b> rate due to the volatility in <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> rate. As compared to <b>the</b> year-ended <b>headline</b> rate, <b>the</b> statistical test results, however, support only the measure of market prices excluding volatile items, not the others. There is some weak evidence of the weighted median measure outperforming <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> rate in <b>the</b> sub-period after 1993. With respect to directional accuracy, the test statistics cannot reject the null hypothesis of an equal probability correctly predicting the moving direction of the inflation trend, though <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> rates have a higher probability. ...|$|R

This angered Willkie, and on his return from his 49-day trip, he confronted Roosevelt about it when making his report at the White House.|$|E
5|$|After a {{succession}} of counterattacks, {{toward the end of}} August the Libyans finally drove the 400 Chadian soldiers out of the town. This victory–the first by Libyan ground forces {{since the start of the}} Toyota War–was apparently achieved through close-range air strikes, which were followed by ground troops advancing cross-country in jeeps, Toyota all-terrain trucks, and light armored vehicles. For the Libyans, who had previously relied on ponderous tracked armour, the assault represented a conversion to the desert warfare tactics developed by FANT. To highlight the victory, Gaddafi flew foreign journalists to the region, so the news of his victory could reach <b>the</b> <b>headlines.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Suns <b>headline</b> [...] "Gotcha" [...] is {{probably}} <b>the</b> most notorious <b>headline</b> in a British newspaper about the incident. Kelvin MacKenzie, {{editor of the}} popular tabloid, {{is reported to have}} used an impromptu exclamation by The Suns features editor, Wendy Henry, as the inspiration for <b>the</b> <b>headline.</b> <b>The</b> accompanying text reported that General Belgrano had only been hit and damaged, not sunk.

5000|$|Foot's {{involvement}} in the nuclear disarmament movement {{gave rise to the}} beloved story that The Times ran <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> [...] "Foot Heads Arms Body" [...] over an article about his leadership of a nuclear-disarmament committee. Some decades later, Martyn Cornell recalled the story as true, saying he had written <b>the</b> <b>headline</b> himself as a Times subeditor around 1986. <b>The</b> <b>headline</b> does not, however, appear in The Times Digital Archive, which includes every day's newspaper for the years 1785-2010.|$|R

5|$|When {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1919, Surrey awarded Hobbs {{a five-year}} contract worth £400 a year. During the season, he began to open the batting with Andy Sandham, who succeeded to Hayward's position as Hobbs' partner; in the following years, the pair established an effective partnership. In total, they shared 66 century opening partnerships and averaged over 50 for the first wicket. Like Hobbs' other successful partnerships, this one was based on quick running. Sandham, even when successful, was often overshadowed by his partner; on one occasion, Sandham scored a century but <b>the</b> <b>headlines</b> were reserved for Hobbs' duck. Sandham usually played the subordinate role and Hobbs took most of the bowling.|$|E
5|$|In 2002–03, off-ice {{problems}} dominated <b>the</b> <b>headlines.</b> The Senators {{filed for}} bankruptcy on January 9, 2003, after {{a long history of}} debt. They continued regular season play after getting some emergency financing from the NHL. Despite the off-ice problems, Ottawa won the Presidents' Trophy, finishing with a franchise-record 113 points, making them the first Canadian team to win it since the Calgary Flames in 1989. This was also the highest finish by an Ottawa team in 77 years (since the original Senators finished first overall in 1926). In the 2003 playoffs, they defeated Yashin and his New York Islanders and the Philadelphia Flyers before coming within one game of making it into the Finals, falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the New Jersey Devils.|$|E

This was more than twice that of the second leading wicket-taker. He was named as the player of the tournament, which India won after defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final. Pathan was featured on <b>the</b> <b>headlines</b> when he claimed 9/16 against Bangladesh, helping to bowl them out for 34, and helped India to emerge victorious over Sri Lanka in the final, taking 3/33. Pathan also scored 94 runs at 31.33 with the bat, compiling scores of 32, 28 and 34. Pathan returned to India and took 3/51 and 1/33 and scored 26 and 12 in his first Ranji Trophy match for the season, against Andhra Pradesh. This resulted in him being selected for the Indian national squad for the 2003–04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Palace {{began their}} first top flight {{campaign}} {{in almost a}} decade by re-signing Andy Gray from QPR for £500,000. In November, Palace hit <b>the</b> <b>headlines</b> when they signed Bristol Rovers goalkeeper Nigel Martyn for £1 million – a record for a goalkeeper in Britain. However, mixed form meant that the Eagles ended the season fifteenth after spending most {{of the first half}} in the top ten. But it was in the FA Cup that Palace really shone. After a succession of ties against lower division teams (Portsmouth, Huddersfield Town, Rochdale and Cambridge United), Palace reached the semi-finals, drawing the same Liverpool side that had beaten them 9–0 earlier in the season. The tie was played at Villa Park, and saw Liverpool score first and hold a seemingly comfortable 1–0 lead at half-time. However, Palace emerged from the half-time interval with a sense of purpose, and within a minute of the restart were level with Bright equalising. After going 2–1 up, they found themselves 3–2 down late in the match and were seemingly beaten. Then a late equaliser by Andy Gray took the game into extra-time, with the winner scored by Alan Pardew. The team secured a thrilling 4–3 victory {{and for the first time}} in their history, Palace were in the FA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|The Geneva Conference {{opened on}} 8 May 1954, {{the day after}} the {{surrender}} of the garrison. Ho Chi Minh entered the conference on the opening day with the news of his troops' victory in <b>the</b> <b>headlines.</b> The resulting agreement temporarily partitioned Vietnam into two zones: the North was administered by the communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam while the South was administered by the French-supported State of Vietnam. The last units of the French Union forces withdrew from Indochina in 1956. This partition was supposed to be temporary, and the two zones were meant to be reunited through national elections in 1956. After the French withdrawal, the United States supported the southern government, under Emperor Bao Dai and Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem, which opposed the Geneva agreement, and which claimed that Ho Chi Minh's forces from the North had been killing Northern loyalists and terrorizing people both north and south. The North was supported by both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Soviet Union (USSR). This arrangement proved tenuous and escalated into the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War), eventually bringing 500,000 American troops into South Vietnam.|$|E
