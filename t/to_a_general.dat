5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E
5|$|Currency war, {{also known}} as {{competitive}} devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> decline in international trade, harming all countries.|$|E

The {{following}} week the game dropped to the third place with further sales of over 32,000 units, contributing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> decline in game sales during that period. Within two weeks of its release, the game had sold nearly 219,000 units in Japan. According to Namco's fiscal report in February 2005, the game had sold 280,000 units in Japan by that time. According to their later 2005 fiscal year report, Episode II was one of Namco's better-selling titles in North America, although no exact sales figures were given. According to a later report, Episode II underperformed commercially, reaching just over 50% of Namco's projected sales target.|$|E
5|$|Fiscal chaos, {{coupled with}} {{problems}} {{of transportation and}} the requisition of metal led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> economic collapse as factories ran out of raw materials and laid off workers. The crisis especially afflicted Belgium's large manufacturing industries. As raw material usually imported from abroad dried up, more firms laid off workers. Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organisations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918. The German authorities used the crisis to loot industrial machinery from Belgian factories, which was either sent to Germany intact or melted down. The policy escalated {{after the end of}} the German policy of deportation in 1917 which later created major problems for Belgian economic recovery {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{attitude}} {{could not be}} maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness {{of the government to}} use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> demand that Crispi should return to power.

5|$|Hurricane Ginger was {{the second}} longest-lasting Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginger spent 27.25days as a tropical cyclone, lasting from September6 to October3. Twenty of those days (September 11 – September 30), Ginger was classified as a hurricane. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, {{and for the first}} nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110mph (175km/h). On September14, Ginger slowed and turned <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> westward track, passing near Bermuda on September23. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August18. Shortly after, the system became embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. By August23, the system began to intensify while convective activity become consolidated around the center of circulation. By 0600UTC on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the wave spawned Tropical Depression Eight roughly 965miles (1,555km) east of Barbados. A weak ridge of high pressure {{to the north of}} the depression led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> westward movement of the system. Gradually strengthening, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm early on August25, at which time it was given the name Gustav.|$|E

Moreover, during his tenure in Dalian, Bo caused resentment for the amount of 'special favours' that he procured for the coastal city {{at the expense of the}} rest of the province.

5|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 13thcentury, congregatio generalis ("general assembly") convoked by the monarchs or their representatives became an {{important}} organ of court system.

All 4th century archaeological remains have come from within the defences and none from outside, suggesting that the whole population were within the defences by the 4th century. The latest coin to be found at Letocetum was minted in the time of the Emperor Gratian and dated to 381CE.

The lack of power led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> disdain for the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO), which increased further when the company left the $40million (1985USD) repair bill to the ratepayers, citing the company's lack of hurricane insurance.
