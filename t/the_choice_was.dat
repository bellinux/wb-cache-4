5|$|The {{rule that}} at most half the contestants win a medal is {{sometimes}} broken {{if it would}} cause {{the total number of}} medals to deviate too much from half the number of contestants. This last happened in 2010 (when <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> to give either 226 (43.71%) or 266 (51.45%) of the 517 contestants (excluding the 6 from North Korea — see below) a medal), 2012 (when <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> to give either 226 (46.35%) or 277 (50.55%) of the 548 contestants a medal), and 2013, when <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> to give either 249 (47.16%) or 278 (52.65%) of the 528 contestants a medal.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages {{there was}} {{considerable}} variation in the nomination of the archbishop and other bishops.

Since the Reformation, the church is explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the British crown; today it {{is made in the}} name of the monarch by the Prime Minister, from a shortlist of two selected by an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.|$|E
5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{forms of the}} story, the woman's pig-like appearance {{was the result of}} witchcraft. Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her that <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> hers, the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in Ireland.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>choice</b> {{operator}} <b>is</b> {{essential for}} the description of action-based reactive systems. If the atomicity of actions is dropped (e. g. by action refinement), one has to decide when <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> triggered. <b>The</b> standard approach <b>is</b> to trigger <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> when actions start. This thesis examine the alternative approach that <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> triggered when actions terminate. This end-based <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> motivated and a process algebra, which contains an end-based choice and an action refinement operator, is established. Consistent semantics (operational, denotational, axiomatical) are given. Furthermore, {{the difference between the}} start-based and <b>the</b> end-based <b>choice</b> <b>are</b> examined, in particular with respect to equivalence notions. New equivalence are established, since the standard equivalences are not preserved by the end-based action refinement operator...|$|R

5|$|Ballard was {{selected}} in the first round, 11th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> seen as a surprise by draft observers, as he was projected to be a late first-round to second-round pick. Ballard himself professed the early selection to be unexpected, saying {{he was ready to}} be drafted between the 20th and 40th positions. Scouting reports listed him as a puck-rushing offensive defenseman with comparisons to Phil Housley. Before making his NHL debut, he was traded twice. He was initially dealt by Buffalo to the Colorado Avalanche on July 3, 2003, for Steven Reinprecht. The following year, he was traded again to the Phoenix Coyotes, along with defenseman Derek Morris, for forward Chris Gratton, defenseman Ossi Väänänen and a second-round selection in the 2005 draft.|$|E

5|$|Following the Iron Bowl, Alabama's bowl {{destination}} was unclear {{due to the}} SEC championship game, which determined the conference champion on December 5. Until then, speculation centered on Alabama potentially attending any of four games: the Peach Bowl, Independence Bowl, Sun Bowl, or Music City Bowl. By {{the time of the}} championship game, the Sun Bowl had been eliminated as an option. After Tennessee won the SEC championship game and a bid to the Fiesta Bowl, other teams were selected by the Peach Bowl and Independence Bowl, leaving Alabama to be selected for the inaugural Music City Bowl. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> made official on December 6, and Alabama began preparing for its matchup with Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{had been}} awarded the first overall pick as {{compensation}} for the New York Jets joining the NFL {{as part of the}} league's merger with the American Football League. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> conditional upon the Giants selecting a quarterback; the team was allowed to trade the pick, if they received a starting quarterback in return. In 1967, the Giants traded their 1967 and 1968 first-round draft picks, their 1967 second-round pick, and a player to be named later to the Vikings in exchange for quarterback Fran Tarkenton. The New Orleans Saints were ultimately given the first overall pick in 1967 (before trading it to the Colts), dropping the Giants' former selection to second.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Houphouët {{was called}} by his tribe to assume the responsibilities of village chief. Preferring to pursue his medical career, he relinquished the office to his younger brother Augustin. Wishing to live closer to his village, he obtained a transfer to Dimbokro on 3 February 1934 and then to Toumodi on 28 June 1936. While Houphouët had displayed professional qualities, his attitude had chafed those around him. As a result, in September 1938, his clinical director demanded that he choose between {{his job as a}} doctor and his involvement in local politics. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> quickly made for him: his brother died in 1939, and Houphouët became chef de canton (an office created by the colonial administration to collect taxes). Due to this, Houphouët ended his medical career the next year.|$|E
5|$|Barely a {{month later}} on 18 August 1851, Juan Manuel de Rosas, {{dictator}} of the Argentine Confederation, declared war on Brazil, beginning the Platine War. Marques de Sousa had been warned by Caxias as early as 27 July 1844 {{of the possibility of}} an armed conflict between Brazil and its Platine neighbor. The government in Rio de Janeiro had prepared against the threat and formed an anti-Rosas alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay and dissident Argentine provinces. Caxias, who had been appointed commander-in-chief of Brazilian land forces, placed Marques de Sousa {{at the head of the}} 2nd Brigade, part of the 2nd Division. The Brazilian army crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. On 17 November, while the army was camped in the village of Santa Lucía near the Uruguayan capital, Marques de Sousa was promoted to a higher command, the 1st division. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> controversial, as there were two more senior and experienced officers next in line who were bypassed owing to their foreign birth.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa—the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft {{in the first month}} of fighting. Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment. But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow. After the long, but successful, Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it {{to be one of the}} major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the Battle of Moscow. Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the French invasion of Russia in 1812.|$|E
5|$|Pursuant to dynastic imperatives and {{the ethos}} of the time, the nobles {{required}} Tamar to marry {{in order to have}} a leader for the army and to provide an heir to the throne. Their choice fell on Yuri, son of the murdered prince Andrei I Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal, who then lived as a refugee among the Kipchaks of the North Caucasus. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> approved by Tamar's aunt Rusudan and the prince was brought to Georgia to marry the queen in 1185. Yuri proved to be an able soldier, but a difficult person and he soon ran afoul of his wife. The strained spousal relations paralleled a factional struggle at the royal court in which Tamar was becoming more and more assertive of her rights as a queen regnant. The turning point in Tamar's fortunes came with the death of the powerful Catholicos-Patriarch Michael whom the queen replaced, as a chancellor, with her supporter, Anton Gnolistavisdze. Tamar gradually expanded her own power-base and elevated her loyal nobles to high positions at the court, most notably the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{were tied}} with the Cubs and Giants in the wild-card race as {{late in the}} season as September 25 at 88–72. However, the Mets lost their {{remaining}} two games and finished their season one game back of the Cubs and Giants who ended tied at 89–73. This record was also the best non-division-winning record and as such a tie-breaker was necessary to determine the wild-card winner. A coin flip on September 14 gave the Cubs' home field advantage, setting Wrigley Field as the location for the game. In the event of a three-way tie the Cubs were presented with the choice to either host two home games or receive a bye and play the winner of a Mets-Giants game on the road because they had the best combined record against the Mets and Giants. Cubs' general manager Ed Lynch decided on the second option, though <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> moot as the Mets fell out of the race. The Cubs' Steve Trachsel and Mark Gardner of the Giants were slated to start the tie-breaker on the September 28.|$|E

5|$|The {{intention}} {{to create the}} racing modes of the game had been present {{from the start of}} the project and Battle Mode was developed from the desire to create a one-on-one mode where victory was not determined simply by competing for rank. The game did not start out as a Mario series game and the first prototype featured a generic man in overalls in the kart; the team decided that characters three heads tall would best suit the design of the karts. They did not decide on incorporating Mario series characters into the game until two or three months after the start of development. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> made after the development team, when observing how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to see what it would look like with Mario in the kart.

40|$|We explore {{different}} contexts and mechanisms that might promote or alleviate the gender effect in risk aversion.

When <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> framed as a willingness-to-pay (WTP) task, men are willing to pay more and thus exhibit lower risk aversion.

We also find that the effect size of the gender difference in risk aversion is reduced or eliminated as the context changes from tasks framed as gambles to other domains; and that attitudes toward gambling mediate the gender effect in gambling framed tasks...|$|R
