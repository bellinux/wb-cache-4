40|$|This work is {{inspired}} by the Green Move project that aims to design and implement a flexible service of vehicle sharing in Milan, based on electric vehicles (EVs) and open {{to a wide range}} of dierent typology of users. Different optimization problems need to be solved to allow an efficient management of the user requests by part of a central unit. For instance the EVs can be parked at several stations and the users would take an EV from a station and leave it in another one. To prevent a station from running out of EVs (or of parking slots) the central unit needs to redistribute the EVs. Up till now the problem of the EV redistribution in a sharing system has been faced with a solution approach similar to that one adopted for the bike sharing, i. e. collecting the exceeding vehicles through a fleet of trucks (in the case of EV by way of <b>tow-trucks)</b> and move them in the stations where they are lacking. We think that such approach is too drastic and not suitable to an urban setting where the EVs may be parked in stations not easily reachable by <b>tow-trucks.</b> Moreover the operation of loading EVs in <b>tow-trucks</b> is very time consuming. For this reason we propose a completely different solution approach consisting in moving the EVs by way of a team of workers that directly drive the EVs that need to be moved. Such a problem generates a challenging pickup and delivery problem with new features that to the best of our knowledge never has been considered in the literature. For such a problem we yield a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation that we test on verisimilar instances built on the Milan road network...|$|R

Courtesy lights {{should not be confused}} with emergency warning lights used in conjunction with audible warning systems (sirens) for emergency vehicles such as police cars, fire apparatus and ambulances, nor should they be confused with warning lights as used by <b>tow-trucks,</b> snow-plows, construction vehicles and school buses to increase awareness especially when moving slowly or stopped in the roadway.|$|R

25|$|Emergency {{services}} in Norway use mostly blue lighting. If a blue flashing light {{is seen in}} either traffic or the sea, other vehicles must yield to let that vehicle pass. Blue flashing lights are used by police, military police, customs, fire departments, rescue services, and ambulances. Government, VIP, and embassy vehicles may also use blue if accompanied by local police. Any vehicle equipped with a blue flashing light must have a permission issued by the DMV. The operator of such vehicle must be a qualified emergency vehicle operator and have a ‘code 160’ endorsement on their driver's license. Blue lights can be used alone or with an additional siren. The siren {{may not be used}} alone. The operator of an emergency vehicle may disregard speed limits and traffic lights with caution. Amber lights, however, are not regulated, but are used for any vehicle that need special attention, such as <b>tow-trucks,</b> snow plows, and parking enforcement. Red flashing lights are no longer in use, and were last used in the early 1960s.|$|R
