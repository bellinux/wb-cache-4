500|$|In season 4, Jacob Solworthy {{wrote in}} his review of the first six episodes of season four: [...] "Until now, 'House of Cards' has centred on the character's outward {{expression}} of power -- {{not to mention his}} hunger for it -- but the writers have shrewdly stripped that back, instead focusing on the character's internal fears in a way not dissimilar from Tony's dream sequences in 'The Sopranos'," [...] he later added, [...] "You'll never root for Frank more <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> by the end of these six episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{revealed}} by a video shown on C-SPAN, when questioned by a New Hampshire resident about his grades in law school, Biden had replied [...] "I think I {{probably have a}} much higher IQ <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> I suspect," [...] and then inaccurately recollected graduating in the [...] "top half" [...] of his class when he actually graduated 76th from 85, that he had attended law school on a full scholarship, and had received three degrees in college. In fact, he had earned a single B.A. with a double major in history and political science, and had received a half scholarship to law school based on financial need with some additional assistance based in part upon academics. [...] During this time, Biden also released his undergraduate grades, which were unexceptional.|$|E
500|$|Some People Change was Montgomery Gentry's lowest-selling album at the time. Joe Galante, then-president of Sony Music Nashville, {{thought that}} the album's poor sales were because it [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, and I think {{we got a little}} too soft." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review, saying that it was more [...] "touchy-feely" [...] <b>than</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> Your Thing, and that [...] "no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "C", criticizing the duo for the {{contradictory}} viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the [...] "defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors" [...] in [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". Jurek comparatively called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that it was [...] "a new pinnacle for the duo", calling the title track [...] "one of those tunes that defines something that {{lies at the heart of}} what is good about Americans." ...|$|E

500|$|On May 7, 2013, Lambesis {{was arrested}} in Oceanside, California, US after {{allegedly}} hiring an undercover detective to kill his estranged wife. The report {{was made by the}} San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain. On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: [...] "The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can." [...] They also stated that their thoughts were [...] "with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation." [...] Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that [...] "we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted". During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded [...] "not guilty" [...] and his lawyer stated: [...] "His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use." [...] On February 25, 2014 Lambesis changed his plea from [...] "not guilty" [...] to [...] "guilty" [...] and consequently faced a potential sentence of nine years in prison.|$|E
500|$|As Milo {{struggles with}} words and begins {{the process of}} making himself their master, he also has {{difficulty}} with numbers, especially when he speaks with [...]58 of a child, who with parents and two siblings (whom Milo does not meet) makes up an average family. Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. [...] The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, [...] "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, {{is that many of the}} things which can never be, often are". Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, [...] "You must never feel badly about making mistakes... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> by being right for the wrong reasons". An index card in the Juster papers sets forth the germ of the princess' [...] "memorable" [...] counsel to Milo, [...] "Quite often the road to Rhyme + Reason is through the right mistakes." ...|$|E
500|$|Cibber replied {{mostly with}} good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some {{of which are}} in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in [...] "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so {{frequently}} fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot (1735) to Cibber's [...] "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. [...] "I must own", wrote Cibber, [...] "that I believe I know more of your whoring <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> of mine; because I don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours." [...] Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the [...] "little-tiny manhood" [...] of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story [...] "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took {{one of the most famous}} revenges in literary history. In the revised Dunciad that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E

2500|$|Jarrell is {{also noted}} for his essays on Robert Frost— whose poetry {{was a large}} {{influence}} on Jarrell's own— Walt Whitman, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, and others, which were mostly collected in Poetry and the Age (1953). Many scholars consider him the most astute poetry critic of his generation, and in 1979, the poet and scholar Peter Levi {{went so far as}} to advise younger writers, [...] "Take more notice of Randall Jarrell <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> of any academic critic." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Kevin D. Williamson, {{reviewing}} The Thomas Sowell Reader for Commentary, said [...] "If a mad scientist were {{to repair}} to his laboratory {{to design a}} machine that would make white liberals uncomfortable, that machine would be Thomas Sowell, whose input is data and whose output is socioeconomic criticism in several grades, ranging from bemused observation to thorough debunking to high-test scorn—all of which are represented in The Thomas Sowell Reader". Williamson says [...] "Thomas Sowell is that rarest of things among serious academics: plainspoken... His plain speaking also makes him dangerous, and that danger is intensified {{by the fact that}} Sowell is black. And not just black, but unassailably black: He's Southern-born, Harlem-raised, brought up poor, and the first of his family to be educated beyond the sixth grade... Because he is black, his opinions about race are controversial. If he were white, they probably would be unpublishable. This is a rare case in which we are all beneficiaries of American racial hypocrisy. That he works in the special bubble of permissiveness extended by the liberal establishment to some conservatives who are black (in exchange for their being regarded as inauthentic, self-loathing, soulless race traitors) must be maddening to Sowell, even more so than it is for other notable black conservatives. It is plain that the core of his identity, his heart of hearts, is not that of a man who is black. It is that of a man who knows a whole lot more about things <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> and is intent on setting you straight, at length if necessary, if you'd only listen." ...|$|E
