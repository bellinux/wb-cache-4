5|$|Although the Georgian Chronicles {{maintain}} <b>that</b> <b>David</b> died in 1001, several Armenian and Muslim accounts {{suggest he}} may have died in 1000. Aristakes gives the date of David’s death as March 28, 1000, which is closely corroborated by another Armenian chronicler Asoghik who says David died on the Easter {{day of the year}} 449 of the Armenian calendar, i.e., March 31, 1000. Yet another Armenian, Samuel Anetsi, also puts the date as 1000.|$|E
5|$|David Young and Simon Diamond fought Apolo and Sonny Siaki in {{the third}} encounter. It lasted 5 minutes and 32 seconds. Close to the end, Davidlifted up and slammed Siaki back-first into the mat with a Spinebuster. The referee refused to count the pin, deeming <b>that</b> <b>David</b> was not the {{eligible}} man. This allowed Apolo to lift up and slam David face-first into the mat to win the match.|$|E
5|$|David and her editor Jill Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as}} the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers <b>that</b> <b>David</b> had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction <b>that</b> <b>David</b> had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.|$|E

5000|$|The Armenian chronicler Matthew of Edessa says <b>that</b> <b>David's</b> {{eldest son}} Demetrius was born from an Armenian woman. She is not {{mentioned}} in the surviving Georgian documents. A reference to the former wife of David, a king of Georgia, is found in the letter of Ansellus, cantor of the Holy Sepulchre, dating from [...] 1120, with which he was sending a relic of the True Cross to the bishop of Paris. Ansellus reports that he acquired the relic from a convent of Georgian nuns only recently established in Jerusalem under the patronage of the Latin patriarch Ghibbelin. Ansellus names the founder of the nunnery as King David's [...] "widow". Since David died only in 1125, the lady of Ansellus's letter may have been his first wife, whom he divorced for political reasons in order to marry a Kipchak princess. According to the modern historian Cyril Toumanoff, David's repudiation of his first marriage occurred [...] 1107. The same author hypothesizes <b>that</b> <b>David's</b> Armenian wife was called Rusudan and she mothered all of David's children. The modern Georgian genealogists Ioseb Bichikashvili and Yuri Chikovani assume <b>that</b> <b>David's</b> elder children were born of his first marriage and at least one son, called Vakhtang, was produced from the second marriage to Gurandukht.|$|R
5|$|David {{begins by}} sending poison pen letters to Nick's wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), which state that Nick {{is having an}} affair. Nick realises David is behind the letters. Price told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) his {{character}} panics and becomes annoyed. Nick is arrogant to his actions and believes David will just forgive him because they are related. He then tells David that they should discuss the affair with Kylie and move on. Price explained <b>that</b> <b>David</b> is worried that Kylie will feel betrayed he knew all along and does not want her to leave him. He decides he must stop Nick and grabs {{the steering wheel and}} causes a car crash. Price believed David was not trying to murder Nick, just prevent him from contacting Kylie.|$|E
5|$|From 1950 onwards David {{was well}} known for her {{magazine}} articles and, in the 1960s and '70s, for her kitchen shop, but her reputation rested and still rests principally on her books. The first five, published between 1950 and 1960, cover the cuisine of continental Europe and beyond. In the 1970s David wrote two books about English cooking. The last of her books published in her lifetime was a collection of previously-printed essays and articles. From the extensive notes and archives left by the author, her literary executor, Jill Norman, edited and completed four more books <b>that</b> <b>David</b> had planned. Six other books published since the author's death in various formats in hardback and paperback have been compilations drawn from her existing works.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear <b>that</b> <b>David</b> was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|E
5000|$|A May 5, 2009, {{article in}} the New York Post {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Davids,</b> who two months earlier had been fighting against charter schools, was now [...] "leading the charge {{in the opposite direction}} — as the founder of the first citywide parent association for charter schools." ...|$|R
50|$|Historians have {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>David's</b> mission may have targeted communities in Southern India, {{on the assumption}} that an existing church there - either descended from the missionary work of the apostle Thomas, or founded by migrant Christians from elsewhere in the region - was in difficulties and required support.|$|R

5|$|Michael Lynch and Richard Oram portray David {{as having}} little initial {{connection}} with the culture and society of the Scots; but both likewise argue <b>that</b> <b>David</b> became increasingly re-Gaelicised in the later stages of his reign. Whatever the case, David's claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was doubtful. David {{was the youngest of}} eight sons of the fifth from last king. Two more recent kings had produced sons. William fitz Duncan, son of King Donnchad II, and Máel Coluim, son of the last king Alexander, both preceded David in terms of the slowly emerging principles of primogeniture. However, unlike David, neither William nor Máel Coluim had the support of Henry. So when Alexander died in 1124, the aristocracy of Scotland could either accept David as King, or face war with both David and Henry I.|$|E
5|$|The Goodman's Fields Theatre was {{established}} in 1727, and it was here <b>that</b> <b>David</b> Garrick made his successful début as Richard III, in 1741. In the 19th century the theatres of the East End rivalled in their grandiosity and seating capacity those of the West End. The first of this era was the ill-fated Brunswick Theatre (1828), which collapsed three days after opening, killing 15 people. This {{was followed by the}} opening of the Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel (1828), the Garrick (1831) in Leman Street, the Effingham (1834) in Whitechapel, the Standard (1835) in Shoreditch, the City of London (1837) in Norton Folgate, then the Grecian and the Britannia Theatre in Hoxton (1840). Though very popular for a time, from the 1860s onwards these theatres, one by one, began to close, the buildings were demolished and their very memory began to fade.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Jareth also underwent some significant developments {{during the early}} stages of pre-production. According to Henson he was originally meant to be another puppet creature in the same vein as his goblin subjects. Henson eventually decided he wanted a big, charismatic star to play the Goblin King, and decided to pursue a musician for the role. Sting, Prince, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson were considered for the part; however, it was ultimately decided <b>that</b> <b>David</b> Bowie would be the most suitable choice.|$|E
