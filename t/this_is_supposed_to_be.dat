He created it as a tribute to the nation on the occasion of 50 years of independence. It was painted on the specially prepared wall of Mahavir Art Gallery in Ahmednagar. Pramod has portrayed Bharat Mata (goddess of Indian Independence) and 500 great people born out of Indian culture. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the worlds biggest pencil sketch.|$|E

2500|$|For New Nightmare, Lou Carlucci, {{the effects}} coordinator, remodeled Freddy's glove {{for a more}} [...] "organic look". He says, [...] "I did the {{original}} glove on the first Nightmare and we deliberately made that rough and primitive looking, like {{something that would be}} constructed in somebody's home workshop. Since <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a new look for Freddy, Craven and everybody involved decided that the glove should be different. This hand has more muscle and bone texture to it, the blades are shinier and in one case, are retractable. Everything about this glove has a much cleaner look to it, it's more a natural part of his hand than a glove." [...] The new glove has five claws.|$|E
2500|$|On February 1, 1985, while {{performing}} her nude act at the [...] "Cine-Stage" [...] within the Mitchell Brothers' O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, Chambers {{was arrested by}} a vice squad and charged with committing a lewd act {{in a public place}} and soliciting prostitution. It was alleged by plainclothes policemen who were in the audience that Chambers allowed audience members to touch her with their hands and mouths during her show called [...] "Feel the Magic". She was released on $2,000 bail and the charges were later dropped. [...] "I've never been arrested in my life for anything, ever, so {{this is kind of a}} big shock for me, not only as a performer but as a human being", Chambers said at the time. [...] "It's a heartbreaker. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a hip city. I really love -- make that LOVED -- this city.

2500|$|Physical {{contact between}} two {{versions}} of the same person in the programme can lead to an energy discharge that shorts out the [...] "time differential". This is apparently due to a (fictional) principle known as the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, and was seen when the past and future versions of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart touched hands in Mawdryn Undead. The Doctor's incarnations do not appear to suffer this effect when encountering each other and shaking hands. This has never been explained. An essay in the About Time episode guides by Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood suggests that Time Lords are somehow exempt from the effect by their very nature. Rose Tyler is seen holding an infant version of herself in [...] "Father's Day", with no visible energy discharge, but the contact does allow the Reapers to enter the church in which the Doctor and several others are taking refuge. While doing a live commentary on the episode at the 2006 Bristol Comic Expo, episode author Paul Cornell said that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, even though it is not mentioned by name. He suggested that the lack of a spark may be down {{to the fact that the}} Time Lords were no longer around to manage anomalies.|$|E

2500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both {{reported that}} [...] "The End" [...] had received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers. Alan Sepinwall of Star-Ledger was less enthusiastic of the finale, stating [...] "I'm still wrestling with my feelings about 'The End'... I thought {{most of it}} worked like gangbusters. ... But as someone who did spend {{at least part of}} the last six years dwelling on the questions that were unanswered—be they little things like the outrigger shootout or why The Others left Dharma in charge of the Swan station after the purge, or bigger ones like Walt—I can't say I found 'The End' wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series. ... There are narrative dead ends in every season of 'Lost,' but it felt like season six had more than usual." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave [...] "The End" [...] a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was [...] "shaky on the big picture—on organizing the welter of mythic-religious-philosophical material it insisted on incorporating into its plot—but highly skilled at the small one, the moment to moment business of telling an exciting story. Rendered insignificant ... were the particulars of what they had done on the island." [...] David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, writing [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> such a smart and wise show, unlike anything else on network TV (blah, blah, blah), why such a wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light, huggy-bear ending. ...

60|$|Two {{kinds of}} geese {{frequent}} the Falklands. The upland species (Anas Magellanica) is common, in pairs and in small flocks, throughout the island.

They live entirely on vegetable matter. The rock-goose, so called from living exclusively on the sea-beach (Anas antarctica), is common both here and {{on the west coast}} of America, as far north as Chile. In the deep and retired channels of Tierra del Fuego, the snow-white gander, invariably accompanied by his darker consort, and standing close by each other on some distant rocky point, is a common feature in the landscape.|$|E

60|$|Having lain to all night, {{he reached}} the river on the 31st of October, but {{found that it was}} too shallow to admit his ships. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> what is now known as Laguna de Moron. Beyond this was a cape {{surrounded}} by shoals, and another projected still farther out. Between these two capes was a bay capable of receiving small vessels. The identity here of the description with the coast near Laguna de Moron seems very clear. The cape east of Laguna de Moron coincides with Cape Palmas, the Laguna de Moron with the shoal river described by Columbus; and in the western point of entrance, with the island of Cabrion opposite it, we recognize the two projecting capes he speaks of, with {{what appeared to be a}} bay between them. This all is a remarkable combination, difficult to be found any where but in the same spot which Columbus visited and described. Further, the coast from the port of San Salvador had run west to Rio de Mares, a distance of seventeen leagues, and from Rio de Mares it had extended N. W. fifteen leagues to Cabo de Palmos; all of which agrees fully with what has been here supposed. The wind having shifted to north, which was contrary to the course they had been steering, the vessels bore up and returned to Rio de Mares.|$|E
60|$|One may, I suppose, {{take the}} Rights of Man {{as they are}} {{embodied}} in the French Declaration as the ostentations of Democracy; our present Democratic state may {{be regarded as a}} practical realization of these claims. As far as the individual goes, the realization takes the form of an untrammelled liberty in matters that have heretofore been considered a part of social procedure, in the lifting of positive religious and moral compulsions, in the recognition of absolute property, and in the abolition of special privileges and special restrictions. Politically modern Democracy takes the form of denying that any specific person or persons shall act as a matter of intrinsic right or capacity on behalf of the community as a whole. Its root idea is representation. Government is based primarily on election, and every ruler is, in theory at least, a delegate and servant of the popular will. It is implicit in the Democratic theory {{that there is such a}} thing as a popular will, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the net sum of the wills of all the citizens in the State, so far as public affairs are concerned. In its less perfect and more usual state the Democratic theory is advanced either as an ethical theory which postulates an absence of formal acquiescence on the part of the governed as injustice, or else as a convenient political compromise, the least objectionable of all possible methods of public control, because it will permit only the minimum of general unhappiness.... I know of no case for the elective Democratic government of modern States that cannot be knocked to pieces in five minutes. It is manifest that upon countless important public issues there is no collective will, and nothing in the mind of the average man except blank indifference; that an electional system simply places power in the hands of the most skilful electioneers; that neither men nor their rights are identically equal, but vary with every individual, and, above all, that the minimum or maximum of general happiness is related only so indirectly to the public control that people will suffer great miseries from their governments unresistingly, and, on the other hand, change their rulers on account of the most trivial irritations. The case against all the prolusions of ostensible Democracy is indeed so strong that it is impossible to consider the present wide establishment of Democratic institutions as being the outcome of any process of intellectual conviction; it arouses suspicion even whether ostensible Democracy may not be a mere rhetorical garment for essentially different facts, and upon that suspicion we will now inquire.|$|E
60|$|The Land Commission {{has been}} in many senses unfortunate. The {{original}} German member, a gentleman {{of the name of}} Eggert, fell early into precarious health; his work was from the first interrupted, he was at last (to the regret of all that knew him) invalided home; and his successor had but just arrived. In like manner, the first American commissioner, Henry C. Ide, a man of character and intelligence, was recalled (I believe by private affairs) when he was but just settling into the spirit of the work; and though his place was promptly filled by ex-Governor Ormsbee, a worthy successor, distinguished by strong and vivacious common sense, the break was again sensible. The English commissioner, my friend Bazett Michael Haggard, is thus {{the only one who has}} continued at his post since the beginning. And yet, in spite of these unusual changes, the Commission has a record perhaps unrivalled among international commissions. It has been unanimous practically from the first until the last; and out of some four hundred cases disposed of, there is but one on which the members were divided. It was the more unfortunate they should have early fallen in a difficulty with the chief justice. The original ground of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a difference of opinion as to the import of the Berlin Act, on which, as a layman, it would be unbecoming if I were to offer an opinion. But it must always seem as if the chief justice had suffered himself to be irritated beyond the bounds of discretion. It must always seem as if his original attempt to deprive the commissioners of the services of a secretary and the use of a safe were even senseless; and his step in printing and posting a proclamation denying their jurisdiction were equally impolitic and undignified. The dispute had a secondary result worse than itself. The gentleman appointed to be Natives' Advocate shared the chief justice's opinion, was his close intimate, advised with him almost daily, and drifted at last into an attitude of opposition to his colleagues. He suffered himself besides (being a layman in law) to embrace the interest of his clients with something of the warmth of a partisan. Disagreeable scenes occurred in court; the advocate was more than once reproved, he was warned that his consultations with the judge of appeal tended to damage his own character and to lower the credit of the appellate court. Having lost some cases on which he set importance, it should seem that he spoke unwisely among natives. A sudden cry of colour prejudice went up; and Samoans were heard to assure each other that it was useless to appear before the Land Commission, which was sworn to support the whites.|$|E
