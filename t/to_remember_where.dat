25|$|Short-term memory (STM) can be {{described}} as a system allowing one to temporarily store and manage information that is necessary to complete complex cognitive tasks. Tasks which employ short-term memory include learning, reasoning, and comprehension. Spatial memory is a cognitive process that enables a person to remember different locations as well as spatial relations between objects. This allows one <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> an object is in relation to another object; for instance, allowing someone to navigate through a familiar city. Spatial memories are said to form after a person has already gathered and processed sensory information about her or his environment.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{memory is}} a person’s {{knowledge}} of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, {{and how to get}} to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> you put a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E

A person with prevention-focus orientation is more likely <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> events <b>where</b> the goal is pursued by means of vigilance than if it was pursued using eagerness approaches.|$|R

25|$|Within the {{literature}} {{it has been}} found that certain species of paridae and corvidae (such as the black-capped chickadee and the scrub jay) are able to use spatial memory <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>where,</b> when and what type of food they have cached. Recent studies with rats and squirrels, have also suggested that they are able to use spatial memory to locate previously hidden food. Experiments using the radial maze have allowed researchers to control for a number of variables, such as the type of food hidden, the locations where the food is hidden, the retention interval, as well as any odour cues that could skew results of memory research. In particular, studies have indicated that rats have memory for where they have hidden food and what type of food they have hidden. This is shown in retrieval behaviour, such that the rats are selective in going more often to the arms of the maze where they have previously hidden preferred food than to arms with less preferred food or where no food was hidden.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Slug (Marshall Lancaster), who {{had been}} seen {{on-screen}} dating Becky in her early appearances, returned. The two characters share a backstory, which was partially created by Lancaster and Kelly themselves. During an interview with Digital Spy Kelly spoke the impact Slug has had on Becky stating: [...] "Marshall and I have invented a whole back story between us. It's nice <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> Becky came from and what a journey she's had. Slug was {{an important part of}} Becky's life– they’ve got a lot of history. They grew up together and looked out for each other." [...] The storyline progresses into Slug confessing his love for Becky. Kelly points out that Becky has been on a journey, subsequently changing, stating that [...] "Becky and Slug didn't know what love was" [...] and that she proves she has changed by rejecting his advances.|$|E
500|$|In 1941 Holloway took a {{character}} part in Gabriel Pascal's film of Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara, {{in which he}} played a policeman. He had leading parts in later films, including The Way Ahead (1944), This Happy Breed (1944) and The Way to the Stars (1945). [...] After the war, he played Albert Godby in Brief Encounter and had a cameo role as the First Gravedigger in Laurence Olivier's 1948 film of Hamlet. In 1951 Holloway played the same role on the stage to the Hamlet of Alec Guinness. For Pathé News, he delivered the commentary for documentaries in a series called Time <b>To</b> <b>Remember,</b> <b>where</b> he narrated over old newsreels from significant dates in history from 1915 to 1942. [...] Holloway also starred {{in a series of}} films for Ealing Studios, beginning with Champagne Charlie in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder. After that he made Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Another Shore (1948). [...] He next appeared in three of the most famous Ealing Comedies, Passport to Pimlico (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). His final film with the studio was Meet Mr. Lucifer (1953).|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of backing tracks {{on the first}} three sides of the album were recorded at I.D. Sound Studios, Los Angeles, engineered by James Lowe with assistance from John Lee. The studio {{was one of the}} first independent units in LA, and Lowe believes Rundgren chose it due to the ability to work hands-on without record company interference and having all the latest technology and equipment. Rundgren played every instrument in turn, starting with the drums, noting it [...] "was the logical place to start," [...] with the others individually laid down on top. While recording the drums, Rundgren would try and hum the song in his head <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> he was, but [...] "if I would screw up, then I would change the song afterwards, to fit the mistake that I had made, because it was easier than going back and fixing it." [...] In retrospect, Rundgren felt he might have performed better with a click track, being a novice drummer at the time, but concluded that the end result [...] "sound like a band". He didn't think his lack of technical proficiency on the instrument was a particular handicap, saying that [...] "people comprehend what you're playing, and it has a greater impact." [...] Engineering the album, Lowe recalled he was [...] "mostly working in the dark", and that Rundgren would leave spaces for instruments during recording, spontaneously developing a song as it was being recorded. [...] "I was never sure exactly where the song was going until we'd put down about four or five tracks." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{more serious}} {{objection}} concerns the film's [...] "timeline". This {{is important because}} Kodachrome II movie film, as far as is known, could only be developed by a lab containing a $60,000+ machine, and the few West Coast labs known to possess one did not do developing over weekends. Patterson's brother-in-law Al DeAtley claims not <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> he took the film for development—or even where he picked it up.|$|E

[...] The [...] "glass" [...] has a hole for your head while it rests on your shoulders and touches the ground on top of your ball. Also, the backswing should be slightly steeper than the downswing. [...] At the top of your backswing, your back should be facing the target.|$|E

2500|$|To {{celebrate}} the 10th anniversary of What to Do When You Are Dead, the band performed {{a series of}} shows in September, October and December 2015, during which they performed the album in its entirety. In 2015, Maria Sherman of Fuse.tv wrote that the album [...] "laid the foundation for future pop-punk bands to explore concept records in very real ways". Calling it [...] "impressive at the time, this band from the suburbs [...] a power pop-punk record with a linear, intricate narrative". AXS contributor Tarynn Law wrote that [...] "the instantly relateable tracks that filled What To Do When You Are Dead soundtracked the teenage angst of kids {{all around the country}} for years to come". Brian Aberback of NorthJersey.com noted that the album [...] "put Armor for Sleep on the indie-rock map and continues to resonate heavily with fans 10 years later". Jorgensen later called the album a [...] "diary entry. Without that, I {{think a lot of people}} when [...] lives go on they forget what they went through at a certain point in time so for me that’s the biggest markers for me <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> I was at the point in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{account of the}} {{creation}} of the art of memory centers around the story of Simonides of Ceos, a famous Greek poet, who was invited to chant a lyric poem in honor of his host, a nobleman of Thessaly. While praising his host, Simonides also mentioned the twin gods Castor and Pollux. [...] When the recital was complete, the nobleman selfishly told Simonides that he would only pay him half of the agreed upon payment for the panegyric, and {{that he would have to}} get the balance of the payment from the two gods he had mentioned. A short time later, Simonides was told that two men were waiting for him outside. [...] He left to meet the visitors but could find no one. [...] Then, while he was outside the banquet hall, it collapsed, crushing everyone within. The bodies were so disfigured that they could not be identified for proper burial. But, Simonides was able <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> each of the guests had been sitting at the table, and so was able to identify them for burial. This experience suggested to Simonides the principles which were to become central to the later development of the art he reputedly invented.|$|E
2500|$|Hunting poodles {{typically}} are dogs with lightning quick reflexes, sprinting hard on command after the downed bird {{and having a}} prodigious ability <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>where</b> the bird fell and (though {{not as good as}} the English Pointer) a decent nose to sniff and track a bird hiding in tall grass Recently, [...] Miniature Poodles have also begun {{to be added to the}} list of hunters in the field: in January 2002, the Canadian Kennel Club opened their Working Certificate program to poodles of all sizes and later in 2014 the American Kennel club opened their Hunt Test program to miniature poodles; in 2017 both the Standard and Miniature were declared eligible for American Kennel Club Spaniel Tests, a program [...] designed for testing dogs with flushing capabilities. Typically, a Miniature Poodle will be the smallest dog of all in the field as it weighs less than 25 lbs or about 10 kg: this is even less than a Boykin Spaniel, the former smallest dog, which weighs closer to 35 lbs, or 16 kg. [...] However, hunters in the USA and Canada have found them very useful for woodcock, chukar, mallards, and smaller ducks like the green-winged teal [...] and bufflehead: their tiny size is an asset in getting at corners and brush that comparatively more massive retrievers cannot reach or where bramble is too thick for cocker spaniels to access.|$|E
