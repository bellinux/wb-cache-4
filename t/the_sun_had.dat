5|$|From {{at least}} the 4th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and {{surrounded}} by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle, whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the Sun. In {{the form of the}} Sun disc Aten, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski {{suggested}} that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend. Richard Muller, {{a professor of}} physics at Berkeley, was part of a team that {{suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> an unseen stellar companion which caused this periodicity, with this hypothetical companion being dubbed Nemesis. Muller was already involved in the automated supernova searches underway at Leuschner, and began the search for Nemesis using the optical telescopes at Leuschner Observatory.|$|E

5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E
5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his {{coworkers}} produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>had</b> been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, news {{had reached}} Charles Town that Bonnet's vessels were moored in the Cape Fear River. Robert Johnson, {{governor}} of South Carolina, authorised Colonel William Rhett to lead a naval expedition against the pirates, even though the Cape Fear River was in North Carolina's jurisdiction. After a false start due to the appearance of another pirate ship near Charles Town, Rhett arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Cape Fear River on 26September with two eight-gun sloops, the Henry and the Sea Nymph, and a force of 130 militia men. Bonnet initially mistook Rhett's squadron for merchantmen and sent three canoes to capture them. Unfortunately for Rhett, his flagship Henry had run aground in the river mouth, enabling Bonnet's canoe crews to approach, recognize the heavily armed and manned sloops as hostile and return uninjured to warn Bonnet. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>had</b> set by the time the rising tide lifted the Henry off the river bottom.|$|E

5|$|Sunday was a rest day, so {{the match}} resumed on Monday, 10 February. As {{it was a}} working day, the crowd was much smaller. Rain had fallen and <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>had</b> baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket, which caused erratic behaviour. Nat Thomson was out for a duck without {{addition}} to the overnight total, and a collapse ensued. New South Wales made only 49 in their second innings; Bannerman top-scored with 20 while six of his colleagues failed to score, while Emmett and Ulyett took four and five wickets respectively, including four wickets in four balls for the latter. England thus won by an innings and 41 runs.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{were thought}} by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and {{epicycle}} motions. Although {{the idea that}} the planets orbited <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> been suggested many times, {{it was not until the}} 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.|$|E
5|$|The story began {{serialisation}} in Tintin magazine from 16 September 1948, {{before beginning}} its serialisation in the French {{edition of the}} magazine from 28 October 1948. Rather than continuing {{at the point where}} he had previously left off, Hergé started the story from scratch. He nevertheless made revisions to {{the early part of the}} story, namely by reworking the characters of Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus, as well as the location of Marlinspike Hall, into the narrative, all of which were elements that had been introduced to the Adventures of Tintin during the intervening eight years. Hergé was contractually obliged to produce two pages of comic for each issue, and in the previous adventure, Prisoners of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>had</b> fulfilled this by producing two pages of new Tintin stories each week. Seeking to limit his workload, he would only produce one page of Land of Black Gold per issue, with the other page being filled by a re-serialisation of old stories from his Jo, Zette and Jocko series.|$|E

25|$|Strom was {{suspended}} from working any further {{games in the}} 1976 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Phoenix Suns after Game 2 because <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>had</b> complained about <b>the</b> foul disparity {{of the first two}} games in the series. In the first two games, the Celtics attempted 58 free throws while <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>had</b> 44.|$|R
25|$|The Sun is also {{assigned}} three spheres. The second completes its {{motion in}} a year instead of a month. The inclusion of a third sphere implies that Eudoxus mistakenly believed that <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> motion in latitude.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1998, {{experiments}} {{began to}} show that solar and atmospheric neutrinos change flavors (see Super-Kamiokande and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory). This resolved the solar neutrino problem: the electron neutrinos produced in <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> partly changed into other flavors which the experiments could not detect.|$|E
25|$|However {{plausible}} it {{may appear}} at first sight, the nebular hypothesis still faces the obstacle of angular momentum; if <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> indeed formed from the collapse of such a cloud, the planets should be rotating far more slowly. The Sun, though it contains almost 99.9 percent of the system's mass, contains just 1 percent of its angular momentum. This means that the Sun should be spinning much more rapidly.|$|E

25|$|The English {{reply was}} {{initially}} jittery. The pace of Brett Lee {{and accuracy of}} Glenn McGrath shook the English opening batsmen Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss. Trescothick, for example, was caught off a no ball from Lee, but survived, as the openers lasted nearly 25 overs – before Strauss was caught behind off Brad Hogg for 41. By that time, however, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>had</b> come out, the ball didn't swing much in the air, and as Lee kept on bowling no balls – seven in total – things simply wouldn't work out for Australia. Trescothick used 132 balls to bring up his century, skipper Michael Vaughan made a healthy contribution with 59 not out, and England brought up the winning total with four overs to spare.|$|E
25|$|At the {{distance}} of a gun-shot from the dune behind which these preparations were in progress, Menéndez had drawn {{a line in the}} sand with his spear, across the path they were to follow. Then he ordered the captain of the vanguard which escorted the prisoners that on reaching the place indicated by the line he was to cut off the heads of all of them; he also commanded the captain of the rearguard to do the same. It was Saturday, September 29, the feast of St. Michael; <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>had</b> already set when the Frenchmen reached the mark drawn in the sand near the banks of the lagoon, and the orders of the Spanish admiral were executed. That same night Menéndez returned to St. Augustine, which he reached at dawn.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 WNBA All-Star Game {{was held}} on July 25 at 3:30pm in the Mohegan Sun Arena. It {{was the second time}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>had</b> hosted the game.

But they later won 7 out of their next 10 games, putting them in playoff position. Halfway through the season, however, there was a three-way tie for second place which included the Sun, the Dream, and the Mystics. The Sun, plagued by a late-season injury to all-star Asjha Jones missed the playoffs {{for the first time since}} moving from Orlando. Sun fans found an unwelcome and unfamiliar ending to the 2009 season. They finished overall with a 16–18 record and finished 6th in the East.
