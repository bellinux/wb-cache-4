5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs <b>to</b> <b>deflate.</b> The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E
5|$|The American press {{exaggerated the}} {{encounter}} between Irene and the American ships, which prompted Diederichs {{to decide to}} send Irene away from the area <b>to</b> <b>deflate</b> tensions between the two countries. After returning to Manila and debarking the non-combatants, Irene was ordered to depart the Philippines. Irene relieved Arcona in Kiaochou, which was in turn ordered to steam to the Caroline and Mariana Islands to observe the American capture of Guam. Irene coaled in Mariveles before departing for Kiaochou on 9 July. While in Kiaochou, Irene conducted crew training. She returned to Manila in November, but remained there only briefly, before she was replaced by Kaiserin Augusta. Irene returned to Germany after 1901; in 1903 she went into drydock at the Imperial Shipyard in Wilhelmshaven for modernization, which was completed by 1905. She was stricken on 17 February 1914 and used as a submarine tender, based in Kiel. In 1916, she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven. She remained there until 26 November 1921, when she was sold for scrapping for 909,000Marks. She was broken up the following year in Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts <b>to</b> <b>deflate,</b> and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the {{iterative}} {{solution of}} large sparse linear systems we develop a theory {{for a family}} of augmented and deflated Krylov space solvers that are coordinate based {{in the sense that the}} given problem is transformed into one that is formulated in terms of the coordinates with respect to the augmented bases of the Krylov subspaces. Except for the augmentation, the basis is as usual generated by an Arnoldi or Lanczos process, but now with a deflated, singular matrix. The idea behind deflation is to explicitly annihilate certain eigenvalues of the system matrix, typically eigenvalues of small absolute value. The deflation of the matrix is based on an either orthogonal or oblique projection on a subspace that is complimentary <b>to</b> the <b>deflated</b> approximately invariant subspace. While an orthogonal projection allows us to find minimal residual norm solutions, the oblique projections, which we favor when the matrix is non-Hermitian, allow us in the case of an exactly invariant subspace <b>to</b> correctly <b>deflate</b> both the right and the corresponding left (possibly generalized) eigenspaces of the matrix, so that convergence only depends on the non-deflated eigenspaces. The minimality of the residual is replaced by the minimality of a quasi-residual. Among the methods that we treat are primarily deflated versions of GMRes, MinRes, and QMR, but we also extend our approach <b>to</b> <b>deflated,</b> coordinate space based versions of other Krylov space methods including variants of CG and BiCG. Numerical results will be published elsewhere...|$|R

500|$|After {{a year at}} RADA, Morrissey {{went back}} to Liverpool to perform in WCPC at the Liverpool Playhouse.
