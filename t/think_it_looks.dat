500|$|David Jaffe, {{creator and}} Game Director of the {{original}} God of War, spoke with NowGamer prior to the first press announcement in late April. He {{said that if he}} had worked on Ascension, he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and [...] "look to the Zelda structure as a jumping off point". He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added [...] "I'd love to see player one be Kratos and player two be this stupid annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck". In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, [...] "If {{it turns out to be}} the case that the single player is watered down because of , then I think they have some justification. But I don't see any evidence of that, and I don't see evidence of that based on the team they are." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the music video, Us Weekly ran a cover story titled Britney Vs. Justin: The War Is On. Timberlake denied that Spears {{inspired}} the video, saying, [...] "The video is not about her. The video is about me." [...] However, Spears told Rolling Stone in October 2003 that she received a call from Timberlake saying there would be a look-alike of her would be in a music video with him. She states that he reassured her by saying, [...] "Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal". Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it. She recalled that when she asked why he had made a video about her, he replied, [...] "Well, I got a controversial video." [...] She stated that it was a great publicity stunt, commenting, [...] "So he got what he wanted. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like such a desperate attempt, personally." [...] After {{the release of}} Spears' video for [...] "Toxic" [...] (2003), Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News said her video [...] " [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] look like child's play".|$|E
2500|$|... 2001: [...] is a Disney {{animated}} film. It featured some of {{the ideas}} of Edgar Cayce in which ships and aircraft were powered by a form of energy crystal. This version of Atlantis looks different than what the explorers <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like, as it is more similar to an Aztec city than a Greek polis.|$|E
60|$|As {{they were}} walking home, James said that the squirrel's back looked wet, where the dye went upon him, {{but he did not}} <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> very blue.|$|R
60|$|The prince looked {{well at the}} carriage. He did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> so unsafe as his servant said; but he {{had given}} his word and he held to it.|$|R
5000|$|The town is {{depicted}} as a somewhat rich town. Though Jackie <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like Paris (to which Donna replies [...] "No wonder you think Kelso could be a model!"), the town is often verbally bashed by numerous characters throughout the series.|$|R
2500|$|Following the race, Powell had an {{ultrasound}} showing new {{tears in his}} abductor muscles as well as scar tissue in a previous injury. The groin injury appears to be season-ending as manager Paul Doyle believes Asafa will miss {{the remainder of the}} year. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> good {{for the rest of the}} season for Asafa," [...] he lamented. Powell was not able to compete for Jamaica in the men's 4 × 100 m relay on 10 August.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} his {{contract}} issues with Liverpool, Gerrard {{told the press}} after the final, [...] "How can I leave after a night like this?" [...] but negotiations soon stalled and on 5 July 2005, after Liverpool turned down another lucrative offer from Chelsea, Gerrard's agent Struan Marshall informed Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry that Gerrard was rejecting a club-record £100,000-a-week offer. Parry conceded the club had lost Gerrard, saying, [...] "Now {{we have to move}} on. We have done our best, but he has made it clear he wants to go and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> pretty final." [...] The next day, Gerrard signed a new four-year deal as Parry blamed the earlier breakdown of talks on miscommunication between the two sides. Gerrard stated upon signing the contract that he would rather win one premier league medal than win multiple titles at Chelsea as it would mean more to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "All young Martian brides {{dress that}} way," [...] Erick said. He {{clutched}} the case tightly as they ran. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> fine." ...|$|E
50|$|Marquis de Baccarat, {{a highly}} {{polished}} villain. It is {{well enough to}} describe his character, as no one would <b>think</b> <b>it</b> to <b>look</b> at him.|$|R
6000|$|... "He carries {{them about}} with him everywhere, ma'am." [...] (Has {{the one we}} bought {{yesterday}} with him now, though you might not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> to <b>look</b> at him.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you know}} whence this sort of fellow gets his sulk? not from life; for he's often {{too much of a}} recluse, or else too young to have seen {{anything}} of it. No, he gets it from some of those old plays he sees on the stage, or some of those old books he finds up in garrets. Ten to one, he has lugged home from auction a musty old Seneca, and sets about stuffing himself with that stale old hay; and, thereupon, <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> wise and antique to be a croaker, <b>thinks</b> <b>it's</b> taking a stand-way above his kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Artists <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> best by lamplight," [...] he said. [...] "The big {{pediment}} {{between the}} windows keeps {{out the light}} in the daytime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Shabaka," [...] he went on, [...] "in Persia royal {{blood is}} common also, {{though some of}} us <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> best when it is shed. What else are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm getting rather hoarse, I fear, After so much reciting : So, if {{you don't}} object, my dear, We'll try {{a glass of}} bitter beer - I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> inviting." ...|$|E
50|$|The initial goal is that {{in three}} years time, the player must bring up the farm by growing and selling crops, and raising livestock. There are also plenty of secrets to unlock in the game. At {{the end of the}} first year, the mayor of the city comes back to the farm to check up on <b>it.</b> If he <b>thinks</b> <b>it's</b> <b>looking</b> good, the player may {{continue}} the game for another couple years. If he thinks the farm is short of success, a second chance is given to revitalize the farm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose {{every one}} has some little immortal spark {{concealed}} about him. You would not <b>think</b> <b>it,</b> to <b>look</b> at them. There is no {{a priori probability}} about it. A strange enigma is man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose {{one must}} keep one's promises, Mrs Bowater, {{even to a}} stranger. Would half-past six be too early to keep mine, do you <b>think?</b> Would <b>it</b> <b>look</b> too--forward? Of course he may have {{forgotten}} all about me by this time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, of course," [...] replied Crumps, in some confusion, [...] "but I mean-- that is, don't you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like {{flying in}} the face of Providence to give it the same name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well; I am {{as likely}} to find my Rainbow there as here, and any other place is as likely as there. It {{all depends on the}} weather. Do you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like rain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Cliff, {{grasping}} Burke by the arm, [...] "don't you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> {{very much}} as if that Captain Hagar was trying to run away with the treasure which has been entrusted to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{left the}} underworld {{before you came}} to it," [...] said Sally. [...] "You wouldn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> to <b>look</b> at him, but he was once a prune-eater among the proletariat, even as you and I. Mrs. Meecher looks on him as a son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} ask," [...] he sighed. [...] "You may not <b>think</b> <b>it,</b> to <b>look</b> at his ingenuous and honest expression, but the fact, nevertheless, remains that Mr. Cullen is a misguided but zealous {{member of the}} Sherlock Holmes fraternity: in short, a detective." ...|$|R
5000|$|October 1966: The Monkees' {{debut album}} is released. Group member Nesmith, in particular, is angered {{when he sees}} the album cover, because he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> makes <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like they played all of the instruments.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear,' said Mrs. Meadows. 'I {{dare say}} Mr, Dusautoy {{is a very}} good man, but I wish he would allow his poor {{delicate}} wife more butcher's meat, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> well to see the vicarage without a man-servant.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think girls {{ought not}} to make up in the street, either," [...] Louise remarked, primly. [...] "A little powder {{in the house is}} all very well"--(Louise had a nose which gave her trouble)--"but I really don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> respectable in the street." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There may be, but that's the {{principal}} thing. I must say I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> very exclusive, going round all alone, {{as if you}} thought no woman {{was good enough for}} you. Do you think you're better than any one else in the world? In America it's usual for people to marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Adeline {{began to}} cry. [...] "I want to <b>think.</b> <b>It</b> seems such a dreadful thing {{to sell the}} place. And why need you hurry to send off a letter to Mr. Hilary about it? Won't it be time enough, when Mr. Putney has the {{writings}} ready? I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will <b>look</b> very silly to send word beforehand. I could see that Mr. Putney didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was business-like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It beats me--it's bran-new--I've never {{struck the}} mate to it before. But I swear I <b>think</b> you'd do <b>it.</b> <b>Look</b> here, I'll send for the station-master.' ...|$|R
2500|$|O'Sullivan {{was born}} in South Boston. He moved to the Savin Hill section of Dorchester with his wife, Mary, {{with whom he had}} six children. He worked for the state Massachusetts Department of Public Works until he was injured on the job in 1970 working on an MBTA tunnel at South Bay, Boston in South Cove. He had also {{previously}} worked as a bartender in South Boston. His wife Mary worked at Girl's Town (Girls Town of Somerville) on Morrissey Boulevard. She later told reporters, [...] "Bill was a kind father. He wasn't strict with the children. He like young people, however, he was against... long hair... he didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I feel {{satisfied}} {{of their}} earnestness, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like a stable, permanent work. Yet I need {{not tell you}} how my old text is ever in my mind, [...] "Thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged." [...] Now more than ever are your prayers needed for dear old George Sarawia and his infant Church.|$|E
6000|$|... "A pretty {{deal to do}} with it! We may all {{be ruined}} for what I know--the country's in that state! Some say it's the end of the world, and be hanged if I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like it! Anyhow, it's not a time for me to be drawing money out of my business, and I should wish Lydgate to know that." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS GEORGE. Why didnt {{you tell}} me that before? Sonny is just the name I wanted for you. [She pats his cheek familiarly; he rises {{abruptly}} and goes to the hearth, where he throws himself moodily into the railed chair] Bill: I'm not going into the hall until there are enough people there to make a proper little court for me. Send the Beadle for me when you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> good enough.|$|E
60|$|They {{went into}} the drawing-room, and Clay chose an easy chair at some {{distance}} from the others. He cared nothing for music, but he felt shaky, and he was glad of an excuse for sitting quiet. Moreover, he wanted time to <b>think.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> as if the doctor, whom he had begun to doubt, had after all been right. He had had a warning which he could not neglect; and as he rather vacantly watched the girl at the piano it was borne in upon him that she had probably saved his life. The others had thought him insensible, but she had guessed that he was feeling for the remedy which had pulled him round.|$|R
6000|$|The stage hero {{is a very}} {{powerful}} man. You wouldn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> to <b>look</b> at him, but you wait till the heroine cries [...] "Help! Oh, George, save me!" [...] or the police attempt to run him in. Then two villains, three extra hired ruffians and four detectives are about his fighting-weight.|$|R
6000|$|Peter laughed again. [...] "He always does," [...] said he. [...] "If he didn't, he wouldn't be happy. You wouldn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> to <b>look</b> at him, but he {{is happy}} right now. He doesn't know it, {{but he is}}. He always is happy when he can show what a bad temper he has." ...|$|R
