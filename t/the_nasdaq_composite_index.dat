5000|$|He [...] "sealed his fame" [...] as an {{investor}} when he correctly identified the dot-com bubble {{at a time}} the Dow Jones Industrial Average was posting annual gains that had averaged 25 percent from 1995 to 1999.

In this paper, I examine the performance of bidders acquiring high-tech targets. First, I find positive abnormal returns for the bidders during 1996 - 2003. Using the market model and a control-firm approach, I find that abnormal returns were higher before the stock market crash of 2000. Second, I determine the relation between the characteristics of bidders and their excess returns. A positive relationship between managerial ownership and abnormal returns is observed. Third, I study the changes in the accounting-based performance measures of the bidders, and find that high-tech acquisitions completed before the crash were accompanied by poor post-acquisition performance, over a one-year comparison window. Finally, I also find evidence that cash-rich bidders acquired high-tech targets to seize growth opportunities, and as a result, earned high abnormal returns. Overall, my results suggest that investors were overoptimistic about the future performance of high-tech mergers, but have lowered their expectations over tim...|$|R
40|$|We propose two {{rational}} expectation {{models of}} transient financial bubbles with heterogeneous arbitrageurs and positive feedbacks leading to self-reinforcing transient stochastic faster-than-exponential price dynamics. As {{a result of}} the nonlinear feedbacks, the termination of a bubble is found to be characterized by a finite-time singularity in the bubble price formation process ending at some potential critical time t̃_c, which follows a mean-reversing stationary dynamics. Because of the heterogeneity of the rational agents' expectations, there is a synchronization problem for the optimal exit times determined by these arbitrageurs, which leads to the survival of the bubble almost all the way to its theoretical end time. The explicit exact analytical solutions of the two models provide nonlinear transformations which allow us to develop novel tests for the presence of bubbles in financial time series. Avoiding the difficult problem of parameter estimation of the stochastic differential equation describing the price dynamics, the derived operational procedures allow us to diagnose bubbles that are in the making and to forecast their termination time. The tests performed on three financial markets, the US S&P 500 index from 1 February 1980 to 31 October 2008, <b>the</b> US <b>NASDAQ</b> <b>composite</b> <b>index</b> from 1 January 1980 to 31 July 2008 and the Hong Kong Hang Seng index from 1 December 1986 to 30 November 2008, suggest the feasibility of advance bubble warning. ...|$|R
