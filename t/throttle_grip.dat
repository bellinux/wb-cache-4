2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned trochoid pump. Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the <b>throttle</b> <b>grip.</b> The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple blanking plug at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|E
5000|$|This {{engine was}} more {{powerful}} with [...] compared to [...] of it's processor , Jawa 250/353. The new engine {{was equipped with}} new a piston and cylinder, having larger intake channels. The carburetor was directly mounted on the cylinder, and the choke was controlled by the <b>throttle</b> <b>grip.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{ease the}} pilot's workload, a {{mechanical}} throttle correlator adjusts the throttle as the collective pitch control is raised or lowered. The pilot {{needs to make}} only small adjustments by twisting the <b>throttle</b> <b>grip</b> on the collective throughout the flight regime. Later models are also equipped with an electronic governor which works to maintain RPM within normal operating limits (between 97% and 104% RPM); the governor is active only when the engine is running above 80% RPM, and is most effective in normal flight conditions. The governor can be switched on or off with a toggle switch located {{at the end of}} the pilot's collective pitch control. When the governor is not engaged, a yellow caution light glows on the instrument panel.|$|E
60|$|Temptation {{had seized}} Mr. Caryll in a <b>throttling</b> <b>grip,</b> {{and for two}} whole days he kept the house, shunning all company and wrestling with that same Temptation. In the end he took a {{whimsical}} resolve, entirely worthy of himself.|$|R
60|$|Vain {{were the}} trooper's struggles to free himself from that <b>throttling</b> <b>grip.</b> Already his efforts grew {{his face was}} purple; his veins stood out in ropes upon his brow till they seemed upon the point of bursting; his eyes {{protruded}} like a lobster's {{and there was a}} horrible grin upon his mouth; still his heels beat the bed, and still he struggled. With his fingers he plucked madly at the throttling hands on his neck, and tore at them with his nails until the blood streamed from them. Still Galliard held him firmly, and with a smile--a diabolical smile it seemed to the poor, half-strangled wretch--he gazed upon his choking victim.|$|R
50|$|The Chairiot solo {{is not a}} conversion; it was {{designed}} from inception {{to be driven by}} a disabled person using a wheelchair. The vehicle is entered through a large rear door and integrated ramp; a floor dock secures the wheelchair to the car. It is controlled by a steering wheel with a spinner knob, along with a combination twist <b>grip</b> <b>throttle</b> and lever for braking. All controls are operable with modest upper body strength. There are no foot pedals in the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game was}} made {{available}} in two-player cabinets featuring two monitors and two replica motorcycles; players accelerate their bikes by holding down the <b>throttle</b> <b>grip</b> and brake {{by using the}} brake lever, while steering is accomplished by physically leaning the bike left or right. The arcade game can be played by up to eight players simultaneously by linking four two-player cabinets together, and the players must complete an entire lap of the track within a preset time limit - and upon completion of a lap, the time is extended for all players in the race. The first player to complete a preset number of laps (between 3 and 6 and adjustable by the arcade operator) wins the race; as in Final Lap and Dirt Fox (the latter of which was only released in Japan), if they manage to finish the race {{in less than a}} preset time, they {{will have the opportunity to}} enter their initials upon the game's [...] "best time" [...] (as opposed to high score) table.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} compare a conventional helicopter Thrust Control Lever (TCL) to the Rotational Throttle Interface (RTI) for tiltrotor aircraft. The RTI is designed to adjust its orientation to match {{the angle of the}} tiltrotor s nacelles. The underlying principle behind the design is to increase pilot awareness of the vehicle s configuration state (i. e. nacelle angle). Four test pilots flew multiple runs on seven different experimental courses. Three predominant effects were discovered in the testing of the RTI: 1. Unintentional binding along the control axis resulted in difficulties with precision power setting, 2. Confusion in which way to move the <b>throttle</b> <b>grip</b> was present during RTI transition modes, and 3. Pilots were not able to distinguish small angle differences during RTI transition. In this experiment the pilots were able to successfully perform all of the required tasks with both inceptors although the handling qualities ratings were slightly worse for the RTI partly due to unforeseen deficiencies in the design. Pilots did however report improved understanding of nacelle movement during transitions with the RTI...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{having only}} a single rotor, the RE5's engine was {{mechanically}} complex and its numerous subsystems made for a heavy motorcycle. Rotary engines produce a lot of heat, and the RE5 had [...] water- and oil-cooling, and double-skinned exhaust pipes. [...] Ignition was CDI, with two sets of ignition points actuated via vacuum and rpm sensors, to light a solitary NGK spark plug. Three oil reservoirs served the sump, gearbox and total loss tank. Separate oil pumps fed (respectively) the main bearings and the inlet tracts (to lubricate tip seals). The throttle controlled both the primary carburetor butterfly and a second valve in the inlet manifold of the secondary throat (the [...] "port" [...] valve), as well as governing oil supply to the combustion chamber. Five cables in total were moved by the <b>throttle</b> twist <b>grip!</b> The carburetor {{was similar to that}} in a rotary-powered car, and was far more complicated than for normal motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} model year was 1971, though the sled {{had been in}} development since 1969. There were two 1971 models, the Raider and the Roamer. The 1971 Raider featured a single cylinder JLO 2-stroke engine {{in the beginning of}} the model year, but later may have switched to CCW. The 1971 Roamer featured a 10 hp Briggs & Stratton 4 cycle engine. The production numbers are unknown, but it is believed that approximately 50 '71 Roamers and 50 '71 Raiders were produced. 1971 Raiders and Roamers featured a twist <b>grip</b> <b>throttle,</b> which was found to be hard to control in bumpy conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of the twist <b>grip</b> <b>throttle</b> control was on the Roper steam {{velocipede}} of 1867-69. Rather than a sleeve that rotated around the handlebar, Sylvester H. Roper's steam motorcycle's entire handlebar rotated, with a dual mode operation. When rotated forward it opened the throttle, and when rotated backwards it applied the spoon brake. Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr said that pioneering this technology was a point {{in favor of the}} Roper's precedence as the first motorcycle, in response to Cycle World Technical Editor Kevin Cameron's position that the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen was more deserving because it used the more successful technology, internal combustion rather than steam. The design drawings of the Reitwagen depicted a twist grip speed control, also applying the brake when turned one way, but when turned the other way, it would have tensioned the belt drive's idler pulley, applying power to the rear wheel {{in the manner of a}} clutch. The actual working model, however, did not have the twist grip, belt drive, or brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Kiekhaefer Mercury foresaw {{that the}} average American's {{interest}} in boating would increase after the war. Kiekhaefer introduced a 19.8 cubic inch, 10 horsepower (hp), two-cylinder alternate firing design engine at the 1947 New York Boat Show called the [...] "Lightning" [...] or KE-7. This engine, also called the [...] "Super 10", actually developed around 14 horsepower. Its designation was updated to KF-7 for 1949. For 1951 the engine block, though still displacing 19.8 cubic inches, was updated a great deal, and given the name [...] "Hurricane". The 1951 kg-7 [...] "Super 10" [...] featured this engine, which developed around 16 horsepower. For 1952, this model was updated with a [...] "forward, neutral, reverse" [...] gearset, and a twist <b>grip</b> <b>throttle.</b> It was renamed [...] "Cruiser" [...] at this point, and no longer called [...] "Super 10". This engine later became {{the heart of the}} [...] "Mark 25", of the mid to late fifties. Initially rated at 16 horsepower, this engine was soon beefed up to 20. There was also an [...] "H" [...] version, which produced more power but carried no rating. [...] "H" [...] version Mercurys were mostly used for racing.|$|R
5000|$|The race {{also saw}} teams banned {{from using the}} [...] "off-throttle blown {{diffuser}}" [...] concept. Previously, teams had mapped their engines to burn fuel when the driver lifted off the throttle. This created exhaust gasses that were routed over the diffuser {{at the rear of}} the car, generating additional downforce. This counters the loss of downforce experienced with blown diffusers when the driver lifts off the throttle. Compared to a car with a conventional blown diffuser, the additional downforce produced while off <b>throttle</b> improves <b>grip</b> under braking and in slower corners while also making the car's handling less throttle sensitive. Some estimates suggested that this allowed teams to find upwards of one second per lap. Off-throttle blown diffusers had been a source of controversy when the FIA previously banned them at the , only to recant the ban twenty-four hours later pending a discussion with the sport's Technical Working Group, and prompting Hispania to threaten a protest of the race results. This led to speculation that engine supplier Cosworth had been unable to map their engines appropriately and thus could not take advantage of the off-throttle concept as none of the Cosworth-powered teams - Virgin, Williams and Hispania (as well as the Ferrari-powered Sauber and Toro Rosso teams) - were using off-throttle blown diffusers. Charlie Whiting, the FIA's technical delegate, ruled that off-throttle blown diffusers qualified as a movable aerodynamic part because the concept used moveable parts within the engine to manipulate relative levels of aerodynamic grip, and were therefore illegal under the FIA's long-standing ban on moveable aerodynamic parts. The ban stated that teams may only map their engines to use ten percent of available throttle power when under braking, with further restrictions to be introduced in [...] Adrian Newey, Red Bull Racing's technical director, admitted that his team had the most to lose from the ban on off-throttle blown diffusers because the Red Bull RB7 had been designed around the concept, in comparison to other teams who had simply applied it to their respective cars after the fact.|$|R
