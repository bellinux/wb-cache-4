5|$|The MLS, {{which has}} teams that play {{in both the}} United States and Canada, was allowed to enter eight of its fifteen U.S.-based teams in the tournament. The <b>top</b> <b>six</b> MLS teams from the {{previous}} season's league standings qualified automatically for the tournament, while the remaining two spots were determined by preliminary qualification matches. The eight MLS entries began play {{in the third round}} of the tournament. In 2010, Seattle Sounders FC finished among the <b>top</b> <b>six</b> in the MLS overall league standings to qualify for the third round of the 2011 U.S. Open Cup. The Chicago Fire however, did not and therefore had to play a series of qualification matches against fellow MLS teams that finished outside of the <b>top</b> <b>six</b> to qualify for the Open Cup tournament.|$|E

5|$|From 1921–22, {{the third}} tier of The Football League {{consisted}} of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling {{to hold on to}} their league status. There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams in each of the two divisions had to apply for re-election to the league. Watford finished outside the <b>top</b> <b>six</b> league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kent's departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in 1926–27, but were unanimously re-elected to the league after a ballot of clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League. By contrast, under Neil McBain and subsequently Bill Findlay, the team recorded five consecutive <b>top</b> <b>six</b> finishes between 1934–35 and 1938–39, and won the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1937. The Football League was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War.|$|E
