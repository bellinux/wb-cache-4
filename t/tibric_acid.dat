40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} indicates that some compounds which produce hepatic peroxisome proliferation in rats also appear to produce Leydig cell adenomas, and some also affect the serum concentrations of testosterone and estradiol. Previous studies with the peroxisome proliferator ammonium perfluorooctanoate showed a direct effect on Leydig cells to alter steroidogenesis. It was therefore proposed that peroxisome proliferators in general may directly affect Leydig cell function to produce Leydig cell tumors by some undetermined mechanism. The present study investigated whether the following peroxisome proliferators directly affect Leydig cell function in vitro: 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, ammonium perfluorooctanoate, acetylsalicylic acid, clofibric acid, ciprofibrate, gemfibrozil, tiadenol, <b>tibric</b> <b>acid,</b> trichloroacetic acid, trichloroethylene, and Wyeth 14, 643.

40|$|Hypolipidaemic {{drugs and}} {{industrial}} plasticizers such as di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, which cause proliferation of hepatic peroxisomes, also cause {{an increase in}} an 80000 -mol. wt. polypeptide in the liver of rats and mice. This polypeptide has been designated as PPA- 80 (PPA, for peroxisome-proliferation-associated; 80 for 80000 mol. wt.). The polypeptide PPA- 80 was purified to over 90 % purity from livers of rats treated with the peroxisome proliferators Wy- 14, 643, nafenopin, <b>tibric</b> <b>acid</b> and clofibrate by a single-step preparative sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoretic procedure. The antibodies raised against the PPA- 80 polypeptide isolated from livers of rats treated with Wy- 14, 643 cross-reacted with polypeptide PPA- 80 purified from the livers of rats treated with Wy- 14, 643, {{as well as from}} the livers of rats treated with nafenopin, <b>tibric</b> <b>acid</b> and clofibrate. The anti-(polypeptide PPA- 80) antibodies did not cross-react with catalase, a marker enzyme for peroxisomes, or with NADPH–cytochrome P- 450 reductase, which has the same approximate mol. wt., 80000. The intensity of immunoprecipitin bands formed with microsomal, large-particle and postnuclear fractions from livers of animals pretreated with peroxisome proliferators was significantly greater compared with equal amounts of protein from corresponding fractions obtained from control animals, suggesting that these agents all enhance the synthesis of the same 80000 -mol. wt. polypeptide. Although the polypeptide PPA- 80 was increased in the postnuclear, large-particle and microsomal fractions of livers of rats pretreated with peroxisome proliferators, the relative abundance of this peptide in the peroxisome-rich light-mitochondrial fraction and its lack in highly purified mitochondrial fractions suggest the localization of this polypeptide in peroxisomes and/or microsomal fraction. Additional studies are needed to establish unequivocally the subcellular localization of the polypeptide PPA- 80 and to ascertain if this polypeptide is identical with the multi-functional protein displaying enoyl-CoA hydratase and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities that was purified by Osumi & Hashimoto [(1979) Biochem.

40|$|Clofibric acid (CPIB) {{and several}} other {{systemic}} hypolipidemic drugs are shown to block phosphatidylcholine synthesis by inhibiting cholinephosphotransferase (ChoPTase; CDPcholine: 1, 2 -diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase, EC 2. 7. 8. 2) and particularly lysolecithin acyltransferase (LLAcylTase; acyl-CoA: 1 -acylglycero- 3 -phosphocholine O-acyltransferase, EC 2. 3. 1. 23) of rat liver microsomes. Whereas millimolar drug concentrations are required to affect de novo lecithin synthesis catalyzed by ChoPTase, reacylation of lysolecithin by LLAcylTase is inhibited at micromolar levels. Increasing effectiveness in ChoPTase inhibition is observed in the series CPIB, SaH- 42 - 348, <b>tibric</b> <b>acid,</b> S- 321328, WY- 14643, S- 8527, and DH- 990, with IC 50 ranging from 22 mM (CPIB) to 0. 3 mM (DH- 990). LLAcylTase inhibition by the hypolipidemic drugs follows the same general pattern, but IC 50 concentrations range from 9 mM (CPIB) to 40 microM (DH- 990). The agents inhibit ChoPTase (Ki, 25 - 0. 25 mM) and LLAcylTase (Ki, 10 - 0. 025 mM) noncompetitively. The data suggest that inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, particularly by the LLAcylTase pathway, {{may be related to}} a drug's effectiveness in decreasing serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels by blocking lipoprotein synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Male Swiss-Webster mice {{were fed}} diets {{containing}} four hypolipidemic agents which {{are known to}} induce proliferation of hepatic peroxisomes. Treatment with all four drugs (clofibrate; its structural analogue, nafenopin; and two drugs structurally unrelated to clofibrate, <b>tibric</b> <b>acid</b> and Wy- 14, 643) produced a marked hepatomegaly in the mice. The extent {{of the increase in}} liver weight correlated well with the increases in total hepatic DNA and in the collective volume of hepatocyte peroxisomes. Treatment with these drugs also produced similar increases in the activities of peroxisome-associated enzymes. The most dramatic increases were noted in the activities of the short-chain (8 - to 26 -fold) and medium-chain (4 - to 11 -fold) carnitine acyltransferase. Significant increases were also noted in the activities of catalase (twofold to threefold), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (twofold to threefold) and the long-chain carnitine acyltransferase (twofold to fourfold). Activity of the latter enzyme, however, is not known to be associated with peroxisome fractions. Concomitant administration of actinomycin D or cycloheximide with a single oral dose of clofibrate diminished the increases in liver weight and carnitine acyltransferase which occurred with clofibrate treatment alone. The finding that the major increase in activity of peroxisome enzymes occurred in those associated with metabolism of acyl CoA groups supports the hypothesis that the hypolipidemic action of the drugs and the proliferation of hepatic peroxisomes are related functions...|$|E
