25|$|Intersex {{people are}} {{excluded}} almost completely. Intersex isn’t {{as rare as}} it seems; about 1% {{of the population is}} intersex in some way. News medias outline {{what it means to be}} male or female, which causes a gap for anyone who doesn’t fall into those two categories. This has led newspapers to bring up issues like intersexuality in athletes due to sports being gendered, leaving <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> to everyone on what exactly is intersexuality. This was brought to worldwide attention with the case of Caster Semenya, where news spread on sporting officials having to determine whether she was to be considered female or male.|$|E

[...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E

[...] Peter Collins of the South Wales Echo said that he had been [...] "glued to the television" [...] every lunchtime for the countdown towards the 6000th episode. Collins added [...] "Never mind who shot JR. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>question</b> now is: who pushed PR? [...] It is a fascinating question which the programme writers are likely to string out for longer than the Chilean miners were down the mine." [...] Matt Bayliss of The Express admitted that he was not afraid to say [...] "teatime telly has never looked so good". A Western Mail reporter stated that Neighbours had pulled out one of soap opera [...] "momentous episodes that get everyone talking." [...] A Daily Record journalist proclaimed [...] "Things have got a little Orient Express on Ramsay Street recently. After all, it's harder to find somebody without a motive to attack Paul Robinson than somebody with one, which is proving difficult." [...] The Daily Mail's soap critic Jaci Stephen stated [...] "Who pushed Paul Robinson? It's a cliff-hanger on Friday, as Mr Nasty's wicked ways catch up with him. It's not quite a storyline of the epic proportion of Who Killed JR? from the days of Dallas, but back in Erinsborough, there are just as many suspects." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band.

Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve.
