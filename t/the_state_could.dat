5|$|Besides the 1874 Supreme Court ruling, a {{critical}} moment came on December 15, 1879, when Judge Lorenzo Sawyer of the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in Orton, 32 F. 457 (C.C.D. Cal. 1879), {{that the federal government}} controlled the railroad land grants, and more importantly, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> not control ultra vires acts of corporations.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 the State of New Jersey named Rutgers College {{as their}} sole land grant college. Pursuant to the Morrill Act of 1862, this {{designation}} gave federal lands {{to the state}} that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> then sell {{to raise money to}} develop practical education in agriculture, science, military science and engineering.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 2003, {{the state}} Supreme Court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> {{proceed with the}} sale of bonds {{financing}} Pullman Square and 48 other projects throughout the state.|$|E
5000|$|In 1885, the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} there were two {{additional}} ways in which <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>could</b> acquire federal enclaves: (1) <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>could</b> [...] "cede" [...] legislative jurisdiction to <b>the</b> United <b>States,</b> and (2) <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>could</b> [...] "reserve" [...] legislative jurisdiction at the time of statehood. The Supreme Court added that these [...] "cessions" [...] and [...] "reservations" [...] were not limited to Enclave Clause ("needful building") purposes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{presence}} of these three conditions meant that congress had chosen to [...] "occupy the field" [...] and thus <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>could</b> not regulate within it.|$|R
2500|$|Deakin v Webb [...] {{was one of}} {{a series}} of cases {{concerning}} whether <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> tax <b>the</b> income of a Commonwealth officer. The High Court of Australia overruled a decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria, holding that <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>could</b> not tax <b>the</b> income of a Commonwealth officer. [...] This resulted in conflict with the Privy Council, a conflict which was ultimately resolved by the passage of Commonwealth law in 1907, that permitted <b>the</b> <b>States</b> to tax <b>the</b> income of a Commonwealth officer. The constitutional foundation of the decision was overturned by the subsequent decision of the High Court in the 1920 Engineers' Case.|$|R
5|$|The third case, Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Washington (Puyallup III), {{was decided}} in 1977. Members of the Puyallup Tribe filed suit, arguing {{that under the}} {{doctrine}} of sovereign immunity, Washington state courts lacked jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on tribal reservations. Writing {{for a majority of}} the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens held that, despite the tribe's sovereign immunity, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> regulate the harvest of steelhead trout in the portion of the river that ran through the Puyallup Reservation as long as <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> base its decision and apportionment on conservation grounds.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} state governments issued {{requests}} for tender for {{the supply of}} sterile fluids and PD fluids. Baxter responded to the requests with tenders that put forward two alternative pricing options: either a state could purchase sterile fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate, or <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> buy each product separately but at a higher rate.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E

2500|$|Sherman's {{proposal}} came {{up again}} {{for the third time}} from Oliver Ellsworth (CT). In the [...] "senate", <b>the</b> <b>states</b> should have equal representation. Advocates said that it could not be agreed to, the union would fall apart somehow. Big states would not be trusted, <b>the</b> small <b>states</b> <b>could</b> confederate with a foreign power showing [...] "more good faith". If delegates could not unite behind this here, one day <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>could</b> be united by [...] "some foreign sword". On the question of equal <b>state</b> representation, <b>the</b> Convention adjourned in the same way again, [...] "before a determination was taken in the House.".|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} loss to <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>could</b> be {{measured on a}} trillion-dollar scale.|$|R
5|$|Marguerite Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; {{it was so}} empty that when the Wars of Castro mercenaries were paid for, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer afford to}} pay interest on government bonds. Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. In August 1663 Marguerite Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E
5|$|Within four days, 2,300 men had {{answered}} Ellsworth's call. A selection {{of only the}} most desirable men cut that number to 1,100, which was considered a regiment's full strength. When <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> not afford to supply the new troops, fundraisers were successful in raising $60,000 for the regiment, enough to provide uniforms, several different models of Sharps rifles, and provisions.|$|E
5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade before <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, and extend US1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>State</b> Legislature <b>could</b> provide {{funding to}} {{eliminate}} railroad crossings ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>states</b> <b>could</b> not. As to {{the first}} theory, <b>the</b> Court <b>stated</b> {{that it was not}} {{presented}} with any evidence suggesting that the speech was likely to cause an incitement to violence. As to the second theory, <b>the</b> Court <b>stated</b> that while it was a closer call, the rationale was not sufficient.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the costs associated with}} staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during the shutdown. The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during the shutdown, which meant <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would come to a halt by mid-August if no more tax stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing liquor purchasing cards, which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their liquor purchasing cards before the shutdown. However, the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} the shutdown, July 1. Liquor purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, Breckinridge {{served as}} an {{independent}} commander in the lower Mississippi Valley, securing Confederate control of the area by taking Port Hudson, which helped halt the federal advance down the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, General Braxton Bragg, commanding the Army of Mississippi, was preparing an invasion of Kentucky, and Breckinridge was ordered to join him. Confederate leaders believed that Breckinridge's presence in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> spur enlistments. Van Dorn was reluctant to lose command of Breckinridge and his men, {{and by the time}} he relented on October 15, Bragg was already retreating from the state after being defeated at the Battle of Perryville. Breckinridge and his division of 7,000 men met Bragg at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. With Kentucky solidly under Union control, Breckinridge's wife and children moved south and followed his troops as closely as was safely possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{news agency}} {{was founded in}} 1937, when the country was still a colony in the Dutch Empire, by {{independence}} activists dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} local coverage by the Dutch-owned Aneta news agency. Antara's operation was absorbed into the Dōmei Tsushin news network following invasion by the Japanese in 1942. Its staff {{played a key role in}} the broadcast of Indonesia's proclamation of independence and assumed control of the Dōmei facilities in the region at the end of the war. The agency remained under private management until it was placed under the control of the presidency in the 1960s when the government shifted its focus from decolonization to nation-building. Antara became an institution through which <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> promote its policies.|$|E
50|$|The Civil War {{came after}} years of {{struggle}} over the issues of slavery and states' rights. People who believed in the doctrine of states' rights believed that <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>could</b> nullify federal laws. Some supporters of states' rights also believed that <b>states</b> had <b>the</b> right to leave the Union. Louisiana's political leaders hoped the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850 would protect slavery and preserve the Union. But <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> planters saw <b>the</b> increasing pressure from abolitionists as an economic threat. Louisiana, like <b>the</b> other <b>states,</b> <b>could</b> not see <b>the</b> desolation that lay ahead when it entered a war expected to last only a few weeks.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, however, in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Court {{held that}} Congress had {{exceeded}} its power {{by attempting to}} require <b>the</b> <b>states</b> to reduce <b>the</b> voting age to 18. This led to adoption of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the Constitution in 1971, which provided that <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>could</b> not set a minimum voting age higher than 18.|$|R
5000|$|Despite this, coins of the Australian pound {{were not}} {{introduced}} until 1910. From 1901 to 1910 <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>could</b> not issue tender and the Commonwealth had not issued tender, so private currency {{was used as}} the common medium of exchange whilst the British pound sterling was the national unit of account.|$|R
5|$|The war {{had ended}} before series {{production}} was started, and the Defence Forces {{did not need}} new vehicles. On the contrary, the army had {{to reduce the number}} of vehicles according to the Moscow Armistice. The frustrated component suppliers left the business and the Ministry of Trade and Industry terminated the vehicle supply contract from the end of 1946. In early 1946, Yhteissisu had agreed with the Ministry of Trade and Industry that vehicles not bought by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> be sold on the civilian market. Sisu S-22s became available for sale at 12 SAT locations in Finland. The company presented a lighter, lower-cost model, the S-22K, at the Helsinki Domestic Industry Fair in May 1946.|$|E
5|$|Introducing {{more taxes}} {{proved to be}} hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, {{and the people of}} the state simply did not have that much money to give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion of a Republican official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E
25|$|Governor George Pataki {{estimated}} that damage in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> exceed $100 million.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposal}} was vetoed by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and <b>could</b> not operate in 2009-2010.|$|R
5000|$|In 1937, {{because of}} concern over <b>the</b> lack of <b>state</b> law on federal enclaves, the Supreme Court held that <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>could</b> reserve some {{jurisdiction}} to themselves in consenting to federal legislative jurisdiction. In response, <b>the</b> <b>states</b> began to amend their [...] "consent" [...] and [...] "cession" [...] statutes to reserve <b>state</b> jurisdiction, including <b>the</b> {{power to tax}} enclave residents.|$|R
5000|$|The {{disposition}} of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> ground <b>could</b> obviate adjudication {{of the federal}} constitutional ground.|$|R
25|$|Section 18 {{cancelled}} the state's {{right to}} appoint, nominate, elect or confirm clerics for a post. But the amendment added, that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> regulate the minimum education required for clerical posts, the {{appointment and dismissal}} of clergymen and servicemen of religion, and define the limits of ecclesiastical disciplinary measures.|$|E
25|$|Passage of Proposition 187 {{reflected}} state residents' {{concerns about}} illegal immigration into the United States {{and the large}} Hispanic population in California. Opponents believed the law was discriminatory against immigrants of Hispanic origin; supporters generally insisted that their concerns were economic: that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> not afford to provide social services for so many who entered the state illegally or overstayed their visas.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>could</b> obtain no {{conviction}} in Morris, unable to produce solid evidence even though, in Whipple's words, “the jurors, {{as well as}} the Court, were convinced we had indicted the right men”. Of the 15 accused in Maples, the jury convicted 3: William Clampit, Wash McKinney, and Reuben Hodges. The three men convicted in Morris appealed their case (now Hodges v. United States), which the Supreme Court accepted in March 1904.|$|E

However, he held that <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>could</b> not suppress truthful information about a lawful economic activity, simply {{out of fear of}} potential consequences.|$|R
