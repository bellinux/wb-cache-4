5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale {{died in a car}} crash on Interstate 95. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|Rachel, who is {{spending}} {{most of her time}} in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy (Susannah Doyle). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men {{in order to have a}} child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by his extramarital affair is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee), a man she has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is still the same insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark.|$|E
25|$|It is {{just before}} dawn. Four priests are {{mourning}} {{the death of}} King Séthos. They wish he had died an honourable death in battle, but the terrible truth {{is that he was}} murdered by the brother he loved. Dawn breaks as Queen Nephté arrives with her young son to pay tribute to her dead husband. Nephté says that it is only <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> child which keeps her alive, otherwise life is barren for her without Séthos. She asks the priests to reveal who killed him. When the arrival of her brother-in-law Pharès is announced, the priests are horrified and Nephté begins to suspect he is the murderer. Pharès tries to flatter Nephté. He also claims it was Séthos' dying wish that he should become her new husband. Nephté admits this is true but she thinks it wrong to talk of marriage while Séthos is still unavenged. However, Pharès seems reluctant to search for the assassin, but at Nephté's insistence he finally agrees to swear on his brother's tomb that he will bring the criminal to justice. The priests are shocked at this sacrilege. After Pharès has left, the chief priest Amédès reveals what Nephté has suspected: Pharès is the killer. Nephté demands vengeance, but she also fears for her son's safety. Amédès agrees to hide the boy among the tombs. He says {{it will be difficult to}} get revenge because Pharès is both respected and feared by the Egyptians. The temple opens as the statesmen and common people arrive for Séthos' funeral rites. The temple girls reveal that Sethos is now an immortal in heaven. Nephté implores the Egyptians to avenge her husband. They swear on the altar to do so. Amédès says he will reveal the murderer's name that evening.|$|E
60|$|For {{memories}} of love are more Than the white moon there above, And dearer than quiet moonshine Are <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> I love.|$|R
60|$|And in {{this also}} {{there had been}} some craft. She had been as it were forced to guard <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own heart; and had, therefore, turned the river of the {{conversation}} right through the heart <b>of</b> <b>her</b> companion.|$|R
60|$|She uttered {{these words}} with an affectionate and anxious tone, which showed, that devotional {{as were the}} {{habitual}} exercises <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mind, <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nursling yet bound her to earth with the cords of human affection and passion.|$|R
500|$|In , hope is {{suppressed}} by the dictatorship. As the Judge Advocate {{states in the}} novel, [...] "the President's first rule of conduct is never to give grounds for hope, and everyone must be kicked and beaten until they realise the fact". It {{can be argued that}} Camila represents hope in the novel because both her father and husband were able to persevere under the dictatorship by thinking of her; however, the President destroys this sense of hope with false stories. When <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> loyalty is eliminated, both her father and husband die because they have lost the hope of returning to her. Furthermore, Camila's happiness with her child and their escape to the countryside {{can be seen as the}} one glimpse of hope in an otherwise dark and disturbing ending. For critic Jean Franco, it is love that offers what little hope there is in the novel: [...] "The system is undermined only by lovethe love of an idiot for his mother, a woman trying desperately to save her husband from death." ...|$|E
60|$|But he only felt {{a deeper}} horror. <b>The</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> made him shrink convulsively.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dusautoy went back, fairly cried at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's vexation, and {{the scandal}} {{to the whole}} town.|$|E
5000|$|The tiles in {{the hall}} of the poor and in the chapel of the Hôtel-Dieu honor the love of Nicoas Rolin for his wife: it shows their {{monogram}} and motto [...] "Seulle", signifying that she was the sole woman in <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband.|$|R
50|$|The next day, as she {{is walking}} through the halls, Buffy finds that she can hear <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> others. In class, she answers the teacher's {{questions}} by listening to <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> classmates. She also hears <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> Freddy Iverson, who writes editorials for the school newspaper and who has a negative opinion about everything at Sunnydale.|$|R
50|$|Nishtha {{was founded}} by the Viennese {{physician}} Dr. Barbara Nath-Wiser, living in India, in <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> deceased husband. In the year 2004 the community centre was built beside the clinic. Since that time, courses and various events as well as workshops for woman’s rights, self-help, health and environment are increasingly taking place.|$|R
60|$|He was surprised, {{and also}} in a sense disappointed. It was {{astonishing}} to find how unpleasant <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> leaving Medchester was to him.|$|E
6000|$|Ah! to get away--away from oneself! But at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> baby, {{her heart}} fell again. [...] "Is your leg quite hopeless?" [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|One trouble, however, shot its {{slanting}} bolts athwart {{the shining}} warmth of that opening day and marred its perfection, {{and that was}} <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father.|$|E
60|$|He {{knew his}} power over her. He {{knew that she}} would not insist upon his leaving her. He knew that, her fears for him being aroused, she would be uneasy if he were out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sight. For all his seeming levity and carelessness, he knew {{whatever}} he chose to know <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> heart.|$|R
60|$|And Amabel {{always liked}} to be shut in by herself, dearly as she loved them all, and mamma especially; there was always {{something}} pleasant in being able to return to her own world, to rest in <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband, and in the possession of the little unconscious creature that had come to inhabit that inner world of hers, the creature that was only his and hers.|$|R
60|$|Of course Editha must be hopelessly puzzled. <b>The</b> very <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> vague conjecturings {{had caused}} him to laugh as maniacs laugh at times.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm sure,'--and {{she broke}} off, unable to express herself; then added, 'Lady Martindale! I was frightened before at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> {{but it is}} much worse now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only {{it is so}} VERY lonely here!' Alice said in {{a melancholy}} voice; and at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{loneliness}} two large tears came rolling down her cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{could do}} a thing like that, I'd die happy!" [...] she exclaimed impetuously, as a feeling of despair came over her at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own poor attempts.|$|E
50|$|Ms. Atwood {{published}} nothing after A Suggestive Inquiry. Walter Leslie Wilmshurst, in his 1918 {{introduction to}} the reissue, laments that <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> later years did not find fruition in another work. He claims, however, {{that there is much}} to be found in <b>her</b> papers, <b>of</b> which he was then in possession. These have not yet been published. The special collections archive of the Brown University library currently holds around 700 of Ms. Atwood's letters.|$|R
60|$|Later Aline was {{to wonder}} at this. But {{at the moment}} all <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> which <b>her</b> half-numbed mind was capable was {{bestowed}} upon their desperate errand.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bolton came in {{with the}} little girl's wraps; they were very common and poor, and <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> getting <b>her</b> {{something}} prettier went through Annie's mind.|$|R
60|$|It exasperated her beyond measure. She {{could not}} get out of the Church the {{satisfaction}} he got. <b>The</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> soul was intimately mixed up with <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own self. Indeed, her soul and her own self were one and the same in her. Whereas he seemed simply to ignore the fact of his own self, almost to refute it. He had a soul--a dark, inhuman thing caring nothing for humanity. So she conceived it. And in the gloom and the mystery of the Church his soul lived and ran free, like some strange, underground thing, abstract.|$|E
60|$|Mysie herself {{heard her}} destiny without much elation, {{though she was}} very fond of Lady Phyllis, and the tears came into her eyes at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> being unwell and wanting her.|$|E
6000|$|At <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> line--it sounded somehow so general--she {{released}} {{him a little}} with a sigh, yet still looking round, as it were, for possibilities. [...] "Jane, you know, is in a state." ...|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, {{he looked}} at her side-wise, and sharply; and when her eyes met his with the same old frankness, <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> losing <b>her</b> maddened him.|$|R
5000|$|... : Queen Elizabeth II sent {{a letter}} to King Harald V of Norway {{describing}} how <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and <b>the</b> Duke of Edinburgh were with the Norwegian people: [...] "I am deeply saddened and shocked by the tragic loss of life of so many people on the island of Utoeya and in Oslo. Prince Philip joins me in extending our heartfelt sympathy to Your Majesty and the people of Norway. Our prayers and thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by the dreadful atrocity." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{look back}} upon it I am aware <b>of</b> one thing: <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> leaving <b>her</b> there and saving myself never crossed my mind. The one {{place for me}} was where she was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I suppose it's <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> late husband!" [...] {{promptly}} replied Miss Inchman, {{who felt}} that it devolved on her to say something, and that quickly. Mrs. Cliff looked up in amazement.|$|E
60|$|It was in {{the grey}} time of dawn. She trembled in a sweat of disquiet, {{and not being able}} to endure <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brother being asleep, she went and tapped at his door.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brother's kindness, and {{the effect}} of his consolation, made Lilias awake that morning in more cheerful spirits; but it was not long before grief and anxiety again took {{possession}} of her.|$|E
60|$|Roxy's pet castle--an {{occasional}} dollar from Tom's pocket--was tumbling to ruin {{before her}} eyes. She could not abide such a disaster as that; she couldn't endure <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>Her</b> remark amused Chambers.|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} no easy task for Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover to {{convince}} their wives {{that it would be}} best to send the boys to some strict boarding school instead of to the private school which they had been attending in the metropolis. Gentle Dora Rover had cried a little at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> having <b>her</b> only son Jack leave home, and Grace Rover had been affected the same way at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> parting from <b>her</b> only boy Fred.|$|R
60|$|Joan had not {{strength}} to go on. <b>The</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Gulden made <b>her</b> faint.|$|R
