5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, three of the Bruins' best forwards decided to join the Royal Canadian Air Force midway through the 1941–42 season. These three forwards made up the Kraut Line, {{one of the best}} lines in the NHL. Despite missing three of their best players, the Bruins managed to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals the next season. In the finals, they were eliminated by the Red Wings, four games to none. Due to his play in the regular season, Brimsek was again named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. However, it was popular opinion at the time that Brimsek deserved <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> the First All-Star Team over Johnny Mowers, including Mowers' own coach and general manager, Jack Adams.|$|E
5|$|The colour {{alone is}} not a {{reliable}} guide to determine the species, as some scarlet robins (P.boodang) take on an orange hue, but while male scarlet and red-capped robins (P.goodenovii) have red breasts and black throats, the flame robin's breast plumage extends {{right up to the}} base of the bill. It is also a little slimmer and has a smaller head than the scarlet robin, and is clearly larger than the red-capped. Females of the respective species are harder to tell apart. Those of red-capped, rose and pink robins are all smaller, with wing lengths less than , smaller than the smallest flame robin. The female scarlet robin has a more pronounced red flush to the breast and <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> the crown above the bill is more prominent and white rather than off-white.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} Ghazis fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's {{official}} historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed {{the position of}} the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that Ghazi had come up to periscope depth to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to crash dive, which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: {{on the night of the}} explosion, Rajput was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two depth charges on <b>the</b> <b>spot,</b> <b>on</b> a position that was very close to the wreckage. The third possibility is that there was a mishap when Ghazi was laying mines on the day before hostilities broke out.|$|E

Moreover, the mages themselves can deliver the energy to any target, by simply pointing out <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> the globe. The magic can also create a protective spell to defend a city and deflect the magical energy hurled against it. It is speculated that using humans may make a more powerful magical explosion.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{was born}} in Newcastle upon Tyne, at 9 Pleasant Row, Shieldfield, {{about a mile from}} the city centre. Although the house in which he was born no longer exists, an inscribed granite tablet marks <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> which it once stood. At that time the area, next to the Pandon Dene, was rural. His father, also called William, was a corn {{merchant}} on the Newcastle quayside, who rose through the ranks of Newcastle society to become mayor of the town in 1850. An elder sister, Anne, born in 1802, was named after his mother, the daughter of Addison Potter.|$|E

25|$|A mass {{uprising}} {{broke out}} in the Alleppey​ region in October 1946. On 24 October Travancore police killed near about 200 people in Punnapra and the government ordered martial law in Alleppey and Cherthala. CP's police and army moved to Alleppy and on 27 October, Vayalar witnessed another mass uprising and 150 people were killed on <b>the</b> <b>spot.</b> <b>On</b> the same day 130 people were killed in different locations of Alleppey in police shoot-outs. According to Prof. A Shreedhara Menon's Kerala History, about 1,000 people died in the Punnapra Vayalar Agitation. Even though the agitation was a short-lived failure, it resulted in better administration of Travancore.|$|E

Following those victories, Kenny suffered his first loss to UFC regular Drew Fickett via decision at Combat Zone 7– Gravel Pit on July 10, 2004.

25|$|The gonys is the ventral {{ridge of}} the lower mandible, created by the {{junction}} of the bone's two rami, or lateral plates. The proximal end of that junction—where the two plates separate—is known as the gonydeal angle or gonydeal expansion. In some gull species, the plates expand slightly at that point, creating a noticeable bulge; {{the size and shape}} of the gonydeal angle can be useful in identifying between otherwise similar species. Adults of many species of large gulls have a reddish or orangish gonydeal spot near the gonydeal expansion. This spot triggers begging behavior in gull chicks. The chick pecks at <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> its parent's bill, which in turn stimulates the parent to regurgitate food.|$|E
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} at the moment when the earth opened up, Korah's sons were {{suspended}} in the air. When the sons of Korah saw the gaping abyss below {{on one side and the}} fire of Gehinnom on the other, they were unable to open their mouths to confess. But as soon as thoughts of repentance stirred in their hearts, God accepted them. Whatever thoughts one of the sons developed, the others developed as well, so that all three were of one heart. The area around them split apart, but <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> which each stood was not touched. They stood separately like three pillars. Moses, Aaron, and all the great scholars came to hear the song of the sons of Korah, and from this they learned to sing songs before God.|$|E
25|$|While Jolson was touring with a stage show during June 1927, {{production}} on The Jazz Singer {{began with the}} shooting of exterior scenes by the second unit. In late June, Alan Crosland headed to New York City to shoot the Lower East Side and Winter Garden exteriors on location. Jolson joined the production in mid-July (his contract specified July 11). Filming with Jolson began with his silent scenes; the more complex Vitaphone sequences were primarily done in late August. Both Jolson and Zanuck would later take credit for thinking up the ad-libbed dialogue sequence between Jack and his mother; another story had it that Sam Warner was impressed by Jolson's brief ad-libbing in the cabaret scene and had Cohn {{come up with some}} lines on <b>the</b> <b>spot.</b> <b>On</b> September 23, Motion Picture News reported that {{production on}} the film had been completed.|$|E

25|$|On June 6, New York City {{voted to}} approve the {{beginning}} of construction of the Grand Central Parkway, which would connect from the Interborough Parkway to the Northern State at Lake Success. Construction of the project would begin in 1932 with paving and landscaping. Governor Roosevelt announced on July 22 that {{he would come to}} the site where the Northern State and the Grand Central would eventually meet and lay a new cornerstone to mark <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> <b>on</b> July 26. The governor, who was touring throughout Nassau and Suffolk County, called the project a significant upgrade to provide the city with proper traffic outlets. Roosevelt laid mortar on the previously placed cornerstone, while Robert Moses announced that state aid would be requested. The day prior, the contract for grading of the new parkway from the city line to Lakeville Road along with construction of the Long Island Motor Parkway and Lakeville Road bridges was awarded. As Moses had warned, the LISPC requested over $5.5million in funds for the projects to be completed in 1932. All the land for it had been accepted to the commission, and a majority of the money went to paying for the Northern State Parkway.|$|E
