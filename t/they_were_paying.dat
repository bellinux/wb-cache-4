5|$|The Abwehr {{was right}} {{to worry about the}} {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> large sums of money, but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{respond to}} the sound of snake hissing, angry voices of adults, the {{crackling}} sound of a fire, thunder, and the cries of other infants. They have a drop in heart rate, their eyes blinking, increased turning toward the speakers or parent, all of these indicating that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> more attention. This is believed by some to be evolutionary response to danger.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} some hostility between players and management, {{not the least}} of which came to a head when Carmine Isacco was sent home by the team for no {{apparent}} reason. Speculation was that management was unhappy with how much <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> him, and were trying to run him out of town. While not public, there was a series of disturbing occurrences behind the scenes that reinforce that speculation.|$|E

25|$|In the 1900s, Fair Lawn {{residents}} were bitter about the schooling situation {{as part of}} Saddle River Township; the schools were either dilapidated or too far away for Fair Lawn residents, and citizens {{felt that they were}} not getting schools comparable to the tax money <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying.</b> As such, a movement to separate from Saddle River Township was born. Fair Lawn residents petitioned to the state, asking to incorporate as an independent borough, and in April 1924, the borough of Fair Lawn was voted into existence.|$|E
25|$|The {{land in the}} environs of {{the town}} was taken under cultivation, and olive groves were planted to {{increase}} Assyria's deficient oil production. The town was of rectangular layout and measured 1760 by 1635 m. The length of the walls was 16,283 Assyrian units, corresponding to the numerical value of Sargon's name. The town was partly settled by prisoners of war and deportees {{under the control of}} Assyrian officials, who had to ensure <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> sufficient respect to the gods and the king. The court moved to Dur-Sharrukin in 706 BC, although it was not completely finished.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, The Economist {{estimated}} that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 {{billion per year}} to federal tax revenue during the 2013–2014 periods. Peter Singer wrote in the New York Times that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry {{and that it would}} likely not exist without it. In other words, taxpayers might be more inclined to change behavior or the system itself if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> $200 billion more in taxes each year related to health insurance. To put this amount in perspective, the federal government collected $1,146 billion in income taxes in 2008, so $200 billion represents a 17.5% increase in the effective tax rate.|$|E

25|$|In December 1991, LKAB {{stated that}} they wanted to take over the {{operation}} of the ore trains from NSB and SJ. At the time, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> 0.15 Swedish krona (SEK) per tonne kilometer in Sweden and 0.30 Norwegian krone (NOK) per tonne kilometer in Norway, while comparable rates abroad were between SEK0.03 and 0.10 per tonne kilometer. While SJ had several times during the 1980s agreed to reduce their rates, NSB had not offered the same, and was making a profit of NOK 60 to 70 million per year. LKAB {{stated that they}}, by taking over operations themselves, could save SEK200 million per year. In addition, they stated that they could save between SEK 50 to 100 million in auxiliary fields. LKAB had sent an application to Swedish authorities for permission to take over operations, and had received positive feedback from SJ. NSB, on the other hand, did not support a solution where they did not operate the trains themselves. LKAB stated that if an agreement with NSB could not be reached, they would shift all their transport to the Port of Luleå.|$|E
25|$|NBC's {{requests}} {{became more}} unreasonable and the O'Brien camp refused them, {{such as the}} right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (i.e., a joke about the conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued on into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host {{to walk away from the}} network. Following his Wednesday, January 20 edition, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. Meanwhile, Ron Meyer passingly suggested to Zucker and Gaspin, based off the public outcry, that they should stick with O'Brien; the two executives agreed to send him on his way. O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.|$|E
500|$|For a {{few years}} after his assassination, Garfield's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story—that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States. Peskin noted that, [...] "In {{mourning}} Garfield, Americans were not only honoring a president; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations." [...] As the rivalry between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after, so too did memories of Garfield. Beginning in 1882, the year after Garfield's death, the U.S. Post Office began issuing postage stamps honoring the late President. Despite his short term as President, nine different issues were printed over the years. In the 1890s, Americans became disillusioned with politicians, and looked elsewhere for inspiration, focusing on industrialists, labor leaders, scientists, and others as their heroes. Increasingly, Garfield's short time as president was forgotten.|$|E

The biggest shows {{when we were on}} the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense," [...] continued Gelbart. [...] "But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'" [...] Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. [...] "So you know what they said?" [...] Gelbart said. [...] "'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor."

2500|$|Upon leaving Mitchell-Lama, {{the owners}} of rental {{buildings}} built since 1974 can raise rents without restriction. Tenants whose buildings had federally-subsidized [...] "236" [...] mortgages may qualify for federal [...] "enhanced" [...] vouchers, which allows them to pay at least what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>paying</b> and no less than 30% of their income in rent, with a government paying the balance. [...] Tenants who do not qualify for enhanced vouchers, including all tenants in post-1973 buildings that were not federally subsidized, must pay the rent set by the landlords. That the buildings {{are no longer in}} a rent-regulation program poses a particular problem for tenants who were receiving special subsidies that may not cover the new, higher rent payments, such as subsidy programs because of proverty age, and disability. In some of the buildings, tenant associations are negotiating [...] "landlord assistance plans" [...] (LAPs) to implement the increases at a slower rate and to protect some of the weakest tenants. The plans are often limited to a specific number of years, and upon their expiration, tenants may be vulnerable. LAPs do not preserve the stock of affordable housing for future tenants.|$|E
