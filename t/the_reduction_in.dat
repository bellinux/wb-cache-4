The setting for this paper is a large US emissions cap and trade market – the NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) – that has greatly reduced NOx emissions since its initiation in 2003. Using rich quasi-experimental variation, we find that <b>the</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> NOx emissions decreased the number of summer days with high ozone levels by about 25 %. The NBP also led to <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> expenditures on prescription pharmaceutical expenditures of about 1. 9 %.

40|$|The {{relentless}} {{technological change}} in telecommunication industry is forcing down {{many of the}} cost elements of a telephone call. Already, the marginal costs {{of the use of}} telecommunication networks are so low that these services could, in reality, be almost free of charge. The technological change, together with increased competition in the sector, will therefore represent a strong force towards decreasing marginal prices of telecommunication services. This technological change will have consequences for the demand for other goods and services. Especially important are probably the effects on the demand for traditional transport services. This paper uses a consumer demand model of the Norwegian economy to analyse these consequences. The model simulations indicate that the falling prices in the telecommunication industry will multiply the demand for telecommunication while consumers expenditure on telecommunication will be approximately constant. The demand for traditional transport will be reduced, and in particular so for luxurious transport modes as air transport (with high Engel elasticity), and less so for transport by bus and rail (with low Engel elasticities). <b>The</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> demand for use of private cars and for boat transportation are larger than <b>the</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> demand for bus and rail, but less than <b>the</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> air transport...|$|R
