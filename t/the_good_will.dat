5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will. No other virtue has this status because every other virtue {{can be used to}} achieve immoral ends (the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person, for example). <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E
5|$|Edward I died in 1307 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Edward II. The new King at first enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> of his nobility, Valence among them. Conflict soon ensued, however, {{connected}} especially with the enormous unpopularity of Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston. Gaveston's arrogance towards the peers, and his control over Edward, united the Baronage {{in opposition to the}} King. In 1311 the initiative known as the Ordinances was introduced, severely limiting Royal powers in financial matters and in the appointment of officers. Equally important, Gaveston was expelled from the realm - as Edward I had already done once before. Pembroke, who was not among the most radical of the Ordainers, and had earlier been sympathetic with the King, had now realised the necessity of exiling Gaveston.|$|E
5|$|Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass {{meetings}} and rallies in Munich and elsewhere {{during the early}} 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power. Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome, the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. Göring, who was with Hitler heading up the march to the War Ministry, {{was shot in the}} leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested. With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to Innsbruck, where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December. This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg. Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to Venice. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via Florence and Siena. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.|$|E

30|$|The “destination of the goods” {{criterion}} has to {{be considered}} differently depending on {{the function of the}} facility (transshipment or storage), due to the different nature of these two logistics functions. For a warehouse (used for storage), the “destination” of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> stored <b>will</b> be <b>the</b> next facility where <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>will</b> be transported to be stored, transformed, sold or consumed, without considering the possible transshipment during the transport operation between the two facilities. For a terminal (used for transshipment), the “destination” of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> transshipped <b>will</b> be <b>the</b> next terminal where they will be transshipped again, or the final destination of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> (where they <b>will</b> be stored, transformed, sold or consumed) if the terminal hosts the last transshipment of their transport operation.|$|R
30|$|Electronic auction {{is mainly}} in the {{following}} three forms: English auction, {{which is the most}} common form of trade, is identified with the property that prices are non-decreasing. Users compete for the highest price they are willing to pay. The transaction will be stopped when the transaction deadline has come. <b>The</b> <b>goods</b> <b>will</b> be sold to the highest bidder. The first-price sealed-bid auction, the bidders will seal the bids. After the auction, the auctioneer opens the tenders and publishes the highest bid. <b>The</b> <b>goods</b> <b>will</b> sell to <b>the</b> highest bidder. The second-price sealed-bid auction, the first-price bidder is the winning bidder who buys <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> with <b>the</b> second price.|$|R
25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> of many abolitionists, {{the social}} {{integration}} of the former slaves was carried out only for a part of them, many of the Roma remaining outside the social organization of the Wallachian, Moldavian and later, Romanian society. The social integration policies were generally left to be implemented by the local authorities. In {{some parts of the}} country, the nomadic Roma were settled in villages {{under the supervision of the}} local police, but across the country, Roma nomadism was not eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Queen Meenakshi {{required}} him to swear on the Koran that he would adhere faithfully to his engagement, and he accordingly took an oath on a brick {{wrapped up in the}} spledid covering usually reserved for that holy book. He was admitted into the Trichinopoly fort and Vangaru Thirumala – apparently with <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> of the queen, who, strangely enough, {{does not seem to have}} wished him any harm – went off to Madurai, to rule over that country and Tirunelveli.|$|E
25|$|The {{rights to}} the YEC designs and <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> of the {{business}} were sold to Rolls-Royce ‘Sentinel Division’ at Shrewsbury who had previously supplied {{a high proportion of}} diesel engines used by YEC and were a competitor in the industrial locomotive market. In 1967 three locomotives were bought from Shrewsbury for use at Scunthorpe Steelworks, these were built to the Janus design to match the many similar locomotives there built in Sheffield. A fourth locomotive, to a different YEC design, was supplied to AEI in Manchester.|$|E

25|$|In section one, Kant argues from {{common sense}} {{morality}} {{to the supreme}} principle of morality, which he calls the categorical imperative. Kant thinks that uncontroversial premises from our shared common sense morality, and analysis of common sense concepts such as ‘the good’, ‘duty’, and ‘moral worth’, will yield the supreme principle of morality, namely, the categorical imperative. Kant’s discussion in section one can be roughly divided into four parts: (1) <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> (2) The teleological argument. (3) The three propositions regarding duty and (4) The categorical imperative.|$|E

25|$|While at {{that stage}} not a union, the British Association of Social Workers {{operated}} a professional advice and representation service from the early 1990s.

25|$|With {{regard to}} morality, Kant {{argued that the}} source of the good lies not in {{anything}} outside the human subject, either in nature or given by God, but rather is only <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanityunderstood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as othersas an end in itself rather than (merely) as means to other ends the individual might hold. This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.|$|E

Machiavelli argued that, had Cesare been able to win the favour of the new Pope, {{he would have been a}} very successful ruler.

25|$|The Venetians, who did {{not have}} any {{standing}} army and relied mainly on mercenaries, could only muster 8,000 men and 42 mostly small ships, under the command of the Captain General Daniel Delfin. This force was not only insufficient to meet the Ottoman army in the field, but also inadequate to man the many fortifications that the Venetians had built or enhanced during the past decades. In addition, the local Greek population disliked Venetian rule, something Damad Ali exploited, by ensuring that his troops respected their safety and property. Thus he was able to count on <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> of the Greeks, who provided his troops with ample provisions, while the Venetians, who hoped to recruit a militia amongst the native population, were left isolated in their forts.|$|E
25|$|The Muslim Ottoman Empire and Christian England were {{allies of}} {{convenience}} against Spain. While Elizabeth's armies were fighting Catholic {{forces in the}} Low Countries to prevent the Spanish from gaining secure harbours on the Channel coast to stage an invasion, England also served Turkish interests by diverting Spain from focusing on domination of the Mediterranean. In 1580, the Turks threatened to invade Poland from lands located north of the Black Sea. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> of Poland was crucial to England because trade with countries bordering the Baltic {{was the source of}} grain and the all important forest products needed to maintain the navy. Furthermore, English merchants enjoyed preferential trading privileges within the borders of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Elizabeth's intercession with the Caliphate was credited with cancelling the invasion, and she received letters of praise from then reigning Polish king, Stephen Báthory.|$|E

50|$|Harris v Nickerson (1873) LR 8 QB 286 is an English law case {{concerning}} {{the requirements of}} offer and acceptance {{in the formation of}} a contract.

25|$|It is true {{there are}} cases in which, if we confine {{ourselves}} {{to the effects of}} the first order, <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? … It is not on account of the evil of the first order {{that it is necessary to}} erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.|$|E
25|$|The {{founder of}} the nursery was Joachim Conrad Loddiges (1738–1826). He was born in Hildesheim, Lower Saxony; his father Casper Lochlies was a {{gardener}} to a nobleman in Wrisbergholzen, near Hannover. Conrad trained in The Netherlands and emigrated to Britain {{at the age of}} 19 during the Seven Years' War to take up employment as gardener for Dr J. B. Silvester in the suburban village of Hackney, north of London. It was then that the family name was anglicised. When in his forties he married, he had not accumulated sufficient savings to expand a small seed business started by fellow German émigré John Busch, which he purchased, together with <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>will</b> of Busch's clientele in 1771 and had fully paid for by 1777, by which time he began to write to people all over the world, urging them to send him packets of seeds collected from trips to native hills, valleys and plains. From these small beginnings, its initial catalogue appearing in 1777 the nursery business gained a specialist market in Britain, and was increasingly able to attract clients from estates and botanical gardens throughout Europe.|$|E
