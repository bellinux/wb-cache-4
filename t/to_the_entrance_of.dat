5|$|In common speech, {{the name}} Lam Tin {{in the past}} usually {{included}} the areas of Lei Yue Mun and Yau Tong. However, new infrastructure and housing estates that were built there are not now considered part of Lam Tin. Conventional boundaries of Lam Tin: west to Laguna City, southeast to Kwong Tin Estate, north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>of</b> Tseung Kwan O Tunnel, southwest to Victoria Harbour.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>of</b> Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E

The area around the bunker was retained as an enclave under the RAF Uxbridge name, under the care of RAF Northolt. An additional guardian, a Hawker Hurricane in the colours of No. 303 (Polish) Squadron, was added to the area in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 2015, {{all three}} Queens met, once again, at Liverpool, {{in order to}} {{celebrate}} the 175th anniversary of the shipping line. After arriving at Liverpool the previous day, Queen Mary 2 made a brief excursion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>of</b> the River Mersey to welcome her two fleetmates into port in the early afternoon. The three Cunarders then sailed, in formation, towards Liverpool. The ships spent several hours together, before the departure of Queen Mary 2 to Saint Peter Port, Guernsey.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau {{remained}} unused in Gotenhafen {{until the}} end of the war. As the Red Army advanced on the city, the remaining crew took the ship out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>of</b> the harbor and sank the vessel as a blockship on 27 March 1945. In 1947, the Polish government ordered the ship be removed, and initial salvage operations began. The ship was sealed and refloated on 12 September 1951 then completely scrapped, though it is believed that some of her steel was used in the construction of Polish merchant vessels. She was the largest ship raised at the time. Norway offered to return the turret from Trondheim in 1979, though the offer was rejected. The gun turret was instead preserved as a museum in Norway.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, a new Greek Revival {{octagonal}} synagogue {{designed by}} architect P.J. Krouse and modelled after the Temple of Athena Nike was {{built at the}} corner of 11th Street and 24th Avenue. The marble steps leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>of</b> the building were flanked by large Ionic columns. The new synagogue could seat 500 and featured stained glass windows displaying the Ten Commandments, a menorah, the Star of David, and Noah's Ark. A fire damaged the building during its first year of operation, and while it was being repaired, services were held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. By 1907, the congregation had grown to include 82 members and was led by Rabbi Max Raisin. By 1927, the Jewish community in Meridian had grown to 525 people, partly due to an influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe. The members of Beth Israel sponsored these newcomers, helping them to find jobs and homes and holding night classes to teach them English.|$|E
5|$|The Merced River and {{its tributaries}} are a popular {{recreational}} area {{in part because of}} Yosemite National Park. There are many activities within the watershed, including boating, fishing, camping and hiking. Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>of</b> Lake McClure. The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and Class IV, mostly upstream of El Portal. There is also boating on Lake McClure. Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds. Campgrounds along the Merced River {{and its tributaries}} include ones at Railroad Flat, McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, Merced Lake, Vogelsang Lake, Sunrise Creek, May Lake, Bridalveil Creek, and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake, the source of Bridalveil Creek.|$|E
5|$|The sixth William {{was briefly}} succeeded {{by his son}} Peter, who was {{followed}} by his son William. William the seventh's son was the eighth William Davenport, and an inventory of his property made shortly {{after his death in}} 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact. His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless, so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport. Warren became part of the clergy, and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>of</b> the estate. The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father, Warren at the age of four. Many changes were made to the house during his tenure, including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery, the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe. William had no sons, so the estate passed to Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
