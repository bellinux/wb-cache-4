5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} at between 1–3 years. Most Eurasian sparrowhawks {{stay on the}} same territory for one breeding season, though others keep the same one for up to eight years. A change of mate usually <b>triggers</b> <b>the</b> change in territory. Older birds tend {{to stay in the}} same territory; failed breeding attempts make a move more likely. The birds which kept the same territories had higher nest success, though it did not increase between years; females which moved experienced more success the year after changing territory.|$|E

5|$|Such {{landslides}} {{are common}} at volcanoes, {{where they are}} favoured by the steep edifices that form from lava flows being stacked {{on top of each}} other. It is not usually known what <b>triggers</b> <b>the</b> collapse, although eruption-associated earthquakes are suspected to play a role. Other volcanoes in the region with sector collapses are: Lastarria, Ollague, San Pedro, Socompa, and Tata Sabaya. The Mellado and Cerro Rosado volcanoes close to Llullaillaco also display evidence of sector collapses.|$|E

50|$|A second {{common cause}} of negligent {{discharges}} is when the gun-handler places their finger on <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> before they have decided to shoot. With the finger so positioned, many activities may cause the finger to compress <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> unintentionally. For example, if one attempts to holster the firearm with finger on <b>trigger,</b> <b>the</b> holster edge will drive the finger onto <b>the</b> <b>trigger,</b> and discharge is likely. If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with finger on <b>trigger,</b> <b>the</b> grasping motion of both hands will likely cause <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> finger to compress <b>the</b> <b>trigger.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{perception}} of greenness (in opposition to redness forming {{one of the}} opponent mechanisms in human color vision) is evoked by light which <b>triggers</b> <b>the</b> medium-wavelength M cone cells in the eye more than the long-wavelength L cones. Light which triggers this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green. A green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487570nm.|$|E
5|$|During the game's present, the war {{has ended}} but {{tensions}} are still high on both sides. The game's primary setting is the Okanos region at the Thirteen Towers, a giant fortress suspended above a giant chasm called the Scar, {{held in place by}} thirteen giant chains said to keep the Scar from growing.

5|$|Fleas are {{holometabolous}} insects, {{going through}} the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal <b>triggers</b> <b>the</b> maturation of the ovaries in females and {{the dissolution of the}} testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E

5|$|In Antigone, {{the protagonist}} is Oedipus' daughter, Antigone. She {{is faced with}} the choice of {{allowing}} her brother Polyneices' body to remain unburied, outside the city walls, exposed to the ravages of wild animals, or to bury him and face death. The king of the land, Creon, has forbidden the burial of Polyneices for he was a traitor to the city. Antigone decides to bury his body and face the consequences of her actions. Creon sentences her to death. Eventually, Creon is convinced to free Antigone from her punishment, but his decision comes too late and Antigone commits suicide. Her suicide <b>triggers</b> <b>the</b> suicide of two others close to King Creon: his son, Haemon, who was to wed Antigone, and his wife, Eurydice, who commits suicide after losing her only surviving son.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and <b>triggers</b> <b>the</b> creation of testosterone and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also <b>triggers</b> <b>the</b> release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is serotinous—it accumulates a canopy seed bank that is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire.|$|E
50|$|A {{contingent}} {{convertible bond}} is defined with two elements: <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> and <b>the</b> conversion rate. While <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> is <b>the</b> pre-specified event causing the conversion process, the conversion rate {{is the actual}} rate at which debt is swapped for equity. <b>The</b> <b>trigger,</b> which can be bank specific, systemic, or dual, has to be defined in a way ensuring automatic and inviolable conversion. A possibility of a dynamic sequence exists—conversion occurs at different pre-specified thresholds of <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> event. Since <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> can be subject to accounting or market manipulation, a commonly used measure has been the market’s measure of bank’s solvency. The design of <b>the</b> <b>trigger</b> and <b>the</b> conversion rate are critical in the instrument’s effectiveness.|$|R

So, the probability that a person <b>triggering</b> <b>the</b> alarm actually is a terrorist, is only about 99 in 10,098, which is less than 1%, and very, very far below our initial guess of 99%.|$|R
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia sceptrum {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also <b>triggers</b> <b>the</b> release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia sceptrum is a reseeder—killed by bushfire and regenerating by seed. The follicles on the old flower spikes remain closed until burnt by fire, after which they open and release the seed. New plants take three to five years to flower again. If bushfires are too frequent—occurring less than four years apart—they risk eradicating local populations of reseeders.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.attenuata {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent.

Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber, B.attenuata is one of the latter group, with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire.|$|E

Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also <b>triggers</b> <b>the</b> release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.oligantha is a reseeder; it has thin bark, and lacks a lignotuber, so it is killed by fire. However, the species is weakly serotinous: fire triggers seed release, yet seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
