5|$|Taurus {{is a big}} and {{prominent}} constellation in the northern hemisphere's winter sky, between Aries {{to the west and}} Gemini to the east; to the north lie Perseus and Auriga, to the southeast Orion, to the south Eridanus, and to the southwest Cetus. In September and October, Taurus is visible in the evening along <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon.</b> The most favorable time to observe Taurus in the night sky is during the months of December and January. By March and April, the constellation will appear to the west during the evening twilight.|$|E
5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> and {{set on the}} western horizon. North latitude is fairly easy to determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the horizon indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 degrees altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 degrees north latitude, Polaris is 45 degrees above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero degrees, but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the night}} sky, Betelgeuse {{is easy to}} spot {{with the naked eye}} owing to its {{distinctive}} orange-red color. In the Northern Hemisphere, beginning in January of each year, it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset. By mid-September to mid-March (best in mid-December), it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, except for a few research stations in Antarctica at latitudes south of 82°. In May (moderate northern latitudes) or June (southern latitudes), the red supergiant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> before sunrise. In the intermediate period (June–July) it is invisible to the naked eye (visible only with a telescope in daylight), unless around midday (when the Sun is below horizon) on Antarctic regions between 70° and 80° south latitude.|$|E
50|$|Mayan astronomers {{knew from}} naked-eye {{observations}} that Venus {{appeared on the}} western and disappeared on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizons</b> at different times in the year, and that it took 584 days to complete one cycle.|$|R
50|$|At 527 metres, János-hegy is {{the highest}} point in Budapest. Other hills in the area, Nagy-Hárs-hegy and Kis-Hárs-hegy, reach 454 metres and 362 metres, respectively. In clear weather, the Mátra Mountains are visible, 80 {{kilometres}} distant. On <b>the</b> far <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> one might see the Great Hungarian Plain (Hungarian: Nagyalföld).|$|R
5000|$|There {{is little}} of {{interest}} to the cruise passenger in the immediate vicinity of the port. There is a craft market as one leaves the dock, but the nearest town, Tapachula, is a few miles inland.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 25 May Howe's pursuit finally bore fruit, when his {{scouting}} frigates spotted a lone French ship of the line at 04:00. This ship sighted Howe's force at the same time, and immediately made {{off in the direction}} of the French fleet. The fleeing battleship left behind an American merchant ship she had been towing, which when taken reported that the French ship was Audacieux, of Nielly's squadron. Pursuing Audacieux after burning the American prize, the British fleet also overran and burnt two French corvettes, the 20-gun Républicaine and 16-gun Inconnue. Continuing his chase over the next three days, on 28 May Howe's lookouts spotted the French on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> slightly to the south, indicating that the French held the weather gage.|$|E

25|$|The {{houses are}} grouped into four main {{categories}} or hemispheres. Horoscopes appear 'upside down' {{in relation to}} how the compass points usually appear, with the ascendant marking <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> traditionally appearing on the left hand side. For this reason the southern hemisphere appears in {{the upper part of}} the horoscope.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} systems of house division. In most, the {{ecliptic}} {{is divided into}} houses and <b>the</b> ascendant (<b>eastern</b> <b>horizon)</b> marks <b>the</b> cusp, or beginning, of the first house, and the descendant (western horizon) marks the cusp of the seventh house. Many systems, called quadrant house systems, also use the midheaven (medium coeli) as the cusp of the tenth house.|$|R
6000|$|The {{evening of}} January 9 showed us right abeam a splendid {{display of the}} Zodiacal Light, whose pyramid {{suggested}} {{the glow of a}} hemisphere on fire.

25|$|Regardless {{of these}} {{different}} methods, all house divisions in Western astrology share certain things in common: the twelve house cusps are always projected on the ecliptic; they will all place the cusp of the first house near <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> and every house cusp is 180° of longitude apart from the sixth following house (1st opposes 7th; 2nd opposes 8th and so on).|$|E
25|$|The Sun {{resides in}} the astrological sign of Gemini from June 20 to July 20 each year (though the zodiac dates it May 21 - June 21). By mid August, Gemini will appear along <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> in the morning sky prior to sunrise. The best time to observe Gemini at night is {{overhead}} during the months of January and February. By April and May, the constellation will be visible soon after sunset in the west.|$|E
25|$|The {{ascendant}} {{is generally}} considered {{the most important and}} personalized angle in the horoscope by the vast majority of astrologers. It signifies a person's awakening consciousness, {{in the same way that}} the Sun's appearance on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> signifies the dawn of a new day. Due to the fact that the ascendant is specific to a particular time and place, it signifies the individual environment and conditioning that a person receives during their upbringing, and also the circumstances of their childhood. For this reason, the ascendant is also concerned with how a person has learned to present him or herself to the world, especially in public and in impersonal situations.|$|E

50|$|A {{complete}} twenty-four-hour {{time cycle}} is {{marked on the}} rim of the overlay. A full twelve months of calendar dates are marked {{on the rim of}} the starchart. The window is marked to show the direction of <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> and western <b>horizons.</b> <b>The</b> disk and overlay are adjusted so that the observer's local time of day on the overlay corresponds to that day's date on the star chart disc. The portion of the star chart visible in the window then represents (with a distortion because it is a flat surface representing a spherical volume) the distribution of stars in the sky at that moment for the planisphere's designed location. Users hold the planisphere above their head with <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> and western <b>horizons</b> correctly aligned to match the chart to actual star positions.|$|R
25|$|In Egyptian belief, the {{disorder}} that predates the ordered world exists beyond {{the world as}} an infinite expanse of formless water, personified by the god Nun. The earth, personified by the god Geb, is a flat piece of land over which arches the sky, usually represented by the goddess Nut. The two are separated by the personification of air, Shu. The sun god Ra is said to travel through the sky, across the body of Nut, enlivening the world with his light. At night Ra passes beyond the western horizon into the Duat, a mysterious region that borders the formlessness of Nun. At dawn he emerges from the Duat in <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the novel, Sophie and Langdon are {{standing}} outside Roslyn Chapel in the evening, Brown describes them looking to the east watching Venus rise above the horizon in the twilight.

2500|$|It {{was also}} a time of {{increased}} metallurgical production, so Iran {{earned a reputation as}} the [...] "armory of Asia". Most of the Sasanian mining centers were at the fringes of the Empire – in Armenia, the Caucasus and above all, Transoxania. The extraordinary mineral wealth of the Pamir Mountains on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> of the Sasanian empire led to a legend among the Tajiks, an Iranian people living there, which is still told today. It said that when God was creating the world, he tripped over Pamirs, dropping his jar of minerals, which spread across the region.|$|E
2500|$|At 18:40, {{suddenly}} and for no immediately apparent reason, Villaret ordered his ships to haul their wind and turn {{back towards the}} east, breaking off contact. By the time the sun set a few hours later, the French had almost disappeared over <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon</b> as the British continued westwards. Although the order to abandon the action has subsequently been much debated, the cause of Villaret's retreat {{was in fact the}} actions of the frigate Phaeton, which Cornwallis had sent ahead of the squadron as a scout early on 17 June. After progressing several miles ahead of the British squadron, Stopford had signalled that there were unknown sails to the northwest, followed by signals indicating four ships in sight and then one for a full fleet, highlighted by firing two cannon. Stopford had been careful to ensure that the French ships could see and read his signals, which were in a code that the French were known to have broken, and Villaret knew well that the only French fleet in those waters was the one he led. He therefore assumed that Phaeton could see the Channel Fleet beyond the northern horizon, a force significantly more powerful than his own. Stopford compounded the ruse at 15:00 by making a string of nonsensical signals to the non-existent fleet before notifying Cornwallis at 16:30, again in plain sight, that the fleet was composed of allied ships of the line. He completed the operation by raising the Dutch flag [...] and signalling for the non-existent fleet to join with Cornwallis. It is not clear to what extent Villaret was taken in by this charade, the French fleet continuing their attack without pause, until at 18:00 when a number of sails appeared on the northwest horizon. At this point Phaeton wore round to return to Cornwallis, and Villaret, now convinced that the strangers, which were in reality a small convoy of merchant vessels, were the vanguard of the Channel Fleet, abandoned the chase.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} tourist {{attraction of the}} city is the Great Pyramid with the Nuestra Señora de los Remedios sanctuary on top. At first glance, the pyramid looks like a hill as most of it is overgrown. The south side of the pyramid has been excavated and there is a network of tunnels inside. The pyramid and church receives about 220,000 visitors each year, and on certain special occasions such as the spring equinox and the feast of the Virgin of the Remedies, there can be up to 20,000 visitors at a time. From the top of the pyramid, in the sanctuary atrium, it is possible to see the Malinche, Popocatepetl, Iztaccíhuatl and Pico de Orizaba Volcanoes in <b>the</b> far <b>eastern</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Midheaven {{is always}} aligned with north or south. However, the Ascendant and Descendant are not {{necessarily}} aligned with east and west, so the Ascendant is not necessarily at 90 degrees to the Midheaven. The Ascendant is the degree of the ecliptic that intersects <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> celestial <b>horizon</b> at a specific time and location. For observers in the tropics, this will always be close to due east and the Ascendant will always be close to 90 degrees away from the Midheaven. As the observer moves farther north or south it becomes possible for the Ascendant to be {{farther and farther away}} from due east.|$|R
60|$|The moon rose {{higher and}} higher above the {{sleeping}} house and softly breathing canyon.

No one would have believed that behind that impenetrable shadow to the west, {{in the heart of the}} forest, the throbbing saw-mill of James Bradley was even at that moment eating its destructive way through the conserved growth of Nature and centuries, and that the refined proprietor of house and greenwood, with the glow of his furnace fires on his red shirt, and his alert, intelligent eyes, was the genie of that devastation, and the toiling leader of the shadowy, toiling figures around him.|$|R

So for a time the two doomed victims subsided into their accustomed calm of mingled hope and despair, waiting patiently for the expected arrival of the much-longed-for Australasian.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{descriptions of}} remote places in archaic Greek epic. I argue that Homeric cosmic geography {{consists of two}} complementary models, {{one in which the}} sun rises and sets at a single locus—the axis mundi—as in the Theogony, and another in which sunrise and sunset take place on <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> and western <b>horizons</b> respectively. Conflation of these models in the Odyssey results in the gemination of peoples and places associated in myth with the sun. This not only explains some recurrent patterns in Homeric geography and their thematic importance to Odysseus’ travels, but also resolves some traditional interpretive difficulties with descriptions of the edges of the earth in archaic epic...|$|R
50|$|The Zodiac or the Bhachakra is {{composed}} of three hundred sixty degrees of the celestial space which is divided by twelve to mark the twelve equal Zodiacal signs or rasis. Rasi-sandhi is where two signs join. The longitudes of the houses (bhava sphutas), rasimanas (oblique ascensions or rising periods of the twelve signs) and other important calculations are all computed for Sayana rasis (tropical position), from these the Ayanamsa is subtracted and the Nirayana bhavas etc., are obtained. Rasi-chakra is simply a figure of the fixed zodiac with the limits and occupants of its twelve signs {{as well as the}} lagna clearly marked. Bhava-chakra is the division of the heaven into twelve houses with reference to time and space. According to Hindu astrology, a bhava means one-third of the arc of the ecliptic intercepted between any two adjacent angles, viz., <b>the</b> Udaya lagna (<b>Eastern</b> <b>Horizon),</b> <b>the</b> Patala lagna (Lower Meridian), the Asta lagna (Western Horizon), and the Madhya lagna (Upper Meridian).
