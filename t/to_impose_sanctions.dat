5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} foreign {{military}} observers had suspicions that the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia and Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community helped install a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation in April 1997, but UNITA {{did not allow}} the regional MPLA government {{to take up residence}} in 60 cities. The UN Security Council voted on 28 August 1997, <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> on UNITA through Resolution 1127, prohibiting UNITA leaders from traveling abroad, closing UNITA's embassies abroad, and making UNITA-controlled areas a no-fly zone. The Security Council expanded the sanctions through Resolution 1173 on 12 June 1998, requiring government certification for the purchase of Angolan diamonds and freezing UNITA's bank accounts.|$|E

25|$|The 2008 global {{financial}} crisis {{was seen as}} being {{a threat to the}} goals envisioned by the charter, and also set forth the idea of a proposed human rights body to be discussed at a future summit in February 2009. This proposition caused controversy, as the body would not have the power <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> or punish countries which violated citizens' rights and would therefore be limited in effectiveness. The body was established later in 2009 as the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR). In November 2012, the commission adopted the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.|$|E
25|$|On 24 June 1992, Shevardnadze and the South Ossetian {{government}} {{signed the}} Sochi ceasefire agreement, brokered by Russia. The agreement included obligations {{to avoid the}} use of force, and Georgia pledged not <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> against South Ossetia. The Georgian government retained control over substantial portions of South Ossetia, including the town of Akhalgori. A Joined Peacekeeping force of Ossetians, Russians and Georgians was established. On 6 November 1992, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) set up a mission in Georgia to monitor the peacekeeping operation. From then until mid-2004 South Ossetia was generally peaceful.|$|E
25|$|Since 2005, Iran's {{nuclear program}} {{has become the}} subject of {{contention}} with the international community, mainly the United States, following earlier quotes of Iranian leadership favoring {{the use of an}} atomic bomb against Iran's enemies and in particular Israel. Many countries have expressed concern that Iran's nuclear program could divert civilian nuclear technology into a weapons program. This has led the United Nations Security Council <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> against Iran which had further isolated Iran politically and economically {{from the rest of the}} global community. In 2009, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence said that Iran, if choosing to, would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon until 2013.|$|E

25|$|In early 2010, Brazil and Lamy {{focused on}} the role of the United States in {{overcoming}} the deadlock. President Lula urged Barack Obama to end a trade dispute between Brazil and the US over cotton subsidies after the WTO gave Brazil the formal go-ahead in 2009 <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> on imports of over 100 US goods. Lamy highlighted the difficulty of obtaining agreement from the US without the presidential fast-track authority and biennial elections. One of the consequences of the economic crisis of 2008–2009 is the desire of political leaders to shelter their constituents from the increasingly competitive market experienced during market contractions. Lamy hoped that the drop in trade of 12% in 2009, quoted as the largest annual drop since the Second World War, could be countered by successful conclusion of the Doha round.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 1990s up until 2000, Somalia was without a {{functioning}} central government. A peace agreement aimed at ending {{the civil war}} that broke out following {{the collapse of the}} Siad Barre regime was signed in 2006 after many years of peace talks. However, the new government was almost immediately threatened by further violence. To temporarily shore up the government's military base, starting in March 2007, AU soldiers began arriving in Mogadishu as part of a peacekeeping force that was intended by the AU to eventually be 8,000 strong. Eritrea recalled its ambassadors to the African Union on 20 November 2009 after the African Union called on the United Nations Security Council <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> on them due to their alleged support of Somali Islamists attempting to topple the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, the internationally recognised government of Somalia which holds Somalia's seat on the African Union. On 22 December 2009, the Security Council passed UNSCR 1907, which imposed an arms embargo on Eritrea, travel bans on Eritrean leaders, and asset freezes on Eritrean officials. Eritrea strongly criticised the resolution. In January 2011, Eritrea reestablished their mission to the AU in Addis Ababa.|$|E

White agreed with the majority that the state can permissibly impose qualifications on the officers of Local 54. But the language of Section 7 of the NLRA {{as well as the}} Court's ruling in Hill permitted the state <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> only on the officers, not on the union.

500|$|By the 17th {{century the}} King's Wall {{had been almost}} {{completely}} absorbed within later buildings, although it is briefly mentioned in the [...] "Extent Roll", a town survey of 1635, and limited sections appear on James Gordon of Rothiemay's map of 1647. The mason John Mylne and the wright (carpenter) John Scott strengthened the Flodden and Telfer walls and constructed artillery emplacements in 1650. Further emplacements were built by Captain Theodore Dury in 1715, {{in response to the}} Jacobite rising of that year. In 1736, the lynching of Captain John Porteous by an Edinburgh mob led the British Government in London <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> on the town. Porteous, Captain of the Town Guard, had been convicted of murder following the shooting of spectators at a public hanging, but following a reprieve, a mob broke into the Tolbooth Jail and executed him. The initial demand by the House of Lords was for the demolition of the Netherbow Port, although this was resisted by the town, and commuted to a fine by the House of Commons. When the town was threatened by the Jacobite rising of 1745, a company of volunteer citizens was raised for the defence of the city, and the mathematics professor Colin Maclaurin advised on improvements to the walls. However, as Bonnie Prince Charlie's troops approached, the town was undermanned and the walls undefended. On the morning of 17 September, a group of Highlanders under Donald Cameron of Lochiel rushed the Netherbow Port as the gates were opened, and Edinburgh was captured without a fight.|$|E
500|$|Before the mid-15th century, {{illuminated}} {{books were}} considered a higher form of art than panel painting, and their ornate and luxurious qualities better reflected the wealth, status and taste of their owners. Manuscripts were ideally suited as diplomatic gifts or offerings to commemorate dynastic marriages or other major courtly occasions. From the 12th century, specialist monastery-based workshops (in French libraires) produced books of hours (collections of prayers {{to be said}} at canonical hours), psalters, prayer books and histories, as well as romance and poetry books. At {{the start of the}} 15th century, Gothic manuscripts from Paris dominated the northern European market. Their popularity was in part due to the production of more affordable, single leaf miniatures which could be inserted into unillustrated books of hours. These were at times offered in a serial manner designed to encourage patrons to [...] "include as many pictures as they could afford", which clearly presented them as an item of fashion but also as form of indulgence. The single leaves had other uses rather than inserts; they could be attached to walls as aids to private meditation and prayer, as seen in Christus' 1450–60 panel Portrait of a Young Man, now in the National Gallery, which shows a small leaf with text to the Vera icon illustrated with the head of Christ. The French artists were overtaken in importance from the mid-15th century by masters in Ghent, Bruges and Utrecht. English production, once of the highest quality, had greatly declined and relatively few Italian manuscripts went north of the Alps. The French masters did not give up their position easily however, and even in 1463 were urging their guilds <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions</b> on the Netherlandish artists.|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. {{has been}} a {{supporter}} of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. In her own book, M.I.A. wrote regarding Wikileaks, [...] "So obviously I love Wikileaks because, after I’d gone through the whole backlash, {{they were the first}} news information site to confirm any news on the Sri Lankan war in the truest form; they were the first to release information stating the truth about {{what had happened to the}} Tamils as I knew it and to reveal that the United Nations was aware that the Sri Lankan government was lying—war crimes had been committed but their hands were tied because any time anyone tried <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>sanctions,</b> governments would walk out. [...] I support Wikileaks because of that." [...] She composed the theme to Assange's television show The World Tomorrow and later stood by Assange's side as he held a press conference at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Assange was successfully granted political asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. [...] "I ask President Obama to do the right thing. The United States must renounce its witch hunt against WikiLeaks," [...] Assange said at the press conference. She posted a photo of Assange from within the embassy, and later tweeted, [...] "hummmm after this day 2things have 2 happen....., either 500 cops turn up outside every rape case reported even if it's without charge. or we get raped by the powerz that be and we deal 4eva." [...] The tweets were in reference to an arrest warrant the Swedish Prosecutor's Office issued in August 2010 for Assange on two charges: rape and molestation. Earlier in 2012 Britain's Supreme Court denied an appeal by Assange to avoid extradition to Sweden to face these charges. In November 2013, Assange appeared via Skype to open M.I.A.'s New York City concert. Also, on 18 September 2014 Maya tweeted a link to a documentary on YouTube entitled [...] "The Internet's Own Boy: Aaron Swartz". The documentary is about the life of Aaron Swartz, who was a computer programmer, writer, political organiser and Internet hacktivist. In the same tweet Maya included a link and invitation to RSVP to a party to launch Julian Assange's new book [...] "When Google Met WikiLeaks".|$|E

Some design elements, like positive pictorial illustrations, or elements providing guidance, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>imposing</b> <b>sanctions,</b> are highly effective, while others not. Explicitly mentioning whistle-blowing leads neither to more ethical intent nor to higher willingness to report misconduct compared to codes without this element.
