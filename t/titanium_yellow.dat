5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between <b>titanium</b> and <b>yellow</b> nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|R
30|$|Esters, ketones and ether esters are {{suitable}} solvents for clear and pigmented PU coating systems. Traditional extenders, such as barytes, calcium carbonate, talc, kaolin, mica, and silica {{may be used}} in one- and two-component systems. Among the conventional inorganic pigments, titanium dioxide, <b>titanium</b> <b>yellow,</b> various iron oxides, cadmium reds and yellows, some carbon blacks and chrome oxide green {{are suitable}} for most of the 2 K PU systems. Organic pigments frequently found in the PU paint formulations, include quinocridone and perylene reds, monoazo and isoindoline yellows, and phthalocyanine blues and greens. The use of organic pigments from other classes may involve undesirable effects on the curing process of PU paint films [10]. Commercial PU coatings contain various additives, such as catalysts, flattening, leveling, thickening and anti-foaming agents. The presence of catalysts offers advantageous rates of polyurethanes reaction at lower temperatures. Those used in PU industry essentially consist on tertiary amines and tin complexes compounds [9].|$|E
40|$|Yellow nail {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} nail changes, respiratory disorders, and lymphedema. In a yellow nail patient with a skeletal titanium implant and with gold in her teeth, we found high levels of titanium in nail clippings. This study aims to examine the possible role of titanium in {{the genesis of the}} yellow nail syndrome. Nail clippings from patients with one or more features of the yellow nail syndrome were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence. Titanium was regularly found in finger nails in patients but not in control subjects. Visible nail changes were present in only half of the patients. Sinusitis with postnasal drip and cough was the most common complaint. The dominant source of titanium ions was titanium implants in the teeth or elsewhere. The titanium ions were released through the galvanic action of dental gold or amalgam or through the oxidative action of fluorides. In other patients the titanium was derived from titanium dioxide in drugs and confectionary. Stopping galvanic release of titanium ions or canceling exposure to titanium dioxide led to recovery. In one patient with a titanium implant, the symptoms recurred after renewed exposure to <b>titanium.</b> <b>Yellow</b> nail {{syndrome is}} caused by titaniu...|$|E

It also contains the following other ingredients: Dicalcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, stearic acid, silica, magnesium stearate, and film coat (hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, <b>titanium</b> dioxide, FD&C <b>yellow</b> #6 lake, riboflavin, FD&C blue #2 lake).|$|R
2500|$|Weiss uses a wood palette {{and a small}} {{range of}} colors; {{typically}} <b>titanium</b> white, <b>yellow</b> ochre, ultramarine blue and cadmium red light, sometimes {{with the addition of}} a deeper red, cadmium yellow light, cerulean and green. [...] He occasionally paints with a knife, but mostly with flat brushes to achieve [...] "a kind of blocky modeling". He uses Claessens oil-primed linen for portraits and panels for landscape work. After forming quick outlines, he works rapidly to block in the light and dark areas of the figure and major compositional elements with turpentine-thinned paint. Following this first stage which takes around half-an-hour, he reworks the areas a dozen times or more, constantly refining and unifying.|$|R
50|$|In the studio, {{using his}} own made-up pigments, he mimics {{the cycle of}} growth and decay by working with matter in a very direct and {{hands-on}} way. He applies colours, deep pools of it, red brick, reds, molten silver and zinc, platinum and <b>titanium,</b> sulphuric <b>yellows</b> and {{so much more to}} dozens of paintings in various states of becoming. He paints standing up, applying a new layer of paint (finished paintings will comprise fifty to one hundred or more layers of paint applied {{over a period of several}} years and when completed can take up to five months to dry out). His preferred tools are palette knives (one in each hand is the norm), and a decorator's brush which he holds vertically using a stippling technique.|$|R
50|$|YAG for {{a period}} was used in jewelry as a diamond and other {{gemstone}} simulant. Colored variants and their doping elements include: green (chromium), blue (cobalt), red (manganese), <b>yellow</b> (<b>titanium),</b> purple (neodymium), pink, and orange. As faceted gems they are valued (as synthetics) for their clarity, durability, high refractive index and dispersion. The critical angle of YAG is 33 degrees. YAG cuts similar to natural garnet, with polishing being performed with alumina or diamond (50,000 or 100,000) on common polishing laps. YAG has low heat sensitivity.|$|R
40|$|Yellow nail {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disease of unclear etiology. We describe a patient who develops yellow nail syndrome, with primary nail and sinus manifestations, shortly after amalgam dental implants. A study of the patient's nail shedding showed elevated nail titanium levels. The patient had her dental implants removed and had complete resolution of her sinus symptoms with no change in her nail findings. Since the patient's nail findings did not resolve {{we do not believe}} titanium exposure is a cause of her yellow nail syndrome but perhaps a possible relationship exists between <b>titanium</b> exposure and <b>yellow</b> nail syndrome that requires further studies...|$|R
5000|$|The VT Roadster enjoyed {{one final}} limited run of 30 cars for the 2000 model year, after the {{introduction}} of the Diablo VT 6.0 (see below). This [...] "Millennium Roadster" [...] model was available in just two colors, <b>Titanium</b> Metallic and <b>yellow,</b> with the 10 cars exported to the United States all finished in Titanium Metallic. Besides an optional carbon fiber spoiler, special two-tone leather interior, and the shorter-ratio SV rear differential (providing enhanced acceleration), this model featured no significant changes from the previous design, and merely served as a final tribute to the outgoing roadster.|$|R
40|$|This work {{comprises}} {{the use of}} energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) techniques {{for the study of}} the composition of twentieth century traditional Japanese color sticks. By using the combination of analytical techniques it was possible to obtain information on inorganic and organic pigments, binders and fillers present in the sticks. The colorant materials identified in the sticks were zinc and <b>titanium</b> white, chrome <b>yellow,</b> yellow and red ochre, vermillion, alizarin,indigo, Prussian and synthetic ultramarine blue. The results also showed that calcite and barite were used as inorganic mineral fillers while Arabic gum was the medium used. EDXRF offered great potential for such investigations since it allowed the identification of the elements present in the sample preserving its integrity. However, this information alone was not enough to clearly identify some of the materials in study and therefore it was necessary to use XRD and FTIR techniques...|$|R

40|$|Citation: Calvin, John Willard. A {{new method}} of {{determining}} iron, nitrites, etc [...] Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1906. Introduction: In the experiments reported below an {{effort was made}} to determine substances such as ferrous iron, nitrites, etc., that reduce hydrogen peroxide quantitatively, by titrating them directly against a standard solution of hydrogen peroxide, using a titanium solution as an indicator. It was {{to determine whether or not}} it is possible to use a titanium solution as an indicator to show when the oxidation is complete, that the experiments were taken up. The fact that a yellow or orange color is produced when hydrogen peroxide is added to a titanium solution, was discovered by Schonn, and has long been known as a delicate test for both hydrogen peroxide and titanium. Although this reaction has been known about thirty years, in examining the literature on the subject, very little is found. In the Journal of the Chem. Soc., 1874, the yellow or orange color formed when a solution of titanium, made by digesting titanium oxide in concentrated sulphuric acid, is added to a solution of hydrogen peroxide, is given as a delicate test for the latter. In the Chemical News, Vol. 47, Edward Jackson gives an article in which he says in substance, if hydrogen peroxide is added to a solution of the chloride or sulphate of <b>titanium,</b> a fine <b>yellow</b> color is formed which is a delicate test for both the peroxide and titanium; the test being so delicate that 1 50, 000 th part of titanium or 1 25, 000 th part of hydrogen peroxide is sufficient to produce the color. In an abstract in the Journal of the Chem. Soc. from the Ber. d. Deutsch Chem. Ges., 1882, Weller gives a method of determining small amounts of titanium colorunetrically by means of the yellow color produced when hydrogen peroxide is added to the solution of titanium. The color produced in the unknown solution is compared with that produced by a standard solution made by dissolving pure potassium titanofluoride...|$|R
