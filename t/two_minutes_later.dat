5|$|Cooper {{struck the}} ball low {{and hard to}} his right; despite Neville Southall getting his fingers to it, the penalty was {{successful}} and brought the scores level. Immediately, Mike England made a substitution, withdrawing midfielder Robbie James and bringing on forward Steve Lovell {{in an effort to}} regain the advantage. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> he made his second and final substitution, bringing off Mickey Thomas for Clayton Blackmore.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} minute, Barcelona's Javier Mascherano conceded a corner kick, which Juventus aimed at Evra but Barcelona cleared it. However <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> Jordi Alba made {{a run on}} Barcelona's left, passing to Neymar and then Andrés Iniesta who set up Ivan Rakitić to score the first goal from close range. Rakitić's goal was Barcelona's fastest goal in a Champions League Final, and the fourth fastest in Champions League Final overall. In the 11th minute, Arturo Vidal of Juventus {{received}} the first yellow card for fouling Sergio Busquets. At half time, Barcelona led 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool – also a Premier League team – {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the Third Round too. Their opening match was a 5–1 home win against Oldham Athletic. Robbie Simpson opened the scoring for Oldham in the 28th minute, but Craig Bellamy equalised just <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> with Steven Gerrard scoring a penalty to give Liverpool the lead. Jonjo Shelvey scored his first goal for the club in the second half, before late goals from Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing ensured progression to the Fourth Round.|$|E
25|$|The final {{episode was}} {{broadcast}} on BBC <b>Two</b> 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> than scheduled due to coverage of Andy Murray and Jürgen Melzer's third round match at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships being moved to BBC One.|$|R

5|$|Manchester United {{kicked the}} game off, and also {{fashioned}} {{the first chance}} of the game; Ronaldo beat Lauren on the left wing to put over a cross, only for Scholes to head the ball over the crossbar after losing his marker. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> a break from José Antonio Reyes had Carroll scampering across from his goal to meet the Spaniard, forcing Reyes wide enough to allow the United defence time to get back.|$|E
5|$|This was Arsenal's tenth Charity Shield {{appearance}} and Liverpool's ninth. Arsenal made no {{changes to the}} first team which played in the FA Cup Final the previous season, whereas for Liverpool new signing Avi Cohen started on the bench. In the match Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the 38th minute when Terry McDermott scored past goalkeeper Pat Jennings. They extended their lead through Kenny Dalglish in the 63rd minute before McDermott added his second <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> Alan Sunderland scored a consolation for Arsenal late on.|$|E
5|$|Another {{high-profile}} clash came {{more than}} 20 years later, {{in the final}} of the FA Cup on 12 May 1979. A capacity crowd saw Arsenal take a 2–0 lead in the first half thanks to goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and with just five minutes left on the clock their lead was still intact. Then, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen pulled a goal back for United, and <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> they equalised with a goal from Sammy McIlroy. However, barely a minute after United equalised, Arsenal's Alan Sunderland scored an 89th-minute goal to win the cup 3–2 for Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Gotō's {{force was}} taken almost {{completely}} by surprise. At 23:43, Aobas lookouts sighted Scott's force, but Gotō assumed {{that they were}} Jojima's ships. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> Aobas lookouts identified the ships as American, but Gotō remained skeptical and directed his ships to flash identification signals. As Aobas crew executed Gotō's order, the first American salvo smashed into Aobas superstructure. Aoba was quickly hit by up to 40 shells from Helena, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Farenholt, and Laffey. The shell hits heavily damaged Aobas communications systems and demolished two of her main gun turrets {{as well as her}} main gun director. Several large-caliber projectiles passed through Aobas flag bridge without exploding, but the force of their passage killed many men and mortally wounded Gotō.|$|E
5|$|Kawachi {{rejoined the}} First Squadron after her refit {{commanded}} by Captain Yoshimoto Masaki and entered Tokuyama Bay {{on the evening}} of 11 July 1918. The following morning torpedo target practice was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at anchor {{for the rest of the}} day. That afternoon a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 in the vicinity of the starboard forward main-gun turret and large quantities of smoke erupted from the turret and between the first and second funnels. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> she began to list to starboard and capsized at 15:55, only four minutes after the explosion. Over a thousand men were aboard Kawachi at the time of the explosion and over 600 were killed, with 433 survivors.|$|E
5|$|Neither side made a {{substitution}} at half time. In the 56th minute, Cesc Fàbregas – who had {{a bicycle}} kick saved by Lloris – set up Diego Costa, whose shot from {{the left of the}} area deflected off Tottenham right-back Kyle Walker and into the net to double Chelsea's advantage. After conceding their second goal, Tottenham made a series of attacking substitutions – Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Chadli made way for Mousa Dembélé, Érik Lamela and Roberto Soldado respectively – but could not change the score. In the 74th minute, Dier's knee caught César Azpilicueta, drawing blood; the Chelsea left-back left the pitch to be bandaged and returned <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> There were four minutes of added time, in which Chelsea substituted Costa for Didier Drogba.|$|E
60|$|<b>Two</b> {{or three}} <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> the cart entered the courtyard. Mrs. Holland {{was on the}} steps. Dick ran down, and helped Annie from the cart. The girl was {{trembling}} violently.|$|R
60|$|<b>Two</b> {{or three}} <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> the murdered man, the {{blanketed}} corpse, the lidless coffin, {{and the open}} grave were under no inspection but the moon's. The stillness was complete again, too.|$|R
60|$|Thus conjuring up the past, and theorizing on the present, she lay restless, {{changing}} her posture {{from one side}} to the other and back again.

5|$|On 22 August 2010, Nani {{missed a}} penalty in the 87th minute away to Fulham, and they then {{equalised}} <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> through Brede Hangeland {{to end the}} match 2–2. Six days later, in a 3–0 home victory over West Ham United, Nani scored his first goal {{of the season and}} assisted Dimitar Berbatov in a Man of the Match display. Nani scored and assisted Michael Owen in a 2–2 away draw away to Bolton Wanderers on 26 September. On 16 October, Nani scored United's second in a 2–2 home draw against West Bromwich Albion. Four days later, Nani scored his first Champions League goal of the season, scoring the solitary strike in a 1–0 home victory over Bursaspor.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 2013, Pogba {{made his}} debut for the French senior {{team in a}} 2014 World Cup {{qualifier}} against Georgia. He played the full 90 minutes in a 3–1 win. Pogba then earned his second cap four days later in another 2014 World Cup qualifier against Spain, starting the match against the world champions, but picked up a yellow card in the 76th minute for unsporting behaviour, before being sent off <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> for a second bookable offence in a 1–0 loss. He scored his first international goal against Belarus on 10 September 2013 in a 4–2 victory, once again during a 2014 World Cup qualifier.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{soon became}} obvious that the Japanese force had no air cover, the U.S. {{aircraft}} were able to set up for their attacks without fear of opposition from Japanese aircraft. U.S. bomber and torpedo aircraft arriving over the Yamato group—after their two-hour flight from Okinawa—were thus able to circle the Japanese ship formation just out of anti-aircraft range in order to methodically set up their attacks on the warships below. The first wave of U.S. carrier planes were spotted by a Japanese lookout on the bridge at 12:32. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> Yamato opened fire with her 460mm main batteries. The Japanese ships stopped zigzagging and increased speed to , beginning evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with their anti-aircraft guns. Yamato carried almost 150 anti-aircraft guns, including her massive 460mm guns.|$|E

50|$|At around 7pm on 28 June, {{a lookout}} aboard HMS Tartar sighted Lauenburg off Jan Mayen, and Tartar began firing. Lauenburg's crew quickly {{abandoned}} {{the ship in}} <b>two</b> lifeboats. <b>Minutes</b> <b>later,</b> Tartar steamed alongside and a boarding party seized Lauenburg. A large amount of material was collected and transferred to Tartar. The Allied warships then fired on and sank Lauenburg.|$|R
5|$|Ten {{minutes into}} the second half, Juventus {{equalised}}: Claudio Marchisio back-heeled the ball to right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who set up Carlos Tevez. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but Álvaro Morata equalised by putting the rebound into the net. In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba {{went down in the}} area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did not give it. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> Barcelona got back into the lead when Lionel Messi shot {{from the edge of the}} area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Suárez put in the rebound. Soon after, Neymar put the ball into the net from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{scheduled}} for 11 and 14 November were to traverse {{each of the}} two tracks, in both directions of travel and at a test speed 10% above the speed limit when the line is in commercial service. On the afternoon of 14 November, the test train was scheduled to depart Meuse TGV Station at 14:18 and arrive at Strasbourg Station at 15:17. At 14:26, authorization was given to begin the test and the test train left Meuse TGV Station <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> During this test, the test train traveled eastbound on Track2, the southern track on the east-west oriented LGV Est, in the direction opposite normal operation (Strasbourg towards Paris). The Meuse-Strasbourg run was the last series of tests on the line during the fourth phase of tests.|$|E
5|$|The 9/11 Commission {{estimated}} that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, shortly after American Airlines Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center and not too long after United Airlines Flight 175 had been hijacked. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. Unlike the other three flights, there were no reports of anyone being stabbed or a bomb threat and the pilots were not immediately killed but shoved {{to the back of}} the plane with the rest of the passengers. At 08:54, the plane began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> at 08:56, the plane's transponder was switched off. The hijackers set the flight's autopilot on a course heading east towards Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content {{to sit back and}} frustrate Roma. Despite this tactic, Liverpool took the lead in the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was disallowed for offside.|$|E
5|$|The period {{immediately}} after half‑time saw few chances, but then, after just over an hour's play, Manchester City regained their stride and suddenly went two goals ahead. A throw-in to Revie led to interplay {{on the right}} wing involving Barnes, Dyson, and Johnstone, resulting in a through-ball which put Dyson clear of the defence to score. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> Trautmann collected the ball {{at the end of}} a Birmingham attack and kicked the ball long to Dyson, over the heads of the retreating Birmingham players. Dyson flicked the ball on to Bobby Johnstone, who scored Manchester City's third, becoming the first player ever to score in consecutive Wembley finals in the process.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a near-capacity crowd, the {{visitors}} Arsenal began the tie more strongly, {{but failed to}} convert their chances. They took the lead minutes before half-time when Alan Smith scored from a Paul Merson cross. Wrexham's performance improved the longer the match went, and they equalised through Mickey Thomas's free kick in the 82nd minute. <b>Two</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> the home side went ahead after Steve Watkin collected the ball from his teammate Gordon Davies and diverted it past goalkeeper David Seaman. A pitch invasion occurred once the whistle blew for full-time; the Wrexham players and staff joined in celebrations with their supporters. Wrexham's reward was a fourth-round tie against West Ham United which they lost in a replay.|$|E
50|$|On February 20, 2016, Stepheson {{signed a}} 10-day {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Clippers.
