25|$|<b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> and {{immigrants}} {{moved to the}} area during the mining boom, prompting {{the federal government to}} create Fort Wilkins near Copper Harbor to maintain order. The first wave were the Cornish from England, with centuries of mining experience; followed by Irish, Germans, and French Canadians. During the 1890s, Finnish immigrants began settling there in large numbers, forming the population plurality in the northwestern half of the peninsula. In the early 20th century, 75% of the population was foreign-born.|$|E
25|$|The US {{television}} rights, {{owned by}} NBC, accounted for {{over half the}} rights revenue for the IOC. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans,</b> however, accessed the BBC's omnibus coverage using proxy servers or VPNs. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage. The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park.

25|$|The British {{conducted}} {{raids on}} American shipping and kidnapped seamen in 1806–07; <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> were thus impressed into the British naval service. In 1806, Jefferson issued {{a call for}} a boycott of British goods; on April 18, Congress passed the Non-Importation Acts, but they were never enforced. Later that year, Jefferson asked James Monroe and William Pinkney to negotiate with Great Britain to end the harassment of American shipping, though Britain {{showed no signs of}} improving relations. The Monroe–Pinkney Treaty was finalized but lacked any provisions to end impressment, and Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification.|$|E

As Poet Laureate, Pinsky founded the Favorite Poem Project, in which <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> of varying backgrounds, all ages, and from every state share their favorite poems. Pinsky believed that, contrary to stereotype, poetry has a strong presence in the American culture. The project sought to document that presence, giving voice to the American audience for poetry.|$|E
25|$|In 1856 {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Thompson River, {{a tributary of the}} Fraser River, and a year later in the Fraser River itself. This sparked an influx of miners and others, as word of the discoveries spread south to the United States. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> flooded into British Columbia, beginning the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. Although without political authority on the mainland, Douglas worked to exert British jurisdiction over the territory. He stationed a warship {{at the mouth of the}} Fraser in order to issue licences to prospectors and merchants. A major task during the huge inflow of settlers was to prevent violence between the recent arrivals and the local First Nations peoples. Due to the Indian Wars in the United States West, American animosity against natives was often high. In the fall of 1858, escalating tensions between the miners and the Taklamakan people of the central area of the canyon broke into the Fraser Canyon War.|$|E

500|$|Borah was not {{personally}} harmed by {{the stock market}} crash of October 1929, having sold any stocks and invested in government bonds. [...] <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> had borrowed on margin, and were ruined by the crash. [...] Congress in June 1930 passed the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, [...] sharply increasing rates on imports. [...] Borah was one of 12 Republicans who joined Democrats in opposing the bill, which passed the Senate 44–42. Borah was up for election in 1930, and despite a minimal campaign effort, took over 70percent of the vote in a bad year for Republicans. When he returned to Washington for the lame-duck session of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of Congress turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued [...] "that for the Government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her. [...] Does anyone believe it? It is a cowardly imputation on the helpless. [...] I resent it and I repudiate it." ...|$|E

The Special Representative and head of the newly created United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA), Abou Moussa, said that international interest in Kony was [...] "useful, very important". The White House released a statement of support through Press Secretary Jay Carney, who stated in a news conference, [...] "We congratulate the hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> who have mobilized to this unique crisis of conscience" [...] and said that the raised awareness from the video is [...] "consistent with the bipartisan legislation passed by our congress in 2010." [...] Cameron Hudson, policy director at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and former Africa director in the National Security Council, also praised Invisible Children for reaching [...] "tens of millions of people who probably never previously heard of Joseph Kony." [...] Anthony Lake, the executive director of UNICEF, was cited as saying that a similar viral video would have made a difference during the Rwandan Genocide in 1994, also suggesting that [...] "this kind of public attention would also have helped save more lives in Darfur and in Congo’s warring east." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 2 October 1942, Queen Mary accidentally sank {{one of her}} escort ships, slicing {{through the}} light cruiser [...] off the Irish coast {{with a loss of}} 239 lives. Queen Mary was {{carrying}} <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> of the 29th Infantry Division to join the Allied forces in Europe. Due to the risk of U-boat attacks, Queen Mary was under orders not to stop under any circumstances and steamed onward with a fractured stem. Some sources claim that hours later, the convoy's lead escort returned to rescue 99 survivors of Curacoa crew of 338, including her captain John W. Boutwood. This claim is contradicted by the liner's then Staff Captain (and later Cunard Commodore) Harry Grattidge, who records that Queen Mary Captain immediately ordered the accompanying destroyers to look for survivors within moments of the Curacoa sinking.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, a {{controversy}} erupted {{related to the}} question of whether the whole-cell pertussis component caused permanent brain injury in rare cases, called pertussis vaccine encephalopathy. Despite this allegation, doctors recommended the vaccine due to the overwhelming public health benefit, because the claimed rate was very low (one case per 310,000 immunizations, or about 50 cases out of the 15 million immunizations each year in the United States), and the risk of death from the disease was high (pertussis killed <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> each year before the vaccine was introduced). No studies showed a causal connection, and later studies showed no connection of any type between the DPT vaccine and permanent brain injury. The alleged vaccine-induced brain damage proved to be an unrelated condition, infantile epilepsy. In 1990, the Journal of the American Medical Association called the connection a [...] "myth" [...] and [...] "nonsense".|$|E
2500|$|Manifest destiny played {{its most}} {{important}} role in the Oregon boundary dispute between the United States and Britain, when the phrase [...] "manifest desiny" [...] originated. The Anglo-American Convention of 1818 had provided for the joint occupation of the Oregon Country, and <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> migrated there in the 1840s over the Oregon Trail. The British rejected a proposal by U.S. President John Tyler (in office 1841-1845) to divide the region along the 49thparallel, and instead proposed a boundary line farther south along the Columbia River, which would have made most of what later became the state of Washington part of British North America. Advocates of manifest destiny protested and called for the annexation of the entire Oregon Country up to the Alaska line (54°40ʹ N). Presidential candidate James K. Polk used this popular outcry to his advantage, and the Democrats called for the annexation of [...] "All Oregon" [...] in the 1844 U.S.Presidential election.|$|E

2500|$|By 1932, {{unemployment}} {{had reached}} 23.6%, peaking in early 1933 at 25%. Drought persisted {{in the agricultural}} heartland, businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans, and more than 5,000 banks had failed. Hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> found themselves homeless, and began congregating in shanty towns – dubbed [...] "Hoovervilles" [...] – that began to appear across the country. In response, President Hoover and Congress approved the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, to spur new home construction, and reduce foreclosures. The final attempt of the Hoover Administration {{to stimulate the economy}} was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act (ERA) which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) in 1932. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2billion was not enough to save all the banks, and bank runs and bank failures continued. Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill, as prices, profits and employment fell, leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is important to note, however, that after volunteerism failed, Hoover developed ideas that laid the framework for parts of the New Deal.|$|E
2500|$|Coulter {{also cited}} the 2002 Senate {{testimony}} of FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley, who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors {{for refusing to}} authorize a search warrant for 9-11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They {{knew that he was}} a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the French Intelligence Service had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for Osama bin Laden she asserted [...] "any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'" [...] so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that [...] "'probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England." [...] Coulter says the poll was [...] "by the [...] "Daily Telegraph", actually it was by Sunrise, an [...] "Asian" [...] (i.e., Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because [...] "FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling," [...] they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. [...] "The FBI allowed <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> to be slaughtered on the altar of political correctness. What more do liberals want?" ...|$|E

How comes it that, by virtue of a law solemnly ratified by a Congress of freemen, the representatives of freemen, <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> are subjected to the most despotic usages, and, from the dockyards of a republic, absolute monarchies are launched, with the [...] "glorious stars and stripes" [...] for an ensign?
