So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would be sort of the opposite, because even though you think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, and it just actually turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> miserable experience.|$|E

It also digs down into softer spots, including Richards’ tumultuous relationship with Anita Pallenberg and the death of their son. The book, which already seems to have earned a place in the admittedly small canon of genuinely great rock lit, is dishy but not lurid, technical but not wonky. Richards’ voice, filtered through Fox’s brain, is so relentlessly endearing, no less a critic than Maureen Dowd has declared the prince of darkness a [...] "consummate gentleman." [...] Time's Richard Corliss writes [...] "Confessional autobiographies, unless they're by William Boroughs, tend to have inspirational endings: salvation through strong will or a good woman. Life has both." ...|$|E

Liu's image was photoshopped into other scenes, depicting him chasing after actor Mark Wahlberg and Olympic hurdler Liu Xiang, or appearing in the background of Edvard Munch's The Scream. The Atlantic's Jessica Levine wrote that the image was [...] "representative of a growing resentment toward alleged abuses by the People's Armed Police," [...] noting that such memes can serve as a barometer of culture in an environment where freedom of speech is limited. [...] "Because of the strictures on speech in China, memes tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> effective way to spread a political message," [...] said Chinese social media expert and blogger An Xiao Mina. [...] "If you use off-the-cuff, remixed humor, it's a little easier to talk about such critical topics." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first piece}} that Uematsu {{composed}} {{for the game}} was the opening theme; game director Yoshinori Kitase showed him the opening cinematic {{and asked him to}} begin the project there. The track was well received in the company, which gave Uematsu [...] "a sense that it was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good project". Final Fantasy VII was the first game in the series to include a track with high-quality digitized vocals, [...] "One-Winged Angel", which accompanies a section of the final battle of the game. The track has been called Uematsu's [...] "most recognizable contribution" [...] to the music of the Final Fantasy series, which Uematsu agrees with. Inspired by The Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky to make a more [...] "classical" [...] track, and by rock and roll music from the late 1960s and early 1970s to make an orchestral track with a [...] "destructive impact", he spent two weeks composing short unconnected musical phrases, and then arranged them together into [...] "One-Winged Angel", an approach he had never used before.|$|E
500|$|When Mendelsohn {{was giving}} a talk, she accidentally {{mentioned}} the crossover, as a result Variety was already inquiring about the crossover episodes [...] that same day. Mendelsohn eventually revealed the crossover at the Banff event in Canada. After the episode was taped, Lorre stated: [...] "The biggest challenge for us was doing a comedy with a murder in it. Generally our stories are a little lighter. Would our audience go with a dead body in it? There was a moment where it could have gone either way. I think the results were spectacular. It turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> funny episode." [...] "Fish in a Drawer" [...] was written by Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar and directed by Jeff Melman. As an inside joke, George Eads, who plays crime scene investigator Nick Stokes on CSI made a cameo as a guest at the wedding reception. Three days after the initial airing of [...] "Fish in a Drawer", [...] "Two And a Half Deaths", the corresponding CSI episode, aired on CBS. However, in an early Zap2it interview, both Mendelsohn and Lorre stated {{that this might be}} the last time a crossover like this might occur.|$|E
500|$|Uematsu's {{approach}} to composing the game's music was {{to treat it}} like a film soundtrack and compose songs that reflected {{the mood of the}} scenes rather than trying to make strong melodies to [...] "define the game", as he felt that approach would come across too strong when placed alongside the game's new 3D visuals. As an example, he composed the track intended for the scene in the game where Aerith Gainsborough is killed to be [...] "sad but beautiful", rather than more overtly emotional, creating what he feels is a more understated feeling. Uematsu has additionally said that the soundtrack has a feel of [...] "realism", which also prevented him from using [...] "exorbitant, crazy music". The first piece that Uematsu composed for the game was the opening theme; game director Yoshinori Kitase showed him the opening cinematic to the game and asked him to begin the project there. The track was well received in the company, which gave Uematsu [...] "a sense that it was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good project". He later stated in the liner notes for the soundtrack album that the music for Final Fantasy VII was his [...] "greatest harvest" [...] to date.|$|E

[...] Earning popularity for things like drifting and other stuff makes it fun to just drive around, but I still wish there was something more unique to this game. I have to give top marks to the graphics and ease of play, though." [...] Another reviewer stated, [...] "This used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> stoic racing simulator, but this is more of a driving game designed to be easy to pick up.

2500|$|On March 20, 2009, {{the town}} of Esparto, California was shaken and windows were {{shattered}} by a blast created by [...] of ANFO during filming of the myth [...] "Knock Your Socks Off".

25|$|It {{remains a}} paradox of the mystics that the {{passivity}} {{at which they}} appear <b>to</b> aim <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> state of the most intense activity: more, that where it is wholly absent no great creative action can take place.

2500|$|John Bierman and Colin Smith {{say that}} Gott was much admired for his {{personal}} qualities, but lacked real military skill. He {{was one of the}} few senior officers who was [...] "well known and well liked by the rank and file". However, [...] "a cold appraisal of his soldiering in North Africa reveals no stunning display of tactics or Rommel-esque grip that bends scarred and exhausted men to the will of the born leader." [...] Field Marshal Sir Michael Carver, one of Gott's officers, took a similar view. He stated that Gott was the one person to whom [...] "all, high and low, turned for advice, sympathy, help and encouragement", but he also believed that Gott was [...] "too good a man <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> great soldier". Gott's own view, as expressed to Alan Brooke was that he was the wrong man for the task, [...] though he was soldier enough to take it on if ordered to.
