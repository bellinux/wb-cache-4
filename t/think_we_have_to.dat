I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait for the estimation of historians'. However, on a TV program in July 2006 he denied that Manchukuo was a puppet state.|$|E
500|$|In an on-set {{interview}} with The Huffington Post, actor John Noble {{explained that the}} episode's primary storyline concerned the bridge between the two worlds. The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do you do? What do you do with this wonderful discovery? Do you keep it? What do you lose if you lose it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> face that issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me...

500|$|The first lap {{collision}} between Kvyat and Vettel {{that put}} the latter {{out of the race}} was a major talking point afterwards. The two had already been embroiled in an argument after the previous Grand Prix in China, when Vettel felt that Kvyat had caused a collision between the two Ferrari drivers. This time around, Vettel reacted to his retirement with what The Telegraph described as [...] "one of the most explosive outbursts heard over team radio for years". He later demanded an apology from Kvyat, as did Red Bull teammate Ricciardo, who felt that Kvyat, who pushed Vettel into him, had ruined his race as well. Red Bull announced that they would summon Kvyat to talks about the incident, calling their race a [...] "disaster", with Helmut Marko, the team's young driver coordinator, calling him [...] "over-motivated". Kvyat received three penalty points on his licence {{as a result of the}} incident. He himself said after the race: [...] "I apologise to everyone who is involved and I will learn from it. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> speak. It is easy now to attack me and I guess everyone will, but I am OK with that." ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E

[...] In an interview with Vox he stated his opposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:...a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States...you're doing away {{with the concept of}} a nation-state. [...] What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don’t believe in that.

2500|$|WASPs do have {{a culture}} — traditions, idiosyncrasies, quirks, {{particular}} signals and totems we pass on to one another. [...] But the WASP culture, {{or at least that}} aspect of the culture I talk about, is enough in the past so that we can now look at it with some objectivity, smile at it, and even appreciate some of its values. There was a closeness of family, a commitment to duty, to stoic responsibility, which I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say weren’t entirely bad.” In [...] "The Cocktail Hour" [...] (1988) a lead character tells her playwright son that theater critics [...] "don't like us....

2500|$|The {{incident}} led to {{a diplomatic}} furor and deterioration in Pakistan–United States relations. A major focus of the incident was the U.S. government's assertion that Davis was protected under the principle of diplomatic immunity due to his role as an [...] "administrative and technical official" [...] attached to the Lahore consulate. The U.S. government claimed that Davis was protected under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and demanded he be released from custody immediately. President Barack Obama asked Pakistan not to prosecute Davis and recognize him as a diplomat, stating, [...] "There's a broader principle at stake that I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> uphold." [...] The Pakistani officials disputed the claim of immunity from a murder charge, asserting that Davis was involved in clandestine operations, and questioned the scope of his activities in Pakistan. The Pakistani Foreign Office stated that [...] "this matter is sub judice [...] {{in a court of}} law and the legal process should be respected." [...] Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi stated that, according to official records and experts in the Foreign Office, Davis was [...] "not a diplomat and cannot be given blanket diplomatic immunity"; Qureshi's stand on the issue allegedly led to him losing the Foreign Affairs ministerial post.|$|E

Well, Occupy Wall Street was a little different, and back in 2008, I wrote that when we will actually see change is when the people come, they set up camp, and they refuse to go home.
