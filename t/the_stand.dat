5|$|Built in 2000, {{the main}} Trinity Road Stand {{is the most}} {{recently}} completed at Villa Park and houses the dressing rooms, club offices and director's boxes. <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> is composed of three tiers with a row of executive boxes between {{the second and third}} tiers. Although much larger than the other stands, <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> has roughly the same roof level as the other three sides. The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match {{are in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> at pitch level. The press and the directors' VIP area are situated in the centre of the middle tier. The upper tiers of <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> extend over Trinity Road, the street that cuts behind the ground. Trinity Road passes through a tunnel formed by the Trinity Road Stand.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of the ground, the Bullens Road stand is divided into the Upper Bullens, Lower Bullens and The Paddock. The rear of the south end of <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> houses away supporters. The north corner of <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> is {{connected}} to the Gwladys Street Stand. The current capacity of <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> is 10,546. <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> takes its name from the adjacent Bullens Road. The Upper Bullens is decorated with Archibald Leitch's distinctive truss design.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Western Wall came under Israeli control in 1967, a tefillin stand was erected with {{permission}} from Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz, the first rabbi of the Kotel. <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> offers visitors the chance to put on Tefillin, a daily Jewish ritual. In the months following the Six-Day War an estimated 400,000 Jews observed this ritual at <b>the</b> <b>stand.</b> <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> is staffed by multilingual volunteers and an estimated 100,000 visitors put on tefillin there annually.|$|E
50|$|The Shay lies on {{the south}} side of Halifax, about a quarter of a mile from the town centre. <b>The</b> four <b>stands</b> at <b>the</b> Shay are <b>the</b> North <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> East <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Stand</b> and <b>the</b> Skircoat <b>Stand.</b> <b>The</b> North and South stands were built in the mid-1990s. <b>The</b> Skircoat <b>Stand</b> is <b>the</b> oldest <b>stand</b> at <b>the</b> Shay.|$|R
5|$|The {{stadium is}} divided into five all-seater <b>stands,</b> <b>the</b> JCT600 <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> Kop, <b>the</b> Midland Road <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> North West Corner and <b>the</b> TL Dallas <b>Stand.</b> All five stands are covered except for {{a small part of}} <b>the</b> main <b>stand,</b> and all but <b>the</b> Midland Road <b>Stand</b> being two-tiered. Most of <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> are {{cantilever}} structures, and because of the ground's location on the hillside, <b>the</b> Midland Road <b>Stand</b> overhangs <b>the</b> road.|$|R
5000|$|St Mirren Park {{is built}} on a 12.5 acre site on Greenhill Road. The {{previously}} unused site {{is less than a}} mile from the clubs former ground. Barr Construction were responsible for the design and construction of the stadium. [...] Their design consisted of four grandstands with a total capacity of [...] <b>The</b> East <b>Stand</b> is <b>the</b> Main <b>Stand.</b> <b>The</b> North <b>Stand</b> is used by away fans. Larger away supports can also be seated in a section of <b>the</b> West <b>Stand.</b> <b>The</b> West <b>Stand</b> has <b>the</b> largest capacity of all <b>the</b> <b>stands.</b> Whilst <b>the</b> South <b>Stand</b> is <b>the</b> Family <b>Stand.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the south}} end of the ground, behind one goal, the Park End Stand backs onto Walton Lane which borders Stanley Park. The name of <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> was {{originally}} the Stanley Park End but it's commonly referred to as the Park End. The single tiered stand broke from the multi-tiered tradition of Goodison Park. The Park End has the smallest capacity at Goodison Park. The current layout of <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> was opened on 17 September 1994 with a capacity of 5,750. It was opened by David Hunt, a Member of Parliament. During the structure's development, fans were able to watch matches by climbing trees in neighbouring Stanley Park.|$|E
5|$|Flagg first {{appeared}} in <b>The</b> <b>Stand</b> as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population. He makes his second appearance in The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos. Flagg was a primary antagonist in King's epic series, The Dark Tower, who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower—the linchpin of existence—so he can claim it for himself and become a god. The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg's background and motivation, linking his previous appearances. Aside from King's novels, Flagg was featured in a television miniseries adaptation of <b>The</b> <b>Stand</b> {{in which he was}} portrayed by Jamey Sheridan and The Dark Tower film adaptation in which he was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey. He has also appeared in Marvel Comics' adaptations of The Dark Tower and <b>The</b> <b>Stand.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> has {{encountered}} {{a number of}} problems since its redevelopment; {{at the beginning of the}} 1999–2000 season, a series of support poles and stanchions had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of <b>the</b> <b>stand.</b> During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the seating capacity in the paddock.|$|E
5|$|The four ends of {{the ground}} are called <b>the</b> North <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Stand,</b> and <b>the</b> BT <b>Stand</b> (east). <b>The</b> South <b>Stand</b> was {{previously}} known as <b>the</b> Hyder <b>Stand,</b> until Hyder was sold. The stadium has three tiers of seating {{with the exception of}} <b>the</b> North <b>Stand,</b> which has two tiers. The lower tier holds approximately 23,500 spectators, the middle tier holding 18,000 and the upper tier holding 33,000 spectators.|$|R
50|$|Ewen Fields {{is made up}} of five <b>stands,</b> <b>the</b> Main <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> Scrattin Shed, the Tinker's Passage End, <b>the</b> Leigh Street <b>Stand</b> and <b>the</b> Walker Lane End. All of <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> are covered.|$|R
50|$|Lokomotiv was {{designed}} solely for football matches and thus has no running tracks. The pitch, which is 104mx68m, {{is surrounded by}} two-tiered four all-seater <b>stands,</b> <b>the</b> North <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> East <b>Stand</b> and <b>the</b> West <b>Stand.</b> <b>The</b> South <b>Stand</b> {{is home to the}} Lokomotiv Moscow ultras. On the other hand, travelling fans generally reside in <b>the</b> North <b>Stand.</b> All <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> are covered by a roof, by thus protecting the fans from the Russian harsh weather elements. The total areas of the glass roof is 20,000 square metres. A unique characteristic of the stadium are the VIP-Boxes found in between the upper and lower tiers of all <b>the</b> <b>stands,</b> with one of them being even a restaurant. Furthermore, the stadium comprises other three VIP-sectors, one of them being of soft-seats. Altogether they total to 974 VIP-seats. Furthermore, there are 156 seats available for the press. Thus in all the stadium holds 30,000 people. Moreover, beneath <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> one can find a fitness centre, a bowling club and also the offices of both the club and the fan club.|$|R
5|$|On 15 June 2016, it was {{announced}} that following the termination of Jarrold as the stand's sponsor, <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> would revert to its historical name of the South Stand. Irish coffee company The Galway Roast were announced as the stand's new sponsors, which would be officially called The South Stand sponsored by The Galway Roast. On 2 November 2016, the club announced that the sponsorship deal with The Galway Roast had been terminated and <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> would once again simply be known as The South Stand.|$|E
5|$|The Goodison Park {{structure}} {{was built in}} stages. In the summer of 1895 a new Bullens Road stand was built and a roof placed on the original Goodison Road stand but only after five directors, including Chairman, George Mahon had resigned over what was described in the club minutes as 'acute administrative difficulties'. In 1906, the doubled-decker Goodison Avenue Stand was built behind the goal {{at the south end}} of the ground. <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> was designed by Liverpool architect Henry Hartley who went on to chair the Liverpool Architectural Society a year later. The club minutes from the time show that Hartley was unhappy with certain aspects of <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> and the poor sightlines meant that the goal line had to be moved seven metres north, towards Gwladys Street. In January 1908, he complained that his fees had not been paid and the bill for <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> was near £13,000. There were 2,657 seats on its upper tier with a terrace below.|$|E
5|$|The Jimmy McIlroy Stand is {{situated}} at {{the eastern side of}} the pitch and has a current capacity of 6,088. The upper tier of <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> is the designated family area at Turf Moor and like the James Hargreaves Stand, it has a number of corporate hospitality boxes. The Bob Lord Stand, which has a capacity of 3,036 fans, runs parallel with Harry Potts Way and houses the executive lounges as well as the Burnley Football Club trophy room. <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> was built in 1974 and was paid for in part by the sale of Martin Dobson to Everton. Named after Bob Lord, the former chairman of Burnley, <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> cost £480,000 was opened by Edward Heath, the Conservative Party leader at the time, a Burnley supporter, who had just been defeated as prime minister by Labour's Harold Wilson.|$|E
50|$|The ground {{has four}} stands: <b>the</b> Co-Operative <b>Stand</b> (or Main <b>Stand),</b> <b>the</b> Thwaites Beer <b>Stand</b> (<b>the</b> Sandy Lane End), <b>the</b> T.D.S <b>Stand</b> (Pearl Street end) and <b>the</b> Westrose Leisure <b>Stand</b> (<b>the</b> Willbutts Lane <b>Stand).</b> All are fully seated, {{apart from the}} Sandy Lane End, which is a small terrace {{behind one of the}} goals.|$|R
5|$|The {{stadium is}} {{projected}} to have an all-seated capacity of 8,005. It will comprise four stands; <b>the</b> East <b>Stand</b> (Main <b>Stand),</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Stand,</b> <b>the</b> North <b>Stand</b> and <b>the</b> South <b>Stand.</b> <b>The</b> three-floored East <b>Stand</b> is to accommodate hospitality guests, players, officials and the media, and will {{be connected to the}} adjacent retail and community facilities. <b>The</b> <b>stands</b> will stretch <b>the</b> length of the playing field, and each corner will host stadium facilities, including matchday emergency services, stewarding, groundsman accommodation, plant space and a fan zone. The seats will be coloured red, white and blue, a combination of the colours of both teams.|$|R
50|$|The movable {{structure}} was 450 feet (137 m) long, 200 feet (61 m) wide, and weighed nearly 9 million pounds (4,500 short tons, 4,000 metric tons). When {{a game or}} event required moving <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>the</b> 145 feet in or out, engineers pumped water into 163 water bearings spaced out beneath <b>the</b> <b>stands,</b> lifting <b>the</b> structure off its foundation. A sheet of water ⅓-inch thick formed under the structure. Hydraulic rams then pushed <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> forward at <b>the</b> rate of two feet per minute, taking stadium engineers about six hours {{from start to finish}} to move <b>the</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Kop {{is a large}} single-tiered stand. Originally a large terraced banking {{providing}} accommodation {{for more}} than 30,000spectators, the current incarnation was constructed in 1994–95 and is single-tiered with no executive boxes. The Kop houses the club's museum, the Reducate centre and the official club shop. The Kop is the most-renowned stand at Anfield among home and away supporters, {{with the people who}} occupy <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> referred to as kopites. Such was the reputation that <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> had it was claimed that the crowd in the Kop could suck the ball into the goal. Traditionally, Liverpool's most vocal supporters congregate in this stand.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stand</b> has two {{corporate}} box areas, the Gunns Function Centre and the Corporate Function Centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Nicholas Jacobs opened before Mr Justice Nicol at the Old Bailey on 3 March 2014. Jacobs {{did not take}} <b>the</b> <b>stand.</b> He {{was found not guilty}} on 9 April 2014 by a 10–2 verdict.|$|E
50|$|The stadium {{has four}} stands, which are {{named after the}} areas of Southampton they face. <b>The</b> main (east) <b>stand</b> is <b>the</b> Itchen <b>Stand,</b> and faces <b>the</b> River Itchen. <b>The</b> {{opposite}} <b>stand</b> is called <b>the</b> Kingsland <b>Stand.</b> Behind <b>the</b> south goal is <b>the</b> Chapel <b>Stand,</b> and to <b>the</b> north is <b>the</b> Northam <b>Stand.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{the final}} whistle, {{there was a}} pitch {{invasion}} by Celtic fans, which meant that the Celtic team could not be presented the trophy on the pitch. Some of the Celtic players also had their shirts taken by Celtic supporters. Celtic captain Billy McNeill had to be ushered around {{the outside of the}} stadium under armed guards to receive the trophy on a podium in <b>the</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{expanded}} {{edition of}} <b>The</b> <b>Stand</b> {{was published in}} 1990, restoring text that had been cut from the original edition. It includes an epilogue in which Flagg appears on a beach and finds a primitive tribe ready to fall under his influence.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had to sit in <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> behind the dugout. Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Milburn <b>stand</b> is <b>the</b> 'main' <b>stand</b> of <b>the</b> stadium, {{housing the}} main entrance, lifts and {{escalators}} behind a glass fronted atrium.

5|$|Banksia serrata {{has shown}} a {{variable}} susceptibility to dieback from the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, the plants in sandier soils showing more resistance than those in heavier soils. Plants from Wilsons Promontory were sensitive. The resistance of plants from Flinders Island is unknown. The small size of <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> renders it vulnerable to eradication.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1995 and {{formerly}} known as the Borough Road Stand, it was renamed in 2002 to recognise former Rovers manager John King. <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> runs along the Borough Road side of the pitch, and is a low-rise seated stand with a capacity of 2,414.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{continuous}} oval bowl, {{each side of}} the stadium is named {{in the manner of a}} traditional football ground. All sides were initially named by compass direction (North Stand and South Stand for the ends, East Stand and West Stand for the sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the Colin Bell Stand in honour of the former player. The vote was almost cancelled (and <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> instead named after Joe Mercer) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club made it clear they still wished <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> named after their hero. The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club's Maine Road ground.|$|E
