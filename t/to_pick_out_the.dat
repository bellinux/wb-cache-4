At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

Only rarely do his photos include shadows falling on {{the background of the}} set. Horst rarely, if ever, used filters. While most of his work is in black & white, much of his color photography includes largely monochromatic settings to set off a colorful fashion. Horst's color photography did include documentation of society interior design, well noted in the volume Horst Interiors. He photographed a number of interiors designed by Robert Denning and Vincent Fourcade of Denning & Fourcade and often visited their homes on Manhattan and Long Island. After making the photograph, Horst generally left it up to others to develop, print, crop, and edit his work.|$|E

The fight scene between McGarrett and Hesse were shot with the portraying actors. Stunt doubles were on hand, but the production staff found they were not needed in the fight scenes until both characters fell into a boat below or the sea. The first [...] "Book 'em, Danno" [...] line was filmed several times as the staff wanted <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> right version. Some of the last scenes to be shot were the cold open scenes. Three days were spent on those scenes, and were filmed at Kualoa Ranch. In one scene of the episode, McGarrett goes to the garage of his father's house and unravels a Mercury Marquis. The car was in fact used on the original show and was on loan to the production staff by its owner, who was the stand-in for Jack Lord, who played the original McGarrett.|$|E

GIC assured that the patient's privacy was not a concern since it ad removed identifiers such as name, addresses, social security numbers. However, information such as zip codes, birth date and sex remained untouched. The GIC assurance was reinforced by the then governor of Massachusetts, William Weld. Latanya Sweeney, {{a graduate student at}} the time, put her mind <b>to</b> <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> governor's records in the GIC data.

2500|$|The use of accidentals {{in medieval}} and renaissance music differs {{significantly}} from modern practice. Medieval notation used two accidental signs, the [...] "b molle" [...] (...) and the [...] "b durum" [...] (...) [...] While the former was identical in {{form to the}} modern flat sign (...) , the latter could be written in forms that resemble either the modern sharp (...) or the modern natural (...) , but these functions were not distinguished from {{each other as they}} are today. The b molle served <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lower of two alternative semitone steps for a given note (e.g., a B as opposed to a B), while the b durum served <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> higher one (e.g., B as opposed to B, but also F as opposed to F, etc.). The meanings of both signs thus overlaps with that of the natural sign today. Until the 16th century, only the flat signs regularly occurred as key signatures {{at the beginning of a}} staff (one or at most two flats). Both forms of accidentals could occur as temporary accidentals elsewhere; however, in practice they were often not written but left to the performer to infer according to the rules of counterpoint and musica ficta.|$|E

2500|$|However, it {{was found}} that the P-70 was not very {{successful}} in actual combat interception of Japanese fighters at night. [...] It was issued P-38H Lightnings stock day fighters with no radar or any other equipment for finding the enemy at night. The Lightning pilots would wait until the enemy was over a target and, hopefully, illuminated by the defender's searchlights. They would then try <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> outline of the enemy aircraft and intercept. This method had its dangers since the P-38 was subjecting itself to antiaircraft fire from defenders as well as gunners aboard the Japanese bombers. The squadron received the P-61 Black Widow to replace the P-38s/P-70s in June 1944. [...] The squadron and its detachments moved several times throughout New Guinea providing cover for U.S. Army assault landings, shipping reconnaissance while protecting the various new air bases.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the first}} six months of 1944, unlike the USAAF, RAF Bomber Command's {{offensive}} was struggling against the renewed German efforts in the technological war. In mid-1943 Bomber Command had introduced Window over Hamburg rendering ground-based Würzburg and the airborne Leichtenstein C-1 radars ineffective. Window, known to the Germans as Düppel, consisting of small aluminium strips dropped by formations to blanket German radar and make it difficult for the defences <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> real position of the raiders. To reduce losses further, Bomber Command shortened its attacks over the target by five minutes to reduce chances of interception. This was followed by spoof routes, used to feint the routes of attacks. Later the use of [...] "Mandrel" [...] airborne jamming screens were used to send the enemy into the wrong area and deny the German fighters the chance of reaching the target area in sufficient strength.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{presence}} of Judge Malipiero would endanger them, the policemen tell the Maniac {{to leave for the}} time being. Instead, the Maniac intends to disguise himself as a forensic expert from Rome, Captain Piccini. The Maniac leaves the office. Feletti nearly exposes the three policemen, until the Maniac reenters, as an extravagantly-dressed amputee. The Maniac manages to concoct a story on how the anarchist died: one of the impatient policemen hit the anarchist in the neck, an ambulance being called; the anarchist then being led to the window for fresh air, and pushed accidentally out of the window due to uncoordinated balance between the two policemen leading him to the window. Feletti is unconvinced, noting how the death of the anarchist was reported by the police to be a suicide, opposed to their original comment that it was [...] "accidental". Bertozzo suddenly enters, delivering a replica of a bomb from another anarchist attack. Bertozzo partially recognises the Maniac, as he knows Captain Piccini, but is dissuaded by Pissani and the Superintendent.

Cuvier found that fossils identified rock formations as alternating between marine and [...] terrestrial deposits, indicating [...] "repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea" [...] which he identified with {{a long series of}} sudden catastrophes which had caused extinctions. In his 1812 Discours préliminaire to his Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles de quadrupeds put forward a synthesis of this research into the long prehistoric period, and a historical approach to the most recent catastrophe. His historical approach tested empirical claims in the Biblical text of Genesis against other ancient writings <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> [...] "real facts" [...] from [...] "interested fictions". In his assessment, Moses had written the account around 3,300 years ago, long after the events described.
