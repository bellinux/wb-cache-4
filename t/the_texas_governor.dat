5|$|The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety {{is a law}} {{enforcement}} agency with statewide jurisdiction. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption. They have acted as riot police and as detectives, protected <b>the</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>governor,</b> tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and the state. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history {{and some of the}} best-known criminal cases {{in the history of the}} Old West.|$|E

25|$|On Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30pm Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC), Lee Harvey Oswald, an alienated loner, assassinated President John F. Kennedy. <b>The</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor,</b> John B. Connally, {{was also}} shot but survived. The episode caused a {{national}} outrage focused on right wing elements in Dallas {{that had long}} been hostile to Kennedy. For a half-century and more the people of Dallas still struggle with being branded as having some responsibility. The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, located where the assassin {{is believed to have}} fired the shots, has become a historic tourist site.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 1913, SB 183 {{was signed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>governor</b> allocating funding for a new institution, making it the second oldest {{academic}} institution in the University of Texas system. The school officially opened on September 28, 1914, with 27 students in buildings belonging to the former El Paso Military Institute on a site just adjacent to Fort Bliss on the Lenoria Mesa. By 1916, enrollment had grown to 39 students, including its first two female students, Ruth Brown and Grace Odell. On October 29, 1916, a devastating fire destroyed the main building of the school, prompting its relocation. In 1917, the new school facility was constructed on its present site above Mundy Heights, with the land donated by several El Paso residents. In a period when United States architects were designing in styles adopted especially from Europe, Kathleen Worrell, wife of the university's dean, was attracted by photographs of the Kingdom of Bhutan in a 1914 issue of National Geographic magazine, which showed the dzong architecture style of its Buddhist monasteries. The resemblances between the local terrain and mountainous features of Bhutan inspired her to propose designing early buildings of the mining school in the dzong style. Liking its distinctiveness, administrations have continued to choose that style for additional facilities, including the Sun Bowl football stadium and parking garages. Dzong (fortified religious and administrative centers) has characteristics such as sloping sides, markedly overhanging roofs, and bands of colored decoration.|$|E
500|$|McCain's {{campaign}} {{never completely}} recovered from his South Carolina defeat, {{although he did}} rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later. He made a speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders, including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as divisive conservatives, declaring [...] "...we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community. But {{that does not mean}} that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders." [...] McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29, and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush. With little hope of overcoming Bush's delegate lead, McCain withdrew from the race on March 9, 2000. He endorsed Bush two months later, and made occasional appearances with <b>the</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>governor</b> during the general election campaign.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Texas Governor George W. Bush {{successfully}} {{ran for the}} presidency. [...] As {{the campaign}} progressed, the media compared Hanna and Bush adviser Karl Rove, who was believed by some to hold a Svengali-like influence over <b>the</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>governor.</b> [...] During the campaign, and until his departure from the White House in 2007, media members often suggested that Rove was able to manipulate Bush, and that Rove exerted considerable control over the government. [...] Bush's advisor was deemed a present-day incarnation of Hanna, who was almost invariably presented negatively and at variance with historical fact. [...] For example, writer Jack Kelly in a 2000 column incorrectly stated that McKinley's front porch campaign was {{at the direction of}} Hanna to ensure the candidate did not vary from campaign themes, rather than McKinley deciding that it was his best response to Bryan's national tour. [...] These comparisons were fuelled by Rove's interest in, and from some reports, liking for Hanna. Rove studied the McKinley administration at the University of Texas under McKinley biographer Lewis L. Gould, and believes that Hanna's influence has been overstated.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{campaign}} focused mainly on domestic issues, {{such as the}} projected budget surplus, proposed reforms of Social Security and Medicare, health care, and competing plans for tax relief, foreign policy was often an issue. Bush criticized Clinton administration policies in Somalia, where 18 Americans died in 1993 {{trying to sort out}} warring factions, and in the Balkans, where United States peacekeeping troops perform a variety of functions. [...] "I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building," [...] Bush said in the second presidential debate. Bush also pledged to bridge partisan gaps in the nation's capital, claiming the atmosphere in Washington stood in the way of progress on necessary reforms. Gore, meanwhile, questioned Bush's fitness for the job, pointing to gaffes made by Bush in interviews and speeches and suggesting <b>the</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>governor</b> lacked the necessary experience to be president.|$|E
2500|$|After the Palo Duro {{campaign}} (1874) and the surrendering of {{the last}} hostile Comanche groups {{coming back from the}} Staked Plains, Old Kiyou was appointed as Comanche head chief, and was ordered to select the [...] "worst" [...] Comanche chiefs and warriors, to be indicted as responsible of the uprising and deported to Fort Marion, Florida, along with 27 Kiowa to be selected by Tene-angopte. Only nine Comanche men (one [...] "Black Horse", but probably not Kobay-otoho third chief of the Quahadi band, and eight [...] "outlawed" [...] warriors), were sent to Fort Marion: all the principal Comanche leaders (Quanah, Mow-way, Tababanika, Isa-rosa, Hitetetsi aka Tuwikaa-tiesuat, Kobay-oburra) were made safe, but neither Parra-ocoom, dead on June 27–28, 1874, during the Adobe Walls fighting, nor Pearua-akup-akup, dead in the icehouse – temporarily used as a jail – of Fort Sill on January 1, 1875, could benefit with Kiyou diplomatic skill in saving the most important warring chiefs of his own people. On the contrary, Guipago, along with Manyi-ten, Tsen-tainte and Mamanti (but not Ado-ete and Zepko-ete), were selected by Tene-angopte and sent to Fort Marion with some lesser personalities. Sent back to Fort Sill in 1879, Guipago, the stubborn chief who had forced [...] "Mr. Washington" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> to accept his terms, died because of marsh-fever in July 1879.|$|E
