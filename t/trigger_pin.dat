2500|$|In August 2017, Glock {{presented}} the [...] "fifth generation" [...] or [...] "Gen5". The revisions centered on ergonomics and improving reliability. Many parts of fifth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged {{with those of}} the previous generations. The two fifth-generation models announced were the Glock 17 and Glock 19, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum. Some conspicuous changes on the fifth-generation models are: ambidextrous slide stop levers, nDLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) surface finish for barrel and slide, a barrel featuring conventional land-and-groove rifling (called the “Glock Marksman Barrel” by Glock) rather than the polygonal rifling used in earlier models, a deeper recessed barrel crown, omission of the finger grooves on the grip, a flared magazine well, and a reintroduction of a (half moon shaped) cutout on the bottom front of the grip. The locking block pin located above the <b>trigger</b> <b>pin</b> that was introduced in the third-generation is omitted. Many internal parts were less conspicuously revised.|$|E

40|$|Cell-to-cell {{directional}} {{flow of the}} phytohormone auxin {{is primarily}} established by polar localization of the PIN auxin transporters, a process tightly regulated at multiple levels by auxin itself. We recently reported that, {{in the context of}} strong auxin flows, activity of the vacuolar ZIFL 1. 1 transporter is required for fine-tuning of polar auxin transport rates in the Arabidopsis root. In particular, ZIFL 1. 1 function protects plasma-membrane stability of the PIN 2 carrier in epidermal root tip cells under conditions normally <b>triggering</b> <b>PIN</b> 2 degradation. Here, we show that ZIFL 1. 1 activity at the root tip also promotes PIN 1 plasma-membrane abundance in central cylinder cells, thus supporting the notion that ZIFL 1. 1 acts as a general positive modulator of polar auxin transport in roots.

50|$|The wrench {{functions}} in the same general way as an ordinary beam torque wrench. There are two beams both connected to the head end but only one through which torque is applied. The load carrying beam is straight and runs from head to handle, it deflects when torque is applied. The other beam (indicating beam) runs directly above the deflecting beam for {{about half of the}} length then bends away to the side at an angle from the deflecting beam. The indicating beam retains its orientation and shape during operation, because of this there is relative displacement between the two beams. The deflecting beam torque wrench differs from the ordinary beam torque wrench in how it utilises this relative displacement. Attached to the deflecting beam is a scale and onto that is fitted a wedge which can be slid {{along the length of the}} scale parallel to the flexing beam, this wedge is used to set the desired torque. Directly facing this wedge is the side of the angled indicating beam. From this side protrudes a pin, which acts as a trigger for another pin, the latter pin is spring loaded, and fires out of the end of the indicating beam once the <b>trigger</b> <b>pin</b> contacts the adjustable wedge. This firing makes a loud click and gives a visual indication that the desired torque has been met. The indicator pin can be reset by simply pressing it back into the indicating beam.|$|E
5000|$|M/24: The [...] "Lotta Rifle," [...] the Model 24 or Model 1891/24 was {{the first}} {{large-scale}} Mosin-Nagant upgrade project undertaken by the Finnish Suojeluskunta (Civil Guard), and there were, in fact three separate variations of the rifle. Barrels were produced by SIG (Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft) and by a German consortium. Swiss-produced barrels {{could be found in}} both standard Mosin-Nagant 1891 contour and in a heavier contour designed for improved accuracy, while all German-produced barrels were heavy weight barrels. The initial contract for the SIG-produced barrels was let on April 10, 1923, and was for 3,000 new barrels produced with the original Model 1891 barrel contour. A subsequent contract for 5,000 additional heavier barrels, stepped at the muzzle end to accept the standard Mosin-Nagant bayonet, was let the next year. The German contracts, starting in 1924 and running to 1926, were all for the heavier, stepped barrels with two contracts: one for 5,000 barrels and a second for 8,000 barrels. The German-made barrels are marked [...] "Bohler-Stahl" [...] on the under side of the chamber. All Model 24s are marked with the Civil Guard logo of three fir tree sprigs over a capital [...] "S." [...] All Model 24s are equipped with a coil spring around the <b>trigger</b> <b>pin</b> to improve the trigger pull and thus the accuracy of the rifle. The Model 24 was called the Lotta's Rifle ("Lottakivääri") after the women's auxiliary of the Civil Guard, known as the Lotta Svärd which was instrumental in raising funds to purchase and repair or refurbish some 10,000 rifles.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{focuses on}} the optimization of the trigger unit of a six-rod TVS. The different configurations of the <b>trigger</b> <b>pin</b> and of the trigger electrode have been considered to study the electric field distribution at the triple points of the unit embedded in the cathode. To optimize the field enhancement, electric field simulations with a planar and a circular heads of the <b>trigger</b> <b>pin</b> in combinations with a convex and a concave shaped trigger electrodes have been done. The simulations were done with an applied trigger pulse voltage of Utrigger = 5 kV and with a discharge voltage the main switch of Uswitch = 20 kV.

5000|$|The Model of 1902 was {{chambered}} for {{the same}} [...]38 ACP cartridge as was the earlier M1900 pistol. The M1902 pistol {{for the most part}} also shared the same hard black rubber grips which were standard on the Model 1900, however, custom grips were also available, especially on presentation versions. The vast majority of Model 1902 pistols were produced with a highly polished, deep and lustrous Colt Royal blued finish, but rarely nickel and silver plated models are encountered, as well as various custom finishes. On some early production Model 1902s the <b>trigger,</b> <b>pins,</b> and grip screws were set off with a fire or nitre blued finish, giving those parts a beautiful cobalt blue hue. The hammer of 1902 pistols usually had a case hardened finish. Earlier production pistols featured either milled straight line or cross-cut checkered slide serrations on the forward end of the slide, which were deleted in later years of production. Although the M1902 was originally intended for the military market, Colt was progressive enough to recognize that commercial merchandizing of the pistol also offered potential revenue and introduced a sporting version of the pistol with a few minor changes. Neither the Military or Sporting versions of the pistol had a manual safety.|$|R
50|$|The Five-seven is a {{semi-automatic}} delayed blowback pistol chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. The pistol has {{a concealed}} hammer.

50|$|The Stoner 63/63A LMG is an {{automatic}} weapon that fires {{from the open}} bolt and the trigger mechanism permits only fully automatic firing though burst size can be controlled by the shooter. The entire trigger unit has four <b>trigger</b> <b>pins</b> that give the unit its modularity. The front pin holds a flapper-type magazine catch/release (used in the Rifle/Carbine variants and the left-hand feed LMG with a 150-round drum-type belt container), a full dust cover (used with the top-feeding Automatic Rifle or vertically mounted ammo box on any belt-fed system) or a half size dust cover (used with the right-hand-feed bottom box carrier). The next two pins retain the timer and hammer, {{both of which are}} absent in the open bolt configurations. The final pin acts as the trigger’s axis shaft; the spring-loaded sear pivots on the selector lever’s axis pin. The selector is disconnected when firing from the open bolt and a sliding manual safety installed near the trigger guard disables the trigger when pushed to the rear. The rear portion of the trigger housing serves as a receiver end cap and is used to attach the shoulder stock. The black polycarbonate pistol grip is also attached to the trigger housing. The checkered grip is flared at the bottom to prevent the shooter’s hand from sliding off and has an internal storage compartment sealed by a hinged cover with a spring-loaded hatch.|$|R

A 5000 fps CCD-camera monitored events occurring in the gap during such a discharge and the intensity variations of a laser beam transmitted through the electrode gap was also monitored. The results indicate the initiation, expansion and collapse of a gas bubble generated at the trigger electrode.

40|$|The inverse-pinch plasma switch was studied using a {{computer}} simulation code. The code {{was based on a}} 2 -D, 2 -temperature magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The application of this code was limited to the disk-type inverse-pinch plasma switch. The results of the computer analysis appear to be in agreement with the experimental results when the same parameters are used. An inverse-pinch plasma switch for closing has been designed and tested for high-power switching requirements. An azimuthally uniform initiation of breakdown is a key factor in achieving an inverse-pinch current path in the switch. Thus, various types of triggers, such as <b>trigger</b> <b>pins,</b> wire-brush, ring <b>trigger,</b> and hypocycloidal-pinch (HCP) devices have been tested for uniform breakdown. Recently, triggering was achieved by injection of a plasma-ring (plasma puff) that is produced separately with hypocycloidal-pinch electrodes placed under the cathode of the main gap. The current paths at switch closing, initiated by the injection of a plasma-ring from the HCP trigger are azimuthally uniform, and the local current density is significantly reduced, so that damage to the electrodes and the insulator surfaces is minimized. The test results indicate that electron bombardment on the electrodes and the insulator surfaces is minimized. The test results indicate that electron bombardment on the electrodes is four orders of magnitude less than that of a spark-gap switch for the same switching power. Indeed, a few thousand shots with peak current exceeding a mega-ampere and with hold-off voltage up to 20 kV have been conducted without showing measurable damage to the electrodes and insulators...|$|R

40|$|Flaming {{a tomato}} leaf evokes a {{variation}} potential; excising an unwounded leaf evokes an action potential; while excising a wounded leaf 90 sec after flame-wounding evokes an action potential superimposed on the variation potential. Furthermore, flaming one leaf induces rapid (15 min), systemic and biphasic accumulation of CMBP transcript, excising the unwounded leaf causes slower, monophasic transcript accumulation, while excising the wounded leaf after 90 sec {{has no effect}} on CMBP transcript accumulation in response to the flame-wound. We propose that both of these electrical signals, the flame-evoked variation potential and the cut-wound evoked action potential are capable of inducing CMBP transcript accumulation, although with somewhat different kinetics. Earlier work by others found the cut-wound had no effect on pin transcript accumulation, thus leaf excision {{could be used as a}} tool to determine whether transport of wound hormones out of the leaf could <b>trigger</b> <b>pin</b> gene expression.

40|$|Plants {{continuously}} {{extend their}} root and shoot systems through {{the action of}} meristems at their growing tips. By regulating which meristems are active, plants adjust their body plans to suit local environmental conditions. The transport network of the phytohormone auxin has been proposed to mediate this systemic growth coordination, due to its self-organising, environmentally sensitive properties. In particular, a positive feedback mechanism termed auxin transport canalization, which establishes auxin flow from active shoot meristems (auxin sources) to the roots (auxin sinks), has been proposed to mediate competition between shoot meristems and to balance shoot and root growth. Here we provide strong support for this hypothesis by demonstrating that a second hormone, strigolactone, regulates growth redistribution in the shoot by rapidly modulating auxin transport. A computational model in which strigolactone action is represented as {{an increase in the}} rate of removal of the auxin export protein, PIN 1, from the plasma membrane can reproduce both the auxin transport and shoot branching phenotypes observed in various mutant combinations and strigolactone treatments, including the counterintuitive ability of strigolactones either to promote or inhibit shoot branching, depending on the auxin transport status of the plant. Consistent with this predicted mode of action, strigolactone signalling was found to <b>trigger</b> <b>PIN</b> 1 depletion from the plasma membrane of xylem parenchyma cells in the stem. This effect could be detected within 10 minutes of strigolactone treatment and was independent of protein synthesis but dependent on clathrin-mediate...|$|E
