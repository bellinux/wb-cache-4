5|$|Edward Norton, around 1930, {{designed}} a mechanical filter {{for use on}} phonograph recorders and players. Norton designed <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> in the electrical domain and then used the correspondence of mechanical quantities to electrical quantities to realise <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> using mechanical components. Mass corresponds to inductance, stiffness to elastance and damping to resistance. <b>The</b> <b>filter</b> was designed to have a maximally flat frequency response.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} born {{in mind that the}} {{characteristics}} of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is from the end of <b>the</b> <b>filter,</b> the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections. It is usual to provide half half-sections at the ends of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> with m = 0.6 as this value gives the flattest Zi in the passband and hence the best match in to a resistive termination.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. <b>The</b> <b>filter</b> consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem facing}} use of <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> is adoption. Many {{projects}} may provide assistance in building <b>the</b> water <b>filters</b> and some may even distribute them but getting {{the host country}} nationals to use <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> requires much more dedication.

5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> design.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} borne {{in mind that}} the {{characteristics}} of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance.

5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam <b>the</b> <b>filter,</b> but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam <b>the</b> <b>filter.</b> Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E

5|$|The coil of the {{transducer}} adds some inductance on {{the electrical}} side of <b>the</b> <b>filter.</b> It is common practice {{to add a}} capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which {{can be incorporated into}} <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> design.

5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> (although <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is a heavy}} smoker, at {{one point}} smoking 70 {{cigarettes}} a day. Bond has his cigarettes custom-made by Morland of Grosvenor Street, mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal; the cigarettes have three gold bands on <b>the</b> <b>filter.</b> Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. The cigarettes {{were the same as}} Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank.

5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters {{can be derived from}} it by applying a scaling factor to the components of the prototype. <b>The</b> <b>filter</b> design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the French {{microbiologist}} Charles Chamberland {{invented a}} filter, {{known today as}} the Chamberland filter or Chamberland–Pasteur filter, that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he could pass a solution containing bacteria through <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> and completely remove them from the solution. In the early 1890s the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study {{what became known as}} the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.|$|E

5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, {{the response of}} <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again.

The first milestone on the way to network synthesis was an important paper by Ronald M.
