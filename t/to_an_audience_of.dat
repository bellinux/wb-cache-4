5|$|Konrad Zuse's Z3 was the world's first working programmable, fully {{automatic}} computer, with binary digital arithmetic logic, but it lacked the conditional branching of a Turing machine. On 12 May 1941, it was successfully presented <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> scientists of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt ("German Laboratory for Aviation") in Berlin. The Z3 stored its program on an external tape, {{but it was}} electromechanical rather than electronic. The Colossus of 1943 was the first electronic computing device, {{but it was not}} a general-purpose machine.|$|E
5|$|The Bad World Tour {{began on}} September 12 that year, {{finishing}} on January 14, 1989.

Jackson broke a Guinness World Record when 504,000 people attended seven sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium.

5|$|Aza Arianao was {{recorded}} over {{five days in}} the summer of 2000 and released the following year. In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which {{was recorded}} in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future. The same year he toured extensively in France, the United States and Canada.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the Graceland tour, she worked with journalist James Hall to write an autobiography titled Makeba: My Story. The book contained descriptions of her experience with apartheid, and was also critical of the commodification and consumerism she experienced in the US. The book was translated into five languages. She {{took part in the}} Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute, a popular-music concert staged on 11 June 1988 at London's Wembley Stadium, and broadcast <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> 600 million across 67 countries. Political aspects of the concert were heavily censored in the US by the Fox television network. The use of music to raise awareness of apartheid paid off: a survey after the concert found that among people aged between 16 and 24, three-quarters knew of Mandela, and supported his release from prison.|$|E

In October 2015, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016. The show tied for best Outstanding Reality Program at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{world tour}} that {{followed}} consisted of well over 100dates and culminated on 19 January 2001 {{in a show}} at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> around 250,000. While the performance was being produced for a CD and DVD release in March 2002, under the name Rock in Rio, the band took a year out from touring, during which they played three consecutive shows at Brixton Academy in aid of former drummer Clive Burr, who had recently {{announced that he had}} been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The band performed two further concerts for Burr's MS Trust Fund charity in 2005, and 2007, before his death in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Though sound-on-film would {{eventually}} become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema, Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations, {{which came to}} an effective dead end. In 1914, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt was granted German patent 309,536 for his sound-on-film work; that same year, he apparently demonstrated a film made with the process <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> scientists in Berlin. Hungarian engineer Denes Mihaly submitted his sound-on-film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian Patent Court in 1918; the patent award was published four years later. Whether sound was captured on cylinder, disc, or film, none of the available technology was adequate for big-league commercial purposes, and for many years {{the heads of the}} major Hollywood film studios saw little benefit in producing sound motion pictures.|$|E
5|$|The House of Orpheus in the {{southern}} part of the city thus takes its name from the large mosaic depicting Orpheus playing his harp <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.|$|E
5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>of</b> 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces {{that they wanted to}} record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E
