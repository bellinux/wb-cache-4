5|$|Slow lorises have {{an unusually}} low basal {{metabolic}} rate, about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of their size, {{comparable to that of}} sloths. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie diet <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans.|$|E
5|$|Khmer Loeu diets in Ratanakiri {{are largely}} {{dictated}} by the food <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> for harvesting or gathering. Numerous food taboos also limit food choice, particularly among pregnant women, children, and the sick. The primary staple grain is rice, though most families experience rice shortages during the six months before harvest time. Some families have begun to plant maize to alleviate this problem; other sources of grain include potatoes, cassava, and taro. Most Khmer Loeu diets are low in protein, which is limited in availability. Wild game and fish are major protein sources, and smaller animals such as rats, wild chickens, and insects are also sometimes eaten. Domestic animals such as pigs, cows, and buffaloes are only eaten when sacrifices are made. In the rainy season, many varieties of vegetables and leaves are gathered from the forest. (Vegetables are generally not cultivated.) Commonly eaten fruits include bananas, jackfruit, papayas, and mangoes.|$|E
