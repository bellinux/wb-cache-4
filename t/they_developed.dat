Shortly thereafter, <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> a {{relationship}} that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors.

5|$|Jansch toured Scandinavia, {{working as}} a duo with Martin Jenkins and, based on ideas <b>they</b> <b>developed,</b> {{recorded}} the Avocet album (initially released in Denmark). Jansch rates this as among his own favourites from his own recordings. On returning to England, he set up Bert Jansch's Guitar Shop at 220, New King's Road, Fulham. The shop specialised in hand-built acoustic guitars but was not a commercial success and closed after two years.|$|E

5|$|A C Benson was {{a friend}} of Henry James, to whom Walpole wrote a fan letter late in 1908, with Benson's encouragement. A {{correspondence}} ensued and in February 1909 James invited Walpole to lunch at the Reform Club in London. <b>They</b> <b>developed</b> a close friendship, described by James's biographer Leon Edel as resembling a father and son relationship in some, but not all, respects. James was greatly taken with the young Walpole, though clear-eyed about the deficiencies in the artistry and craftsmanship of his protégé's early efforts. According to Somerset Maugham, Walpole made a sexual proposition to James, who was too inhibited to respond. Nevertheless, in their correspondence the older man's devotion was couched in extravagant terms.|$|E

5|$|After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a {{small group}} of friends with whom he {{regularly}} tested his creations, starting in 1960. <b>They</b> <b>developed</b> a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect — some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation — all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks. Shulgin published many of these objective and subjective reports in his books and papers.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, the Slavs {{had settled}} the Baltic coast in Pomerania, which {{subsequently}} {{developed into a}} commercial and military power. Along the coastline, remnants of Scandinavian settlements and emporia were to be found. The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of Truso, located in Prussia. Prussia itself was relatively unaffected by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by Baltic Old Prussians. During the same time, the tribe of the Vistulans (Wiślanie), based in Kraków and the surrounding region, controlled a large area in the south, which <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> and fortified with many strongholds.|$|E
5|$|Despite their film careers, Orci and Kurtzman {{continued}} to create television series. These included Sleepy Hollow, which <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> alongside Phillip Iscove. They pitched the series {{to a number}} of networks, and it was picked up by Fox. Orci took five years to bring the series Matador to television, with it originating from a conversation with his cousin Andrew. It was created for Robert Rodriguez's El Rey Network, and Rodriguez's one demand of the show was that he could direct the pilot episode. Orci later explained in an interview that it was an easy decision, and he needed to pretend to consider it.|$|E

In the normal four-passenger version its speed reached 380km/h (230mph) when powered by a 447kW (600hp) BMW VI engine. The He 70 was designed with an elliptical wing, which the Günther brothers had already incorporated into the Bäumer Sausewind before they joined Heinkel. This wing design became a feature in this and many subsequent designs <b>they</b> <b>developed.</b> The He 70 drew {{the interest of the}} Luftwaffe, which was looking for an aircraft with both bomber and transport capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{civil war}} in the Arab Empire the Umayyads came to power under Muawiyah I. Under the Umayyads the conquest of the {{remaining}} Byzantine and northern Berber territories in North Africa was completed and the Arabs were able to move across large parts of the Berber world, invading Visigothic Spain through the Strait of Gibraltar, under the command of the allegedly Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad. But this happened only after <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> a naval power of their own, and they conquered and destroyed the Byzantine stronghold of Carthage between 695698. The loss of Africa meant that soon, Byzantine control of the Western Mediterranean was challenged by a new and expanding Arab fleet, operating from Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Western Electric, the {{manufacturing}} division of AT, acquired {{the rights to}} the de Forest audion, the forerunner of the triode vacuum tube. Over the next few years <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> it into a predictable and reliable device that made electronic amplification possible for the first time. Western Electric then branched-out into developing uses for the vacuum tube including public address systems and an electrical recording system for the recording industry. Beginning in 1922, the research branch of Western Electric began working intensively on recording technology for both sound-on-disc and sound-on film synchronised sound systems for motion-pictures.|$|E
