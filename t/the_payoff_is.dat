40|$|A price-setting {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate whether a proposed governmental subsidy system to reduce sales and production of environmentally harmful products would maintain competition, as required by EU regulations. Dyads of participants {{played the role of}} producers, independently setting unit prices for their products in a sequence of trials with feedback. In experimental conditions a subsidy was paid for unsold units, a system which had previously been found to raise prices and reduce the number of units sold. For half of the dyads in each condition <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>were</b> individual, in <b>the</b> other half they were split equally to motivate cooperation. Substantiating that the subsidy did not eliminate competition, the prices were set lower and incomes <b>were</b> lower when <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>were</b> individual than when they were split equally. The participants also adjusted their prices to increase their own payoff, taking into account the prices set by the others when <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>were</b> individual—which they did not when <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>were</b> split equally. <b>The</b> results support the claim that the proposed subsidy system is effective in raising prices so that sales and production of environmentally harmful products can be reduced without eliminating competition. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} n-player stochastic games with the following properties: (1) in every state, the transitions are controlled by one player, (2) <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> equal to zero in every non-absorbing state, (3) <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> non-negative in every absorbing state. With respect to the expected average reward, we provide a constructive proof that a subgame-perfect ε -equilibrium exists in pure strategies, for every ε > 0. More-over, if all transitions of a game in our class are deterministic, then the game has a subgame-perfect 0 -equilibrium in pure strategies. Keywords: mathematical economics...|$|R
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Eagle Eye a {{score of}} two stars out of four, saying: [...] "The word 'preposterous' is too {{moderate}} to describe Eagle Eye. This film contains not a single plausible moment after the opening sequence, and that's borderline. It's not an assault on intelligence. It's an assault on consciousness." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of four, saying: [...] "This movie tests the viewing public's tolerance for enduring crass stupidity when <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> <b>is</b> a series of repetitive, ADD-infected chase scenes. Director D.J. Caruso does a moderately good job of hiding how incredibly dumb this screenplay is by keeping things moving at such a whirlwind pace that a lot more seems to be happening than actually is. In reality, the chase scenes don't mean anything because they don't advance the plot—it's mice on a treadmill, running and running and not getting anywhere." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called it a [...] "slick, silly techno-thriller" [...] and [...] "Even those who surrender all disbelief at the door will be hard pressed not to smirk at some of the wildly improbable plotting." ...|$|E

30|$|This {{approach}} {{allows us}} to develop a theoretical model that explains the experimental and empirical evidence that shows that individuals reciprocate not only towards the individuals they are dealing with, but {{with other members of}} the same group. We show that for very asymmetric games (those in which some players can greatly punish or reward the opposite player with little cost to themselves), the outcome where the sum of <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> maximized is a SGRE, and if the games are played sequentially, the outcome where the sum of <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> maximized <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only SGRE, as players in the first period want their partners to be treated kindly in period 2, they are kind in order to make their partner’s opponent be kind in return.|$|R

40|$|Risky {{strategies}} with payoff mean {{changed in}} 2 × 2 simulation-based game: a normal distribution case The authors investigate <b>the</b> Nash equilibrium <b>payoff</b> in <b>the</b> 2 × 2 simulation-based game where <b>the</b> two strategic <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> Normal distribution and <b>the</b> equilibrium <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> realized after <b>the</b> decision-making.

30|$|Games {{that appear}} to be independent, {{involving}} none of the same players, may be related by emotions of reciprocity between the members of the same groups. In the real world, individuals are members of groups and want to reward or punish those groups whose members have been kind or unkind to members of their own. In this paper, we extend Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger’s model of sequential reciprocity (Games Econ Behav 47 (2): 268 – 298, 2004) to groups of individuals and define a new “sequential group reciprocity equilibrium” for which we prove its existence. We study the case of two games with two players in each game, where each player belongs to the same group as a player in the other game. We show that when <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> of one game are much higher than <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> of <b>the</b> other, the outcome of the game with higher <b>payoffs</b> determines <b>the</b> outcome of the other game. We also find that when <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>are</b> very asymmetric, <b>the</b> outcome where the sum of <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium.|$|R
30|$|Third, if <b>the</b> {{material}} <b>payoffs</b> of both {{games are}} sufficiently asymmetric (i.e., individuals can greatly reward or punish their opposing players with little cost to themselves), {{the outcome in}} which the sum of <b>the</b> material <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium. This result is very optimistic as it concludes that in the outcome where the sum of <b>the</b> material <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> being maximized, nobody wants to deviate (even if they can increase their own material payoffs by doing it). The reason is that in this case, <b>the</b> emotional <b>payoffs</b> <b>is</b> positive, in fact very positive, and even the players who can increase their material payoffs by deviating, prefer to maximize their emotional payoffs instead and being kind (as their partners are being treated nice, in fact, very nice).|$|R
