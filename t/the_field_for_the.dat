5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of a football field, and the ball moved along the board to report each play.

50|$|Gleaning is the {{traditional}} Biblical practice of gathering crops {{that would otherwise be}} left in <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> to rot or be plowed under after harvest. Because the food is unmarketable, usually due to cosmetic reasons, some growers allow crews of gleaners to pick what is left after harvest to donate to those who are needy. It is also often more cost-effective for farmers to have their crops gleaned than to have paid pickers go back through <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> missed produce.|$|R

5|$|At the time, Hooters was {{sponsoring}} a car driven by Mark Stahl, another owner-driver in the Cup series. Unlike Kulwicki, Stahl was a part-time participant who had trouble making races. The Hooters car {{failed to make}} <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Motorcraft Quality Parts 500 and the Atlanta-based chain, desiring {{a spot in the}} race, approached the sponsorless Kulwicki to gauge his interest. The principals agreed to at least a one-race deal, which became a much longer term deal when Kulwicki recorded an eighth-place finish in the race. Later in the season, Kulwicki won the Bristol night race for his third career win. In 29races, he had eleven top10 finishes, fourpoles, and finished 13th in the points.|$|E
5|$|Despite rising {{traffic to}} Las Vegas, WAE reduced {{service to the}} city amid the Great Depression. Once its {{financial}} situation improved, the airline bought the airfield and established a monopoly on flights. When the city attempted to purchase the field and build a more modern terminal, WAE refused. With the advent of World War II, however, WAE was pressured to sell the airfield. Nevadan Senator Pat McCarran helped obtain federal funding {{for the city to}} buy the field and construct a new terminal. He also helped establish a gunnery school by the United States Army Air Corps at <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> senator's contributions, the airport was named McCarran Field in 1941.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new face {{centered}} approach to <b>the</b> collocation of <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> application of a surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC). This approach deals with the ambiguities in the surface normal that arise at the edges on stair-cased surfaces [...] The accuracy of the new scheme is compared to edge based and conformal approaches using both planar sheet and spherical shell test cases. Stair-casing effects are evaluated and the face-centered scheme exhibits significantly less error than the edge based approach...|$|R

The Curwen {{family owned}} iron ore mines at Harrington and the account books of Curwen's steward contain many {{references}} to iron ore.
