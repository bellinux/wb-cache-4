5|$|The {{game was}} {{televised}} in the United States by CBS in high-definition with play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz and color commentator Phil Simms. This {{was the first}} Super Bowl announced by Nantz.

5|$|The hockey {{pitch is}} {{rectangular}} in shape. The longer perimeter edges {{are called the}} side line, the opposing shorter edges are referred toe back line and the portion of this between the goal posts {{is known as the}} goal line. The side line must measure 91.40m (100yd) and the back line should measure 55.00m (60yd). There must be a minimum run-off of 2m at <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> 3m at the backlines which may be a different surface for the final metre. All line markings must be white and 75 millimetres wide. In each corner of the pitch, a corner flag of no more than 300mm square is attached to a post of height 1.201.50m.|$|E
25|$|After {{suffering}} a severe leg injury in 1970, Pardoe {{spent two years}} on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> <b>and</b> struggled to hold down a first team place upon his return. He retired in 1976, taking {{a place on the}} coaching staff, and remained at the club until 1992.|$|E

30|$|Although {{the video}} {{reviewer}} was blinded to <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> assessment results <b>and</b> <b>the</b> medical diagnosis of concussion for this study, {{they were only}} partially blinded {{to the use of}} the HIA. Given that the process for enacting a use of this rule requires the trainer to provide a signal to <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> official on <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> identifies <b>the</b> interchange, the video reviewer was able to identify many instances where the HIA was used.|$|R
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2003, long-time GM Jerry Krause retired, and former player and color {{commentator}} John Paxson was tapped as his successor. Jay Williams, coming off a promising rookie campaign, was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. His contract was bought out by the Bulls in February 2004 and {{he has yet to}} return to the game. Paxson selected point guard Kirk Hinrich with the seventh pick in the draft, and signed veteran free agent and former franchise player Scottie Pippen. With Pippen playing, Cartwright at <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> <b>and</b> Paxson in the front office, the Bulls hoped that some of the championship magic from before would return.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} {{minutes of the}} game, {{it seemed that the}} game would live up to the hype. On the opening kickoff, 49ers rookie kick {{returner}} Derrick Harmon caught the ball too close to <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> stepped out of bounds at the San Francisco 6-yard line. The 49ers managed to advance to the 41-yard line but were forced to punt, and Dolphins defensive back Fulton Walker returned the punt 9 yards to the Miami 36-yard line. Then on their first play of the drive, Marino completed a 25-yard pass to Tony Nathan. Five plays later, Miami reached the San Francisco 23-yard line. But on third down, 49ers cornerback Eric Wright tackled wide receiver Mark Clayton 2 yards shy of the first down. Miami had to settle for a 37-yard field goal from Uwe von Schamann.|$|E
500|$|The 1934 NFL Championship Game, {{dubbed the}} [...] "Sneakers Game" [...] because the Giants donned sneakers at halftime {{to get better}} traction, {{resulted}} in a 30–13 win on {{the field for the}} team but an even more important victory in the box office. Tickets for the game sold so fast that Mara decided to add 6,000 temporary seats on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> in other portions of the stadium, which resulted in the team taking in $64,504 from that game alone.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Canada lost {{a bid for}} {{a seat on the}} UN Security Council. While {{initially}} {{blaming the}} loss on his rival Ignatieff, Harper later said that it was due to his pro-Israeli stance. Harper then said that he would take a pro-Israeli stance, no matter what the political cost to Canada. Ignatieff criticized Harper's stance as a [...] "mistake", saying Canada would be better able to defend Israel through the Security Council than from <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> pointed out that it is the Security Council that will determine if sanctions are imposed on Iran. Ignatieff also accused Harper of steering the discussion away from implementing the two-state solution, and instead rendering all discussion into a competition [...] "about who is Israel's best friend".|$|E
500|$|Franken said {{he learned}} that 21% of Americans {{received}} most of their news from talk radio, an almost exclusively conservative medium. Said Franken, [...] "I didn't want to sit on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> <b>and</b> I believed Air America could make a difference." [...] In November 2003, Franken talked about moving {{back to his home}} state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. At the time the seat, once held by Wellstone, was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman. At a 2004 Democratic presidential campaign event, Franken tackled a man who was allegedly threatening other attendees and heckling Governor Howard Dean. [...] In 2005, Franken announced his move to Minnesota: [...] "I can tell you honestly, I don't know if I'm going to run, but I'm doing the stuff I need {{to do in order to}} do it." [...] In late 2005, Franken started his own political action committee, called Midwest Values PAC. By early 2007, the PAC raised more than $1 million.|$|E

500|$|Dougan {{was signed}} by Aston Villa in July 1961 for a fee of £15,000. He {{was signed by}} manager Joe Mercer as a {{replacement}} for Gerry Hitchens, who had been sold on to Inter Milan earlier in the summer for £85,000. Teammate Peter McParland later commented that [...] "when Derek came to us at Aston Villa I think it was {{at a time when he}} was not taking the game particularly seriously". After returning from watching his [...] "Villans" [...] teammates win the 1961 League Cup Final at Villa Park on 5 September, Dougan was a passenger in a car accident which killed fellow passenger Malcolm Williams and left Dougan with a broken arm and head injuries; driver and teammate Bobby Thomson was charged but found 'Not Guilty' of careless driving. In November 2010 – three years after Dougan's death, Thomson claimed that Dougan had drunkenly pulled a deerstalker hat over his eyes, causing him to crash the car. Dougan recovered after three months on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> ended the 1961–62 season with 12 goals in 27 matches. He twisted his knee midway through the 1962–63 campaign after slipping in the street, and ended the season with 14 goals from 33 games.|$|E
500|$|Arthur and his retinue {{appear in}} some of the Lais of Marie de France, but it was the work of another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, that had the {{greatest}} influence with regard to the development of Arthur's character and legend. Chrétien wrote five Arthurian romances between [...] and 1190. Erec and Enide and Cligès are tales of courtly love with Arthur's court as their backdrop, demonstrating the shift away from the heroic world of the Welsh and Galfridian Arthur, while Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, features Yvain and Gawain in a supernatural adventure, with Arthur very much on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> weakened. However, the most significant {{for the development of the}} Arthurian legend are Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, which introduces Lancelot and his adulterous relationship with Arthur's queen (Guinevere), extending and popularising the recurring theme of Arthur as a cuckold, and Perceval, the Story of the Grail, which introduces the Holy Grail and the Fisher King and which again sees Arthur having a much reduced role. Chrétien was thus [...] "instrumental both in the elaboration of the Arthurian legend and in the establishment of the ideal form for the diffusion of that legend", and much of what came after him in terms of the portrayal of Arthur and his world built upon the foundations he had laid. Perceval, although unfinished, was particularly popular: four separate continuations of the poem appeared over the next half century, with the notion of the Grail and its quest being developed by other writers such as Robert de Boron, a fact that helped accelerate the decline of Arthur in continental romance. Similarly, Lancelot and his cuckolding of Arthur with Guinevere became one of the classic motifs of the Arthurian legend, although the Lancelot of the prose Lancelot (...) and later texts was a combination of Chrétien's character and that of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's Lanzelet. Chrétien's work even appears to feed back into Welsh Arthurian literature, with the result that the romance Arthur began to replace the heroic, active Arthur in Welsh literary tradition. Particularly significant in this development were the three Welsh Arthurian romances, which are closely similar to those of Chrétien, albeit with some significant differences: Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain is related to Chrétien's Yvain; Geraint and Enid, to Erec and Enide; and Peredur son of Efrawg, to Perceval.|$|E

2500|$|... "Fight for LSU" [...] is LSU's {{official}} fight song. During LSU football games, it {{is played}} {{when the team}} runs onto the field, after the field goal or extra point is attempted/scored {{and at the end}} of each half (though at the end of the first half a recording is played since the band is already on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> <b>and</b> unable to perform it live). Contrary to popular belief, the song [...] "Hey Fightin' Tigers" [...] is not LSU's fight song, however it is a staple at pep rallies and is often sung by fans before games and after wins.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} week of the 2005 season, the New Orleans Saints used the stadium for a [...] "home" [...] game against the Giants because of {{extensive}} damage to the Louisiana Superdome after Hurricane Katrina. One end zone was painted in Saints colors, Saints banners were hung on the walls around <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> <b>and</b> the Saints wore their home jerseys. The game was rescheduled to a Monday night with a special start time of 7:30 PM EDT, preceding the other scheduled game on Monday Night Football. The Giants were normally not visitors at Giants Stadium unless they were playing the Jets.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} {{broadcast}} in the United States by NBC Sports – at the time, still a [...] "Service of NBC News" [...] – with Curt Gowdy handling the play-by-play duties and joined by color commentators Al DeRogatis and Kyle Rote {{in the broadcast}} booth. Also helping with NBC's coverage were Jim Simpson (reporting from <b>the</b> <b>sidelines)</b> <b>and</b> Pat Summerall, on loan from CBS (helping conduct player interviews for the pregame show, along with Rote).
