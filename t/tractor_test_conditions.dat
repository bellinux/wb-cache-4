25|$|The WC was {{the first}} farm tractor to have rubber tires as {{standard}} equipment, and the first <b>tractor</b> <b>tested</b> on rubber in the Nebraska <b>tractor</b> <b>tests.</b> The pneumatic-rubber-tire-on-steel-wheel combination was more expensive to make than a steel wheel with cleats. To make rubber tires standard equipment while also keeping {{the cost of the}} tractor low, the WC's designers, C.E. Frudden and Walter Strehlow, gave the WC drop gearing at the rear (bull-gear-with-pinion final drives), which allowed row-crop ground clearance while having smaller-diameter drive wheels. Drop gearing had appeared many times before on earlier tractors, but never yet for this new reason—to minimize the amount of rubber needed for the tires.|$|R
40|$|Variations in sinkage and cone index are {{of crucial}} {{importance}} when planning fieldwork, and {{for determining the}} trafficability of farm machinery. Many studies have highlighted the link between higher values of these parameters and dramatic decreases in crop yield. Variations in the dry bulk density and cone index of clayey soil in Southern Spain were measured following each of five successive passes over the same land with {{the three types of}} tractor most widely used in the area (tracked, two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive). In addition, sinkage (rut depth) of the running gear was measured using a laser microrelief profile meter. This device, which integrates three sensors, was specifically designed for these experiments, as was an electrical penetrometer to determine the cone index, and both instruments proved reliable and accurate in the field. The main goal {{of this study was to}} design, manufacture and test these new devices. The first pass caused most soil alteration when compared to successive passes for all types of <b>tractor</b> <b>tested</b> and soil <b>conditions</b> prevailing during the tests. (Heavier) four-wheel drive tractors were found to cause greater soil damage (sinkage, cone index and dry bulk density) than two-wheel drive and track tractors. There was no statistically significant difference between the two latter types. The greatest alterations were recorded in the top 10 cm of the soil. The results show that soil compaction should be avoided as much as possible. This can be achieved by ensuring that tractors always travel along the same tracks, especially in the wet season.

5000|$|The Nebraska <b>tractor</b> <b>testing</b> law had {{its roots}} from 1919 when Wilmot Crozier, a farmer and {{legislator}} from Osceola in Polk County, bought a Ford 8-16 tractor. Not made by Henry Ford Co., the Ford 8-16 didn't {{live up to its}} advertised claims. The advertisements claimed it could pull three plows at once. Mr. Crozier could only get it to pull one. He took it back to the dealership and demanded they take it back, but they told him, [...] "You own it, you keep it". They did eventually give him a Rumely H tractor The advertisements claimed it could pull three plows at once; Crozier got it to pull five. Wilmot Crozier and State Senator Charles Warner decided to ensure that all farmers would get a fair deal when buying any model of tractor sold in Nebraska. Under their leadership, the Nebraska Tractor Test Law was passed in 1919, House Roll 85. At the same time, the legislature established a facility for <b>tractor</b> <b>testing</b> on the east campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to ensure that tractor manufacturers met their advertised claims of the tractors performance.The Nebraska Tractor Test Laboratory is known around the world as the first test lab in the world.

The <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> chosen were {{a test case}} relevant to LPP (lean premixed prevaporized combustion) for gas turbines (pair= 15. 5 bar, Tair= 750 K) and the corresponding cold <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> in terms of air density (pair= 6 bar, Tair= 290 K). Both test cases were investigated in the absence {{as well as in}} the presence of a filmer plate on which part of the nascent fuel spray impinges. The nozzle diameter was 0. 45 mm and the fuel flowrate was 2. 94 g/s, so that the fuel-to-air momentum flux ratio q (q=(rliq*uliq 2) /(rair*uair 2)) assumed a value of 6.

Results of inter-laboratory ageing studies of roll-to-roll and spin coated samples with correspondingly flexible plastic packaging and glass encapsulation tested under dark <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> among 7 laboratories are presented.

Three different <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> each one of them a film showing objects and corresponding phrases made of randomly generated artificial words, were designed. The structure of the first, high variability <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> included context-dependent information and the structures of the second and the third, low variability <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> were characterised by frequent nonsense target-word rate, target-words occurring in phrase final position. The aim of the artificial input language was to ensure the novelty of test material, and to simulate the type of learning situation - when the semantic content of words is arbitrary - facing young infants in the beginning of language learning. Analysis of informants looking behaviour, prior to, and after exposure to the objects and the corresponding audio input, were performed. Results showed that the structure of high variability <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> and the structure of low variability <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> were associated with significant between-group differences. This finding indicates that the nonsense phrases in low variability <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> managed to 'explain' the objects just like semantically meaningful phrases do.
