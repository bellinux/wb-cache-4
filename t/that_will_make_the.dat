5|$|Chief Vanuatu, {{leader of}} the bigfoots, in {{recognition}} of the pair's actions, makes the Freelance Police members of the bigfoot tribe and tells them of a spell <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> world safe for bigfoots again, preventing their capture by humans. However, the chief requires help deciphering the spell's four ingredients, and asks for Sam and Max's help. Eventually, they discover that the ingredients are a vegetable resembling John Muir, hair restoration tonic, the tooth of a dinosaur, and a vortex contained within a snow globe. Combined with a live bigfoot sacrifice—which Max substitutes for frozen bigfoot-clad Bumpus and Harvey—the ingredients cause large trees to spring into existence, destroying towns and cities and covering the bulk of the west United States in forest. Content that their work is done, Sam and Max take the frozen ice block containing Bumpus and Harvey to the carnival. Believing that Bruno has been returned to them, the owners give a large reward of skee ball tickets to the Freelance Police, who then spend the end credits shooting targets at a carnival stall with real firearms.|$|E

25|$|In color science, {{chromatic}} adaptation is {{the estimation of}} the representation of an object under a different light source from {{the one in which}} it was recorded. A common application is to find a {{chromatic adaptation}} transform (CAT) <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> recording of a neutral object appear neutral (color balance), while keeping other colors also looking realistic. For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between ICC profiles with different white points. Adobe Photoshop, for example, uses the Bradford CAT.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of freight shipments between the EU, Russia and the Asian Pacific Region currently go by sea via the Suez Canal – a distance of between 17,000 and 22,000km. By extending the broad-gauge line, the promoters of the Košice–Vienna project aim to make the Trans-Siberian Railway more competitive vis-à-vis the sea routes. By eliminating the need to change bogies, freight delivery times from East Asia to Europe will be cut by 14 days to just half of the time required for transportation by sea. And as {{there will be no}} freight transshipment the risk of accidental damage to cargo could be reduced. Russian Railways CEO Vladimir Yakunin believes it is the faster freight delivery <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> project competitive.|$|E
25|$|Usually the pressed juice {{will require}} some {{additional}} treatment, {{which can be}} done separately to the pressed juice alone or to the entire batch of wine if the pressed juice is blended with the free-run. These treatments may include acid adjustments to lower pH, extended settling periods for clarification and additional racking to remove the extra suspended solids {{and the use of}} fining agents to remove extra solids or excess tannins. Grape pulp contains a lot of pectins that create colloid coagulation with these solids <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> wine difficult to stabilize. Some winemakers will use pectolytic enzymes during the maceration process to help break down the cell walls to allow the release of more juice freely. These enzymes are also used with white wines to assist in clarification. The type of pressing used and the amount of suspended solids plays a particular role in filtering decisions as a high amount of suspended solids (particularly natural gums) can clog and damage expensive filters.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, the PGA Tour Policy Board {{approved}} {{a change in}} the number of players <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> cut. The cut will continue to be low 70 professionals and ties, unless that results in a post-cut field of more than 78 players. Under that circumstance, the cut score will be selected to make a field as close to 70 players as possible without exceeding 78. Players who are cut in such circumstances but who have placed 70th or worse will get credit for making the cut and will earn official money and FedEx Cup points. This policy affected two of the first three events with cuts, the Sony Open in Hawaii and the Buick Invitational. In late February, the Policy Board announced a revised cut policy, effective beginning with the Honda Classic. The new policy calls for 36-hole cut to the low 70 professionals and ties and, if that cut results in more than 78 players, a second 54-hole cut to the low 70 professionals and ties. Those who do not survive the 54-hole cut are designated as MDF (made the cut, did not finish).|$|E

The National Trust have opposed the proposed development, stating that it will spoil the view and cheapen the experience, creating a [...] "fairground ride" [...] <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> area feel more like an amusement park.

[...] The {{magazine}} Peelings II awarded the game an A+, its highest rating, and noted that if only the game had high-resolution graphics, {{it would have been}} a candidate for its Game of the Year Award. According to Softalk, [...] "What puts this game head and shoulders above other adventures is that while the player is seeking the information needed to escape from the Island, the computer is actively seeking the information <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> player lose the game. [...] The dual challenges of learning about the Island while avoiding the subtle and not-so-subtle traps laid by the computer make the game both interesting and exciting". Softline stated that the game [...] "that exercises your intellect like few games", and concluded that [...] "The Prisoner is imaginative, well presented and thought provoking. Hats off to Dave Mullich and Edu-ware Services for bringing real mental challenge to the game industry". BYTE stated that the game [...] "is not for the easily frustrated ...

According to Henry Ford III, the executive in charge of the GT's development, the arrangement is part of Ford's view that video games are [...] "a new avenue for us to reach our customers". Similarly, the deal gave Turn 10 Studios direct access to Ford's design teams as the new GT was in development. Staffers with Turn 10 were some of the few people outside of Ford that knew of the GT's existence. According to Turn 10's John Wendl, [...] "this is the first time we've been able to launch a car and a game at the same time". Certain design and performance aspects of the Ford GT were first revealed through the game including the car’s active rear wing which automatically changes its angle in different conditions, such as under braking.|$|E
