25|$|The No. 24 truck {{entered as}} a {{research}} and development entry for BDR in 2005. Steve Park drove the No. 67 South Padre Island entry {{in a pair of}} races {{towards the end of the}} year following his release from Orleans Racing. His best finish was 16th at Texas. In 2006, A. J. Allmendinger drove the newly renumbered 24 for three races, posting a fifth-place run at Talladega Superspeedway. ARCA Re/MAX Series driver Phillip McGilton was to make his NASCAR debut in <b>this</b> <b>truck</b> at Homestead-Miami Speedway before going full-time with the No. 22 team in 2008, however plans were changed as Blaney was put in the No. 22 truck sponsored by Caterpillar. <b>This</b> <b>truck</b> has made only one start, which came at the 2008 Ford 200 with Tayler Malsam driving to a 21st-place finish. This team was also shut down after the 2008 season concluded.|$|E
25|$|The Leyland 4-tonne {{truck was}} {{produced}} by Leyland Trucks in Lancashire. It was developed for the British Army and won the competition to replace a fleet of older Bedford M-type 4-tonne trucks. It shares some key components with the commercial 45 Series light truck. Deliveries to the British Army started in 1990. The official British Army Out of Service Date for <b>this</b> <b>truck</b> {{was the end of}} 2014, but around 650 were retained.

25|$|When {{the column}} of {{vehicles}} stopped suddenly during this exchange, T1 Patrol's Breda-carrying truck {{collided with the}} back of the wireless truck, wrecking its radiator; the truck had to be stripped and abandoned and the crew joined other trucks. While the wireless truck was able to continue the loss of the Breda's firepower was a setback to the unit. In addition a G1 Patrol vehicle wrecked its sump after hitting a rock and this too was stripped and abandoned. T1 Patrol's wireless truck separated from the column and parked in a field at Sidi Selim (about 12km south-east of Barce) to act as a rendezvous point after the attack; <b>this</b> <b>truck</b> was also to keep a constant radio watch for messages from Lt Col David Stirling's SAS unit operating that night against Benghazi ("Operation Bigamy").|$|E
2500|$|Danny Reese: Shortly after Sherwood's departure, Rowland hired Reese to {{take over}} the truck vacated by Sherwood after it had finally {{received}} a new ECM (as seen in episode 8).

2500|$|The {{increase}} in the frame length between the preceding 40 Series and the 40-2 Series six-axle locomotives was made to accommodate the new HT-C truck design, in which the traction motors all face the same direction, making the trucks longer. [...] After a series of derailments involving Amtrak SDP40F units that were equipped with [...] "hollow bolster" [...] HT-C trucks, applied only to the SDP40F, Conrail ordered the SD40-2 units and several orders of SD50s with the older Flexicoil trucks, but the HT-C truck was vindicated and it ultimately went under most 40 Series, 50 Series and 60 Series six-axle locomotives, and <b>this</b> <b>truck</b> is still found under many remanufactured locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} of Egypt is {{taking steps to}} close the Egyptian-Sudanese trade center of Alshalateen and move it to the border control pass point on the 22nd parallel, which has had its facilities enlarged and its administrative manpower increased to handle the Egyptian-Sudanese land trade. By doing <b>this,</b> <b>trucks</b> bringing goods to Egypt from Sudan {{will not be allowed}} to unload their goods in Alshalateen, as in the past, but instead at the Hadarba border pass point. Wadi Halfa is another border pass point west of the Nile River at 22 degrees north.|$|R

2500|$|The No. 23 truck {{began in}} 2004 when Davis {{purchased}} its equipment from Phil Bonifield. The truck was piloted by Shelby Howard. Howard ran eight races {{before he was}} released, and Johnny Benson took over. Despite running a limited schedule, Benson finished 25th in points. [...] Benson became the full-time driver in 2005, and had six top-fives {{en route to a}} tenth-place points finish. Benson went on to collect five wins during the 2006 season with additional backing from Exide Batteries and finished runner-up to Todd Bodine for the championship. 360 OTC sponsored the 23 for ten races during the 2007 season. Benson won four races and finished third in points. In 2008 Benson was considered a title favorite. Benson and crew chief Trip Bruce won five races that year and held off defending champion Ron Hornaday to win the 2008 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series championship, the first ever NASCAR championship for BDR. [...] Before winning the championship, it was announced that Benson would not return in 2009. Both Benson and Trip Bruce have since been named to the No. 1 truck of Red Horse Racing. ARCA RE/MAX Series driver Tayler Malsam was intended to drive <b>this</b> <b>truck</b> for ROTY, but he later moved to Randy Moss Motorsports with Skinner.|$|E

60|$|Standing near was a {{hand truck}} {{used in the}} {{manipulation}} of small freight. It stood by a shed full of sacked wool, a consignment {{from one of the}} sheep ranches. On <b>this</b> <b>truck</b> the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool. Stooping low, Buck Patterson started for Calliope's fort, slowly pushing this loaded truck before him for protection. The posse, scattering broadly, stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him. Only once did Calliope make demonstration. He fired from a window, and some tufts of wool spurted from the marshal's trustworthy bulwark. The return shots from the posse pattered against the window frame of the fort. No loss resulted on either side.|$|E
60|$|CHORUS (describing the {{original}} combat, now symbolized in the dance) At this word they rushed in, one after another. They seized the torches; {{it seemed as}} if gods could not face them. Ushiwaka stood unafraid; he seized a small sword and fought like a lion in earnest, like a tiger rushing, like a bird swooping. He fought so cleverly that he felled the thirteen who opposed him; many were wounded besides. They fled without swords or arrows. Then Kumasaka said, 'Are you the devil? Is it a god who has struck down these men with such ease? Perhaps you are not a man. However, dead men take no plunder, and I'd rather leave <b>this</b> <b>truck</b> of Yoshitsugu's than my corpse.' So he took his long spear and was about to make off.|$|E

That darned Chinaman wouldn't come with me," [...] he added, with a laugh, [...] "because, he said, he'd knocked off work 'allee same, Mellican man!' Look here, Slinn," [...] he said, with a sudden decisiveness, [...] "my pay-roll of the men around here don't run short of a hundred and fifty dollars a day, and yet I couldn't get a hand to help me bring <b>this</b> <b>truck</b> over for my Christmas dinner." ...|$|E
