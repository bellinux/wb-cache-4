5|$|Since LAGs can be obliterated by bone remodeling, this {{represents}} an underestimate {{of the true}} number of LAGs that had actually developed; McDonald and colleagues estimated three or four missing LAGs by examining the spacing between the visible LAGs. This indicates that the animal was eight to nine years old when it died. The spacing between the LAGs decreases significantly towards the outer surface, indicating <b>that</b> <b>growth</b> was slowing, {{but the lack of}} the external fundamental system (a series of tightly-spaced LAGs) indicates <b>that</b> <b>growth</b> had not yet ceased. This is consistent with the unfused sutures between the centra and neural spines in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the unfused sutures between the sacral centra and their corresponding ribs. Overall, the growth rate of Eolambia appears to have been comparable to that of Hypacrosaurus and Maiasaura, which reached maturity after seven or eight years.|$|E
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed <b>that</b> <b>growth</b> rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{inhabit the}} tropics, {{as well as}} {{temperate}} and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice {{at the other end}} of the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean <b>that</b> <b>growth</b> rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species that could be considered amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in the splash zone.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The {{study found that the}} parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and <b>that</b> <b>growth</b> was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus {{are known}} from both large adult {{specimens}} and small larvae, showing an extreme change in body shape. In these species, {{the shape and}} proportions of skull bones change {{in the early stages}} of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits are the first to form, followed by larger ridges. As development continues, the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull, with ossification (the replacement of cartilage by bone) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication <b>that</b> <b>growth</b> rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.|$|E

40|$|The {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} nature of posttraumatic growth includes two main competing claims: one which argues <b>that</b> posttraumatic <b>growth</b> reflects authentic positive changes and the other which argues <b>that</b> posttraumatic <b>growth</b> reflects illusory defenses. While the former might suggest <b>that</b> posttraumatic <b>growth</b> enhances intimacy and close relationships, the latter might imply <b>that</b> posttraumatic <b>growth</b> hinders interpersonal relations. The present study aimed to test these claims by investigating the association between posttraumatic growth and dyadic adjustment over time at both the individual and dyadic levels, and the potential role of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Former prisoners of war and comparable war veterans and their wives (n = 229) were assessed twice, 30 – 31 (T 1) and 35 – 38 (T 2) years after the 1973 Yom Kippur War in Israel, with regard to posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress symptoms and dyadic adjustment. Results indicated <b>that</b> posttraumatic <b>growth</b> was associated with both elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms and low dyadic adjustment among both husbands and wives. Posttraumatic stress symptoms at T 1 and T 2 mediated the association between posttraumatic growth and dyadic adjustment. Wives' posttraumatic growth at T 1 predicted posttraumatic growth and dyadic adjustment of the husbands at T 2. The higher the wives' posttraumatic growth, the higher the posttraumatic growth and the lower the dyadic adjustment of the husbands in the subsequent measure. The findings suggest <b>that</b> posttraumatic <b>growth</b> reflects defensive beliefs which undermine marital relationships and <b>that</b> posttraumatic <b>growth</b> might be transmitted between spouses and implicated in {{the deterioration of the}} marital relationship over time...|$|R

25|$|The growth speed {{relevant}} to this question can be independently measured by researching the bone structure. In 1998 Zhang determined <b>that</b> <b>growth</b> was fast, leading to fibrolamellar bone. Comparison with the bone structure of an alligator indicated that Confuciusornis had a high metabolism {{comparable to that of}} modern birds. The growth speed of Confuciusornis would have been similar to that of Beipiaosaurus. A study by Armand de Ricqlès in 2003 indicated <b>that</b> <b>growth</b> was essentially modern, Confuciusornis reaching its maximum size in at most twenty weeks, perhaps as few as thirteen. Basal birds would have limited their size, not by slowing growth but by limiting the period of growth. A 2013 study found medullary bone in a short tailed specimen, confirming that it was female.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{questions}} behind and arguments {{for and against}} of Australian population growth.

There is much less agreement on the crucial question of whether population growth and immigration have also made a positive contribution to ‘intensive’ <b>growth,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>growth</b> in real national income per capita, a widely used proxy for living standards. Historically, the ‘populate or perish’ imperative was the main source of popular and political support for population growth and immigration.
