5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Since the 2003 reforms {{subsidies}} {{have been}} linked to the size of farms, so farmers get the same for a hectare of land regardless of how much land they own. So while subsidies allow small farms to exist, large farms <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the larger share of the subsidies. With the 2008 Health Check of the CAP, a first step was taken towards limiting CAP payments to very large landowners.|$|E
25|$|The {{inverted}} repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants, and accumulate few mutations. Similar {{inverted repeat}}s {{exist in the}} genomes of cyanobacteria {{and the other two}} chloroplast lineages (glaucophyta and rhodophyceae), suggesting that they predate the chloroplast, though some chloroplast DNAs have since lost or flipped the inverted repeats (making them direct repeats). It is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as chloroplast DNAs which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rearranged more.|$|E
25|$|In our galaxy, the {{distribution}} of clusters depends on age, with older clusters being preferentially found at greater distances from the galactic centre, generally at substantial distances above or below the galactic plane. Tidal forces are stronger nearer {{the centre of the}} galaxy, increasing the rate of disruption of clusters, and also the giant molecular clouds which cause the disruption of clusters are concentrated towards the inner regions of the galaxy, so clusters in the inner regions of the galaxy <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> dispersed at a younger age than their counterparts in the outer regions.|$|E

Refugees have been allowed to establish their own 'court' system which is funded by LWF. Community leaders preside over these courts and are allowed to pocket the fines they impose. Apart from fines there are punishments, including flogging and detention. Dinka community members (from South Sudan) <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> stronger punishments. Refugees are left without legal remedies against abuses as they can’t appeal against their own courts.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} Kuznets {{curve is}} a hypothesized relationship between environmental quality and economic development: various indicators {{of environmental degradation}} <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> worse as modern economic growth occurs until average income reaches a certain point {{over the course of}} development. Although the subject of continuing debate, some evidence supports the claim that environmental health indicators, such as water and air pollution, show the inverted U-shaped curve. It has been argued that this trend occurs in the level of many of the environmental pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, lead, DDT, chlorofluorocarbons, sewage, and other chemicals previously released directly into the air or water.|$|E

25|$|The {{shell model}} {{was able to}} qualitatively explain many of the mysterious {{properties}} of atoms which became codified in the late 19th century in the periodic table of the elements. One property {{was the size of}} atoms, which could be determined approximately by measuring the viscosity of gases and density of pure crystalline solids. Atoms <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> smaller toward the right in the periodic table, and become much larger at the next line of the table. Atoms {{to the right of the}} table tend to gain electrons, while atoms to the left tend to lose them. Every element on the last column of the table is chemically inert (noble gas).|$|E
25|$|Tollers {{have the}} {{capacity}} to be very social dogs, {{as long as they are}} sufficiently socialized early on in life. While Tollers are energetic and outgoing around their owners and family, their cautious nature makes them reserved around strangers. Exposure to new people, locations, smells and sights are crucial to the healthy development of the Toller breed. They <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along well with other dogs; however, they have a strong prey drive and may chase after cats or other small animals. Their prey drive can be avoided if cats, for example, are introduced early on in a Toller's life. Failure to properly socialize Tollers at a young age may result in aggressive, destructive, or timid behaviour in maturity.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, {{local and}} {{national}} government often refuse to recognize slums, because the slum are on disputed land, or because of the fear that quick official recognition will encourage more slum formation and seizure of land illegally. Recognizing and notifying slums often triggers a creation of property rights, and requires that the government provide public services and infrastructure to the slum residents. With poverty and informal economy, slums do not generate tax revenues {{for the government and}} therefore <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> minimal or slow attention. In other cases, the narrow and haphazard layout of slum streets, houses and substandard shacks, along with persistent threat of crime and violence against infrastructure workers, makes it difficult to layout reliable, safe, cost effective and efficient infrastructure. In yet others, the demand far exceeds the government bureaucracy's ability to deliver.|$|E

25|$|Although {{females are}} less likely than males to {{initiate}} physical violence, they can express aggression by using a variety of non-physical means. Exactly which method women use to express aggression is something that varies from culture to culture. On Bellona Island, a culture based on male dominance and physical violence, women <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into conflicts with other women more frequently than with men. When in conflict with males, instead of using physical means, they make up songs mocking the man, which spread across the island and humiliate him. If a woman wanted to kill a man, she would either convince her male relatives to kill him or hire an assassin. Although these two methods involve physical violence, both are forms of indirect aggression, since the aggressor herself avoids getting directly involved or putting herself in immediate physical danger.|$|E
25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is {{an emotion}} that is felt in {{all stages of}} infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> angry at them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E
25|$|Green, swing {{promoting}} {{and humid}} conditions {{sums up the}} construction of English pitches but everything depends on weather e.g. in summer it may behave like Indian pitches too. Early in the season, most batsmen {{have to be on}} their guard as English pitches prove to be most fickle, like the country's weather. Later in the summer, the pitches <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> harder and lose their green. This makes the task easier for batsmen and only genuine fast bowlers like those bowling in range of (135–150km/h) and spinners can contain. Spinners prove less effective {{in the first half of}} the season and tend to play their part only in the second half. The humid conditions and little dust makes the grounds ideal place to practice reverse swing with a 50-over old ball. Of all grounds, The Oval is the most dangerous as the ball reverse swings most there. Another reason for this is traditionally it hosts the last international test match of a touring side in a summer.|$|E
