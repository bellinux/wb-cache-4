Throughout the video the women click <b>their</b> <b>heels</b> and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E

50|$|Occasionally, faces {{who have}} {{recently}} turned from being heels still exhibit characteristics from <b>their</b> <b>heel</b> persona. This occurs due to fans being entertained by a wrestler despite (or because of) <b>their</b> <b>heel</b> persona, often {{due to the}} performer's charisma or charm in playing the role. Certain wrestlers such as Eddie Guerrero and Ric Flair gained popularity as faces by using tactics that would typically be associated with heels, while others like Scott Hall and Stone Cold Steve Austin displayed heelish behavior through most of their careers yet got big face reactions, leading them to be marketed as antiheroes.|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} reform {{of all was}} the emancipation of the serfs, a policy that was unpopular with large sections of the nobility. When the committee appointed to bring it about dug in <b>their</b> <b>heels</b> and made difficulties, Alexander II asked Konstantin to join the committee in September 1857. Where the Tsar was unsure of himself, his younger brother was more forceful, quick tempered, and cared not what others might think of him.|$|E
25|$|On 24 June, Gyulai's {{advance guard}} clashed with Broussier at Karlsdorf south of Graz. A {{battalion}} of the Franz Karl Infantry Regiment, a landwehr battalion, two companies of Grenzers, and four squadrons of cavalry confronted five French battalions supported by six artillery pieces. The Frimont Hussars drove back one battalion of the 9th Line Infantry Regiment. The French had {{the better of}} the encounter when the untried soldiers of the Massal Austrian landwehr took to <b>their</b> <b>heels.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Tour de France has {{the major}} fault of {{dividing}} the country, {{right down to}} the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in <b>their</b> <b>heels</b> and the neighbours were complaining.|$|E
25|$|With his {{effectiveness}} {{hindered by}} {{the necessity of}} pitching two days in a row, the Browns found themselves on <b>their</b> <b>heels</b> quickly when ace Bob Caruthers walked four of the first five batters, surrendering a second run on a base hit given up to third baseman Tom Burns of the Chicagos. The game was called after completion of eight innings due to darkness. John Clarkson was again {{on top of his}} game as the right hander struck out 8 Browns in earning his second win of the series. Caruthers took the loss for the Browns, giving Chicago a lead of two games to one in the series.|$|E
25|$|With {{the failure}} of the break up of the siege, a mutiny broke out amongst the Spanish troops because of arrears of pay and about 1,200 {{soldiers}} deserted in Venlo. As a force they captured Hamont and then fled to Hoogstraten {{with the rest of the}} Spanish troops on <b>their</b> <b>heels</b> before making a deal with Maurice. In the terms given to the mutineers by Maurice Grave was to be garrisoned by them and kept in their hands before being returned to Dutch control by the end of 1603. While Grave surrendered Maurice heard the news that Albert's troops were making no progress in the siege at Ostend.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, Terceira (and Angra in particular) {{has been}} a popular place for out-of-favor monarchs to cool <b>their</b> <b>heels</b> while events on the Portuguese {{mainland}} or elsewhere went on without them. In 1667, {{near the end of}} the Portuguese Restoration War, King Afonso VI, his chief advisor, Castelo Melhor, and Castelo Melhor's francophile party were overthrown by the king's younger brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja, (who later ruled as Pedro II of Portugal.) Pedro first installed himself as his brother's regent; then, he arranged Afonso's exile to the island of Terceira in the Azores on the pretense that he was incapable of governing. Afonso's exile lasted seven years.|$|E
25|$|Far to the east, {{a column}} of French conscripts under Jacob Job Élie, set out from Philippeville toward Beaumont. In {{the early hours of}} 16 October, they were {{attacked}} by Coalition troops and fled. Élie managed to rally his soldiers and arrange them in two lines near Boussu-lez-Walcourt. At dawn when the Austrians attacked again, the second line fired a volley into the backs of the first line and all the infantry took to <b>their</b> <b>heels.</b> Louis Henri Loison capably covered the retreat with the French cavalry, saving the foot soldiers from being cut to pieces. As it was, Élie lost 400 men and 12 artillery pieces, while only 138 casualties were suffered by Benjowsky's division.|$|E
25|$|As Caulaincourt's dragoons {{disposed}} of their opponents, {{the mass of}} French cavalry poured across the ford behind them. At this moment Soult waved forward the infantry brigade assigned to attack the bridge. Led by the 1st Battalion of the 40th Line Infantry Regiment, the French dashed forward. They were aided by a crossfire of horse artillery pieces and skirmisher fire. Seeing that the French cavalry would soon cut them off, the Spanish infantry fired two badly-aimed volleys at their attackers and took to <b>their</b> <b>heels.</b> The redoubt and all its guns were captured by the French. Both of Girard's brigades reached the south bank {{with the loss of}} only a few men who lost their footing at the ford and drowned.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the heel pad {{mechanical}} properties of runners, who repetitively load the heel pad during training, with cyclists who do not load <b>their</b> <b>heel</b> pads during training. Ten competitive long distance runners and 10 competitive cyclists volunteered for this study. The thickness of the unloaded heel pad was measured using realtime B-mode ultrasonography. A heel pad indentation device was used to measure the mechanical properties of the heel pads. To evaluate the differences between the two groups, in heel pad properties, a repeat measures analysis of variance was used (p <. 05.) Heel pad thickness was not different between groups when normalized with respect to subject height. There was no significant difference between the groups in percentage energy loss during loading and unloading (runners: 61. 4 % +/- 8. 6; cyclists: 62. 5 % +/- 4. 6). Heel pad stiffness for the runners was statistically significantly less than that of the cyclists (p =. 0018; runners: 17. 1 N. - 1 +/- 3. 0; cyclists: 20. 4 N. - 1 +/- 4. 0). These results indicate that the nature of the activity undertaken by individuals may influence <b>their</b> <b>heel</b> pad properties. This finding may be important when considering differences in heel pad properties between different populations...|$|R

25|$|It rained {{again during}} the Race of Champions in 1974, and the more nimble Formula One cars showed <b>their</b> <b>heels</b> to the Formula 5000 contingent; the winner was Jacky Ickx driving a Lotus-Ford 72E. The Grand Prix circus {{returned}} to Brands for a race on 20 July, and the RAC (who organised the race) came in for censure from the FIA for allowing the pit lane to be blocked during the race, thus preventing Niki Lauda from rejoining at the end to claim fifth place, which he was awarded on appeal. The winner was Jody Scheckter in a Tyrrell-Cosworth 007 who covered the 199.75-mile race at an average pace of 115.73mph, from Emerson Fittipaldi (McLaren-Cosworth M23B), Jacky Ickx (Lotus-Cosworth 72E), Clay Regazzoni and Niki Lauda (Ferrari 312B3) with Carlos Reutemann (Brabham-Cosworth BT44) in sixth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the face}} of Loison's first assault, Leite's and Moretti's men took to <b>their</b> <b>heels.</b> The Spanish hussars bolted without even {{attempting}} to stop the French charge. Leite fled, but most of his men {{ran back to the}} town and tried to defend the place. The French troops were able to fight their way into the town at a number of places. In the butchery that followed, at least 2,000 Portuguese and Spanish fell, including many townspeople. French losses were 90 killed and 200 wounded. After the killing stopped, the French soldiers thoroughly sacked Évora. According to one account, the French massacred the town's entire population. Whatever the exact truth, the atrocity made it easier for the proud Portuguese to accept British aid in their struggle. Loison continued east to drive the Portuguese away from Elvas before being ordered back to Lisbon to face a new threat.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine {{attack was}} fierce {{and it was}} not long before the Bulgarians began slowly to retreat. The Byzantine cavalry charged the {{infantry}} in the centre killing many Bulgarians. The Bulgarian position became desperate as they could not manage to hold the heights to the south of the river and began a hasty retreat to the north. Elated, the Byzantines started a bitter chase and their battle formations soon began to break, especially as a rumour spread that their commander, Leo Phocas, had been killed. At this point, Simeon, who had detected the disarray in the Byzantine formation, ordered his army to stand, and, at the head of his heavy cavalry corps, attacked the Byzantine left wing from behind the hills. With an irresistible onslaught the cavalry bore down at the confused enemy who immediately bent under their attack, panicked and took to <b>their</b> <b>heels.</b>|$|E

25|$|But {{help was}} on the way. Receiving news of the Spanish invasion, Édouard Milhaud marched his cavalry to Baza. He {{reaching}} there early on 4 November 1810 and united his horsemen with Rey's 2,000 French infantry. Milhaud brought 1,300 cavalrymen, including the 5th, 12th, 16th, 20th, and 21st Dragoon Regiments and the Polish lancers of the Legion of the Vistula. The French also had two horse artillery batteries. Blake had 12 guns {{in addition to the}} 1st and 2nd Divisions of the Army of the Center. Arranging his troopers {{on both sides of the}} main highway, Milhaud ordered a cavalry charge. The French horsemen plowed into Blake's horsemen and scattered them. As the Spanish cavalry fled, they rode through their own infantry formations. When the French dragoons and Polish lancers galloped toward the disordered Spanish infantry, the men took to <b>their</b> <b>heels.</b> The Imperial French horsemen completely smashed Blake's vanguard, hacking down scores of soldiers and capturing hundreds of others. When the French came upon Blake's second division deployed in difficult terrain, they stopped their charge. Blake quickly ordered a retreat. In the Battle of Baza the French lost 200 killed and wounded. The cavalry won the battle and Rey's infantry suffered negligible losses. Blake's army lost 500 killed and wounded and 1,000 soldiers captured.|$|E
25|$|The Italian 2nd Army {{commander}} Luigi Capello was commanding while bedridden with fever. Realizing {{that his}} forces were ill-prepared for this attack and were being routed, Capello requested permission to withdraw {{back to the}} Tagliamento. He was overruled by Cadorna who believed that the Italian force could regroup and hold out. Finally, on 30 October 1917, Cadorna ordered {{the majority of the}} Italian force to retreat {{to the other side of}} the Tagliamento. It took the Italians four full days to cross the river, and by this time the German and Austro-Hungarian armies were on <b>their</b> <b>heels.</b> By 2 November, a German division had established a bridgehead on the Tagliamento. About this time, however, the rapid success of the attack caught up with them. The German and Austro-Hungarian supply lines were stretched to breaking point and consequently they were unable to launch another attack to isolate a part of the Italian army against the Adriatic. Cadorna was able to retreat further and by 10 November had established a position on the Piave River and Monte Grappa, where the last push of the German and Austro-Hungarian forces was met and defeated by Italian forces at the First Battle of Monte Grappa.|$|E
25|$|The {{assault in}} the center was delayed because of the tardy arrival of Montrichard's division. Its 5th Light Infantry crossed the river and {{deployed}} into line but {{was hit by a}} devastating volley from an Austrian grenadier battalion. Montrichard's other units advanced in columns which were out of touch with each other. When Fröhlich's grenadiers and Förster's division counterattacked, Montrichard's division dissolved and its soldiers took to <b>their</b> <b>heels.</b> The grenadier battalion was swamped by fleeing Frenchmen, but it managed to keep its cohesion until some Russian infantry cut their way through to the rescue. Olivier's assault was preceded by a lightning cavalry charge around noon that swept the west bank clear of Austrians. The infantry crossed in the cavalry's wake and soon captured San Nicolò and two guns. Hearing cannon fire, Liechtenstein went forward to check on the situation and found a crowd of Austrian troops running away from Olivier's assault. He immediately went back to his command and led two squadrons each of the Lobkowitz and Levenehr Dragoons and one squadron of the Archduke Joseph Hussars against Olivier's south flank. Having disposed of Montrichard's division earlier, the Allies were free to mass against Olivier's division and eventually throw it back to the Trebbia's east bank. The Wouwermanns Grenadier Battalion recaptured two Austrian 12-pound cannons.|$|E
