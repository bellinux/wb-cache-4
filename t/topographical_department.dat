60|$|I {{sent off}} a very hurriedly-written letter two days since from Lât. In these two days we have crossed thirty-one miles of as rough a country as the warmest admirer of the desolate and savage could wish to see. Around us, {{as far as}} the eye could reach, was {{stretched}} a perfect sea of mountains; and up and down these we have tumbled and stumbled—not a few horses getting tremendous falls—from morning until long after nightfall. It has been one long monotonous toil. Sometimes we climb upon smooth slippery rock; then we ascend steep paths covered with loose boulders of every size; then we are upon a narrow ledge on a mountain’s face; then we are crashing through thick bushes. One can no longer keep count of the number of ravines we cross, for we climb a dozen hills a day. It would puzzle even the engineers of the <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> to lay down this rugged and broken country in a map. It would be as easy to make a map of the Straits of Dover, and to draw each wave to its proper scale. The toil of the troops during these two days has been tremendous. The first day’s march was thirteen miles; yesterday’s was eighteen,—many say it was twenty; but I think a long eighteen was about the mark. Eighteen miles would be a long march in England, but here it is a tremendous journey. Each man is carrying with him ammunition, &c.—fifty-five pounds—more than half a mule-load. In addition to this, most of the troops are now upon baggage-guard, and have to assist in constantly adjusting loads and looking after the mules. Lastly, a fourth of the troops are out every night upon picket. I had occasion, in a letter written from Mahkan, to speak upon the cruel over-marching of men and animals; but that was nothing to these two days’ marches. The country now is much rougher, the distances longer, and the men have in addition to carry their kits. The troops came in last night in a prostrate state; very many did not come in at all. I should say that not more than half the baggage arrived until this morning; and to add to the other disagreeables, we had a tremendous thunderstorm about eight o’clock, which wetted every soul, except the very few who had been fortunate enough to get up their tents, to the skin. The men have no change of clothes with them, and of course had to sleep in their wet clothes. Of those who were on the road when the rain began, some held on and came straggling in up to ten o’clock; the greater number, however, unrolled their blanket and waterproof-sheet, and lay down where they were for the night. I say fearlessly that such a march over such a country was never before made by similarly-weighted men. Of course we have to halt to-day, and then by to-night we shall have progressed a less distance towards Magdala than we should have done had we made three days’ marches of, say, eleven miles each. Nor is there any reason why we should not have done so. We are fortunately now in a well-watered country. Good-sized streams run between each of the higher ranges, and we crossed four or five of them yesterday.|$|E
50|$|The General Staff was {{initially}} organized with a chief {{with a head}} office and four departments: the Communications Department (1873-1937), Military Statistics Department (1873-1908), Military History Department (1873-1937) with the Military Archives and <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> (1873-1937).|$|E
50|$|Dumaresq {{became a}} {{lieutenant}} in the Bombay Native Infantry, also working in the Revenue and <b>Topographical</b> Survey <b>Department</b> of Gujarat. Granted sick leave in 1823, he spent some time recuperating in Mauritius, then jpourneyed to Hobart and Sydney. He briefly returned to England after being deemed unfit for tropical duty, but was soon travelling again to Hobart. Dumaresq's sister had married Ralph Darling, who in 1824, had been appointed Governor of New South Wales. Darling, his wife and Dumaresq (along with Dumaresq's brothers William John and Henry) sailed in the Catherine Stewart Forbes and arrived in Hobart in October 1825.|$|R
50|$|In March 1838, {{the survey}} was divided into four departments: {{geological}} and mineralogical, zoological, botanical, and <b>topographical.</b> Each <b>department</b> was headed by a specialist {{under the direction of}} the State Geologist. In 1840, the botanical and zoological aspects of the survey were abolished by the legislature. They were perceived as offering the state little benefit, overriding Houghton's protests that they remain. In 1845, Houghton was out sailing on Lake Superior when a storm overturned his boat and he drowned. After this incident {{the survey was}} suspended, although Houghton's assistant and another surveyor continued to map the mineralogical deposits on the south shore of Lake Superior.|$|R

2500|$|In December, Sheridan was {{appointed}} chief commissary {{officer of the}} Army of Southwest Missouri, but convinced the department commander, Halleck, {{to give him the}} position of quartermaster general as well. In January 1862, he reported for duty to Maj. Gen. Samuel Curtis and served under him at the Battle of Pea Ridge. Sheridan soon discovered that officers were engaged in profiteering. They stole horses from civilians and demanded payment from Sheridan. He refused to pay for the stolen property and confiscated the horses for the use of Curtis's army. When Curtis ordered him to pay the officers, Sheridan brusquely retorted, [...] "No authority can compel me to jayhawk or steal." [...] Curtis had Sheridan arrested for insubordination but Halleck's influence appears to have ended any formal proceedings. [...] Sheridan performed aptly in his role under Curtis and, now returned to Halleck's headquarters, he accompanied the army on the Siege of Corinth and served as an assistant to the <b>department's</b> <b>topographical</b> engineer, but also made the acquaintance of Brig. Gen. William T. Sherman, who offered him the colonelcy of an Ohio infantry regiment. This appointment fell through, but Sheridan was subsequently aided by friends (including future Secretary of War Russell A. Alger), who petitioned Michigan Governor Austin Blair on his behalf. Sheridan {{was appointed}} colonel of the 2nd Michigan Cavalry on May 27, 1862, despite having no experience in the mounted arm.|$|R

50|$|Gutiérrez was {{acquainted with}} letters {{from an early}} age, but did not disdain the sciences, and was {{especially}} fond of mathematics. He studied engineering {{as much as he}} did law. He earned his doctorate in jurisprudence at age 27 with the thesis Sobre los tres poderes públicos ("On the three public powers"). He was exempt from paying tuition due to his family's poor economic standing, but chose to pay his own way as a surveyor and engineer with the <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department,</b> by producing translations, and by contributing to literary journals.|$|E
50|$|From 1833 to 1843 he was {{employed}} by Thomas Colby and Thomas Larcom {{as head of}} the <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> (the antiquities division) of the Irish Ordnance Survey. Amongst his staff were John O'Donovan, one of Ireland's greatest ever scholars, and Eugene O'Curry. A prizewinning essay submitted to the Royal Irish Academy in 1834 on Irish military architecture was never published, but his seminal essay On the History and Antiquities of Tara Hill was published by the Academy in 1839. During this period Petrie was himself the editor of two popular antiquarian magazines, the Dublin Penny Journal and, later, the Irish Penny Journal.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the death}} of Edward O'Reilly in August 1830, he was {{recruited}} to the <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> of the first Ordnance Survey of Ireland under George Petrie in October 1830. Apart from a brief period in 1833, he worked steadily for the Survey on place-name researches until 1842, unearthing and preserving many manuscripts. After that date, O'Donovan's work with the Survey tailed off, although he was called upon {{from time to time}} to undertake place-name research on a day-to-day basis. He researched maps and manuscripts at many libraries and archives in Ireland and England, with a view to establishing the correct origin of as many of Ireland's 63,000 townland names as possible. His letters to Larcom are regarded as an important record of the ancient lore of Ireland for those counties he documented during his years of travel throughout much of Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Spate's {{dissertation}} was admired, but {{his strong}} political beliefs made an academic career in England unlikely. After {{a year as}} a tutor in Reading, he took up a position at the University of Rangoon in Myanmar (then Burma) in 1937. There he became interested in the colonial struggle for independence, and produced a steady stream of high-quality work on the geography of Myanmar. When World War II broke out, Spate joined he army as a volunteer and was seriously injured in the first Japanese raid on the Rangoon airport. He was evacuated to India, where he recuperated, wrote poetry, and served in the unusual capacity of a military censor. In 1944, he moved to the Inter-Service <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> in New Delhi (and later Kandy, Sri Lanka) where he was a major in charge of the section of the office dealing with Burma.|$|E
50|$|The Interservices <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> (ISTD) {{came out}} of the near-fiasco of the British {{invasion}} of Norway (April 9 - May 9, 1940). Prior to that time, the Army and Royal Navy had different intelligence units that were independent of each other. The ISTD was established at Manchester College, Oxford. Working together with members of each arm and the Allies, this unit was able to bring together zero-elevation aerial photography, which is phototgraphy taken as close to the wave tops as possible, in order to bring the views of the beach landscape, which were then made into continuous horizontal strip photographs. These files were marked with military targets such as bridges, marshalling yards and the like, and up-to-date photos and intelligence were used to up date obsolete maps. From these new maps, and from older maps, magazine illustrations, and old family photographs taken on holiday collected from the public, new maps could be produced for the planning staffs and operations forces.|$|E
50|$|Higgins Lake {{is a large}} {{recreational}} and fishing lake in Roscommon County, in the U.S. state of Michigan. The 9,900 acre (40 km²) lake {{is known for its}} deep, clear waters and is the 10th largest in Michigan with a shoreline of 21 mi. It is named after Sylvester Higgins, the first chief of the <b>topographical</b> <b>department</b> of the Michigan Geological Survey. It has a maximum width of 4 mi and a length of 7 mi with a maximum depth of 135 ft. The mean depth is 44 ft and the lake contains almost 20 billion cubic feet (570 million m³) of water. Its retention time is about 12.5 years. The lake's watershed covers 19,000 acres (77 km²). The twin-lobed lake receives half of its water from submerged springs, six percent from incoming streams, and the remainder from direct rainfall and runoff. It drains into Marl Lake by the Cut River which runs into Houghton Lake and eventually to Lake Michigan. A mile north of the lake, water flows into the Lake Huron watershed.|$|E
5000|$|Babcock {{served the}} entire Civil War. Initially, Babcock {{volunteered for the}} Sturgis Rifles as an enlisted soldier in 1861, but he soon was offered a {{civilian}} position to be a principal scout for the Army of the Potomac. Babcock became a skilled interrogator of captured Confederates. In 1862, Babcock worked as a Confederate order-of-battle expert with the <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> under Allan Pinkerton and made maps for General George B. McClellan. In one of his reports, Babcock's estimate of enemy forces was off by less than one percent. Early in 1863, Babcock joined the Bureau of Military Information under Colonel George H. Sharpe to gather intelligence. While in this secret service, Babcock provided detailed maps for aeronaut Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, who made frequent flights to obtain tactical intelligence. In 1863, Babcock discovered Robert E. Lee's forward movement, which helped end the Battle of Gettysburg. [...] At the Battle of Appomattox Court House in 1865, Babcock found General Lee under an apple tree and facilitated the surrender of the Confederate States Army. Even {{though he was a}} civilian, Babcock was unofficially called [...] "Captain Babcock" [...] and then later [...] "Colonel Babcock".|$|E
50|$|In 1847, Petermann {{moved to}} London with the {{intention}} of furthering his geographical studies and then returning to Germany. Soon, however, he decided to follow a professional career there as the environment he moved into seemed to be favorable for his prospects. In London, he worked as a reporter for a London periodical (Athenaeum, journal of literature, science and the fine arts. London, 1828-1921), and in 1850 founded his own establishment: The Geographical Establishment, Engraving, Lithographic and Printing Office. In 1852 the young Ernst Georg Ravenstein (1834-1913) was apprenticed to him, before he went in 1855 into the service of the <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> of the British War Office. Petermann's firm published, among other things, the Atlas of physical geography with descriptive letter press (1850, with Thomas Milner), and the Physical statistical maps of the British Isles, showing the geographical distribution of the population and inland hydrography. His productions for the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society included the map Survey of the Sea of Aral by commander A. Butakoff, 1848 & 1849. He also established lifelong relationships with many scientists, politicians and explorers, mainly through his membership of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) of London. In 1847, he {{became a member of the}} RGS. When he was 28 in 1850 he was elected under-Secretary. In 1868 he was awarded with the prestigious 'Founders medal' of the RGS.

50|$|As the war progressed, the Museum and Library staffs participated {{more and}} more in the {{activities}} of the Inter-Services <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> (I.S.T.D.), a special department responsible for supplying topographical intelligence for all combined operations, and, in particular, for preparing reports in advance of military operations overseas. It relied in large measure upon the Museum and Library organization for the provisions of the geological information incorporated into the reports, such information being written up by the Museum staff or by the staff of the I.S.T.D. from bibliographies, maps and texts supplied to its Library Liaison Service from the Museum. The work was of a highly confidential character but, in special circumstances, of great importance and interest, and it is now permissible to state that the Museum and Library staffs provided information relating to every considerable military operation in Africa and Europe from the first landings in North Africa. Of special significance, not always apparent at the time that they were supplied, are the reports of North Africa and other Mediterranean territories in 1942; on Yugoslavia, Crete, the Dodecanese, and Möhne Valley, Lampedusa, Pantelleria, the geology of certain Alpine tunnels, and various regions of the Far East in 1943; and those on the flying bomb sites in France in 1944. In connexion with this class of work {{and in the course of}} a visit to the United States in 1944 by a member of the Museum staff, the opportunity was taken to establish contact with the Military Geology Unit of the US Geological Survey, with most helpful results. Considerable assistance was also given to the Naval Intelligence Division, whose handbooks are extensively used by the Services, by Government Departments, and by British embassies abroad. Chapters were contributed on the Mineral economics of West Africa, the Belgian Congo, Mozambique and Angola, and accounts of the geology and mineral resources of other territories prepared the staff of Naval Intelligence Division were checked prior to printing off.In addition to the contributions made to the work of these two service Departments, assistance and information was given from time to time to various Government Departments such as the Ministry of Supply, the Ministry of Economic Warfare, the Ministry of Works and Buildings, the Imperial War Graves Commission, the Ministry of Information, the Ministry of Aircraft Production, and to the scientific liaison officers of the Dominion Governments.|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of territory as a constitutive element of States {{was a much}} more dynamic and complex process than it is made out to be. Within {{the framework of the}} Buenos Aires State formation, separated from the Argentine Confederation, the <b>Topographical</b> <b>Department</b> prompted a process of information search on the limits of internal jurisdictions (partidos) that was carried out by local authorities (jueces de paz) towards 1854. The aim of this articule is to analyze the criteria used by local authorities to establish limits to their own jurisdictions, and the adjustments proposed within their territory. In addition, the nature of information use and communication within the administration is taken into consideration, both on a provincial and local level {{as well as in the}} State’s own distribution. We argue that territorial management processes in a complex situation of political turmoil and inherent administrative limitations had a prolonged realization. Articulation processes aimed to reach a consensus on jurisdictional limits that would allow an improved control of both territory and population entailed, towards the mid 19 th century, the acceptance of different social and political relations by local and provincial authorities...|$|E
40|$|Marshall Conant, {{the second}} {{principal}} of Bridgewater Normal School, {{was born in}} Pomfret, Vermont, January 5, 1801, of parents who had emigrated from Bridgewater, Massachusetts. He attended the district schools in his native state and in his youth was apprenticed to a carpenter. Having developed an interest in mechanics, he decided to become an architect and carried on a rigorous program of mental improvement. He began his teaching in his own district and in his free time studied geometry, calculus, and astronomy. At the age of twenty-four, despite his limited education and equipment, he computed a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse and was overjoyed to find his calculations verified. He also constructed a table for a systematic method of making his computations. In the summer of 1828, he calculated an Almanac for 1829, of which 10, 000 copies were sold. He taught in Boston and Roxbury and in 1837 went to Hillsboro, Illinois, where he headed a new academy established there, in which his wife Roxanne also taught. Conant returned to Massachusetts in 1841 and shortly afterward was named head of the <b>topographical</b> <b>department</b> of the Boston Water Works. During his four years in this post, the first major water lines of Boston were constructed. He made many computations in hydraulics, {{and some of his}} papers of this period are in the college archives. When this work was completed he became the engineer in charge of constructing the new railroad from Dover, New Hampshire to Lake Winnipesaukee. In 1852 he moved to Bridgewater, the home of his ancestors, where he became superintendent of the Eagle Cotton Gin Company. In his new home he became friendly with Nicholas Tillinghast, and so impressed Tillinghast that when the principal resigned in 1853 he recommended that Marshall Conant be appointed his successor and the Board of Education concurred. In his administration Mr. Conant expanded the scientific studies in the Normal School, adding books to the school library, anatomical plates, historical, geological and geographical maps, and scientific apparatus, including an orrery, which he made. He also helped to organize the Bridgewater Natural History Society and delivered the opening lecture to this group. He sent forth many excellent teachers, some of whom headed and developed Normal Schools {{in many parts of the}} country, and he brought to the Normal School faculty two of its most illustrious members, Albert Gardner Boyden and Eliza B. Woodward, both of whom came to the school in the fall of 1857. When he resigned from the principalship in 1860, the foundation of a professional school for teachers was firmly laid. In 1862 George Boutwell, Director of the Internal Revenue Service, named Mr. Conant as his assistant, and for the next ten years Conant resided in Washington, D. C. He returned to Bridgewater in 1872, broken in health but with a clear and active mind, and completed a manuscript for an astronomical publication shortly before his death in Bridgewater on February 10, 1873. Of Mr. Conant, his successor, Albert Gardner Boyden, wrote: “His whole mind and strength were given to his teaching; his genial manner, his ready command of language, and his faculty in illustration, always secured the attention of his pupils. In his favorite studies of Mathematics, Astronomy, and Mechanics, he was very clear, definite, and original in his methods. By his fidelity, his devotion, his enthusiasm, and the inspiration of his life, he was constantly drawing his pupils to higher fields of thought and higher attainment. ” Can there really be a better tribute to a teacher?[URL]...|$|E
