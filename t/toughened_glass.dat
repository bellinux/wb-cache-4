40|$|A common {{method to}} {{determine}} the distribution of internal stresses in thermally or chemically <b>toughened</b> <b>glasses</b> depends on stress-optical measurements made on ground samples over a suitably chosen cross section.

In situations where thermal stress cracking has occurred, it can be prevented by using a thicker standard window glass which is structurally stronger and more resistant to cracking, or by using thin <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> to increase strength.|$|E
25|$|When built, {{the driving}} cabs had {{distinctive}} wrap-around front windows, although these {{were replaced by}} flat, <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> in the 1970s to better protect drivers following some incidents of stone-throwing vandalism.

This was particularly appreciated in the scenic riverside areas around Craigendoran and Helensburgh.|$|E
25|$|Glass doors {{pose the}} risk of unintentional {{collision}} if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface {{to make it more}} visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated or <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E

50|$|Nickel sulfide has two polymorphs. The alpha form has a {{hexagonal}} unit cell, {{while the}} beta form has a rhombohedral cell. Small amounts of this compound occur as imperfection when glass is manufactured. It {{is believed that}} cracks occur in <b>toughened</b> window <b>glass</b> panels due to the volume change associated with the alpha to beta phase transition of these nickel sulfide defects.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of <b>toughening</b> <b>glass</b> and ceramics by {{addition of a}} piezoelectric particulate secondary phase {{is the focus of}} current research. It is hypothesised that stress concentrations at the tip of an advancing crack can re-orient piezoelectric domains within the reinforcement {{in the direction of the}} stress field around the crack, thus dissipating energy which contribute to fracture toughness increment of the composite. Previous work has focussed on producing glass/piezoelectric inclusion composites by conventional sintering. This process is accompanied by extended porosity formation, as well as Pb depletion in the PZT phase. In several cases, the long processing times required to fully sinter the glass matrix lead to glass-PZT reactions and to loosing the stoichiometry of the PZT inclusions. In this study, the novel production of new glass matrix composites reinforced with piezoelectric inclusions by using microwave heating was investigated. Specifically, lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) particles in lead silicate and borosilicate glass matrices were considered. Mixtures of glass and PZT powders were prepared and used to fabricate powder compacts by uniaxial cold-pressing. In order to achieve densification, the compacts were subsequently heated in a single mode applicator, connected to a generator operating at the 2. 45 GHz ISM frequency. ...|$|R
25|$|The listed train {{shed roof}} which is 105 metres wide between {{platforms}} 1 and 12, has four spans, two spans 185 metres in length over {{the eastern part}} of the station date from the 1860s while the other two at the western side measuring 150 metres long were built in the early 1880s. The roof is supported by masonry walls with round-headed windows alongside platforms 1 and 12 and rows of cast iron columns. The roof spans have wrought iron trusses with cast iron struts on girders between the columns. The original roof was covered with slates with some glazing. The slates were subsequently replaced with boarded felt. Between 1997 and 1999 the roof was refurbished and 10,000 panes of <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> 'float' above the wrought iron trusses.|$|E
500|$|The {{west side}} has a [...] façade. VIP seats, {{television}} crew equipment, press and most box seats {{are in the}} west building. The glass has been designed with a curvature intended to simulate the visual effect of a ball hitting the net. Special, seamless, [...] beams {{have been developed to}} support the structure. The geometry consulting company Evolute GmbH developed panelling that rationalised the [...] double-curved freeform glass surface into 855 planar and cylindrical panels, all in hot bent <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b> This solution allowed for minimising the number of shapes necessary by 93%, reducing costs considerably.

On the first occasion that offered {{he was determined to}} go out and see these roads. That would come after the flying ship he was presently to try. His attendant officer described them as a pair of gently curving surfaces a hundred yards wide, each one for the traffic going in one direction, and made of a substance called Eadhamite--an artificial substance, so far as he could gather, resembling <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b> Along this shot a strange traffic of narrow rubber-shod vehicles, great single wheels, two and four wheeled vehicles, sweeping along at velocities of from one to six miles a minute. Railroads had vanished; a few embankments remained as rust-crowned trenches here and there. Some few formed the cores of Eadhamite ways.|$|E

50|$|When {{float glass}} is broken (normal window glass), it breaks into sharp shards that are {{dangerous}} {{to anyone in}} the vicinity. This is particularly hazardous if the window is broken by human impact. <b>Toughened</b> (tempered) <b>glass</b> can produce showers of small glass pellets that can cause serious injury; especially {{in the event of}} a car crash (because most automotive side glass is tempered). The building codes of some countries specify requirements for personal safety in architectural glass and glazing. Certain films with correct certification can be used to upgrade existing glass and glazing to meet the safety standards specified in the building codes.|$|R
50|$|Architectural {{glass is}} glass {{that is used}} as a {{building}} material. It is most typically used as transparent glazing material in the building envelope, including windows in the external walls. Glass is also used for internal partitions and as an architectural feature.

6000|$|I {{never saw}} such an awkward people, with machinery; you see, they were totally unused to it. The miller-gun {{was a little}} double-barreled tube of <b>toughened</b> <b>glass,</b> with a neat little trick of a spring to it, which upon {{pressure}} would let a shot escape. But the shot wouldn't hurt anybody, it would only drop into your hand. In the gun were two sizes--wee mustard-seed shot, and another sort that were several times larger. They were money. The mustard-seed shot represented milrays, the larger ones mills. So the gun was a purse; and very handy, too; you could pay out money in the dark with it, with accuracy; and you could carry it in your mouth; or in your vest pocket, if you had one. I made them of several sizes --one size so large that it would carry {{the equivalent of a}} dollar. Using shot for money was {{a good thing for the}} government; the metal cost nothing, and the money couldn't be counterfeited, for I was the only person in the kingdom who knew how to manage a shot tower. [...] "Paying the shot" [...] soon came to be a common phrase. Yes, and I knew it would still be passing men's lips, away down in the nineteenth century, yet none would suspect how and when it originated.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{strengthening}} {{results in}} a strengthening similar to <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b> However, the process does not use extreme variations of temperature and therefore chemically strengthened glass {{has little or no}} bow or warp, optical distortion or strain pattern. This differs from <b>toughened</b> <b>glass,</b> in which slender pieces can be significantly bowed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Toughened</b> <b>glass</b> is {{used when}} strength, thermal resistance, and safety are {{important}} considerations. Passenger vehicles, for example, have all three requirements. Since they are stored outdoors, they {{are subject to}} constant heating and cooling as well as dramatic temperature changes throughout the year. Moreover, they must withstand small impacts such as from road debris such as stones as well as automobile accidents. Because large, sharp glass shards would present additional and unacceptable danger to passengers, <b>toughened</b> <b>glass</b> is used so that if broken, the pieces are blunt and mostly harmless. The windscreen or windshield is instead made of laminated glass, which will not shatter into pieces when broken while side windows and the rear windshield is typically <b>toughened</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
50|$|Glazing can {{be mounted}} {{on the surface of}} a window sash or door stile, usually made of wood, {{aluminium}} or PVC.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to understand the room temperature and high temperature behavior of brittle materials such as in situ <b>toughened</b> ceramics, <b>glasses</b> and intermetallics as the basis for developing life prediction and test methodologies. A major objective was to understand the relationship between microstructure and mechanical behavior within the bounds of a limited number of materials. A second major objective was to determine the behavior as a function of time and temperature. Specifically, the room temperature and elevated strength and reliability, the fracture toughness, slow crack growth and the creep behavior. These results will provide input for parallel materials development and design methodology programs. Resultant design codes will be verified.

50|$|The H-class {{cars were}} {{progressively}} updated during the 1970s, {{again in the}} late 1980s and most recently (on five trams) in 2000. These included <b>toughened</b> safety <b>glass</b> in windows, replacing wooden panels with fibreglass, upgrading bogies, fluorescent lights inside the cars, and sealed-beam headlights and brake/hazard lamp clusters outside. In 1986 the trams were converted from trolley pole to pantograph operation. Despite the various refurbishments and upgrades, the overall character of the H-class trams has stayed very much as they were built. The interiors are still varnished wood and glass etched with MTT logos, and with no heating or air conditioning. Any remaining services are crew operated, with a driver and conductor on single cars, or a driver and two conductors on two-car sets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Toughened</b> or {{tempered}} <b>glass</b> {{is a type}} {{of safety}} glass processed by controlled thermal or chemical treatments to increase its strength compared with normal glass. Tempering puts the outer surfaces into compression and the interior into tension. Such stresses cause the glass, when broken, to crumble into small granular chunks instead of splintering into jagged shards as plate glass (a.k.a. annealed glass) does. The granular chunks are less likely to cause injury.|$|R

Energy demands for heating greenhouses are calculated considering climatic parameters of both locations. Furthermore, different constructions materials are taken into account, and energy demands are evaluated if the same greenhouse is made of 4 mm <b>toughened</b> single <b>glass,</b> double insulated glass or polycarbonate plates.

5000|$|Laminated {{glass is}} {{composed}} layers {{of glass and}} plastic held together by an interlayer.
