The sheep genotypes used were Poll Dorset growth × Border Leicester Merino (PDg × BLM), Poll Dorset growth × Merino (PDg × M), Poll Dorsetmuscling × Merino (PDm × M), Border Leicester × Merino (BL × M) and Merino × Merino (M × M). Loin muscles (Longissimus lumborum) collected from 40 ewe and wether sheep slaughtered at 14 months of age were processed for fatty acid determination. After frozen storage, 20 g samples were minced and a 7 g homogenate was processed for muscle lipid extraction using a chloroform:methanol (2 : 1) procedure.

30|$|The {{procedure}} of the short-circuit test {{is described as}} follows [8]. First, several sites are selected in the AT <b>feeding</b> <b>system.</b> At each site, the catenary is uncharged, and a vehicle-mounted circuit breaker is then connected between the catenary and the rails. Next, the circuit breaker is open-circuited, and the catenary is charged. The circuit breaker is then closed, and the catenary is short-circuited. A huge short-circuit current flows <b>through</b> the AT <b>feeding</b> <b>system,</b> and current transformers are used to obtain the current distribution. The measured currents are transformed into voltage signals, which are used to compare with a threshold {{to determine whether the}} catenary is short-circuited or not. If yes, the measured currents will be sent to the traction substation, and a fault locator will estimate the short-circuit site based on the current distribution. Since current transformers are installed at different sites and the measured currents vary greatly in magnitude, the times to reach the threshold may be different, and current measurements may be non-synchronous. The magnitude and direction of the currents can only be determined from the measurements.|$|R

40|$|In 2009, Mt. Etna (Italy) {{activity}} was characterised {{by the end}} of a long-lasting flank eruption started on 13 May 2008 and by the opening of a new summit degassing vent on the E flank of the South-East crater on 6 November. This was preceded by a sequence of significant anomalies in volcanic degassing, detected by periodic measurements of soil CO 2 efflux on the east flank of the volcano, continuous measurements of SO 2 flux from five fixed monitoring stations, and periodic FTIR measurements of the SO 2 /HCl and SO 2 /HF molar ratios in the volcanic plume. Since April 2009, soil and crater emissions showed a progressive increase marked at least by two major steps, in April-May and September-October. Increases were not observed simultaneously; in fact, they were detected first in soil CO 2 emissions and then, a few days/weeks later, in crater SO 2 flux. Only minor increases of HCl and HF crater fluxes were observed between November and December. The highest SO 2 and halogens fluxes were recorded in coincidence {{with the opening of the}} November 6 vent. The degassing behaviour of the volcano in 2009 is consistent with the differential release of magmatic gas species, according to their different solubilities, from a magma body rising from ~ 5 km depth to the surface.
