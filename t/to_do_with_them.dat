5|$|Great Aunt Joyce and Uncle Dick - Unseen characters, {{they are}} often {{mentioned}} by Victor and Margaret, as an aging and grim couple and Victor and Margaret dread having anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Great Aunt Joyce is mentioned as having a glass eye and has the habit of knitting bizarre items (such as six-fingered gloves) for Victor. Uncle Dick has a wooden arm; in the final Comic Relief (2001) episode, it transpires that a nurse had mistakenly placed a drip in the false arm for 18 hours after a trip to hospital after trying to remove a kidney stone with a wire coat hanger.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{they enter}} into a {{disagreement}} over his illegitimate son; Dain despises the eight-year-old boy's calculating mother and wants nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> while Jessica sympathetically wants to rescue the boy from his poor living conditions. The boy, Dominick, is becoming ill-behaved and reminds Dain self-loathingly of himself at his age. Eventually, with Jessica's prodding, Dain is persuaded to rescue the neglected boy from his mother's clutches. While doing so, the Marquess comes {{to terms with his}} mother's abandonment and realizes that Dominick is just as scared and lonely as he was as a boy. Dominick is invited to live at the Ballister estate, while the boy's mother, to her pleasure, is given a large stipend and told to find her fortune in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Ms. Hartman and Jackie {{are taken}} by the Cybermen for conversion, but the Cyber Leader orders the Doctor held aside because he has {{valuable}} information about the Daleks. The Cyber Leader is destroyed by a strike team led by Jake Simmonds, who have travelled from their universe {{in pursuit of the}} Cybermen. Ms. Hartman is converted, but Jackie escapes into a stairwell. Jake uses a device around his neck to take the Doctor to the parallel universe and their version of Torchwood. The Doctor meets with the alternate universe Pete Tyler, who tells him that after he left the Cybermen were sealed in their factories while humanity decided what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> In the meantime, the Cybermen vanished and the breach began causing unprecedented global warming on the parallel Earth, which the Doctor theorises is the start of the process that will lead to both planets falling into the Void.

25|$|According to reports, on 2 November from {{thirty to}} forty sampan-men {{entered the house}} of the {{contractor}} who supplies the Harbour Department with fuel for launches, and threatened to maim him if he refused to join their cause by stopping supplies. The contractor told them he would not have anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and, fearing an attack, collected in all of his coolies, although the sampan-men did not reappear. On 13 November Lim Eow Thong and Goh Taik Chee introduced a deputation of sampan-men to Assistant Protector of Chinese Beatty, whereupon the sampan-men related the hardship brought about by the prohibition on repairs along Weld Quay, and of the inadequacy of the present fare structure. Beaty said he would lay these complaints before Bland. Following that a meeting took place at Bland's office. In addition to the Chinese sampan-men who talked to Beatty, leaders of the Malay and Indian sampan-men approached Major H. Barry de Hamel, the Chief Police Officer, and L. H. Clayton, the Superintendent of Indian Immigration. The Government refused to do anything unless the sampan-men called off their strike.|$|E

25|$|Peter {{gathered}} his army at Cologne on 12 April 1096, planning to stop there and preach to the Germans and gather more crusaders. The French, however, were {{not willing to}} wait for Peter and the Germans and {{under the leadership of}} Walter Sans Avoir, a few thousand French crusaders left before Peter and reached Hungary on 8 May, passing through Hungary without incident and arriving at the river Sava at the border of Byzantine territory at Belgrade. The Belgrade commander was taken by surprise, having no orders on what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and refused entry, forcing the crusaders to pillage the countryside for food. This resulted in skirmishes with the Belgrade garrison and, to make matters worse, sixteen of Walter's men had tried to rob a market in Zemun across the river in Hungary and were stripped of their armor and clothing, which was hung from the castle walls. Eventually the crusaders were allowed to carry on to Niš, where they were provided with food and waited to hear from Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October 1931, Simon and a {{group of}} friends held a dinner in honour of Professor George Saintsbury, author of the classic Notes on a Cellar Book. Although the retired {{professor}} would have nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> this gathering turned into the Saintsbury Club, which continues to this day. One of those present was AJA Symons (no relation to Simon's wife), a dilettante in the publishing trade whom Simon had met some years earlier. On 20 October 1933, the two established the Wine & Food Society, with Simon as President (and Editor of the Society journal, Wine and Food), and Symons as Secretary handling the business side. The Society held its first banquet at the Savoy in January 1934. With the ending of Prohibition in the United States in 1933, Simon made his first trip to North America the following year. On 11 December 1934, he founded in New York City a branch of what would become the International Wine & Food Society, and branches across the US, Australia and South Africa soon followed. His great friend Symons died of a brain haemorrhage on 26 August 1941, and Simon took over control of the Society from that point. He finally ceded control of the journal to Condé Nast Publications in 1962. The Spring 1963 edition was the first under its new editor, a former copywriter on Vogue called Hugh Johnson.|$|E
500|$|Stanley Kubrick {{wanted to}} use the album's title track in A Clockwork Orange. The group refused permission, {{primarily}} because Kubrick was unsure of exactly which pieces of music he wanted and what he wished <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> In retrospect, Waters said [...] "maybe it's just as well it wasn't used after all".

Bringing back the monsters was Gatiss' idea, and he {{convinced}} executive producer Steven Moffat by coming up with new things <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> The Ice Warriors' costume was improved but not significantly redesigned, as the production team felt they were not well known enough.

He first {{recorded}} the song as a solo performance, on acoustic guitar, on 25 July– a version that remained unreleased until Anthology 3. He was unhappy with the group's first attempt to record the track, and so invited his friend Eric Clapton to come and play on it. Clapton was unsure about guesting on a Beatles record, but Harrison said the decision was [...] "nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> It's my song." [...] Clapton's solo was treated with automatic double tracking to attain the desired effect; he gave Harrison the guitar he used, which Harrison later named [...] "Lucy".|$|E

Forbes, meanwhile, received a report that most of Lobengula's force, commanded by inDuna Mjaan, had separated from the king and was moving to attack the laager the same night (this was actually an exaggeration; only about 300 riflemen had split from the main Matabele force, though they were indeed south of the river, undetected by Forbes). Visibility was poor by now, and rain periodically fell. The laager received no word from Wilson until about 21:00, when Sergeant-Major Judge and Corporal Ebbage arrived from across the river to tell Forbes that Wilson had found Lobengula's tracks, and followed him for [...] Wilson regarded the chances of taking the king alive as so good {{that he was going}} to remain {{north of the}} river overnight.

500|$|Memer in turn {{has a deep}} {{hatred of}} the Alds, vowing [...] "I will always hate the Alds, and I will drive them out of Ansul, and kill them all if I can". Her anger arises from the {{enslavement}} of her city and the hurt done to her loved ones, but also from her mixed heritage: in anger she often refers to herself in derogatory terms such as [...] "half-breed". Her hatred prevents her from engaging with the Alds in any way: she continually refers {{to them in a}} negative manner, and when it is suggested that she attend Orrec's performance for the Gand, is initially reluctant because she wants nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Thus she rejects the Alds in a manner ultimately similar to their rejection of the culture and belief of Ansul. Yet {{by the end of the}} story Memer grows into an acceptance of the Alds and the notion of coexistence with them, even as she grows into her own identity as the reader of the Oracle.|$|E
500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court!

500|$|... "Training Day" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. IGN writer Cindy White wrote that Deangelo {{was not given}} a proper introduction {{and that he was}} not distinguished from Michael's character. She also went on to criticize Jim, Pam and Dwight's reaction to Deangelo as the new manager, particular that of Jim and Pam, writing that [...] "it's becoming painfully obvious that the longtime writers don't know what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> anymore". However, she concluded that the episode continued the seventh season's improvement over the sixth, and that it showed potential for future episodes of the season. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt praised Michael's reactions to the office easily ignoring him for Deangelo, calling the final shot of him walking into his office alone [...] "quite effective", and that Dwight's reaction to not being suggested to be Michael's replacement made it more [...] "meaningful". Despite this, he continued by saying that the series was not [...] "sophisticated" [...] enough to use this plotline effectively and criticized the writing for the cast, which made them look [...] "stupid" [...] for [...] "cheap humor" [...] and a [...] "enormously shallow laughter". He ultimately gave the episode a [...] "C+". Alan Sepinwall, a columnist for HitFix, complimented the chemistry between Ferrell and Carell, but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael [...] "being petulant about not being the center of attention every minute of every day", negatively comparing it to [...] "Viewing Party". Despite this, he noted that Ferrell's presence did involve several funny moments.|$|E

[...] The A.V.

[...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Emily Exton gave the episode a positive review, writing that {{it was fun to}} see [...] "the resemblances between all the moms and their kids" [...] and enjoyed Will Ferrell's cameo here. At the beginning of his review, Adam Mersel of TV Guide said that this episode was not funny and was [...] "amused, a bit confused, and left wanting more." [...] After recapping the episode he said that he took his comments back, explaining that the episode [...] "did have laughs." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepiwall for HitFix wrote this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't a very funny episode of the show... yet it did some nice things in trying to pull Liz {{and some of the other}} characters back into reality." [...] Sepinwall commented that Tracy and Jenna's stories with their mothers were [...] "nice grounded moments for the show's two broadest main characters, and the sort of thing 30 Rock needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> a few times a season." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad liked this episode better than the previous episode [...] "Argus", enjoyed Elaine Stritch's return as Jack's mother, and that Tracy's story with Novella Nelson was [...] "actually well done", explaining that his situation makes sense in the TGS world. The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that [...] "The Moms" [...] was [...] "fun but lighter than air, content to string together a mild plot with a series of good jokes and callbacks."
