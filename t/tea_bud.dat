5000|$|Pre-Qingming Longjing: The premium {{early season}} first-picking known as Ming Qian or Pre-Qingming (or Before Ching Ming) Longjing tea {{requires}} {{it to be}} produced from the first spring shoots prior to the Qingming Festival on the 5th of April each year (approximately). In accordance with the Chinese farming calendar, which is a national holiday between April 1st - 4th, it rains. After the rain the tempeture heats up causing the tea plant to grow faster. When the <b>tea</b> <b>bud</b> becomes too big it begins to loose complexity in the brewed flavor, therefore the pre-qingming tea is considered better.|$|E
40|$|Galloylated catechins, as {{the main}} {{secondary}} metabolites in the tea plant, including (-) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate and (-) -epicatechin- 3 -gallate, comprise approximately three-quarters of all the tea plant catechins and have stronger effects than non-galloylated catechins, both on the product quality in tea processing and the pharmacological efficacy to human beings. The subcellular localization of galloylated catechins has been {{the primary focus of}} studies that assess biosynthesis and physiological functions. Classical histochemical localization staining reagents can not specifically detect galloylated catechins; thus, their subcellular localization remains controversial. In the present study, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against galloylated catechins, which can be used for the subcellular localization of galloylated catechins in the tea plant by immunohistochemistry. Direct ELISA and ForteBio Octet Red 96 System assay indicated the mAb could recognize the galloylated catechins with high specificities and affinities. In addition, <b>tea</b> <b>bud</b> was ascertained as the optimal tissue for freezing microtomic sections for immunohistochemistry. What’s more, the high quality mAbs which exhibited excellent binding capability to galloylated catechins were utilised for the visualization of them via immunohistochemistry. Our findings demonstrated that vacuoles were the primary sites of localization of galloylated catechins at the subcellular level...|$|E

5000|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{generally}} accepted definition of white tea and very little international agreement; some sources use the term to refer to tea that is merely dried with no additional processing, some to tea made from the <b>buds</b> and immature <b>tea</b> leaves picked shortly before the buds have fully opened and allowed to wither and dry in natural sun, while others include <b>tea</b> <b>buds</b> and very young leaves which have been steamed or fired before drying, [...] Most definitions agree, however, that white tea is not rolled or oxidized, resulting in a flavour characterized as [...] "lighter" [...] than green or traditional black teas.|$|R
500|$|White tea (白茶) {{was also}} {{developed}} in the Fujian province with its first mentions in the Song Dynasty document Treatise on Tea, where the delicate buds used for producing white tea, the difficulty in producing it, its taste, and its rarity were lauded. The production method of white tea was described by Ming Dynasty author Tian Yiheng (田艺蘅) in [...] "Zhuquan Xiaopin" [...] (煮泉小品) (produced in the 33rd year of the Jiajing Emperor) regarding Fuding white tea (福鼎白茶). In this work, he stated that <b>tea</b> <b>buds</b> that have undergone fixation by panning over flames (as with green tea) is second to a white tea that was simply allowed to dry under the sun, since it is more natural in taste and lacks flavours imparted by the smoke and flames ("芽茶以火作者为次，生晒者为上, 亦更近自然，且断烟火气耳") ...|$|R
5000|$|Huangshan Maofeng tea ( [...] ; {{pronounced}} [...] ) is a {{green tea}} produced in south eastern interior Anhui province of China. The tea {{is one of}} the most famous teas in China and can almost always be found on the China Famous Tea list. The tea is grown near huangshan (Yellow Mountain), which is home to many famous varieties of Green Tea. Huangshan Mao Feng Tea's English translation is [...] "Yellow Mountain Fur Peak" [...] due to the small white hairs which cover the leaves and the shape of the processed leaves which resemble the peak of a mountain. The best teas are picked in the early Spring before China's Qingming Festival. When picking the tea, only the new <b>tea</b> <b>buds</b> and the leaf next to the bud are picked. It is said by local tea farmers that the leaves resemble orchid buds.|$|R
5000|$|Matcha is {{made from}} shade-grown tea leaves that also are used to make gyokuro. The {{preparation}} of matcha starts several weeks before harvest and may last up to 20 days, when the tea bushes are covered to prevent direct sunlight. This slows down growth, stimulates an increase in chlorophyll levels, turns the leaves a darker shade of green, and causes the production of amino acids, in particular theanine. Only the finest <b>tea</b> <b>buds</b> are hand-picked. After harvesting, if the leaves are rolled up before drying as {{in the production of}} sencha, the result will be gyokuro (jade dew) tea. If the leaves are laid out flat to dry, however, they will crumble somewhat and become known as tencha (...) [...] Then, tencha may be de-veined, de-stemmed, and stone-ground to the fine, bright green, talc-like powder known as matcha.|$|R
3000|$|... sinensis var. sinensis (China type) from Fujian Province in {{southeast}} China. However, {{because of the}} limited raw tea produced in Fujian Province, <b>tea</b> <b>buds</b> grown in other locations and from different tea tree subspecies have also been used for oolong tea in recent years; an example is Camellia sinensis var. assamica (Assam type), which is mainly distributed in Yunnan Province in southwest China, especially the districts around Pu-erh (Lv et al. 2014 a). These two tea subspecies grown in different locations show obvious differences, such as the sizes of their leaves and their water-soluble components (Liang et al. 2005). Until now, however, little known about the similarities and dissimilarities of these two oolong teas. To determine their consistency in taste, we analyzed the caffeine, catechin, total polysaccharide, and volatile components of Yunnan and Fujian oolong teas and compared them {{with those of other}} common types of teas.|$|R
50|$|Kabusecha (冠茶) is sencha {{grown in}} the shade to {{increase}} sweetness and relaxing amino acids. About {{a week before the}} <b>tea</b> leaf <b>buds</b> are picked in the spring, the plantation is covered with a screen to cut out the direct sunlight. This shading produces a milder tea than standard sencha. The shaded tea known as gyokuro differs from kabusecha in that it is shaded for a longer period: about 20 days.|$|R
40|$|Tea is {{a widely}} {{consumed}} beverage {{in the world and}} its consumption is highly recommended due to the great number of healthy properties. Tea can be classified in white, green, oolong, and black according to the different processing method. White tea, a rare variety, is little fermented, only made by new growth buds and young leaves, and after picking is immediately dried to maintain its delicate and sweet taste. Recently, many health benefits including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-melanogenic properties, an effect on prediabetesinduced reproductive dysfunction and on the stabilization of collagen in dentine resulting in functional remineralization have been attributed to white tea. Due to these functional properties, it could be interesting define the nutraceutical properties of white tea consisting of only sprouting buds or sprouting buds with the first three leaves grown according to minimum processing system. The aim of the present research is to investigate samples, commercially available in Europe, coming from four countries: China (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis), India, Sri Lanka, and Malawi (Camellia sinensis var. assamica), for the chemical composition and minerals profile of the different white tea infusions (consisted both of only buds or of buds plus young leaves). The chemical composition has been defined by LC-ESI-MSn and mono and two dimentional High Resolution NMR spectroscopy; furthermore, a quantitative profile of the main components has been investigated by a RP-HPLC-DAD method and tentatively by quantitative NMR using ERETIC 2 method. For each sample, macro and trace elements were determined using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and ICP-mass spectrometry (MS). For the first time, a differentiation of nutraceutical properties between white <b>tea</b> <b>buds</b> and buds plus young leaves from different countries will be defined...|$|R

40|$|Hawk tea (Litsea coreana var. lanuginose) is a {{very popular}} herbal tea in the {{southwest}} of China. According to the maturity degree of raw materials, Hawk tea can usually be divided into three types: Hawk <b>bud</b> <b>tea</b> (HB), Hawk primary leaf tea (HP), and Hawk mature leaf tea (HM). In this study, some of the bioactive constituents and antioxidant properties of the three kinds of Hawk tea infusions were comparatively investigated. The {{results showed that the}} contents of total flavonoids, vitamin C, and carbohydrates in Hawk <b>bud</b> <b>tea</b> infusion (HBI) were higher than those in Hawk primary leaf tea infusion (HPI) and Hawk mature leaf tea infusion (HMI). HPI had higher contents of total polyphenols and exhibited better DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing activity power. HBI could provide more effective protection against erythrocyte hemolysis. As age is going from bud to mature leaf, the ability to inhibit the formation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) conjugated diene and the loss of tryptophan fluorescence decreased.

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the concentrations of fluoride in UK tea products and their infusions. This {{is related to the}} uptake and distribution of fluoride within tea plants Camellia sinensis (L.). Human oral bioaccessibility of fluoride from the consumption of tea infusions was estimated, using an in vitro approach. The possible health significance from fluoride exposure is discussed. Fluoride in tea products and the distribution within the tea plant was determined using a method, involving alkali fused digestion with ion chromatography and a conductivity detector for the instrumentation. For the aqueous infusions and the supernatants in the bioaccessibility experiments, ion selective electrode with a voltmeter was adopted. Mean fluoride concentrations in tea products and their infusions varied significantly (p< 0. 001; n= 3) and were related to the type of tea product and the retail cost. The higher priced teas, such as Darjeeling, Assam and Oolong, had lower fluoride concentrations. The lower priced supermarket Economy ranged teas were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in fluoride and exhibited concentrations similar to Chinese Brick tea, which is prepared using mature tea leaves. The higher quality products are prepared by selecting the finest tips of <b>tea</b> (<b>buds),</b> whereas an Economy products use coarser harvesting techniques to include mature leaves in the product. Fluoride affinity and tolerance of C. sinensis was assessed by a series of fluoride dosing experiments, ranging from 0 to 200 mg. Following fluoride dosing, a rapid uptake and accumulation occurred throughout the tea plants, resulting in partial necrosis of random leaves. Despite the necrosis, the plants tolerated the fluoride and continued to increase in height, although at a significantly slower rate (p< 0. 05) compared to the control plants. Accumulation of fluoride was observed to be mostly in the mature leaves followed by younger buds, then the roots. This relates to the part of the plant used to produce the tea types, with mature leaves for Economy products and the buds for the finer teas. The in vitro bioaccessibility assessment of fluoride estimated that over 91. 4...|$|R

40|$|Tea flush shoots {{comprising}} three {{leaves and}} a bud were harvested from 20 different cultivars planted {{in a single}} area of UPASI Tea Research Farm and analyzed for β-D-glucosidase and β-galactosidase activities. Among the cultivars studied a range of variability of 0. 63 to 5. 45 units of β-galactosidase activity and 0. 06 to 1. 91 units of β-D-glucosidase activity was observed. This result suggested the influence of genotype on these enzymes. The activity was higher in actively growing <b>tea</b> tissues (<b>bud)</b> and lowest in bark of the tea plant. At any given stage of black tea manufacture β-galactosidase activity was {{higher than that of}} β-D-glucosidase. During manufacturing process the activity of both enzymes varied widely and remained maximum in withered leaves. The insignificant correlation coefficient obtained for these two enzymes with productivity suggest that they cannot be used as one of the biochemical tools to predict the yield potential of tea cultivar. The flavour analysis carried out in green leaf, withered leaf, cut dhool, fermented dhool, made tea and tea brew indicated that not even a single flavour compound was found maximum in green leaf. This provides important information that most of the flavour compounds are produced after harvest...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Tea-scented Chinas (Rosa × odorata) were Oriental cultivars {{thought to}} represent hybrids of R. chinensis with R. gigantea, a large Asian climbing rose with pale-yellow blossoms. Immediately upon their introduction {{in the early}} 19th-century breeders went to work with them, especially in France, crossing them first with China roses and then with Bourbons and Noisettes. The Tea roses are repeat-flowering roses, named for their fragrance being reminiscent of Chinese black tea (although {{this is not always}} the case). The colour range includes pastel shades of white, pink and (a novelty at the time) yellow to apricot. The individual flowers of many cultivars are semi-pendent and nodding, due to weak flower stalks. In a [...] "typical" [...] <b>Tea,</b> pointed <b>buds</b> produce high-centred blooms which unfurl in a spiral fashion, and the petals tend to roll back at the edges, producing a petal with a pointed tip; the Teas are thus the originators of today's [...] "classic" [...] florists' rose form. According to rose historian Brent Dickerson, the Tea classification owes as much to marketing as to botany; 19th-century nurserymen would label their Asian-based cultivars as [...] "Teas" [...] if they possessed the desirable Tea flower form, and [...] "Chinas" [...] if they did not. Like the Chinas, the Teas are not hardy in colder climates. Examples: 'Lady Hillingdon', 'Maman Cochet', 'Duchesse de Brabant', 'Mrs. Foley Hobbs'.|$|R
30|$|The {{production}} of secondary metabolites in higher plants is often affected by hormone regulation. Ethylene is a plant hormone {{that affects the}} plants growth and development and is sometimes required for processes including ripening, senescence, and abscission (Schaller 2012). In <b>tea</b> plants, floral <b>buds</b> are more sensitive to ethylene than are leaves (Woolf et al. 1999). Ethylene is critical for signal transduction {{and its effect on}} the accumulation of secondary metabolites. Ethylene regulates flavonol biosynthesis through the MYB 12 transcription factor, which affects the expression of chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and flavonol synthase (Lewis et al. 2011). Ethylene signaling is involved in the defense resistance of plants by enhancing polyphenol oxidase activity during stress (Bosch et al. 2014; Thipyapong and Steffens 1997). Studies on rice coleoptiles have shown that ethylene induces the accumulation of polyamine (Lee and Chu 1992).|$|R

40|$|Hawk tea (Litsea coreana Lévl. var. Lanuginosa (Migo) Yen C. Yang & P. H. Huang), a {{very popular}} herbal tea material, has {{attracted}} more and more attention due to its high antioxidant properties and possible therapeutic effect on type II diabetes mellitus. The raw materials of Hawk tea are usually divided into three kinds: <b>bud</b> <b>tea</b> (BT), primary leaf tea (PLT) and mature leaf tea (MLT). In this study, the DPPH radical scavenging activity and the antimicrobial properties of these three kinds of Hawk tea from different regions were comparatively investigated, and a ultra-high performance liquid chromatographic coupled with a photodiode array detector (UPLC-DAD) method was employed for comparison {{of the three major}} flavonoid constituents, including hyperoside, isoquercitrin and astragalin, in different samples of Hawk tea. At the same time, the effect of methanol extract (ME) of PLT on the mouse postprandial blood glucose and the effect of ME and its different fractions (petroleum ether fraction (PE), ethyl acetate fraction (EA), n-butanol fraction (n-BuOH), and water fraction (WF)) on the activity of α-glucosidase were studied. The results showed that Hawk BT and Hawk PLT possessed the higher radicals scavenging activity than Hawk MLT, while the antibacterial activity against P. vulgaris of PLT and MLT was higher than Hawk BT. The contents of the three major flavonoid constituents in samples of Hawk PLT are higher than Hawk BT and Hawk MLT. The mouse postprandial blood glucose levels of the middle dose (0. 5 g/kg) group and the high dose (1 g/kg) group with oral administration of the ME of PLT were significantly lower than the control group. What’s more, the inhibitory effect of ME of PLT and its EA and n-BuOH fractions on α-glucosidase was significantly higher than that of acarbose. Rapid ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) was used to identify the flavonoids in Hawk PLT, and a total of 20 flavonoids were identified or tentatively identified by comparing their retention times and accurate mass measurements with reference compounds or literature data. The bioactive flavonoid composition and DPPH radical scavenging activities present in different Hawk tea raw materials are quite different due to the different ontogenesis of these raw materials. Further studies on PLT showed that the substances in PLT ME could reduce the level of mouse postprandial blood glucose through inhibiting the activity of α-glucosidase...|$|R
