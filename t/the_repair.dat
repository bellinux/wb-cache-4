5|$|In 2006 {{the pier}} {{was sold to}} Manchester company Urban Splash. The new owners {{launched}} a competition in August 2007, inviting people to submit ideas for the regeneration of the pier and island. At the time, <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> work required was estimated at £4 million.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, workers whose {{tasks were}} {{considered}} {{too important to}} be paid on a piece-rate basis were moved to a time-rate method. This was largely done in consideration of safety grounds and usually applied to those conducting maintenance or <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> of equipment.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 plaster ceiling supports and <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster pieces in the ceiling. Contractors had to install scaffolding tall enough to reach the highest interior crevice in the ceiling eight stories up—the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E
30|$|Comparison of <b>the</b> <b>repaired</b> column {{performances}} {{in this study}} is complicated by the different damage conditions of the corresponding original columns and <b>the</b> different <b>repair</b> profiles. Thus non-dimensional response indices were developed to compare <b>the</b> <b>repaired</b> column to <b>the</b> corresponding original column in terms of strength, stiffness, and ductility, which were the extension of previous work by Vosooghi and Saiidi (2013). The indices were then used to compare the performance of <b>the</b> <b>repaired</b> columns.|$|R

5|$|A {{clock is}} {{documented}} in this tower since 1405, {{when a new}} bell was installed. The city accounts of 1438 mention <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> of the clockworks. The first mention of a dial is in 1443, and the first known image of the, much smaller first astrolabium dial (in the diary a cobbler journeyman from Ulm) is dated 1534. The jacquemart (bellstriker) is also documented in the same 1534 source.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one hour}} later, Hiryū's second attack wave, {{consisting}} of ten B5Ns and six escorting A6Ms, arrived over Yorktown; <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> efforts {{had been so}} effective that the Japanese pilots assumed that Yorktown must be a different, undamaged carrier. They attacked, crippling Yorktown with two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a 23-degree list to port. Five torpedo bombers and two fighters were shot down in this attack.|$|E
5|$|Development of the {{military}} settlement at Tvrđa started in 1687 when the Habsburg armies drove the Ottomans {{out of the city}} during the Great Turkish War. The chief commander of the Imperial army, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, saw Osijek as a location of exceptional strategic importance in the war against the Ottomans. He urged <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> of the city walls, and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban's principles of military engineering.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Anlaby Road {{was damaged}} by enemy bombing, <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> cost {{of which was}} in the region of £1,000. The Cricket Club served notice to quit at the same time, and so in 1943 the tenancy was officially ended. Hull were forced to return to the Boulevard Ground from 1944 until 1945 because of the poor {{condition}} of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road. The new stadium was finally opened under the revised name of Boothferry Park on 31 August 1946.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, noted that <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> of STIS {{was a major}} victory for both the mission and the science community, as {{that part of the}} {{telescope}} performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed of, and looking at things like the motion of stars around black holes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, {{the depot}} was {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> of vehicles and the conversion of aircrew coaches. Aircraft engines, propellers and radar equipment also continued to be repaired on the site, as were vehicles from the US Air Force's Third Air Force base at nearby RAF South Ruislip which began to be serviced from April 1949. The American vehicles were maintained in a dedicated shed, No. 5.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> work, Westfalen briefly {{went into}} the Baltic Sea for training, before {{returning}} to the North Sea on 4 October. The fleet then advanced as far as the Dogger Bank on 19–20 October. The ship remained in port for the majority of 1917. The ship did not actively take part in Operation Albion in the Baltic, though she was stationed off Apenrade to prevent a possible British incursion into the area.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, {{following}} the serious attack on Pi Vell ten months before, the government {{set up a}} working group consisting of representatives of the Barcelona provincial administration, the local municipality, and the Institute of Catalan Studies, to manage the maintenance and protection of the two trees. The first result was <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> of the damaged tree in July, and in February 2016 they decided to place video security cameras at the site, watching both trees.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Keyser Creek {{was a clear}} stream until it reached <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> shops of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. At this point, it {{received}} some oil and refuse. At the Capouse Shaft, the creek washed an ash bank and a culm bank and was contaminated with some sulfur. More dirty waste materials drained into the creek at the Archbald Colliery and a fertilizer plant also discharged waste into it.|$|E
40|$|Twelve cadaveric {{shoulders}} {{were used to}} determine the effects of release of the superior capsule and the cora-cohumeral ligament on the strain in <b>the</b> <b>repaired</b> rotator cuff tendon. A rotator cuff tear (2 cm wide and 1. 5 cm long) was created and repaired under a 3 -kg tensile force. The strain in <b>the</b> <b>repaired</b> tendon was measured with use of linear transducers with the arm in 50 different positions. Release of either the superior capsule or the coracohumeral ligament diminished the tension of <b>the</b> <b>repaired</b> rotator cuff by an average of 25 % with the arm in adduction. Release of both of these structures further reduced the tension by an average of 44 % in adduction and 43 % to 60 % with the arm in 15 ° of elevation.

5|$|Repair work {{commenced}} on {{the garden}} and undercroft in early 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and was scheduled to take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration {{and work on the}} memorial itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project would be complete by Armistice Day 2010. During <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> work the memorial itself was rotated to face the city hall, in accordance with the wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration work. Its place in the memorial garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: Breath by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. The memorial and garden was re-dedicated after three years on Armistice Day, 11 November 2011; <b>the</b> <b>repair</b> work had cost £2.6million.|$|E
