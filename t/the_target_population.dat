Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to Amnesty International, {{the use of}} rape {{during times}} of war is not a {{by-product}} of conflicts, but a pre-planned and deliberate military strategy. In {{the last quarter of}} a century, the majority of conflicts have shifted from wars between nation states to communal and intrastate civil wars. During these conflicts the use of rape as a weapon against the civilian population by state and non-state actors has become more frequent. Journalists and human rights organizations have documented campaigns of genocidal rape during the conflicts in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Liberia, Sudan, Uganda, and the DRC. The strategic aim of these mass rapes are twofold. The first is to instill terror in the civilian population, with the intent to forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second is to degrade the chance of possible return and reconstitution by inflicting humiliation and shame on the targeted population. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land.

Personas also help prevent [...] "self-referential design" [...] when the designer or developer may unconsciously project their own mental models on the product design which may be very {{different from that of the}} target user population. Personas also provide a reality check by helping designers keep the focus of the design on cases that are most likely to be encountered for the target users and not on edge cases which usually won't happen for <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>population.</b> According to Cooper, edge cases which should naturally be handled properly should not become the design focus.|$|E

2500|$|Creation and {{manipulation}} of front groups or infiltration of existing organizations. While the Communist {{presence in the}} [...] "united Front" [...] against the US/GVN was no secret, VC operatives took pains to screen {{the full extent of}} their influence, and stressed patriotism, anti-foreign sentiment, local grievances and other issues that could mobilize support. Integral to this process was the creation of [...] "front" [...] groups to mask the true VC agenda. Such groups lent an aura of populist spontaneity and voluntarism while the VC worked them behind the scenes. Such entities could be seemingly innocuous farming cooperatives, or cultural groups, or anything in between. Party members either manipulated these new groups behind the scenes or infiltrated existing ones and gradually took over or influenced them towards the VC line. The goal was to enmesh {{as many people as possible}} in some group which could then be manipulated. Thus for example a traditional, apolitical rice harvest festival would be eventually twisted into mobilizing demonstrations against a government official or policy. Members of a farming cooperative might be persuaded into signing a petition against construction of an airfield.

Peer support outreach for those exposed to traumatic events refers to programs that seek to identify and reach out to those suffering from or at risk for mental health problems following a traumatic event {{as a means of}} connecting those people to mental health services. Paraprofessional peers are defined as having a shared background as <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>population</b> and work closely with and supplement the services of the mental healthcare team. These peers are trained in certain interventions (such as Psychological First Aid) and are closely supervised by professional mental healthcare personnel. [...] Peer support for recovery from PTSD refers to programs in which someone with lived experience of PTSD, who experienced a significant reduction in symptoms, provides formal services to those who have not yet made significant steps in recovery from his or her condition. The peer support for recovery model focuses on improvement in overall health and wellness, and has long been successful in the treatment of SMI (serious mental illness) but is relatively new for PTSD.|$|E

While it is uncertain how successful such attempts were against <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>population,</b> historians have noted that, [...] "history records numerous instances of the French, the Spanish, the English, and later on the American, using smallpox as an ignoble means to an end.

[...] The British High Commander Jeffery Amherst authorized the intentional use of disease as a biological weapon against indigenous populations during the Pontiac's Rebellion, saying, [...] "You will Do well to try to Innoculate the Indians by means of Blanketts, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execreble Race", and instructing his subordinates, [...] "I need only Add, I Wish to Hear of no prisoners should any of the villains be met with arms."

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the sample design developed and implemented for TIMSS Advanced 2008 and the derivation of sampling weights for the study. It explains how <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> were {{defined in the}} participating countries and how the national sample designs were developed and implemented.

To complement the general information in this chapter, Appendix B provides specific details about the national sample designs and their implementation, including details of population coverage and exclusions, stratification variables, and sample size allocation. TIMSS Advanced 2008 proposed a uniform sample design to all participants to ensure that differences in survey results were not attributable {{to the use of}} different sampling methodologies. This uniform sample design was f lexible enough to accommodate the distinctiveness of national school systems at the upper secondary 52 chapter 4 : timss advanced 2008 sampling level and how <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> were defined across participating countries. The TIMSS Advanced 2008 National Research Coordinators (NRCs) were responsible for developing their national sample designs and implementing them in their own countries, {{with the support of the}} sampling consultants. 1 4. 2 The	TIMSS	Advanced	 2008 	<b>Target</b>	<b>Populations</b> TIMSS Advanced 2008 measured student achievement in two student populations at the end of secondary schooling: advanced mathematics students and physics students.
