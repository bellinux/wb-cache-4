Setting – Academic libraries in the United States. Subjects – 3925 academic library respondents. Methods – The author chose to use survey data collected from the 2006 ALS conducted bythe NCES. The survey included data on various topics related to academic libraries, {{but in the case of}} this study, the author chose to analyze three of the 193 variables included. The three variables: electronic books expenditure, computer hardware and software, and expenditures on bibliographic utilities, were combined into one variable called electronic resource expenditure. Gate counts were also considered as a variable. Electronic resource expenditure was also split as a variable into three groups: low, medium, and high. Multiple regression analysis and general linear modeling, along with tests of reliability, were employed. Main Results – The author determined that low, medium, and high spenders with regard to electronic resources exhibited differences in gate counts, and gate counts have an effect on <b>reference</b> <b>transactions</b> in any given week. Gate counts tend to not have much of an effect on <b>reference</b> <b>transactions</b> for the higher spenders, and higher spenders tend to have a higher number of <b>reference</b> <b>transactions</b> overall. Low spenders have lower gate counts and also a lower amount of <b>reference</b> <b>transactions.</b> Conclusion – The findings from this study show that academic libraries spending more on electronic resources also tend to have an increase with regard to <b>reference</b> <b>transactions.</b> The author also concludes that library spaces are no longer the determining factor with regard to number of <b>reference</b> <b>transactions.</b> Spending more on electronic resources is also important to increase both in-person and electronic <b>reference</b> <b>transactions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The University of Northern British Columbia’s Geoffrey R. Weller Library can {{boast of}} a healthy and stable {{reference}} service. While statistical analysis reveals that patron use of this service is on the decline, this is not unlike current trends experienced by many libraries today.

40|$|Objective – To examine {{provider}} pessimism {{by comparing}} user and provider {{perception of the}} same instant messaging <b>reference</b> <b>transaction.</b> Design – Instant messaging users and providers completed post-reference transaction surveys which were analyzed using the pair perception comparison method. Setting – A large research university in the United States. Subjects – Two hundred undergraduate journalism students (users of the instant messaging service) and 51 Master of Library Science (MLS) students enrolled in a reference services class (providers of the instant messaging service). Methods – The authors created a research help webpage from which users could access the instant messaging service. Prior to service availability, providers received reference instruction and demonstrated reference aptitude through in-class activities. The authors briefed providers on the project and provided a wiki containing resources they might need during <b>reference</b> <b>transactions.</b> Providers worked in two-hour shifts, and two providers were available during each shift. The service was available for one week while potential users completed a journalism assignment. The authors asked both users and providers of the service to complete an online survey {{at the conclusion of}} the <b>reference</b> <b>transaction.</b> Users and providers completed different surveys, but both types included the following four elements: questions to aid in matching a user to a provider; questions about satisfaction with the service based on guidelines put forth by the Reference and User Services Association (RUSA); open-ended questions about the reference transaction; and questions regarding demographics, prior reference service usage, and knowledge of instant messaging. There were 55 valid <b>reference</b> <b>transactions,</b> and from those, the authors matched 26 pairs of user and provider surveys. The authors analyzed paired surveys to (a) compare the user’s perception of the <b>reference</b> <b>transaction</b> with the provider’s guess about the user’s perception and (b) compare the provider’s self-perception of the <b>reference</b> <b>transaction</b> with the provider’s guess about the user’s perception. The authors introduced the pair perception comparison method for the analysis using two-tailed paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Main Results – Analysis of background information showed that users were younger on average than providers and used instant messaging more frequently. Even so, most users and providers felt comfortable with instant messaging. When providers were asked to guess how satisfied overall they thought the user was with the <b>reference</b> <b>transaction,</b> they reported on average that the user was less satisfied than the user actually was. These results were statistically significant. The authors found no significant difference between the providers’ overall satisfaction with the service they provided and their guesses about the users’ overall satisfaction. The authors also analyzed the matched pairs on 14 specific aspects of satisfaction gathered from surveys. When comparing the users’ satisfaction with the service they received and the providers’ guesses about the users’ satisfaction, the providers underestimated the users’ satisfaction on average for all 14 dimensions. The authors found statistically significant differences with regard to 7 of the 14 dimensions: tempo, ease of use, friendliness, understanding, accuracy, follow up, and spelling. When comparing the providers’ satisfaction with a given <b>reference</b> <b>transaction</b> and their guesses about the users’ satisfaction with the same <b>reference</b> <b>transaction,</b> the authors found significant differences for 3 of the 14 dimensions: interest, resource type, and accuracy. Conclusion – This study has shown for instant messaging reference what other studies have shown for face-to-face reference—that provider pessimism exists. Whatever the environment, providers of reference tend to judge themselves more harshly than the people they are helping judge them. Based on a review of the literature, the authors further note that both expert and novice reference providers experience such pessimism. The authors are hopeful that providers will view these results as evidence of their own competence during instant messaging <b>reference</b> <b>transactions.</b> The results of this study provide valuable information for training instant messaging providers. For example, the fact that providers thought users were less satisfied with the tempo of the <b>reference</b> <b>transaction</b> than they really were suggested to the authors that instant messaging providers need not be so concerned about giving a quick answer. An accurate answer is more desirable. In the same vein, providers thought that users were more concerned with spelling than they really were. Both of these cases, and others gleaned from the results, provide insight into what aspects of the <b>reference</b> <b>transaction</b> providers should spend their time and effort on. Finally, the authors introduced the pair perception comparison method to compare feedback from matched pairs on individual <b>reference</b> <b>transactions,</b> a methodology not used in any earlier studies. They deemed this method to be an effective way to uncover biases and false assumptions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} librarians' attitudes towards instruction in virtual <b>reference</b> <b>transactions</b> and to review relevant literature. Design/methodology/approach – Librarians who provide virtual reference services are surveyed about attitudes towards providing instruction via virtual reference software. In addition to gathering demographic information respondents are asked to rate agreement or disagreement with statements about virtual references using a six-point Likert scale. Findings – The librarians surveyed see value in providing instruction during the virtual reference encounter, but also identify concerns and barriers. Discussion of Marchionini's concept of exploratory search and Madell and Muncer's study on control in computer mediated communication is used to highlight some characteristics of the virtual reference environment that might require unique pedagogy and reference practices. Research limitations/implications – Most respondents are from academic libraries, potentially limiting its applicability to public or special library settings and the survey does not explore the attitudes of librarians who do not currently provide virtual reference. Practical implications – Findings will be useful for institutional or consortial virtual reference training as well as improving individual practice. Findings may also have policy and/or staffing implications for virtual reference programs.
