50|$|In the USA, a {{protective}} trust is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> trust that was devised {{for use in}} estate planning. (In another jurisdiction this might be thought <b>of</b> as one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> protection <b>trust.)</b> Often a person, A, wishes to leave property to another person B. A, however, fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before A dies, and that therefore B would receive none of it. A could establish a trust with B as the beneficiary, but then A would not be entitled to use of the property before they died. Protective trusts were developed {{as a solution to}} this situation. A would establish a trust with both A and B as beneficiaries, with the trustee instructed to allow A use of the property until they died, and thereafter to allow its use to B. The property is then safe from being claimed by A creditors, at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trusts establishment. This use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders, and is frequently used as an alternative to them.|$|R

That discus-sion is reinforced by identification of a series of widespread analytical errors — errors that appear inWorld Bank work, but by no means only inWorld Bank work: tunnel vision, improper use of first-best analysis, improper use of steady-state analysis, incomplete analysis of implicit pension debt, incomplete analy-sis of the impact of funding (including excessive focus on financial flows, failure to consider how funding is generated, and improper focus on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> in <b>trust</b> funds), and ignoring distributional effects. The second part of the article considers implications for policy: there is no single best pension design, earlier retirement does little or nothing to reduce unemployment, unsustainable pension promises need to be addressed directly, a move from pay-as-you-go towards funding in a mandatory system {{may or may not be}} welfare improving, and implementation matters — policy design that exceeds a country’s capacity to implement it is bad policy design.

50|$|The asset-protection {{trust is}} a trust that splits the {{beneficial}} enjoyment <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>assets</b> from their legal ownership.

Thus this kind of trust fulfills the goal <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> protection planning, i.e. to insulate <b>assets</b> from claims <b>of</b> creditors without concealment or tax evasion. A creditor’s ability to satisfy a judgment against a beneficiary’s interest in a trust is limited to the beneficiary’s interest in such trust. Consequently, the common goal <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> protection <b>trusts</b> is to limit the interests of beneficiaries in such a way so as to preclude creditors from collecting against <b>trust</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|R
