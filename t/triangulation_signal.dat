40|$|Using an 802. 11 {{wireless}} client as {{a location}} sensor is an increasingly popular way of enabling location-based services. <b>Triangulation</b> on <b>signal</b> strengths from multiple access points {{can be used}} to pinpoint location down to a few meters. However, this level of accuracy comes at the price of a manual, tedious, spatially highdensity calibration of signal strength as a function of location. This paper presents a new 802. 11 location algorithm based on a relatively coarse calibration. This helps answer the question of how accurate location can be computed based on a realistic level of calibration effort. The algorithm uses an interpolation function that gives location as a function of signal strength. As such, it is suited to maintaining some degree of performance in spite of reduced calibration data. We use this feature to test the effect of reducing the number of calibration readings per location and the number of locations visited during calibration. Our experiments show that calibration effort can be significantly reduced with only a minor reduction in spatial accuracy. This effectively diminishes one of the most daunting practical barriers to wider adoption of this type of location measurement technique. ...|$|R

Previous research has addressed {{the quantity and quality}} of children 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity while in early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings, yet little research has investigated the social and physical environmental influences on physical activity in these settings. The outcomes of this study will be to measure these social and physical environmental influences on children 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity using a combination of a real-time location system (RTLS) (a closed system that tracks the location of movement of participants via readers and tags), accelerometry and direct observation. Methods and analysis: This study is the first of its kind to combine RTLSs and accelerometer data in ECEC settings. It is a cross-sectional study involving ∼ 100 educators and 500 children from 11 ECEC settings in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. A RTLS and Actigraph GT 3 X+ accelerometers will be concurrently used to measure the level and location of the children 2 ̆ 7 s and educators 2 ̆ 7 physical activity while in outside environments. Children and educators will wear accelerometers on their hip that record triaxial acceleration data at 100 Hz.

One of the measurement systems was a set-up of 7 laser triangulation sensors for measuring relative displacement of the piston rod mechanical lead-through transmission in the direct drive. Two measurement periods, separated by 2. 5 month, are presented in this paper. One measurement is made two weeks after launch and another 3 months after launch. Comparisons and correlations are made between different sensors measuring simultaneously. Noise levels are investigated. Filtering is discussed for further refinement of the laser <b>triangulation</b> sensor <b>signals</b> in order to separate noise from actual physical displacement and vibration. Measurements are presented from {{the relative displacement of}} the piston rod mechanical lead-through, from magnetic flux in the air gap, mechanical strain in the WEC structure, translator position and piston rod axial displacement and active AC power. Investigation into the measurements in the time domain with close-ups, in the frequency domain with Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and with time-frequency analysis with short time Fourier transform (STFT) is carried out to map the spectral content in the measurements. End stop impact is clearly visible in the time-frequency analysis. The FFT magnitude spectra are investigated for identifying the cogging bandwidth among other vibrations. Generator cogging, fluctuations in the damping force and in the Lorenz forces in the stator are distinguished and varies depending on translator speed. Vibrations from cogging seem to be present in the early measurement period while not so prominent in the late measurement period. Vibration frequencies due to wear are recognized by comparing with the noise at generator standstill and the vibration sources in the generator.

This study explores six different methods of three-dimensional shape and surface area measurements using the range of morphology associated with the Scleractinian corals: Goniopora tenuidens, Acropora intermedia, and Porites cylindrica. Wax dipping; foil wrapping; multi-station convergent photogrammetry that used the naturally occurring optical texture for conjugate point matching; stereo photogrammetry that used projected light to provide optical texture; a handheld laser scanner that employed two cameras and a structured light source; and X-ray computer tomography (CT) scanning were applied to each coral skeleton to determine the spatial resolution of surface detection {{as well as the}} accuracy of surface area estimate of each method.

40|$|The Debris Resistive/Acoustic Grid Orbital Navy Sensor (DRAGONS) is {{intended}} to be a large area impact sensor for in-situ measurements of micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD) in the approx. 0. 2 to 1 mm size regime. These MMOD particles are too small to be detected by groundbased radars and optical telescopes, but still large enough to be a safety concern for human space activities and robotic missions in the low Earth orbit (LEO) region. The nominal detection area of DRAGONS is 1 sq m, consisting of four 0. 5 m x 0. 5 m independently operated panels. The concept of the DRAGONS design is to combine three different detection technologies to maximize information extracted from each detected impact. The first technology is a resistive grid consisting of 62. 5 -microns-wide resistive lines, coated in parallel and separated by 62. 5 micron gaps on a Kapton film. When a particle a few hundred micrometers or larger strikes the grid, it world penetrate the film and sever some resistive lines. The size of the damage area can be estimated from the increased resistance. The second technology employs a dual-layer, 25 -microns-thick Kapton film with a 10 cm separation. By measuring the time difference between impacts on the two films, the impact speed can be calculated. The third technology is based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) acoustic impact sensors. Multiple PVDF sensors are attached to the backside of both Kapton films to provide impact timing measurements. The impact location on each film can be identified from the <b>triangulation</b> of <b>signals</b> received at different PVDF sensors and provides an estimate of the impact direction. The development of DRAGONS is supported by the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office. The project is led by the U. S. Naval Academy (USNA), with additional collaboration from the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the University of Kent at Canterbury in Great Britain, and Virginia Tech (VT). The short-term goal of DRAGONS is to advance its Technology Readiness Level to 9 and to demonstrate the system capabilities of detecting and characterizing submillimeter MMOD impacts. The long-term goal is to deploy a large detection area (> 1 sq m) DRAGONS to 700 - 1000 km altitude and collect sufficient data for better environment definition of MMOD in the 0. 2 - to 1 -mm size regime. The Preliminary Design Review (PRD) of DRAGONS was held at the USNA in June 2012. The Critical Design Review (CDR) is scheduled for early 2013. A flight-ready unit with a 0. 25 sq m detection area will be completed and tested by the end of September 2013.

Unlike those prior systems that depend on detection of sounds and/or lights emitted by emergency vehicles, this system is not subject to severe range limitations. This system can be retrofitted into any pre-existing traffic-light-control system, without need to modify that system other than to make a minimal number of wire connections between the two systems. This system comprises several subsystems, including a transponder and interface circuitry on each emergency vehicle, a monitoring and control unit at each intersection equipped with traffic lights, and a wide-area two-way radio communication network that connects the emergency vehicles and intersection units.

System tests are currently being performed in Nuremberg's " Frankenstadion", a stadium taking part in the FIFA world cup 2006. The position is determined by hyperbolic <b>triangulation</b> based on <b>signal</b> delay differences between transmitters and receivers, which are installed within the stadium on exactly defined coordinates. The objects to be localized are miniaturized transmitters mounted inside the balls or attached to the shin pads of the players. The carefully chosen dimensioning of the system results in an accuracy within the cm range over the regional observation area of the soccer field while also allowing to resolve high speed movements of the ball. The core of the miniature transmitters consists of a two-chip ASIC solution, which sends up to 2000 brief code sequences per second in the ISM band at 2. 4 GHz. For a sufficient monitoring of the pitch up to twelve receivers per system have to be placed in various heights above ground. These synchronized receivers pick up the bursts and process them in order to obtain time-of-arrival-values. These are then handled by a computing cluster to derive position data streams with an update rate of that of the burst rate. The system can handle up to 150 transmitters on the field. This locating system offers worldwide the first possibility to analyse all matches and players objectively with the same evaluation basis. To offer the public more attraction during the match, a lot of information from the running speed of a player to the length of a pass can be provided automatically. Soon, transmissions of soccer matches on TV can be enriched with a lot of information. This way, there is a new possibility for media companies to make the game more attractive and to awake a higher interest among the audience. Applications i...|$|R
40|$|Raytheon is {{a defense}} {{contracting}} company {{with an electronic}} warfare division that is developing a radio frequency <b>signal</b> <b>triangulation</b> system. Part of the focus in improving this technology {{is the need for}} accurate and real time locational knowledge of the signal receivers, which are located at the tips of aircraft wings. Due to turbulence during flight, the fluttering motion of the wings alter the distance and angle relationships of the two receivers and add noise to the received signal data, which negatively affect the triangulation estimates. To mitigate this error caused by the wing flutter, Raytheon is developing a software algorithm that predicts the precise locations of the signal receivers in space to attempt to clean up the incoming signal data. As part of the development process at Raytheon, {{there is a need for}} a device that can move a signal antenna in random, flutter-like motion so rapid testing and refinement of the algorithm can be done. Thus Raytheon has made this project available for us to complete. This project was completed over the course of one year, which was divided into three distinct phases of development. The first phase of the design process was research and design ideation. In this step, the project specifications that the completed device would have to meet was defined. Research into existing systems and available technologies was done to gain knowledge of the wide range of possible solutions that could be explored. During the second phase of the design process, various actuation methods and their feasibility for use in this project were analyzed, while iterative refinement of the device was also underway in parallel. The last phase involved building and testing the final design of the project. The final product that was born out of this process is a two axis, large amplitude, low frequency shake device. The vertical axis is belt-driven with a servo drive and meets the required maximum motion of 11 inch stroke at 1. 6 Hz. The horizontal axis is rack and pinion driven with a DC motor that is controlled by an Arduino board in closed loop control that met the maximum motion requirement of 1. 1 inch stroke at 3. 2 Hz. Both of the drive systems were capable of generating a pseudorandom motion that resembles the flutter of wingtips...|$|R
40|$|Ambient {{intelligence}} {{is a new}} information paradigm, where people are empowered through a digital environment that is ?aware? of their presence and context and is sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to their needs. Hence, {{one of the important}} requirements for ambient intelligent environments (AIEs) is the ability to localize the whereabouts of the user in the AIE to address her/his needs. In order to protect user privacy, the use of cameras is not desirable in AIEs, and hence, {{there is a need to}} rely on nonintrusive sensors. There are various localization means that are available for outdoor spaces such as those which rely on satellite <b>signals</b> <b>triangulation.</b> However, these outdoor localization means cannot be used in indoor environments. The majority of nonintrusive and noncamera-based indoor localization systems require the installation of extra hardware such as ultrasound emitters/antennas, radio-frequency identification (RFID) antennas, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization system that is based on WiFi signals which are free to receive, and they are available in abundance in the majority of domestic spaces. However, free WiFi signals are noisy and uncertain, and their strengths and availability are continuously changing. Hence, we present a fuzzy logic-based system which employs free available WiFi signals to localize a given user in AIEs. The proposed system receives WiFi signals from a large number of existing WiFi access points (up to 170 access points), where no prior knowledge of the access points locations and the environment is required. The system employs an incremental lifelong learning approach to adjust its behavior to the varying and changing WiFi signals to provide a zero-cost localization system which can provide high accuracy in real-world living spaces. We have compared our system in both simulated and real environments with other relevant techniques in the literature, and we have found that our system outperfo- ms the other systems in the offline learning process, whereas our system was the only system which is capable of performing online learning and adaptation. The proposed system was tested in real-world spaces from a living lab intelligent apartment (iSpace) to a town center apartment to a block of offices. In all these experiments, our system has been highly accurate in detecting the user in the given AIEs, and the system was able to adapt its behavior to changes in the AIE or the WiFi signals. We envisage that the proposed system will play an important role in AIEs, especially for privacy concerned situations like elderly care scenarios...|$|R
