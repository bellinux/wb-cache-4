5|$|Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking. After {{his closing}} {{speech at the}} British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners, he began to see Lionel Logue, an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised {{breathing}} exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. Subsequently, he was able <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> less hesitation. With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during {{a tour of the}} empire in 1927. His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.|$|E

5|$|The Arch {{demolition}} {{was formally}} {{announced by the}} Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples in July 1961, but immediately drew widespread protest. Experts {{did not believe the}} £190,000 estimate and suspected foreign firms could move the Arch on rollers for substantially less. The Earl of Euston, the Earl of Rosse and John Betjeman all protested against the redevelopment. On 16 October, 75 architects and students staged a formal demonstration against the demolition inside the Great Hall, and a week later Sir Charles Wheeler led a deputation <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan against the demolition. Macmillan replied that as well as the cost, there was no place large enough to put the Arch that would look in keeping with its surroundings. Demolition began on 6 November and was completed within four months.|$|E

The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|E

5|$|Then-Bruins {{head coach}} Don Cherry {{suggested}} that the reason Orr never re-signed with the Bruins was Orr's complete trust in Eagleson at the time (Orr said that he described Eagleson as a brother). Cherry recalled Orr had refused <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>with</b> the Bruins team president directly, allowing Eagleson to mislead or withhold enough details from Boston's offer. Orr's departure from the Bruins was acrimonious {{and he has not}} held an official role with the Bruins since. Years later, it emerged that Eagleson had very good relations with Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz and NHL president John Ziegler that colluded to hold back salaries of certain players. Orr disassociated himself from Eagleson in 1980.|$|E
