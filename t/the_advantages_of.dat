5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ancient and}} modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae {{as an example of}} the power of a {{patriotic}} army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.|$|E
5|$|Having {{satisfied}} {{himself as}} to <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> screw propulsion, Brunel {{wrote to the}} company directors to persuade them {{to embark on a}} second major design change, abandoning the paddlewheel engines—already half constructed—for completely new engines suitable for powering a propeller.|$|E

In order to comprehend the forming mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> talent, we analyzed the issue by discussing the talent mobility, human capital, and the price union of talent. Finally, we employed a case of industrial cluster in Jinjiang of China to verify the forming mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> talent...|$|R
5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it {{is susceptible to}} many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Medaka and {{zebrafish}} {{are used}} as research models for studies in genetics and developmental biology. The zebrafish is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory vertebrate, offering <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> genetic similarity to mammals, small size, simple environmental needs, transparent larvae permitting non-invasive imaging, plentiful offspring, rapid growth, and the ability to absorb mutagens added to their water.|$|E

30|$|In a nutshell, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> OPE {{is that it}} {{destroys the}} {{structure}} of the tree and <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> PPE is that it destroys the order information. Thus, by combining OPE with PPE, we remove both order- and structure-based linkages.|$|R
50|$|The newer {{fuel systems}} for heating use either {{woodchips}} or wood pellets. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> woodchips is cost, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> wood pellets is the controlled fuel value. The use of woodchips in automated heating systems, {{is based on}} a robust technology.|$|R
5|$|Militarily, {{although}} {{the battle was}} actually not decisive {{in the context of}} the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting. The performance of the defenders is used as an example of <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers.|$|E
5|$|Once it was {{recognized}} that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that re-compression could relieve the symptoms, Paul Bert showed in 1878 that decompression sickness is caused by nitrogen bubbles released from tissues and blood during or after decompression, and showed <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> breathing oxygen after developing decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, {{the response of}} the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again. Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.|$|E

50|$|A recent {{variation}} of the electric locomotive is the fuel cell locomotive. Fuel cell locomotives combine <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> not needing an electrical system in place, with <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> emissionless operation. However, {{there is a substantial}} initial cost of such fuel cell vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{cartridge}} {{is unique}} {{in that it was}} the first ever cartridge to use a belted rim. The addition of a belt to a rimless cartridge design provided <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> allowing for correct headspacing of highly tapered cartridges (an <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> rimmed cartridges) and smooth feeding through magazine rifles (<b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> rimless cartridges).|$|R
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> {{linezolid}} is {{its high}} bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, {{as if it}} had been given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|The Stirling {{solar dish}} {{combines}} a parabolic concentrating dish with a Stirling engine which normally drives an electric generator. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> Stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime.|$|E
5|$|A long bar of Danish territories in {{the south}} and lack of {{sufficient}} year-round ice-free ports severely limited Sweden's access to Baltic trade. Nevertheless, the country prospered due to exports of timber, iron and most notably copper, coupled with <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> a growing navy and proximity to the Livonian ports across the narrow Gulf of Finland. Before the Livonian war, Sweden had sought expansion into Livonia, but the intervention of the Russian tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo-Swedish War of 1554–1557, which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod.|$|E
50|$|Vented walls offer <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> {{being able}} to shed more heat {{earlier in the evening}} when it is more {{commonly}} required while higher heat capacity non-vented walls offer <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> improved overall diurnal stability.

5|$|After the First Crusade's {{capture of}} Jerusalem and victory at Ascalon the {{majority}} of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe. Godfrey was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only Tancred of the crusader princes remained with the aim of establishing his own lordship. At this point the Franks held only Jerusalem and two great Syrian cities; Antioch and Edessa but not the surrounding country. Jerusalem remained economically sterile despite <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> being the centre of administration of church and state and benefitting from streams of pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|Before the First World War, the Spanish Army {{bought a}} Schneider-Brillié in 1909 {{to be used}} in Melilla, where armed {{conflict}} with local tribes was going on. This was a French bus platform that was fitted with an armoured body, to be used as troop transport. Although it was big, slow and its performance was not good, the Spanish Army learned the value of armored vehicles and bought a second one. Spanish Army officers appreciated <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> using advanced weapons technology in the Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
5000|$|ARFIMA(0,d,0) {{is similar}} to {{fractional}} Gaussian noise (fGn): with d = H−&frac12;, their covariances have the same power-law decay. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> fGn over ARFIMA(0,d,0) is that many asymptotic relations hold for finite samples.

5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some of <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations, reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, the Spanish {{government}} decided {{to sign a}} contract with the French company GIAT to begin production of the AMX-30. However, it was not <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness to sell their L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, that led the Spanish Army to favor the French armored vehicle.|$|E
5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> and {{disadvantages}} <b>of</b> legal resident spies mostly mirror <b>the</b> disadvantages and <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> illegal resident spies.
