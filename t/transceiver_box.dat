40|$|The {{objective}} of the MEMO project is to design, integrate and operate applications which utilise interactive mobile Multimedia services by integrating two subsystems: a high-speed broadcasting system, and a low speed bi-directional communications system. This is realised by combining the existing GSM mobile telecommunications network and the Digital Audio Broadcasting system. After a first successful trial with this platform for mobile Multimedia services [1], the project {{is now in a}} stage to consolidate the user requirements and to define and develop its second generation equipment, based on experience gained using first generation equipment. The principal {{objective of}} the second generation MEMO demonstrator is to integrate the technical components in order to provide the full functionality required by the services and to improve the performance of the overall system. Especially, the 2 nd generation terminal design will provide a higher degree of portability and mobility by connecting a laptop PC through a wireless LAN to a DAB/GSM <b>transceiver</b> <b>box</b> which can be placed remotely. The paper will report on the basic principles of MEMO, the assumptions and findings of the requirements studies, and the state of implementation of the second generation equipment, as well as on trial design and example services...|$|E
50|$|Selecting a VMS {{system is}} most {{dependent}} on what vendors and {{models have been}} approved by the fishing vessel's state of registry and the functionality requirements. Normally an authority will specify specific approved equipment to ensure end to end system integrity and service level meeting the specific requirements applicable to the vessel type. For example, some systems require a user interface on the vessel, whilst others will have a simple black <b>box</b> <b>transceiver</b> with no user interface.|$|R
5000|$|QRPers are ham radio enthusiasts {{known to}} use a power output of five watts, {{sometimes}} operating with as little as 100 milliwatts or even less. Extremely low power—one watt and below—is often referred to by hobbyists as QRPp. Commercial transceivers designed to operate at or near-QRP power levels have been available for many years, but some QRPers prefer to design and build their own equipment, either from kits or from scratch. Many build miniature transmitters and <b>transceivers</b> into Altoids <b>boxes</b> and operate using battery power. Popular QRP kit models include the Elecraft K2, KX1, and now KX3 [...] and those produced by NorCal, Small Wonder Labs, and others. QRP activity can often be heard on 7.030 MHz.|$|R
