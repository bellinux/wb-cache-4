40|$|The {{tumorigenesis}} of sporadic endocrine tumors {{is still}} not fully understood. It {{is well known that}} patients with von Recklinghausen syndrome (NF- 1) (OMIM 162200) carrying NF 1 germline mutations are predisposed to endocrine tumors including pheochromocytomas and duodenal somatostatinomas. It is unclear, however, whether the rarely reported occurrence of pancreatic insulinomas in NF- 1 patients represents a coincidental finding or whether insulinomas are a rare manifestation of the NF- 1 syndrome. To determine the potential association between the NF- 1 syndrome and pancreatic endocrine tumors, we analyzed a NF- 1 patient with a well-differentiated pancreatic endocrine carcinoma for NF 1 mutation, allelic loss of the NF 1 gene and its expression in peripheral blood and tumor cells. The germline mutation c. 499 del TGTT known in the family was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing of exon 4 in DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the NF 1 gene was carried out using 3 intragenic microsatellite markers on 17 q 11. 2. RNA expression was examined by reverse transcription and a consecutive PCR spanning intron 3 of the NF 1 gene including the mutated site in exon 4. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze NF- 1 protein expression. Mutation analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes confirmed the 4 base pair deletion in exon 4 starting at codon 167 (499 del TGTT). LOH analysis of tumor tissue revealed retention of both NF 1 alleles. While reverse transcriptase-PCR of peripheral blood showed bi-allelic expression of both the wild-type NF 1 and the mutated form, reverse transcriptase-PCR of tumor extracts demonstrated expression of the mutated but not the wild-type NF 1 allele. Additionally, neurofibromin, the NF 1 gene product, was absent in the tumor tissue of the NF- 1 patient. These results show that the wild-type NF 1 <b>transcrips</b> and protein are reduced, in the reported insulinoma, supposedly by epigenetic mechanisms. This provides strong evidence that there is a relationship between von Recklinghausen disease and the patient's insulinoma. In this line, insulinomas may be viewed as a rare manifestation of the NF- 1 syndrome. Furthermore, the NF 1 gene must be considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for sporadic insulinomas and probably other pancreatic endocrine tumors...|$|R

40|$|Ascidians (urochodates: Ciona intestinalis and Phallusia mammillata) are {{considered}} the closest invertebrate ancestors of vertebrates. They develop into simple tadpoles made of 2600 cells harboring a notochord and a dorsal nerve chord. At {{the turn of the}} 20 th century, the ascidians model contributed much to the idea that oocytes contained localized determinants of development. This led to the concept of mosaic development. Today we know that some of these determinants are maternal RNAs localized in the egg cortex. Ascidian determinant RNAs are part of a large family of maternal RNAs called postplasmic/PEM RNAs. They include about 40 <b>transcrips</b> classified as Type I (localized before fertilization) and Type II (localized after fertilization). Type I postplasmic/PEM RNAs are relocalized after fertilization in a stereotyped fashion such that they concentrate in the posterior region of the zygote and form a compact cortical zone in the 2 posterior vegetal blastomeres at the 8 cell stage called the CAB (Centrosome Attracting Body). The large numbers of postplasmic/PEM RNAs identified, the synchronicity and abundance of embryos, and the ability to isolate cortical fragments retaining the RNAs make the ascidian model particularly attractive for studying localization and cortical anchorage of polarized RNAs. It is possible to operate a first classification of postplasmic/PEM RNAs based on their localization in cells in the tail of the tadpole. The determinant Macho 1 and PEM 1 segregate in 2 B 8. 11 cells with somatic destinies while RNAs such as the germ plasm marker Vasa is in addition localized in 2 B. 12 cells precursors of the germ line. The 3 UTR regions of postplasmic/PEM RNA {{are considered}} to contain part of the code for localization and anchorage. In Ascidians as in the amphibian Xenopus these regions are characterized by frequent xCACx repeats. Using this criteria to screen 3 UTRs of all Ciona intestinalis genes, we confirmed that frequent xCACx repeats constituted a predictive signature for postplasmic/PEM RNAs and found 2 new members (MnK et PSD). We have also identified subcellular anchorage sites of postplasmic/PEM RNAs using high resolution immuno-in situ localization techniques in oocytes and embryos as well as in cortical fragments isolated from them. The RNA determinants Macho 1 and PEM 1 are associated with a sub-domain of cortical Endoplasmic Reticulum (cER) while Vasa, PEM 3, POPK RNAs are localized in granules (putative germ granules). This demonstrates that although at low resolution these RNAs appear co-localized in the cortex they have in fact different structures of anchorage. This allows to propose that postplasmic/PEM RNAs belong to 2 categories: a category (Vasa-Type) associated with granules and segregating in both 8. 11 and 8. 12 cells and a category (Macho 1 -Type) associated to cER which segregates only into B 8. 11 cells. We also investigated whether, as in nerve terminals, the translation machinery was also polarized in oocytes and embryos. Indeed we found that some factors (PAPB) and regulators (phosporylated forms of MnK, 4 EBP et S 6 Kinase) of translation initiation were co-localized with postplasmic/PEM RNAs associated with the cER (Macho 1 and PEM 1 RNAs). The fact that regulators such as MnK and S 6 Kinase change phosphorylation status after fertilization suggests that they control translation initiation of determinants RNAs in the cortex following egg activation.
