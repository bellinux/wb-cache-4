5|$|Robert's {{treatment}} {{was used by}} William the Conqueror {{as one of the}} justifications for his invasion of England, the other being that Edward had named William his heir. Ian Walker, author of the most recent scholarly biography of Harold Godwinson, suggests that it was Robert, while in exile after the return of Godwin, who testified that King Edward had nominated Duke William to be Edward's heir. However, this view is contradicted by David Douglas, a historian and biographer of William the Conqueror, who believes that Robert merely relayed Edward's decision, probably while Robert {{was on his way to}} Rome to receive his pallium. Several medieval chroniclers, including the author of the Life of Saint Edward, felt that the blame for Edward and Godwin's conflict in 1051–1052 lay squarely with Robert; modern historians <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Robert as an ambitious man, with little political skill.|$|E

40|$|Twenty preservice {{teachers}} were interviewed prior to commencement of their teacher education course {{to establish the}} conceptions of teaching and approaches to learning with which they entered the course. Students were categorised as surface, deep or achieving in their learning orientations (Biggs, 1987). Five conceptions of teaching were identified: the nurturing helper, authority and disciplinarian, shaper of children 2 ̆ 7 s lives, presenter of information and facilitator of thinking and learning. There was a consistent relationship between conceptions of learning and conceptions of teaching. Surface learners <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> teaching as transmission of information. There were very few deep learners, however they <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> teaching as facilitation of thinking and learning. Achieving learners <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> teaching as nurturing. Achieving learners also indicated that shaping children 2 ̆ 7 s lives and imposing discipline were important...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} publicly funded campaigns for two election cycles in Arizona, Connecticut and Maine, to determine the likelihood a candidate will participate and whether that participation has any impact on competition. The study finds that all types of candidates seem willing to participate, but candidates with the lowest probability of winning may {{be more inclined to}} do so. In terms of competition, participating candidates <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an increase in their vote shares, while candidates who faced an opponent participating in the program <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their vote shares decline...|$|R
25|$|Anti-intellectualism is {{hostility to}} and mistrust of intellect, intellectuals, and intellectualism {{commonly}} expressed as deprecation {{of education and}} philosophy, and the dismissal of art, literature, and science as impractical and even contemptible human pursuits. Anti-intellectuals present themselves and are perceived as champions of common folk—populists against political and academic elitism. They <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> educated people as a status class detached from the concerns of most people, and feel that intellectuals dominate political discourse and control higher education.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether such symbols are writing, primitive or proto-writing, or merely non-writing symbols or signs for other purposes such as identification is a highly controversial one, and the debate still continues today. Proponents of the view that they are early Chinese writing <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> evidence in comparisons of individual signs with individual oracle bone script characters. Others believe that Neolithic signs {{are part of an}} incipient semiotic system that eventually {{led to the development of}} mature Chinese writing.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of the starter culture is then slowly reduced, often by the graduated addition of must to get within 5–10°C (41–50°F) of the must that the culture will be added to. This is done to avoid the sudden cold shock that the yeast cells may experience if the starter culture was added directly to the must itself which can kill up to 60% of the culture. Additionally, surviving cells exposed to cold shock <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an increase in hydrogen sulfide production.|$|E

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey of over seven hundred students on four degree {{courses at the}} University of Paisley found that the majority had paid employment during term time. The average time spent at work per week was just under 15 hours. Students on the whole <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their employment as interfering with their studies, this being particularly the case with those who worked longest hours. On the other hand, students <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> employment as helpful for their future careers. No relationship was found between whether students worked and their socio-economic background. There was some evidence that students working longer hours performed less well DFDGHPLFDOOKLVZDVSDUWLFXODUO...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{a general}} {{consensus}} about values and ideologies underlying the monumental complex of Mont'e Prama, political implications and artistic influences are still hotly debated. As for political significance, some scholars <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{in the small}} number of warriors, with respect to archers, a sign of military and political decay of the Nuragic society, caused by the establishment of Phoenician centers in Sardinia. This would be mirrored by the import and adoption of Levantine ideological models and by assignment of the statues to the orientalizing period spreading throughout the Mediterranean area during the 8th century BC.|$|E
25|$|This {{branch of}} Protestantism is {{distinguished}} by {{belief in the}} baptism with the Holy Spirit as an experience separate from conversion that enables a Christian to live a Holy Spirit–filled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their movement as reflecting {{the same kind of}} spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement.|$|E

25|$|Like {{other forms}} of evangelical Protestantism, Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible and the {{necessity}} of accepting Christ as personal lord and savior. It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church.

25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{dogs with}} SM show {{scratching}} behavior. [...] Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to suffer pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM cavaliers {{is a sign}} of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine. [...] If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing scoliosis. [...] If the problem is severe, there is likely to be poor proprioception (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs. [...] Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> progression of the condition.|$|E
2500|$|Many twentieth-century {{theories}} {{rejected the}} nineteenth-century theories' opposition of myth and science.

50|$|There are {{significant}} differences between the four accounts, recording the evolution of the tradition from the earliest gospel (that of Mark) to the last (the Gospel of John).

500|$|Although monastic chroniclers {{after the}} Norman Conquest {{accused him of}} crimes such as perjury and homicide, they do not provide any {{evidence}} of those crimes. Almost 100 years after his death, another Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was taunted in 1164 by King Henry II's barons with Stigand's fate for daring to oppose his king. Modern historians views <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him as either a wily politician and indifferent bishop, or to see him purely {{in terms of his}} ecclesiastical failings. The historian Frank Stenton felt that his [...] "whole career shows that he was essentially a politician". Concurring with this, the historian Nick Higham said that [...] "Stigand was a seasoned politician whose career had been built on an accurate reading of the balance of power." [...] Another historian, Eric John, said that [...] "Stigand had a fair claim to be the worst bishop of Christendom". However, the historian Frank Barlow felt that [...] "he was a man of cultured tastes, a patron of the arts who was generous to the monasteries which he held". Alexander Rumble argued that Stigand was unlucky in living past the Conquest, stating that it could be said that Stigand was [...] "unlucky to live so long that he saw in his lifetime not only the end of the Anglo-Saxon state but also the challenging of uncanonical, but hitherto tolerated, practices by a wave of papal reforms".|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{difference}} between Catholic theology {{and most of}} the many different Protestant theologies on the issue of concupiscence is whether it can be classified as sin by its own nature. Different Protestant denominations <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> concupiscence as sin itself, an act of the sinner. [...] The Catholic Church teaches that while it is highly likely to cause sin, concupiscence is not sin itself. [...] Rather, it is [...] "the tinder for sin" [...] which [...] "cannot harm those who do not consent" [...] (CCC 1264).|$|E
25|$|Historians {{and colleagues}} {{generally}} agree that Shockley {{was a poor}} manager and businessman.

50|$|As a group, the Socialists of {{the period}} {{repeatedly}} rejected the general strike as a tactic; however, a number of Socialist leaders advocated its use {{for one reason or}} another.

30|$|The PSTs {{found the}} idea of ‘trouble’ useful when they were {{analysing}} {{what was happening in}} their transcripts.

2500|$|Confucius Institutes have defended their establishments, [...] {{comparing}} them with other cultural promotion {{organizations such as}} Alliance française and Goethe-Institut. However, unlike the Alliance francaise or Goethe-Institut, many Confucius Institutes operate directly on university campuses, thus giving rise to unique concerns related to academic freedom and political influence. Some observers have noted that CIs are largely limited to teaching cultural and language programs, and the institutes' staff <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> political and controversial subjects as human rights and democracy as outside {{the context of the}} mission of a Confucius Institute.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{viewpoint}} on sex education, historically {{inspired by}} sexologists like Wilhelm Reich and psychologists like Sigmund Freud and James W. Prescott, holds {{that what is}} at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual mores. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized sexual oppression and to make up their own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of [...] "Reid About Sex" [...] suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to mainstream psychiatry, that <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> such beliefs {{as signs of}} psychopathology, the Paranoia Network promotes a philosophy of living with unusual and compelling beliefs, without necessarily pathologising them as signs of mental illness. It was partly inspired by the Hearing Voices Network's approach to auditory hallucinations.|$|R

5000|$|Pentecostals {{are also}} {{distinguished}} from the charismatic movement {{on the basis of}} style.
