5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to solve food collection problems using genetic programming. The genetic program will evolve programs that mimic <b>the</b> way <b>ants</b> can collect food {{and bring it}} back to a nest. There are two special factors in this genetic program that make <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> work together in order to solve the problem, as opposed to each ant acting on its own. First, there will be a stream in the environment that <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> must cross to get to the food. Although all <b>ants</b> have <b>the</b> same program, some must move into the water and die, building a bridge for <b>the</b> other <b>ants</b> to cross. <b>The</b> surviving <b>ants</b> must realize that a bridge has already been built that they can use, instead of killing themselves by building another bridge. Second, the food will be too heavy for one ant to lift alone. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> must find <b>the</b> food, and call to other ants for help. If all of <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> are at food waiting for help, some, but not all, of <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> must realize that they are in a deadlock situation, and leave their food to help other ants. Both of these problems require <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> to use teamwork to solve <b>the</b> problem. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> must realize what other ants are doing, without direct communication or a state machine within <b>the</b> <b>ants...</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{variation in}} ant–aphid relationships involves lycaenid butterflies and Myrmica ants. For example, Niphanda fusca butterflies lay eggs on plants where ants tend herds of aphids. The eggs hatch as caterpillars which feed on <b>the</b> aphids. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> do not defend the aphids from the caterpillars (this {{is due to}} the caterpillar producing a pheromone <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> detect making them think the caterpillar is actually one of them), but carry the caterpillars to their nest. In <b>the</b> nest, <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> feed <b>the</b> caterpillars, who in return produce honeydew for <b>the</b> <b>ants.</b> When <b>the</b> caterpillars reach full size, they crawl to the colony entrance and form cocoons. After two weeks, butterflies emerge and take flight. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> will attack <b>the</b> butterfly but the butterfly has a sticky wool like substance on their wings that disable <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> jaws, meaning it can take flight without being ripped apart by <b>the</b> <b>ants.</b>|$|R
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. <b>The</b> <b>ant</b> is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E
5|$|Attack by <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> Crematogaster laeviuscula is {{different}} from attacks by birds. Rather than knocking down the nest, the ants swarm all over the nest and remove the brood from it. The ants destroy the entire brood but {{they are unable to}} kill the adults.|$|E

25|$|As {{the larvae}} feed and grow, native ants may gather and {{indicate}} the presence of larger Mission blue larvae. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> often stand on the caterpillar and tap it with their antennae.

5|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Ant</b> and the Grasshopper, a {{grasshopper}} squanders {{the spring}} and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food. After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> colony during the second act. Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.|$|E

50|$|A {{species of}} South American <b>ant</b> has adapted <b>the</b> ability to hunt creatures that {{are up to}} 13,350 times their mean weight. <b>The</b> Azteca andreae <b>ants</b> have {{developed}} a physical hook that enables their ambushes: <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> are arboreal and ambush flying insects that land on their trees. Whenever a bug lands on <b>the</b> leaf, <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> spring into action: a small number bite down on {{the legs of the}} winged creature. While the bug is stuck and attached to <b>the</b> leaf, more <b>ants</b> come to dismember the prey. <b>The</b> average <b>ant</b> can hold up to 5,700 times its own body weight. The reason for this is suggest by a possible co-evolution between <b>the</b> Azteca andreae <b>ants</b> and <b>the</b> Cecropia obtusa leaves. The leaves have pronounced velcro-like loops that <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> are able to hook on to. <b>The</b> <b>ants</b> prevent other bugs from eating the leaves, while the leaves gives <b>the</b> often preyed-upon <b>ants</b> a predatory edge.|$|R
5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} an egg. If the egg is fertilised, <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> becomes a diploid female; if not, {{it becomes a}} haploid male.

5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> nest where it feeds on <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> larvae.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia is {{only found}} in Australia. Until its rediscovery, the genus was only {{known from the}} {{original}} specimens collected in Western Australia by Amy Crocker in December 1931. Entomologist Robert W. Taylor expressed doubt about the type locality of <b>the</b> <b>ant,</b> but said that the specimens were probably collected from {{the western end of}} the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia. Entomologists feared that Nothomyrmecia was extinct, as notable biologists such as E.O. Wilson made attempts to find <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> but failed to do so. In 1977, Taylor rediscovered Nothomyrmecia in Poochera, 1300km (800mi) away from the original collection site. Colonies are found in old growth mallee woodland with many Eucalyptus species such as Eucalyptus brachycalyx, Eucalyptus oleosa and Eucalyptus gracilis abundant. Only a few small colonies are known in its restricted distribution, listing it as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ants</b> protect <b>the</b> {{trees from}} attack by other insects.

In exchange, V. collinsii not only provides <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> with hollow thorns in which to live, but also produces lipid- and protein-rich food bodies, known as Beltian bodies, on the tips of new leaflets, which are consumed by <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> and are critical for larval growth.

5|$|Once the P. rebeli larvae {{infiltrate}} the host’s brood, they ascend {{to the highest}} social ranks of the host's hierarchy by using acoustics to achieve social acceptance from worker M. schencki ants. P. rebeli larvae and pupa accomplish this by mimicking the sound that the queen of <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> colony makes, both while as a larva and as a pupa in the colony.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism in Lepidoptera is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} and the P. rebeli caterpillar is no exception as it displays polymorphism in its larval form. The P. rebeli caterpillars have two strategies for living and growing underground: to exist as fast-developing larvae (FDL) or slow-developing larvae (SDL). After <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> brood adopts the FDL, which comprise approximately 25% of the total P. rebeli larvae, the FDL complete growth the following spring and eclose (emerge as an adult from the pupa) in early summer to complete their life cycle. The SDL, which comprise 75% of P. rebeli larvae, do not grow much during the first year, but grow rapidly during {{the early part of}} the second summer and remain a second winter within <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> colonies. While both larva types ultimately form similar-sized pupae, their polymorphic growth rates could indicate alternative fitness strategies and different ways to exploit the M. schencki food resources.|$|E
5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. <b>The</b> <b>ant</b> prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides <b>the</b> <b>ant</b> with isolation and warmth. This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry dirt and grass to build nests. One study found suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not.|$|E
50|$|The {{harvesting}} is done {{by local}} peasants who are often wounded by <b>the</b> <b>ants,</b> since <b>the</b> <b>ants</b> have strong mandibles.
