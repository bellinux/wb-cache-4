In that sense, Varoufakis argued, taking on the [...] "bailout" [...] loans in 2010 and 2012, before restructuring the debt properly and putting in place a proper developmental program (including reforming the oligarchy, creating a development bank and dealing with the banks' non-performing loans) would lead to deeper bankruptcy, a great depression and a harder default in the future. His explanation of why the troika of Greece's lenders (the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission) insisted on these bailout loans was that they represented a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> from the private banks to Greece's and Europe's taxpayers.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of the financial crisis}} were driven by underpricing of risk and lack of transparency, which led to a loss of confidence when the bubble finally burst. Crisis resolution involved massive government interventions that caused a permanent <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>losses</b> to the public sector as well as sovereign-debt crises that may involve painful solutions. Letting banks fail is a necessary disciplinary factor, but this requires a well-defined “game plan” which did not exist in the crisis. Regulatory reforms underway aim at restoring confidence, but they may hamper the long-term potential of institutional investors. Nevertheless, institutional investors should still be able to provide risk capital – except for perhaps pension funds, which have been weakened by demographic developments. Finally, improving governance and reducing excessive risk-taking are important but challenging tasks. More active and involved shareholders could further these goals, but such participation will be hard to achieve. Therefore, transparent bonus and remuneration plans are perhaps the most important initiatives for preventing future systemic financial crises. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{period of}} time often passes between entering into a sales agreement and its execution. During this period goods can be shipped, stored or be under other circumstances that render impossible proper control over them by both vendor and buyer {{and at the same}} time increase the risk <b>of</b> accidental <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> or damage to the goods. The risk <b>of</b> accidental <b>loss</b> or damage entails encumbering one of the parties to the agreement with negative consequences of such events. From the standpoint of the buyer, such ramifications amount to the obligation to pay, whether or not the goods have been damaged or lost and the possibility of demanding the fulfillment of mutual obligations from the vendor could not be exercised. The determination of share in the risk <b>of</b> accidental <b>loss</b> or damage <b>of</b> goods is a difficult task due to conflict of interest existing between the parties. The objective of the vendor is to transfer the risk as soon as possible while the buyer is eager to accept the risk as late as possible. This issue becomes crucial for goods that are shipped by sea (the so-called „goods at sea” since sea shipment in most cases takes place over long distances. The traditional stance says that the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> risk occurs at the moment of entering into an agreement, <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> ownership, <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> physical control over merchandise and also at the point when the vendor has fulfilled all contractual obligations. In terms of „goods at sea”, new solutions are being explored, guided by the rule that the party that can obtain cheaper insurance against <b>loss</b> or damage <b>of</b> merchandise and is able to be paid effectively and without unnecessary delay for the loss or damage by the insurer and shipping company as well as wield better control over the merchandise during shipment, should be obliged to be encumbered with the risk. Article 68 of CISG provides for special rules on the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> or damage <b>of</b> the goods during shipment.

A key quantity to disentangle both CDW and superconductivity orders is the dynamic density response, quantified by the loss function, or equivalently the dynamic structure factor S(q,ω).

We applied CEST to detect systematically 15 common cellular metabolites in a panel of differentially aggressive human breast cancer cell lines. The highest CEST contrast was generated by creatine, myo-inositol, glutamate, and glycerophosphocholine, whose cellular concentrations decreased with increasing breast cancer aggressiveness. These decreased metabolite concentrations resulted in turn in a decreased CEST profile with increasing breast cancer aggressiveness in water-soluble extracts of breast cell lines. Treatment of both breast cancer cell lines with the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin resulted in increased metabolic CEST profiles, which correlated with significant increases in creatine, phosphocreatine, and glycerophosphocholine. CEST can detect breast cancer aggressiveness and response to chemotherapy in water-soluble extracts of breast cell lines. The presented results help shed light on possible contributions from CEST-active metabolites to the CEST contrast produced by breast cancers.
