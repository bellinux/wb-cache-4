40|$|The FCC process {{continues}} {{as one of}} the major refinery technologies despite changes in refinery operations. The main fractionator/vapor recovery systems associated with many FCC units have the potential for significant gains in energy efficiency and product recovery through revamping. Older FCCU designs did not take full advantage of the heat available in the main fractionator. These older designs typically reject large amounts of heat to air or water cooling while using steam <b>to</b> <b>reboil</b> towers in the vapor recovery unit. By selecting the proper location and rates of side pump around streams, heat available in the main column can be used <b>to</b> <b>reboil</b> most or all of the VRU towers. Revamps of this type may be undertaken as stand alone energy conservation projects or {{as part of a larger}} revamp aimed at improving the recovery of marketable products. This paper will give examples of an older design with relatively inefficient heat utilization and a newer design incorporating recent trends in heat recovery. A case study describing an actual revamp of a main fractionator/VRU system will illustrate the potential for increased energy efficiency and improved product recovery...|$|R

This paper discusses a complex integrated low level heat recovery system that is being engineered for installation in a large petroleum refinery. The system will recover during normal operations 106 million BTU's per hour of thermal energy presently being lost to water.

40|$|As {{energy costs}} {{continue}} to increase, {{one must be}} willing to accept greater complexities in heat recovery systems. The days of being satisfied with only simple hot product to cold feed exchange, restricted to the plot boundaries of each unit, are a thing of the past. This paper presents results of a refinery-wide survey to identify potential high temperature heat sources that are not being recovered and low temperature systems that consume fuel. The best candidates in each category were connected by a circulating heat medium loop where waste heat is recovered for useful purposes. The heat medium chosen is turbine fuel. It is pumped around the refinery to pick up heat at the crude distilling unit, the hydrocracker, the catalytic cracker, and the coker; the heat is used <b>to</b> <b>reboil</b> a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed Water. The heat that is recovered is equivalent to some 660 B/D of fuel: at an illustrative fuel value of say $ 30 per barrel, the value of the recovered heat is $ 20, 000 per day. An energy conservation project at Shell's Norco (Louisiana) Manufacturing Complex involves several processing units and recovers heat that was previously lost to air or cooling water. The recovered heat is used <b>to</b> <b>reboil</b> a butylenes splitter column and to preheat boiler feed water. Essentially, the system consists of a circulating heat medium that transfers waste heat to heat consumers. The heat medium picks up heat from multiple donors and transfers it to multiple consumers...|$|R

Although currently limited to temperatures below approximately 350 F, nevertheless a variety of uses have been demonstrated. These include about 1 / 3 of the distillation columns in the U.

The researchers have collected the data with the preparation a 33 questionnaire question to measure the emotional intelligence and a 20 questionnaire question to measure the rate of the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> the type of educational media. The questionnaire of the emotional intelligence contains five subscales such as self-consciousness, self – control, self-motivation, social consciousness, social skills and the questionnaire of the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> the type of educational media contains visual media, audio media, visualaudio media, multi-sensory and meta-media. The results showed that it has no relationship between the rate of selfconsciousness, controlling himself, self-motivation, his social consciousness and an amazing people and the rate of the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> educational media. Furthermore, it does not exist no relationship between the rate of social skills of people and the rate of <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> visual media, visual-audio, multi-sensory and meta-media but there is a direct relationship between the rate of social skills of people and the rate of <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> audio media, i. e. the people with higher social skills have more <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> audio media. On the other hand, people with high emotional intelligence don’t have as much <b>tendency</b> as <b>to</b> the educational media.

In addition, the extent <b>to</b> which the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive predicts forgiveness of an actual transgression was examined among married couples. The <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive partially mediated the relation between model of other (relationship partner) and satisfaction for those in dating relationships and for husbands. For those in marital relationships, the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive partially mediated the relation between model of self and satisfaction. In addition, for wives, endorsing a greater <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive was related to forgiveness of an actual transgression, regardless of the severity of that transgression. For husbands, endorsing a greater <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive was related to forgiveness of an actual transgression, but only for more severe transgressions.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to study the impact of {{national}} culture on the diffusion process of innovation. The study was conducted on consumers in two countries of Sweden and Iran who have significant cultural differences based on Hofstede’s five cultural dimensions model. A questionnaire designed <b>to</b> evaluate the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> adopt new products and to imitate was completed by 200 people in each of two respective countries. These participants were well distributed across different genders and age groups. The responses obtained were analyzed to evaluate the impact of culture on adoption of innovation {{as well as on}} imitation. In addition, the role of gender on the adoption of new product as well as on imitation was investigated. The analysis of the data obtained in this study clearly indicates that national culture plays a significant role on the diffusion process of innovation. These results show that the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> adopt new products in the Swedish culture is higher than that in the Iranian culture. In other words one can conclude that the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> adopt new products in countries with low power distance, low uncertainty avoidance, individualistic, and short term orientation culture is higher than in countries with high power distance, high uncertainty avoidance, collective, and long term orientation culture. The results of this research also demonstrate that gender also {{plays an important role in}} the adoption of new products. These results indicate that the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> adopt new product by males in both Sweden and Iran is higher than the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> adopt new products by their female counter parts. In other words in both feminine and masculine cultures males have more <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> adopt new products than females. The analysis of the data obtained in this study indicates that national culture plays a significant role on the degree of imitation. These results show that the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> imitate in Iranian culture is higher than in the Swedish culture. In other words the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> imitate in countries with high power distance, high uncertainty avoidance, collective, and long term orientation culture is higher than the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> imitate in countries with low power distance, low uncertainty avoidance, individualistic, and short term orientation culture.
