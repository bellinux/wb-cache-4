However, this change in perspective may lie elsewhere. In October 1955, Huxley had an experience while on LSD that he considered more profound than those detailed in The Doors of Perception.

Was it better to pursue a course of careful psychological experimentation.... or was the real value of these drugs to [...] "stimulate the most basic kind of religious ecstasy"? ...|$|E
