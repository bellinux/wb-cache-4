5|$|It {{was during}} {{this stage of the}} {{fighting}} <b>that</b> <b>James</b> Llewellyn Davies earned the Victoria Cross (VC). Davies, alone, attacked a German machine gun position after previously failed efforts had resulted in numerous British deaths. He killed one German and captured another as well as the gun. Although he was wounded, he then led an attack to kill a sniper who had been harassing his unit. Davies subsequently died of his wounds.|$|E

5|$|He {{scored two}} more {{victories}} on 23 and 28 April, his {{first in the}} North African Campaign. However, on 23 April, Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf 109 received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As Marseille was leaning forward the rounds missed him by inches. Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter. Just a month later, records show <b>that</b> <b>James</b> Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941. Marseille engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A turning dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested Marseille.|$|E
5|$|In January 1689, a Convention Parliament {{assembled}} in England and declared <b>that</b> <b>James</b> had effectively abdicated when he fled, {{and that the}} thrones of England and Ireland were therefore vacant. The Parliament or Estates of Scotland took similar action, and William and Mary were declared monarchs of all three realms. The Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689 settled the succession. Anne and her descendants were {{to be in the}} line of succession after William and Mary, and they were to be followed by any descendants of William by a future marriage. On 24 July 1689, Anne gave birth to a son, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, who, though ill, survived infancy. As King William and Queen Mary had no children, it looked as though Anne's son would eventually inherit the Crown.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Manning {{left the}} family in 1869 after selling most of the family's realty to his wife. There is no {{evidence}} that suggests that Isaac had any permanent relations with any members of the family again. Within four years James was remarried to her son Sylvester's father-in-law, Frank Perkins. The marriage lasted less than two years, after which time she reverted to her former married name. It was at this time <b>that</b> <b>James</b> became increasingly worried about her eternal welfare. She began to petition the First Presidency to be endowed and to be sealed, along with her children, to Walker Lewis, a prominent African-American Mormon Elder. Lewis, like Elijah Abel, had been ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime, and James therefore assumed that he would be eligible for temple ordinances. However, her petitions were consistently ignored or refused.|$|E
5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried <b>that</b> <b>James</b> might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
5|$|Many {{residents}} {{moved away}} from Bow Street after the theatre {{was established in the}} early 18th century. Life in the street declined and became known for pornography and prostitution. The publisher Edmund Curll lived at No.2 during this time, and by 1740 the street held 8 pubs, concealing a number of brothels. In 1833, the Commissioners of Woods, Forest and Land Revenues were looking to buy land on and around Bow Street, and discovered <b>that</b> <b>James</b> Robinson, lessee to the Duke of Bedford, was running a brothel there. In the following legal dispute, Robinson's legal team accused the Commissioner's surveyor of being prejudiced against prostitution. The building was demolished, but made little difference to the area's reputation. In 1844, a resident suggested the street should be renamed as a continuation of Wellington Street to distance itself from the reputation Bow Street had acquired.|$|E

The encounter lasted eight minutes and fifty-five seconds. Brown gained the pinfall after performing his signature maneuver the Pounce following interference from Phi Delta Slam (Bruno Sassi and Big Tilly).|$|E
5|$|Officers from Latona {{were first}} {{to board the}} French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal {{surrender}} except to an officer of Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage. British historians have debated this opinion: William James agreed with this assessment, but also opined that if Horatio had been alone {{it would have been}} Scott surrendering rather than the French officers, such was the damage his ship had suffered in the battle. Edward Pelham Brenton, who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time, gives most of the credit for the victory to Latona, in a detailed account <b>that</b> <b>James</b> later criticised for its inaccuracies.|$|E

Melina would turn face after the match due to being attacked by Phoenix in a backstage segment.|$|E
5|$|The English claimed {{sovereignty}} {{based on}} the false claim that Svalbard was discovered by Hugh Willoughby in 1553, <b>that</b> <b>James</b> I had annexed it in 1614 {{and that it was}} the English who had started whaling. The Netherlands stated that whaling could not be the basis for claiming sovereignty. The issue ended in a political deadlock, with Denmark–Norway and England both claiming sovereignty and France, the Netherlands and Spain claiming the archipelago a free zone under mare liberum. Although Denmark–Norway never formally gave up its claim to Svalbard, the archipelago continued to be a terra nullius—a land without a government.|$|E
5|$|The missionaries {{introduced}} a musical form of chant into Britain, {{similar to that}} used in Rome during the mass. During the 7th and 8th centuries Canterbury was renowned for the excellence of its clergy's chanting, and sent singing masters to instruct others, including two to Wilfrid, who became Bishop of York. Putta, the first Bishop of Rochester, had a reputation for his skill at chanting, which he was said to have learned from the Gregorian missionaries. One of them, James the Deacon, taught chanting in Northumbria after Paulinus returned to Kent; Bede noted <b>that</b> <b>James</b> was accomplished in the singing of the chants.|$|E

5|$|The {{reaction}} against the king {{at the general}} council had shown Atholl <b>that</b> <b>James</b> was {{not only on the}} back-foot but his political standing had received a huge set-back and may have convinced the earl that James's death was now a viable course of action. Atholl had seen how assertive action by two of his brothers at different times had allowed them {{to take control of the}} kingdom and that as James's nearest adult relative, the earl must have considered that decisive intervention on his part at this time could prove to be equally successful.|$|E
5|$|When first {{described}} by the naturalist George Perry in 1810, the brolga was misclassified as a species of Ardea, the genus that includes the herons and egrets. It {{is in fact a}} member of the Gruiformes—the order that includes the crakes, rails, and cranes, {{and a member of the}} genus Antigone. The ornithologist John Gould used the name Grus australasianus when he wrote about it and noted it to be widespread in the north and east of Australia. He also recorded that it was easy to tame, and <b>that</b> <b>James</b> Macarthur had kept a pair at his home in Camden. Calling it the Australian Crane, he mentioned that its early colonial name had been Native Companion. The Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union made brolga, a popular name derived from Gamilaraay burralga, the official name for the bird in 1926.|$|E
