5|$|Navarro stated, on 21 August 2010, {{that the}} case was stagnating because an {{official}} interpreter was unable to be found for the case in Peru. The Peruvian association of translators and interpreters and the Dutch embassy both separately stated {{at the time that}} they have been unable to locate one to officially translate Spanish into Dutch. Unlike Aruba and the United States, Peru does not guarantee the right to a speedy trial. On 6 September, a Peruvian appeals court voted 2 to 1 to reject Van der Sloot's motion that he is being unlawfully held. Because 3 votes are required for a decision, if a fourth judge voted in Van der Sloot's favor, a fifth judge would be required to break the tie. Peruvian statutes permit a suspect to be detained for up to 18 months for interrogation, though Navarro expressed skepticism <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officers would do so with his client.|$|E
5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular {{gathering}} place {{in the basement of}} a Harlem tenement. He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E
5|$|The SS {{established}} {{a police state}} within Nazi Germany, using the secret state police and security forces under Himmler's control to suppress resistance to Hitler. In his role as Minister President of Prussia, Hermann Göring had in 1933 created a Prussian secret police force, the Geheime Staatspolizei or Gestapo, and appointed Rudolf Diels as its head. Concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract {{the power of the}} SA, Göring handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934. Also on that date, in a departure from long-standing German practice <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> was a state and local matter, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. Himmler named his deputy and protégé Reinhard Heydrich chief of the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Heydrich also continued as head of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; security service).|$|E

25|$|The book is {{primarily}} {{designed for use}} by counterterrorism and law enforcement officials. Terrorist Recognition Handbook is structured into six main sections of information and resources.

Nance's main thesis throughout the work is <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials must remain vigilant for potential terrorist activities. He compares and contrasts the field of counterterrorism to ordinary criminal prevention, noting that in both cases law enforcement officials should become experts on developing awareness of commons behavior patterns of suspects.|$|E

The search involved extensive internet keyword searches, reviews of paper publications and field observation. In consultation with other researchers the list was reviewed and analyzed for classification.

The resulting typology may be used as a basis for further research in the area of <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> organizational behavior, policy development and program implementation.

25|$|Trafficante {{was born}} in Tampa, Florida, to Sicilian parents Santo Trafficante Sr. and his wife Maria Giuseppa Cacciatore in 1914. He {{dropped out of high}} school before the 10th grade.

U.S. Treasury Department documents indicate <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> believed Trafficante's legitimate business interests to included several legal casinos in Cuba; a Havana drive-in movie theater; and shares in several restaurants and bars in Trafficante's hometown of Tampa, Florida. He was rumored to be part of a Mafia syndicate which owned many Cuban hotels and casinos. As one of the most powerful mobsters in the U.S., Trafficante was invited to the Havana Conference in December 1946.|$|E
25|$|Nance {{provides}} {{a discussion on}} suicide attacks, and stresses that in most cases those who commit suicide by bombing other individuals are generally not psychotic in nature. He emphasizes that these individuals {{are for the most}} part logical and smart people with extremist religious viewpoints. While not attempting to explain their acts, Nance notes it is crucial to comprehend terrorists' thought processes so <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials may attempt to anticipate them. The book goes over common tactics used by clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents. Nance notes such organizations are a key component to terror operations, and require additional study. He gives forth an analysis of different types of clandestine cell systems, explaining common methodologies, covert communication methods, and from where they recruit their agents.|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia {{argued that}} the Court thought the {{precedent}} established in the Gerstein case in regards to issues associated with warrantless arrests {{was more than enough}} in determining when probable cause is determined for suspects.

Finally, Justice Scalia argued that the Court’s further interpretation of the Gerstein case to mandate <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> must determine probable cause in a set amount of time was unnecessary; he felt that it was completely unrelated to clearing arrest-related administrative affairs or assigning a judge to the suspect’s case. He also felt that the probable cause determination for suspects arrested without a warrant should be less strict.|$|E

25|$|Assistant Attorney General John Doar {{and former}} Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, {{representing}} President Lyndon Johnson, went to Selma {{to meet with}} King and others at Richie Jean Jackson's house and privately urged King to postpone the march.

Collins suggested to King that he make a symbolic witness at the bridge, then turn around and lead the marchers back to Selma. King told them that he would try to enact the plan provided that Collins could ensure <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> would not attack them.

25|$|The Supreme Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> {{officers}} {{may enter}} a house without knocking {{if they have}} “a reasonable suspicion” that announcing their presence would be dangerous or allow a suspect to destroy evidence (for example, by flushing drugs down the toilet). In addition, rules on civil asset forfeiture allow law enforcement officers to seize anything which they can plausibly claim was the proceeds of a crime. The property-owner need not be convicted of that crime; if officers find drugs in a house, they can take cash {{from the house and}} possibly the house itself. Commentators have said these rules provide an incentive for law enforcement officers to focus on drug-related crimes rather than rape and murder investigations. They also provide an incentive to arrest suspected drug-dealers inside their houses, which can be seized, and to raid stash houses after most of their drugs have been sold, when officers can seize the cash.|$|E

On June 10, 1969, Dippolito was sentenced to five years for each charge (10 years total). A $10,000 bond allowed him to remain free pending appeal of his conviction. It was during this time <b>that</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> recognized him as the underboss of the Los Angeles family. On April 16, 1971, his sentence was reduced from ten to five years by Judge Warren J. Ferguson and he started serving his sentence. On December 13, 1971, Dippolito was paroled after only serving eight months. Joe Dip was released after San Bernardino mayor Al C. Ballard, Police Chief Louis J. Fortuna, and California Superior Court Judge Joseph A. Katz vouched for Dippolito in letters written in 1969 to a probation officer.|$|E
