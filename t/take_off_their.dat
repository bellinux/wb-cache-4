5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air {{supremacy}} in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in Rotte strength only, often jettisoning their bombs {{at the first}} sight of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough fuel to cover the Ju 87s on <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> <b>their</b> most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{two people}} fencing <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> masks, which reveal {{them to be}} Madonna and her doppelgänger {{surprised}} to see each other; they resume their violent fighting. The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall. Different artifacts from the Bond films {{are present in the}} room and the two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an electric chair.|$|E
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E

5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts in a long time.|$|E
25|$|Some Dutch {{fans were}} forced to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> {{trousers}} branded with the logo of Bavaria beer, as Budweiser was the official beer of the tournament. Rather than leave the stadium, they proceeded to watch the match in their underclothes.|$|E
25|$|Their {{ultimate}} stunt is {{arranging for}} nearly 1000 women in Rothwell, Northamptonshire {{to have their}} bust measured professionally, complemented by receiving free correctly-fitting bras. Trinny, Susannah and the 1000 participants then <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> tops in public, revealing their new bras and ultimately disposing of their old bras in public, emphasizing the importance of wearing the correct bra size. The results find that 976 out of the 1000 women, averaging at about 90%, actually had the wrong size bra.|$|E

25|$|Hundreds {{of local}} people, mostly young men, were arrested. They {{were made to}} <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> shirts and lie on the ground. Their hands were tied behind their backs. Later that afternoon, they were thrown by {{soldiers}} into trucks {{to be taken to}} the Ingkayutthaboriharn army camp in the nearby province of Pattani. The prisoners were stacked five or six deep in the trucks, {{and by the time the}} trucks reached their destination five hours later, in the heat of the day, 78 men had died of suffocation.|$|E
25|$|As Penn became homeless, {{he began}} to live with Quaker families. Quakers were {{relatively}} strict Christians in the 17th century. They refused to bow or <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> hats to social superiors, believing all men equal under God, a belief antithetical to an absolute monarchy which believed the monarch divinely appointed by God. Therefore, Quakers were treated as heretics because of their principles and their failure to pay tithes. They also refused to swear oaths of loyalty to the King. Quakers followed the command of Jesus not to swear. The basic ceremony of Quakerism is silent worship in a meeting house, conducted in a group. There was no ritual and no professional clergy, and many Quakers disavowed the concept of original sin. God's communication comes to each individual directly, and if so moved, the individual shares their revelations, thoughts or opinions with the group. Penn found all these tenets to sit well with his conscience and his heart.|$|E
25|$|Empty shoes {{may also}} symbolize death. In Greek culture, empty shoes are the {{equivalent}} of the American funeral wreath. For example, empty shoes placed outside of a Greek home would tell others that the family's son has died in battle. At an observation memorializing the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, 3,000 pairs of empty shoes were used to recognize those killed. The Shoes on the Danube Bank is a memorial in Budapest, Hungary. Conceived by film director Can Togay, he created it on the east bank of the Danube River with sculptor Gyula Pauer to honor the Jews who were killed by fascist Arrow Cross militiamen in Budapest during World War II. They were ordered to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> shoes, and were shot {{at the edge of the}} water so that their bodies fell into the river and were carried away. The memorial represents their shoes left behind on the bank.|$|E

25|$|Bernhardt made {{a two-year}} world tour (1891–1893) to {{replenish}} her finances. Upon returning to Paris, she paid 700,000 francs for the Théâtre de la Renaissance, and from 1893 until 1899, was its artistic director and lead actress. She managed {{every aspect of}} the theater, from the finances to the lighting, sets, and costumes, as well as appearing in eight performances a week. She imposed a rule that women in the audience, no matter how wealthy or famous, had to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> hats during performances, so the rest of the audience could see, and eliminated the prompter's box from the stage, declaring that actors should know their lines. She abolished in her theater the common practice of hiring claqueurs in the audience to applaud stars. She used the new technology of lithography to produce vivid color posters, and in 1894, she hired Czech artist Alphonse Mucha to design {{the first of a series}} of posters for her play Gismonda. He continued to make posters of her for six years.|$|E

But not Irving Crane." [...] Rudolph Wanderone, a/k/a Minnesota Fats, once opined, [...] "Irv Crane would have been the only guy to notice the horse under Lady Godiva," [...] while professional rival Willie Mosconi who had criticized Crane for his cautious style, stated in his 1993 autobiography, Willie's Game, that [...] "Crane wouldn't take a shot unless his grandmother could make it." ...|$|E
500|$|The clip {{starts with}} Muñiz texting Stan, with both in {{different}} rooms. Following this, the singers put on virtual reality equipment and are seen virtually walking together through the city, {{sitting on a}} bench, simulating a kiss, riding bikes and eating at a restaurant. During the last scene of the video, Stan throws Muñiz on the bed before both <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> virtual reality glasses and gloves. The clip received positive response, with Raluca Tanasă from InfoMusic writing that it [...] "showcases the manifestation of love in a virtual way". Currinn of CelebMix stated, [...] "On first watch, the viewers are captured by {{the beauty of the}} artists; so much so, that you don’t even realise that they're in different cities during the virtual reality scenes. It's such a sweet and adorable concept, enough to prove that long distance can completely work out between couples if this could actually happen".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{reaction from}} newspaper critics. In the Liverpool Echo, Rachael Tinniswood {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "was a fantastic display of everything that has made Cold Feet such a popular drama {{over the past few}} years" [...] and that Kimberley Joseph had proved to be [...] "a more than adequate replacement" [...] for Fay Ripley {{over the course of the}} fourth series. Tony Purnell wrote in the Daily Mirror that [...] "The fact that the gang ended up in Australia showed just how much the series had lost its way." [...] Graham Young in the Birmingham Mail wrote that the excursion to Sydney [...] "smacks more of giving the cast a treat after four years, rather than any real necessity of the script". The Daily Records critic wrote [...] "if this is the last-ever episode, we should make the most of what has been a relatively disappointing series". In a column about Chewin' the Fat, Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the episode—"which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot"—of being the point the series jumped the shark. Times columnist Caitlin Moran described it as [...] "both draining and tensifying". Moran went on to say that Adam and Rachel had become poorly characterised and suggested that Mike Bullen had come to loathe the characters. The episode was selected as a [...] "pick of the day" [...] in The Sun and The Sunday Times. Writing in the Journal of British Cinema and Television in 2006, Greg M. Smith analysed the development of the David character over the course of Series 4, including the fantasy scene in this episode where David imagines living with Karen in Australia, and the scene where David and Karen <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> wedding rings: [...] "Old, exhausted love is traded for new, vibrant love in this single gesture. Karen pursues David as he storms off after the ceremony, shouting his name, undoubtedly ready to alternate once more between pain and partial forgiveness, as they have done throughout their marriage. David turns and says: 'No, Karen. No more'." [...] Smith also compared the scene to the wedding scene in the film The Best Years of Our Lives (William Wyler, 1946).|$|E

If a man recognizes Kuroki in his wife or girlfriend, he is forced to strip it off {{in order to deal}} with her. That's how I liberate both sexes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brocius {{was known}} for a mean sense of humor when drunk.

2500|$|Most actors {{had contact}} before filming with the {{individuals}} {{they were to}} portray, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site. Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: [...] "We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down {{a vast number of}} characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But I still think it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this." [...] As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.|$|E
