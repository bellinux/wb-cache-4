50|$|Many {{of these}} {{companies}} have since merged; {{by the end of}} 2000, there were only three of <b>the</b> original <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> left in <b>the</b> United States. After the 1984 breakup, part of AT&T Corp.'s Bell Labs was split off into Bellcore, which would serve as an R&D and standards body for <b>the</b> seven <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b> In 1997, Bellcore was acquired by Science Applications International Corporation where it became a wholly owned subsidiary and was renamed Telcordia.|$|R
2500|$|The {{addition}} of Qwest allowed CenturyLink {{to become the}} third largest telecommunications company in the United States, and the largest landline phone provider {{in the state of}} Colorado. [...] The new company has 17 million access lines, 5 million broadband customers, and 1.4 million video subscribers across 37 states. The merger also made CenturyLink owner of one of <b>the</b> so-called <b>Baby</b> Bells: Qwest included what was once US West, <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell</b> for much of the western United States.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a process}} of selling an asset. The largest and likely the most famous {{corporate}} divestiture in history was the 1984 U.S. Department of Justice-mandated breakup of the Bell System into AT&T and <b>the</b> seven <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Most {{local loop}} service to homes is {{provided}} through old-fashioned copper wire, {{although many of}} <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> are beginning to upgrade the so-called [...] "last mile" [...] to fiber optic.|$|E
5000|$|... Verizon is one {{of three}} {{companies}} that had their roots in <b>the</b> former <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b> <b>The</b> other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell</b> members. One, SBC Communications, bought out the Bells former parent AT&T Corporation and assumed the AT&T name. The other, CenturyLink, was formed initially in 2011 by the acquisition of Qwest (formerly named US West).

2500|$|Although [...] "Southwestern Bell" [...] {{generally}} {{referred to}} the operations of <b>the</b> entire <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell,</b> in 1995, SBC decided to change its corporate name to SBC Communications in order to reposition itself as a national telecommunications company. Southwestern Bell Telephone underwent a branding overhaul and adopted the slogan, [...] "Your friendly neighborhood global telecommunications company." [...] The slogan was later shortened to, [...] "Friendly. Neighborhood. Global." ...|$|R
50|$|MediaOne Group, Inc. (Comcast MO Group, Inc.) {{was created}} by US WEST Inc's, one of <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> Regional Bell Operating Companies, acquisition of Boston-based Continental Cable and combined with its previously acquired Atlanta-based Wometco/GTC. Wometco/GTC company had adopted the MediaOne name a year earlier. Media One Group was acquired in 2000 by AT&T Broadband, and was subsequently acquired by Comcast in 2002.|$|R
50|$|AT&T Labs also traces {{its origin}} to Southwestern Bell Technology Resources, Inc. (SWB TRI) {{which was founded}} in 1988 as the R&D arm of Southwestern Bell Corporation. It had no {{connection}} to Bellcore, the R&D organization owned equally by all of <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tele-TV was {{originally}} intended to feed programming content to the video systems <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> were planning in the early 1990s, but the venture {{lost much of its}} Bell company support when the 1996 Telecommunications Act distracted them with the possibility of a much more lucrative revenue stream - long-distance service.|$|E
50|$|Following the Telecommunications Act of 1996, AT&T Communications began {{reselling}} Bell Operating Company-provided {{telephone service}} at lower prices {{to compete with}} <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b> Their names were: Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell, and US West.The advertising campaign which had a broad appeal was named AT&T CallVantage.|$|E

50|$|The {{design is}} {{reminiscent}} of a small-scale Bell 47 helicopter. In fact, the helicopter was originally called <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> Belle, but <b>Bell</b> Helicopters objected and the name was changed to Safari.|$|R
50|$|CompuServe, and its outside {{telecommunications}} attorney, Randy May, led {{the appeals}} before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to exempt data networks {{from having to}} pay the Common Carrier Access Charge (CCAC) that was levied by the telephone Local Exchange Carriers (primarily <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell</b> companies) on long distance carriers. The primary argument was that data networking was a brand new industry, and {{the country would be}} better served by not exposing this important new industry to the aberrations of the voice telephone economics (the CCAC is the mechanism used to subsidize the cost of local telephone service from long distance revenue). The FCC agreed with CompuServe's position, and the consequence is that all dial-up networking in the United States, whether on private networks or the public Internet, is much less expensive than it otherwise would have been.|$|R
5000|$|Landline {{telephone}} service {{continues to be}} divided between incumbent local exchange carriers and several competing long distance companies. As of 2005, some of <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> are beginning to merge with long distance phone companies. A small number of consumers are currently experimenting with Voice over Internet Protocol phone service.|$|E
5000|$|Since AT&T was {{required}} to divest the Bell logo and trademark to <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells,</b> American Bell was renamed AT&T Information Systems on January 1, 1984. The business unit, American Bell Advanced Information Systems, was absorbed into AT&T Network Systems, while American Bell Consumer Products, renamed AT&T Consumer Products, became a unit of AT&T Technologies.|$|E
50|$|Local {{calls are}} defined as calls {{originating}} and terminating within a local access and transport area (LATA) which {{is defined by the}} Federal Communications Commission. All <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells,</b> as well as other LECs, typically operate businesses in more than one LATA yet their services of local telephone calls are still defined by LATA boundaries, not their business areas.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{following}} the liberalisation of the strict regulations governing {{the provision of}} cable television in the UK, Oyston (through Oyston Cable Communications Group Limited) won, and started to develop, six of the government-granted monopoly broadband franchises, issued by the newly established Cable Authority and covering almost 700,000 households and businesses in the Northwest of England. In 1990, when <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell</b> operating companies saw an opportunity to use cable telephony to gain {{a foothold in the}} UK's telecommunication market, Southwestern Bell acquired a majority 80% stake in the Oyston Cable Communications Group. Oyston's remaining 18% holding was also bought by Southwestern Bell, for £2.99 million, in 1991 (a Statutory Instrument dictated that the remaining 2% holding in Oyston Cable had been vested in Liverpool City Council, on behalf of all the local councils covered by the Oyston franchise areas.) ...|$|R
25|$|AT was not <b>the</b> first <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell</b> to {{sell off}} rural landlines. Ameritech sold some of its Wisconsin lines to CenturyTel in 1998; BellSouth sold some of its lines to MebTel in the 2000s; U S WEST sold many {{historically}} Bell landlines to Lynch Communications and Pacific Telecom in the 1990s; Verizon sold many of its New England lines to FairPoint in 2008 and its West Virginia operations to Frontier Communications in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, U S WEST became <b>the</b> first <b>Baby</b> <b>Bell</b> to {{have its}} {{different}} Bell Operating Companies carry on business under a single name. U S WEST Communications became a [...] "d/b/a" [...] name for Mountain Bell as well as Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell; however, the three companies remained legally separate. The three companies also began using the U S WEST Communications logo, which continued to include the Bell symbol.|$|R
50|$|Often, {{in large}} LATAs, {{there is also}} a class known by the oxymoronic name local long-distance, which refers to calls within the {{customers}} LATA but outside their local calling area. This area is normally served by the customers local telephone provider, which is usually one of <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells,</b> despite attempts by some CLECs to compete in the local telephone market.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the breakup}} of the Bell system in 1984, the US federal {{government}} imposed rules to allow <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> and other long-distance providers to compete via [...] "equal access." [...] Equal access allows telephone subscribers to choose an authorized telephone company or companies to handle their local toll and long-distance toll (including international) calls from their traditional, wireline telephones.|$|E
50|$|Frontier West Virginia was {{the first}} Bell Operating Company to have been {{completely}} divested by a Baby Bell and sold to a non-Baby Bell. Some historically Bell local access lines have been sold to non-Baby Bells {{over the years by}} BellSouth, US West, and Verizon; however, the Bell Operating Companies from which those exchanges were split have remained in existence with <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the US the 1982 anti-trust {{break-up}} of AT&T {{resulted in}} a number of smaller telephone companies called <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells.</b> Following this <b>the</b> Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 prohibited telephone companies from providing video services within their operating regions. In 1993 the National Communication and Information Infrastructure (NII) was proposed and passed by the US House and senate, thus opening the way for <b>the</b> seven <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell and U S WEST to implement VOD systems. All of these companies and others began holding trials to set up systems for supplying video on demand over telephone and cable lines.|$|R
50|$|What {{eventually}} became Verizon was founded as Bell Atlantic, {{which was one}} of <b>the</b> seven <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells</b> that were formed after AT&T Corporation was forced to relinquish its control of the Bell System by order of the Justice Department of the United States. Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&P Telephone).|$|R
50|$|In 1983, Nisenholtz joined Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide {{where he}} founded the Interactive Marketing Group (IMG), the first full-service {{interactive}} unit at a major US advertising agency. He guided the firm's interactive strategy and operations for 11 years until his departure in 1994, at which {{time he was a}} senior vice president {{and a member of the}} operating committee. He then worked for one year as director of content strategy for Ameritech Corporation, one of <b>the</b> so-called <b>Baby</b> <b>Bells,</b> where he was responsible for guiding development of new video programming, interactive information and advertising services.|$|R
