5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a Harpoon Missile, {{a booster}} propelled <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been given}} top {{priority}} by the Air Force, {{the first flight}} test of the Bold Orion missile was conducted on May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched the Bold Orion vehicle {{at the apex of}} a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> itself, allowed <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistan Air Force retaliated {{for these}} attacks by bombing Okha harbour scoring direct hits on {{fuelling}} facilities for missile boats, an ammunition dump, and <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> boats' jetty. The Indian Navy anticipated this attack {{and had already}} moved <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> boats to other locations to prevent any losses.

5|$|All {{agreements}} {{were not}} actually {{made in the}} North Atlantic Council meeting, {{but in fact it}} was made in Istanbul Summit, 2003, except for the signing of <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> defense contract which happened on 28 November. The Council meeting was held on 29 November.|$|E
5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. <b>The</b> <b>missile</b> was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as soon as it became visible. A transponder in <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> could respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E
5|$|Testing {{then moved}} to Kwajalein. The first test on 21 March 1963 failed when the MTR failed to lock onto <b>the</b> <b>missile.</b> A second on 19 April also failed when the missile's {{tracking}} beacon failed 30 seconds before intercept. The third test, this time using an actual target consisting of an Agena-D upper stage equipped with a Zeus miss-distance transmitter, was carried out on 24 May 1963, and was a complete success. From that point until 1964, one DM-15S was kept {{in a state of}} instant readiness and teams continually trained on <b>the</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E

During <b>the</b> Cuban <b>Missile</b> Crisis in October 1962, 59 of <b>the</b> <b>missiles,</b> with their W49 [...] thermonuclear warheads, {{were brought to}} operational readiness. <b>The</b> Thor <b>missile</b> force was disbanded in 1963, and <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> were returned to the United States, where most were expended in military space shots.|$|R
50|$|On 1 December 1959, the {{squadron}} reformed at RAF North Luffenham in Rutland, equipped with three Thor Intermediate-range ballistic <b>missiles,</b> supplied by <b>the</b> United States under Project Emily. <b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> were operated under a dual key system, with the British {{in control of}} the launch sequence, and the Americans responsible for arming <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> nuclear warhead, giving each nation a veto on using <b>the</b> <b>missiles.</b> <b>The</b> squadron, {{along with the rest of}} the Thor force, was brought to full readiness during <b>the</b> Cuban <b>Missile</b> Crisis. <b>The</b> squadron disbanded on 23 August 1963.|$|R
5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced inertial guidance system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control. <b>The</b> <b>missile</b> was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} serious study on attacking {{ballistic}} missiles with interceptor missiles {{was carried out}} by the Army Air Force in 1946, when two contracts were sent out as Project Wizard and Project Thumper to consider the problem of shooting down missiles of the V-2 type. These projects identified the main problem being one of detection; the target could approach from anywhere within of hundreds of miles, and reached their targets in only five minutes. Existing radar systems would have difficulty seeing <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> launch at those ranges, and even assuming one had detected <b>the</b> <b>missile,</b> existing command and control arrangements would have serious problems forwarding that information to the battery in time for them to attack. The task appeared impossible at that time.|$|E
5|$|After launch, <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> was guided {{towards the}} target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. <b>The</b> <b>missile</b> flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
50|$|No {{particular}} maneuvers {{are required}} by <b>the</b> ship; <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> are capable of changing course after the launch up to 200° so all <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> in <b>the</b> ship could be used against the same target in one attack.|$|R

Although {{not covered by the}} treaty, West Germany agreed unilaterally to the removal of <b>the</b> Pershing 1a <b>missiles</b> from its inventory in 1991, and <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> were destroyed in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Derrickson {{was fascinated}} by color schemes. He chose blue-green and orange as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still. <b>The</b> <b>missile</b> silo {{converted}} by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray and orange, which was inspired by an image of lava flowing through a gray field. Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film, and rendered the colors in post-production {{to make them more}} subtle, for realism.|$|E
5|$|Gun {{armament}} of {{the class}} consists of two Bofors /70 Mk1 gun mounted on the bow and towards the stern. During the development phase, the designers planned on using French Exocet anti-ship missiles as the class's main weapon system. However, due to the high price the French asked for <b>the</b> <b>missile,</b> possibly because of political reasons, the project was changed and two Soviet P-20 (SS-N-2B) were used instead. Self-defense measures include two Wallop Barricade chaff launchers.|$|E

Enraged, Rhoemer engages Gabe in a final fight, but is killed with a gas grenade.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> were {{intended}} {{to be used in}} salvos; a submarine could launch eight in rapid succession, maintaining control of each through a separate datalink. In flight the group could co-ordinate their actions; one would fly to a higher altitude and use its active radar to search for targets, forwarding this data to <b>the</b> other <b>missiles</b> which remained at low altitude. <b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> were programmed so that half of a salvo would head for a carrier target, with the rest dividing between other ships. If <b>the</b> high-flying <b>missile</b> was shot down, another from the salvo would automatically pop up to take its place. All of <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> would switch to active radar for the terminal phase of the attack.|$|R

According to IRGC, the strike {{targeted}} ISIL [...] "command centers, gatherings, logistic sites and factories of suicide car bombs". This became Iran's first operational use of mid-range <b>missiles</b> since <b>the</b> Iran-Iraq War. <b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> reportedly were of Zolfaghar type (upgraded Fateh-110 with a longer range and optional cluster munition warhead), with a reported range of 750 km.

5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead {{while it was still}} far enough away to give <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the state of the art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.|$|E

5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of <b>the</b> <b>missile.</b> Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
