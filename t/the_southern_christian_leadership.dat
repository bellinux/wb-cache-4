Led by Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, Fred Shuttlesworth and others, the campaign of nonviolent direct action culminated in widely publicized confrontations between young black students and white civic authorities, and eventually led the municipal government to change the city's discrimination laws.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{was born}} in New Orleans, Louisiana; his parents were leaders in the African American community. Ford {{attended}} Wayne State University and Grambling State University, from which he was expelled in 1969 before graduating for leading civil rights demonstrations. He was expelled by the university, despite it being historically black, because it relied on public funds which were controlled by a state government opposed to desegregation. Ford {{was a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference staff from 1966 to 1972 and worked for Martin Luther King, Jr. as a member of an advance team of the Poor People's Campaign.

Ford worked as a car salesman and later became a full-time legislator. Ford is a lifelong bachelor.|$|E

50|$|Jackson {{was based}} in Chicago and was a close ally of Mayor Richard J.

5|$|In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, {{and other}} {{civil rights activists}} founded <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral {{authority}} and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests {{in the service of}} civil rights reform. One of the group's inspirations was the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King after he attended a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience. Other civil rights leaders involved in the SCLC with King included: James Bevel, Allen Johnson, Curtis W. Harris, Walter E. Fauntroy, C. T.

2500|$|The genre's role in {{exploring}} and shaping {{race relations in}} the US has been controversial.

5000|$|According to the Church Committee:While the {{declared}} {{purposes of}} these programs were to protect the [...] "national security" [...] or prevent violence, Bureau witnesses admit {{that many of the}} targets were nonviolent and most had no connections with a foreign power.

The Socialist Workers Party program included non-SWP sponsors of anti-war demonstrations which were cosponsored by the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance, its youth group. The Black Nationalist program targeted a range of organizations from the Panthers to SNCC to <b>the</b> peaceful <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference, and included every Black Student Union and many other black student groups.

25|$|New {{organizations}} such as <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) rose up with different approaches to activism.

25|$|With {{civil rights}} {{activity}} blocked by Judge Hare's injunction, Frederick Douglas Reese requested {{the assistance of}} King and <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference (SCLC).

2500|$|In 2001, the foundation's {{efforts to}} build the {{memorial}} were stalled because Intellectual Properties Management Inc., an organization operated by King's family, wanted the foundation to pay licensing fees to use his name and likeness in marketing campaigns.

U.S. Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., {{who was a member}} of the SCLC's board, forced Rustin's resignation from the SCLC in 1960 by threatening to discuss Rustin's morals charge in Congress.

5000|$|The Freedom Rides of 1961 were {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} Gandhian campaign. After four months without a decision on desegregated busing from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), James Forman, Executive Secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), led a delegation of nonviolent picketers to Monroe to work with Robert F. Williams. (Freedom Riders in Anniston, Alabama, had already benefitted from the protection of an armed group led by Colonel Stone Johnson). The Monroe Freedom Riders were brutally assaulted while picketing city hall, but were rescued by Williams and his group, who proceeded to exchange gunfire with white supremacist civilians and police. Numerous Freedom Riders have expressed gratitude to Williams for saving their lives that day. The ICC decided in the Freedom Riders’ favor less than {{one month after the}} Monroe conflict. In 1962, Freedom Rider John Lowry publicly praised Williams and proclaimed that nonviolent action could not be successful without a [...] "threat of violence." [...] Other civil rights figures who praised Robert F. William’s contribution to the movement included Rosa Parks, Julian Bond, Howard Zinn, Stanley Levison, and Ella Baker.

5000|$|The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s {{was highly}} {{controversial}} in many black churches, where the minister preached spiritual salvation rather than political activism. The National Baptist Convention became deeply split; Jackson had supported the Montgomery bus boycott of 1956, but by 1960 {{he told his}} denomination they should not become involved in civil rights activism. Jackson was based in Chicago and was a close ally of Mayor Richard J. Daley and the Chicago Democratic machine against the efforts of Martin Luther King, Jr.. In the end, Jackson prevailed. Yet, surprisingly, it was a former son of Olivet by J. H. Jackson L. Venchael Booth, whom Jackson would later install as pastor of First Baptist Church of Gary in September 1944, who issued the founding call for what became a rival group, Progressive National Baptist Convention. The PNBC became the [...] "household {{of the civil rights}} movement among Black Baptists," [...] and the frontline supporters of the extensive activism of <b>the</b> King's <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference.
