25|$|At 20:22 UTC, Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 {{arrived in}} Toronto twelve minutes late. Some of the {{passengers}} and baggage, including the bag Singh had checked in, were transferred to Air India Flight 182. In response to threats from Sikh activists, Air India had requested extra security, leading Canada to assign extra policemen in terminals in Toronto and Montreal, and all baggage was to be checked by X-ray or by hand. But after the x-ray machine broke down that day, inspectors used a portable PDD-4 explosive sniffer. An Air India security officer had demonstrated that it made a loud scream when a lit match was held an inch away, and showed {{that it should be}} used {{around the edge of the}} bag being tested. Between 5:15 and 6:00, the sniffer was heard <b>to</b> <b>beep</b> at a soft-sided maroon suitcase with a zipper going all around; it beeped in a low volume near the zipper lock. But Air India was not informed since checkers were not instructed on how to react to only a short beep, so they allowed the bag to pass on its way. Later investigation would determine that the two containers that could have contained M. Singh's bag were placed close to the sensitive electronic bay of the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Can we assign {{attitudes to}} a {{computer}} based on its beeps?-Toward an effective method for making humans empathize with artificial agents Can we assign attitudes {{to a computer}} based on its beeps? If so, which kinds of beeps are perceived as specific attitudes, such as “disagreement”, “hesitation” or “agreement”? To examine this issue, I carried out an experiment to observe how participants perceive or assign an attitude to a computer according <b>to</b> <b>beeps</b> of different durations and F 0 contour’s slopes. The results revealed that 1) beeps with increasing intonation regardless of duration were perceived by participants as “disagreement”, 2) flat sounds with longer duration were interpreted as “hesitation”, and 3) decreasing intonations with shorter duration were as “agreement. ”...|$|R

Data informing this article are based on 76 qualitative interviews with university students and recent graduates who are currently employed, and the results indicate that beeping practices are embedded in sociocultural, normative, gender patterns. The data also show that beeping is a multilayered exercise that each individual at some social-relational level engages in: It is the relationship <b>to</b> the <b>beep</b> recipient that negotiates this practice.

As a result, Adventures of the Road Runner was released theatrically alongside the live-action film Lad: A Dog, and was subsequently split into three further shorts.

DePatie completed the task by December 1963. Although Chuck Jones was fired in early 1962, he helped DePatie's task by directing four more cartoons with his former unit. The cartoons were Hare-Breadth Hurry, Mad as a Mars Hare, Transylvania 6-5000 and <b>To</b> <b>Beep</b> or Not <b>to</b> <b>Beep.</b> The final project at the studio was making the animated sequences, directed by McKimson, for the 1964 Warner Bros. feature The Incredible Mr. Limpet. With the studio closed, Hal Seeger Productions in New York had to be contracted to produce the opening and closing credits for The Porky Pig Show, which debuted on ABC in 1964. This marked one of the first times that the Looney Tunes characters were animated outside of the Los Angeles area.|$|E
50|$|The COMT Val158Met {{polymorphism}} {{also has}} a pleiotropic effect on emotional processing.Furthermore, the polymorphism {{has been shown to}} affect ratings of subjective well-being. When 621 women were measured with experience sample monitoring, which is similar to mood assessment as response <b>to</b> <b>beeping</b> watch, the met/met form confers double the subjective mental sensation of well-being {{from a wide variety of}} daily events. The ability to experience reward increased with the number of ‘Met’ alleles. Also, the effect of different genotype was greater for events that were felt as more pleasant. The effect size of genotypic moderation was quite large: Subjects with the val/val genotype generated almost similar amounts of subjective well-being from a ‘very pleasant event’ as met/met subjects did from a ‘bit pleasant event’. Genetic variation with functional impact on cortical dopamine tone has a strong influence on reward experience in the flow of daily life. In one study participants with the met/met phenotype described an increase of positive affect twice as high in amplitude as participants with the val/val phenotype following very pleasant or pleasant events.|$|R
