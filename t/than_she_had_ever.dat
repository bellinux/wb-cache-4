5|$|As one of {{the last}} {{remaining}} major poets of the Silver Age, she was newly acclaimed by the Soviet authorities as a fine and loyal representative of their country and permitted to travel. At the same time, by virtue of works such as Requiem, Akhmatova was being hailed at home and abroad as an unofficial leader of the dissident movement, and reinforcing this image herself. She was becoming representative of both the Soviet Union and Tsarist Russia, more popular in the 1960s <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been before the revolution, this reputation only continuing to grow after her death. For her 75th birthday in 1964, new collections of her verse were published.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{completion}} of the conversion work, West Alsek was taken out for trials over two passes on a [...] course on 19 June. Representatives from the USSB, the Navy Department, the United States Coast Guard, the Cunard Line, and Todd and other shipbuilders were on board—some 125 guests in all.

Her father then gave her everything, because {{he used to}} spend his capital. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> nothing but the crumbs of that feast to live on, and she doesn't really know how meagre they are--she has yet to learn it. My mother has {{told me all about}} it. Isabel will learn it when she's really thrown upon the world, and it would be very painful to me to think of her coming to the {{consciousness}} of a lot of wants she should be unable to satisfy." ...|$|R
50|$|Louise Ellis later visits Charlotte at rehab {{when she}} {{believes}} Victoria to have died. Charlotte tells {{her that she}} wants {{nothing to do with}} her mother's funeral, but that Louise is welcome to plan it. Louise begs her to attend, and Charlotte responds that she is healthier and happier <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been. Charlotte promises to let Louise into Victoria's penthouse hotel room if the latter stops calling her.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} Jem, a {{reference}} to To Kill a Mockingbird. Ann and Rae {{fall in love with}} him. Jem helps Ann see there is more to the world than merely what is found in stories and books. He helps her wake up to the reality of her surroundings and see more <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> seen before, even more than he could realize he had helped open her eyes to see.|$|R
500|$|Corpses swell as gases from {{decomposition}} {{accumulate in}} the torso {{and the increased}} pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look [...] "plump", [...] "well-fed", and [...] "ruddy"—changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life. In the Arnold Paole case, an old woman's exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> looked in life. The exuding blood gave {{the impression that the}} corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would {{listen to what the}} people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue {{at the drop of a}} hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E
2500|$|In November 1971, Genie {{displayed}} {{an ability}} to change pitch and volume while singing {{that she had never}} demonstrated in her speech. Around a week after the first time she sang, while on a trip to the hospital, Curtiss improvised a song to calm Genie down and Genie again surprised her by singing along; Curtiss especially noticed that Genie sang the word [...] "hospital" [...] far louder <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> spoken. Almost a year after moving in with the Riglers, while David Rigler was examining and cleaning her ear, Genie uttered the only recorded scream of her lifetime. The scientists did not know why she had screamed on that particular occasion, or why they never heard her do so again.|$|E

That night, Florence says that <b>she</b> is happier <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been; the next morning, Charles asks for a divorce, but finds that Florence has died. He leaves, and Willie becomes Clean's new father.|$|R
2500|$|Other roles at the Opéra {{included}} Ophélie in Ambroise Thomas' Hamlet and Valentine in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots (1868). She {{appeared at}} La Scala during the 18691870 season, but {{was back in}} Paris when the Franco-Prussian War {{broke out in the}} summer of 1870. Daniel Auber's La muette de Portici was performed [...] "with the 'Marseillaise' interpolated into the third act and sung by Mme Sass with far more conviction <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> brought to Verdi's Elisabeth." [...] After the French defeat at Sedan, as Prussian troops began to approach Paris, plans were made to convert the nearly finished, but still unoccupied new opera house, the Palais Garnier, into an emergency hospital. Sasse decided to quit the Opéra and emigrated to Italy. She appeared in Saint Petersburg during the 18701871 season.|$|E

6000|$|... "Young knights," [...] said Master Gottfried, [...] "it would scarce become me to say, nor you to hear, {{how much}} matter of fancy such love {{must have been}} towards one whom she knew but for a few short months, though her pure sweet dreams, through these long years, have moulded him into a hero. Boys, I verily believe ye love her truly. Would it be well for her still to mourn and cherish a dream while yet in her fresh age, capable of new happiness, fuller <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> enjoyed?" ...|$|R
60|$|The dowager had {{the curse}} of bad {{impressions}} in youth to contend with, and labored infinitely harder now to make her daughter act right, <b>than</b> formerly <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> done to make her act wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "Off {{the face}} of the earth, sir," [...] Pritchard replied. [...] "Something like two months ago, the young married couple, with Miss Beatrice, started for a holiday tour somewhere down in the west of England. A few days after they started, Miss Beatrice comes back to London alone. She goes to a boarding-house, is {{practically}} penniless, but <b>she</b> <b>has</b> shaken her sister--has, I believe, never spoken with her since. A little later, Elizabeth alone turns up in London. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> plenty of money, more money <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> the control of before in her life, but no husband." ...|$|R

[...] He further said he was staging [...] "a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve." [...] As originally planned, he began his announcement day with a visit to the Naval Academy.|$|R
60|$|As {{for poor}} Lucia, {{no one will}} {{complain}} of her for being happy; for feeling that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> got a holiday, the first for now four years, and trying to enjoy it to the utmost. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> no household cares. Mr. Bowie manages everything, and does so, {{in order to keep}} up the honour of the family, on a somewhat magnificent scale. The children, in that bracing air, are better <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> seen them. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> Valencia all to herself; and Elsley, in spite of the dark fancies over which he has been brooding, is better behaved, on the whole, than usual.|$|R
50|$|It {{is under}} these {{circumstances}} that the struggling family will have to pray for a miracle when their worlds begin to spiral out of control.

Rose, the strong and virtuous matriarch of her family, stands firmly on her faith when she tells Hattie that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> to meet God for the first time. At {{the end of her}} rope, Hattie lifts her arms in a miraculous and desperate show of faith and power. It will take both of the women to battle the principalities coming against their family unit.|$|R

40|$|Attending the National Ballet School {{is every}} {{aspiring}} dancer's dream It's been Brynna's {{for as long}} as she can remember. When her parents move her family to Melbourne so Brynna can attend a top ballet school, it looks like her dream is about to become a reality. But why does she feel so awful about the move? Her brother Tam is angrier <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> seen him and her mother is working hard to keep the family afloat. Will every step towards success come at a price?
