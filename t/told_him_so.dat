The first working title was 'Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi,' and Shantanu (Moitra, the music director) <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>So</b> he said, 'Munnabhai to theek hai, yeh Mahatma Gandhi kaun hai?' ('Munnabhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A few days ago on TV a lot of {{politicians}} were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday! Many didn't know his first name. They kept saying, 'what's in a name, we respect his ideals,' but come on! How can you not know his name? ...|$|E
500|$|While {{waiting for}} Acton's reply, Waugh heard {{that his brother}} Alec had {{arranged}} a job for him based in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff who {{was working on the}} first English translation of Marcel Proust's novel sequence À la recherche du temps perdu. Waugh promptly resigned his position at Arnold House, in anticipation of [...] "a year abroad drinking Chianti under olive trees." [...] Then came Acton's [...] "polite but chilling" [...] response to The Temple at Thatch. This letter has not survived; its wording was recalled by Waugh 40 years later, in his biography A Little Learning. Acton wrote that the story was [...] "too English for my exotic taste ... too much nid-nodding over port." [...] He recommended, facetiously, that the book be printed [...] "in a few elegant copies for the friends who love you", and gave a list of the least elegant of their mutual acquaintances. Many years later Acton wrote of the story: [...] "It was an airy Firbankian trifle, totally unworthy of Evelyn, and I brutally <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>so.</b> It was a misfired jeu d'esprit.|$|E
500|$|The fictional {{character}} Stingaree {{proved to}} be a prototype of a character Hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in Cassell's Magazine, A. J. Raffles. The character was modelled on George Cecil Ives, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer who, like Raffles, was a resident of the Albany, a gentlemen's only residence in Mayfair. The first tale of the series [...] "In the Chains of Crime" [...] was published in June that year, titled [...] "The Ides of March". The stories were collected into one volume—with two additional tales—under the name The Amateur Cracksman, which was published the following year. Hornung used a narrative form similar to Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, with Raffles and his partner-in-crime (and former school fag) Bunny Manders being the criminal counterparts to Holmes and Dr. Watson—although Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders [...] "were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie" [...] (Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas).—and he dedicated the stories to his brother-in-law: [...] "To A.C.D. This form of flattery". Doyle had warned against writing the stories, and reflected in his memoirs that [...] "there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal the hero". The book was a popular and financial success, although some critics also echoed Doyle's fears. The reviewer in The Spectator wrote that [...] "stern moralists" [...] would consider the book's premise [...] "as a new, ingenious, artistic, but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old-fashioned hero-worship of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin". The book ends with Manders imprisoned and Raffles apparently dead, something that left The Spectator reviewer [...] "expressing [...] satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form. It is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue." ...|$|E

Carrel was engaged to the Englishman until Tuesday, the 11th, inclusive, if the weather were fine; but the weather turned bad and he was thus free. On {{the morning of the}} 9th, Whymper, as he was descending to Valtournanche, was surprised to meet Carrel with a traveler, who was coming up {{with a great deal of}} baggage. He questioned Carrel, who told him that he would be unable to serve him after the 11th, because he had an engagement with a [...] "family of distinction"; and when Whymper reproached him for not having <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>so</b> before, he replied that the engagement dated from a long time back, and till then the day had not been fixed. [...] Whymper had as yet no suspicion that the [...] "distinguished family" [...] was Giordano himself but he became aware of it in Breuil on the morning of the 11th, when the guides had already started to explore, and he learnt that everything had been made ready long before for the expedition which was to prepare the way for Quintino Sella.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{coalition}} Government {{collapsed in}} 1951. However, in 1954 a second inter-party Government was formed. On this occasion Liam Cosgrave, {{at the age}} of 34, was given a cabinet position. As Minister for External Affairs Cosgrave took part in trade discussions and chaired the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 1955. He also presided over Ireland's admission to the United Nations in 1955. Cosgrave outlined the three principles of his foreign policy to the Dáil in June, 1956, the first was adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, the second was independence and non-alignment, but the third made clear where Ireland's sympathies lay: [...] "to do whatever we can {{as a member of the}} UN to preserve the Christian civilisation of which we are a part and with that end in view to support whenever possible those powers principally responsible for the defence of the free world in their resistance to the spread of communist power and influence." [...] Ireland was non aligned in favour of the United States. The second Inter Party government collapsed amid severely deflationary policies set by the patrician Minister for Finance, [...] Gerard Sweetman, and Cosgrave held Sweetman personally responsible for Fine Gael's defeat in 1957, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>so,</b> reportedly stating that Fine Gael [...] "was no longer led by people living in big houses at the end of long avenues."
