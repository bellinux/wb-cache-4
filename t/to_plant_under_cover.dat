40|$|Water is a {{limiting}} factor in citrus development which makes hydric replacement {{a common practice}} in plantations where its distribution is scarce. The hydroretentor gel {{has been one of}} the available technologies for water supply <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> and may also be an alternative that contributes to the rational use of water for planting citrus seedlings. This study evaluated the efficiency of hydrogel as an alternative to minimize the effects of water deficit in seedlings of seedless cultivars of tangerines ('Ortanique', 'Okitsu' and 'Clemenules') and oranges ('Navelina', 'Navelate' and 'Lanelate'), all grafted on Poncirus trifoliata. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, in a randomized blocks design, where plants with hydrogel were compared <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> <b>under</b> conventional irrigation and also <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> <b>under</b> water deficit, in a triple factorial arrangement. The rates of carbon liquid assimilation, stomatal conductance and transpiration and the ratio between internal and external CO 2 concentrations were evaluated. It was verified that the effect of the hydrogel for maintaining the hydric status of citrus seedlings is variable and dependent on physiological mechanisms of response to water deficit. There was no response of 'Ortanique' and 'Navelate'seedlings to the hydrogel application. The hydrogel promoted the recovering and maintenance of the hydric status of 'Okitsu', 'Clemenules', 'Navelina' and 'Lanelate' seedlings, however, these cultivars were sensitive to changes in the water status, with considerable reduction of gas exchange...|$|R

This experiment aimed at investigating whether light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{have the same}} effectiveness on plant morphology, photosynthetic and physiological responses as FLUORA lamps. Seedlings of common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea), species of high interest for their nutraceutical properties, were grown in controlled-environment chambers for 50 days under LED and FLUORA light sources as sole-source lighting systems, {{and the effects of}} artificial light supplies on plant photosynthetic performance and chlorophyll content (SPAD) were evaluated. The results were compared <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> grown <b>under</b> natural sunlight.

The two species showed different gas exchange dynamics under LEDs and FLUORA lighting, and photosynthetic performance decreasing after 10 days of light treatment compared <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> <b>under</b> sunlight.

40|$|Development {{of crops}} with {{improved}} nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) {{is essential for}} sustainable agriculture. However, achieving this goal has proven difficult since NUE is a complex trait encompassing physiological and developmental processes. We thought to tackle this problem by taking a systems biology approach to identify candidate target genes. First, we used a supervised machine-learning algorithm to predict a NUE gene network in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Second, we identified BT 2, {{a member of the}} Bric-a-Brac/Tramtrack/Broad gene family, as the most central and connected gene in the NUE network. Third, we experimentally tested BT 2 for a role in NUE. We found NUE decreased in plants overexpressing BT 2 gene compared <b>to</b> wild-type <b>plants</b> <b>under</b> limiting nitrate conditions. In addition, NUE increased compared <b>to</b> wild-type <b>plants</b> <b>under</b> low nitrate conditions in double mutant plants in bt 2 and its closely related homolog bt 1, indicating a functional redundancy of BT 1 and BT 2 for NUE. Expression of the nitrate transporter genes NRT 2. 1 and NRT 2. 4 increased in the bt 1 /bt 2 double mutant compared <b>to</b> wild-type <b>plants,</b> with a concomitant 65 % increase in nitrate uptake under low nitrate conditions. Similar to Arabidopsis, we found that mutation of the BT 1 /BT 2 ortholog gene in rice (Oryza sativa) OsBT increased NUE by 20 % compared <b>to</b> wild-type rice <b>plants</b> <b>under</b> low nitrogen conditions. These results indicate BT gene family members act as conserved negative regulators of nitrate uptake genes and NUE in plants and highlight them as prime targets for future strategies to improve NUE in crops.

30|$|Due to its {{structural}} requirement for seed protein content, soybean {{has a high}} nitrogen demand, often exceeding 200  kg ha- 1 (Bhangoo and Albritton 1976; Bezdicek et al. 1978; Patterson and LaRue 1983). Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and mineral soil or N fertilizers are the main sources for meeting the N requirement of high-yielding soybean varieties. BNF is an effective and efficient source of N supply <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> <b>under</b> favorable atmospheric and environmental conditions (Hungria and Vargas 2000; Chen et al. 2002). More than 50 – 83 % of the necessary N requirement for soybean {{can be derived from}} BNF (Salvagiotti et al. 2008; Schipanski et al. 2010) by symbiotic association with either the genus Bradyrhizobium or Sinorhizobium. Unkovich and Pate (2000) found that, on average, nitrogen fixation by dry-land soybean supplies from 100 – 142  kg N ha- 1 on a worldwide basis. Under favourable conditions, levels of nitrogen fixation are elevated more than 250  kg N ha- 1 (Peoples et al. 1995).|$|R
30|$|The non-consistent {{correlation}} between proline level and stress tolerance can be {{ascribed to the}} fact that proline turnover, rather that just proline accumulation, was more important <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> growth maintaining <b>under</b> stress.
