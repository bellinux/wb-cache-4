25|$|After five years, CNN outgrew its {{original}} home, a former country club {{on the outskirts}} of midtown Atlanta. In 1985, Turner purchased the Omni International hotel from Canadian real estate tycoon Nelson Skalbania and moved CNN's headquarters to the building, rechristening the complex as <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center.</b> As Omni International, the complex had never succeeded. Cousins sold it to Turner, along with the Atlanta Hawks NBA franchise. CNN moved into the end of the tower that once housed The World of Sid and Marty Krofft. Turner was instrumental in the revival of Atlanta's downtown.|$|E

50|$|After {{the park}} closed, the Omni complex {{went through a}} number of renovations, but {{continued}} to have trouble attracting tenants until the mid-1980s. At that point, Ted Turner decided that his CNN cable network had outgrown its sparse headquarters at Atlanta's old Progressive Club building. When scouting a new location, he discovered that the old Krofft park section of the Omni was largely unchanged, sporting enormous rooms and hallways that were ideal for television studios and newsrooms. <b>CNN</b> moved into <b>the</b> building in 1987. Turner soon bought the entire complex and renamed it <b>CNN</b> <b>Center.</b> <b>The</b> massive escalator remains, now used as part of <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> Tour. <b>The</b> facility also features an Omni Hotel (which has been there since the Center was built), meeting space, restaurants, and gift shops.

50|$|It {{has been}} widely speculated that in 1993 media mogul Ted Turner, founder of the 24-hour news network CNN, was {{inspired}} to create a talk show after walking through the atrium of the company's headquarters in Atlanta, <b>The</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center.</b> As the story goes, Turner walked through {{the ground floor of}} <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> and saw the sunlight shining down into the atrium. He had a revelation that the side of atrium in front of The Turner Store would be a great place for a talk show. So one year later and after millions of dollars in renovations, a portion of <b>The</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> food court was transformed into a state of the art broadcast studio that seated over two hundred people and Talkback Live was created.
