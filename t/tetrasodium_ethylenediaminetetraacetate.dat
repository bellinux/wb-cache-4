40|$|An accurate, {{dependable}} {{determination of}} 0 - 60,ug-at. /l. of NOs-N in sea {{water has been}} developed. The sample is treated with <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> solution and passed through a column of copperized cadmium filings. A nearly quantitative reduction of nitrate to nitrite results. Nitrite is then determined by a diazotization method. Neither sulphide nor high nitrite concentrations interferes. Approximately eight samples per hour per column can be analysed {{with a standard deviation}} of 0 ' 12,ug-at. /l. at the 20,ug-at. /l. level...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the synthesis of}} a [2]catenane that consists of two triply entwined 114 -membered rings, a molecular 621 link. The woven scaffold is a hexameric circular helicate generated by the assembly of six tris(bipyridine) ligands with six iron(II) cations, {{with the size of}} the helicate promoted by the use of sulfate counterions. The structure of the ligand extension directs subsequent covalent capture of the catenane by ring-closing olefin metathesis. Confirmation of the Star of David topology (two rings, six crossings) is provided by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. Extraction of the iron(II) ions with <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> affords the wholly organic molecular link. The self-assembly of interwoven circular frameworks of controlled size, and their subsequent closure by multiple directed covalent bond-forming reactions, provides a powerful strategy for the synthesis of molecular topologies of ever-increasing complexity. A hexagram is a six-pointed geometric star consisting of twointerwoven triangles that cross each other six times in itsthree-dimensional representation, a 621 link in Alexander– Briggs notation 1. It has long been used as a religious, cultural and artistic symbol 2 and is today the generally recognized symbol of Judaism (the ‘Star of David ’ or, in Hebrew, ‘Magen David ’ (Shield of David)). Molecular links (catenanes 3) have been targets for rational synthesis for more than half-a-century 4. This is, in part...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{modification}} of a procedure, developed previously {{for reducing the}} trace mineral content of isolated soybean protein, has been made {{for the purpose of}} removing calcium from blood fibrin and thereby lowering the calcium content of a purified diet containing it. The properties of the chelate, <b>tetrasodium</b> <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> (Na 4 EDTA), of combining with cations and keeping them in solution so that they could be washed away at the isoelectric point of the proteins were utilized in developing the procedure. The original blood fibrin was found to contain 0. 1881 % calcium. After purification by the procedure described the calcium content was reduced to 0. 0078 %. This amounted to approximately 4. 15 % of the original quantity. POULTKY SCIENCE 52 : 540 - 542, 1973 IN AN experiment of 28 weeks duration evidence was obtained that a purified basal diet containing 14. 5 % blood fibrin as the protein source, supplied almost, but not quite enough calcium {{to meet the needs of}} mature White Leghorn male chickens (Norris et al., 1972). Most of the males were 11 months of age at the start of the experiment but a few were some-what older. The basal diet was found, when assayed by the atomic absorption procedure to contain 0. 03 % calcium. Using the same procedure, the blood fibrin was shown to have 0. 1881 % cal-cium. The blood fibrin, therefore, proved to be the major source of calcium in the basal diet. Because of the failure to obtain striking evidence of calcium deficiency in male chickens fed the basal diet, an attempt was made to reduce the calcium content of the blood fibrin. In order to do this, recourse was made to the chelating agent, tetrasodium-ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na 4 EDTA), and a procedure for remov-ing the calcium from the blood fibrin by washing with a Na 4 EDTA solution wa...|$|E
40|$|Nitric acid {{solutions}} will {{be created}} from the dissolution of Hanford K Basin sludge. These acidic dissolver solutions must be made alkaline by treatment with NaOH solution before they are disposed to ~ the Tank Waste Remediation System on the Hanford Site. During the alkali treatments, sodium diuranate, hydroxides of iron and aluminum, and radioelements (uranium, plutonium, and americium) will precipitate from the dissolver solution. Laboratory tests, discussed here, were pefiormed to provide information on these precipitates and their precipitation behavior that is important in designing the engineering flowsheet for the treatment process. Specifically, experiments were conducted to determine the optimum precipitation conditions; the completeness of uranium, plutonium, and americium precipitation; the rate of sedimentation; and the physico-chemical characteristics of the solids formed by alkali treatment of simulated acidic dissolver solutions. These experiments also determined the redistribution of uranium, plutonium, and americium flom the sodium di~ate and iron and al&inurn hydroxide precipitates upon contact with carbonate- and EDTA-bearing simulated waste solutions.
