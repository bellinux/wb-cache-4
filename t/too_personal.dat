25|$|Constantia's {{poems are}} few and far between, yet the ones still in {{circulation}} are seen as proof of her intelligence. Many poems, epigrams, and occasional pieces flowed from her facile pen—written in Latin, Greek, or English; but as they did not come up to her standard of excellence, she burnt them all before her death. None of her poems have been preserved, save a few which she addressed to various friends, notably to Mrs. Barber, and which are <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> to be quoted as they could not possess any interest for the general reader; and, on the other hand, it would be unfair to give them as specimens of Mrs. Grierson's poetical abilities.|$|E
25|$|Droste's {{earliest}} {{poems are}} derivative and conventional but in 1820 her work {{began to show}} marked originality when she embarked on a cycle of religious poems, Das geistliche Jahr ("The Spiritual Year"). Droste intended to write one poem for each Sunday and Feast Day of the church year and the cycle was meant to please her devout grandmother, but when Droste had completed 25 poems, she realised they were <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> and showed too many traces of spiritual doubt, so she shelved the work until 1839 when a friend persuaded her to complete the series. Even then she did not publish the poems and they were only offered to the public posthumously in 1851.|$|E

The song was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Tennessee in 2011. A snippet of the song premiered on July 15, 2011 on MTV News, three {{months prior to the}} release of its album, Evanescence. During an interview Lee said, [...] "That's the one that made us cry ... like, literally, just in here, working on it, there have been tears." [...] At first, Lee anticipated that the song would become a B-side at most, thinking of the song as <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> for an album track.|$|E

500|$|Truth Serum is {{the debut}} {{extended}} play (EP) by Swedish recording artist Tove Lo. The singer signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music in 2011, which {{led her to}} write songs for artists like Girls Aloud and Icona Pop. Around that time, she {{was going through a}} hard situation in a relationship, so she eventually started composing tracks related to that matter. She then decided to keep those tracks for herself as she considered them <b>too</b> <b>personal.</b> Lo independently released two of the songs as singles, [...] "Love Ballad" [...] in October 2012, and [...] "Habits" [...] in March 2013. Their popularity gained the singer a record deal with Universal Records in 2013. The EP was eventually released through the label to digital retailers on 3 March 2014.|$|E
500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Kove {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make the film biographical, based on a story her father told her: he had dreamed of being an artist, and made an appointment with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough {{to make it in the}} art world. However, he stood at the top of the stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was <b>too</b> <b>personal,</b> and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to her work for other artists, Lo has co-written the songs from her own record releases. While writing for other singers, she started to record the songs she deemed <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> to give away; {{the first one was}} [...] "Love Ballad", which was initially offered to an artist who wanted to change the lyrics. The track became her first collaboration with co-writers Jakob Jerlström and Ludvig Söderberg, better known as The Struts, and was later released as Lo's debut single in October 2012. [...] "Habits", also co-written with The Struts, was released as the singer's second single in March 2013. It was written during 2012's Hurricane Sandy in New York, and was inspired by Lo's attempts to forget a former boyfriend through substance abuse and other hedonistic practices. Its popularity among music blogs gained the artist a recording contract with Universal Music Group.|$|E
500|$|When the two {{began working}} on a song that Stefani stated was <b>too</b> <b>personal,</b> she left to visit Kanal. He played her a track on {{which he had been}} working and which became [...] "Crash", the album's final single. The two tried to write new material, but gave up after two weeks. They did not return to work until six months later, when Stefani began collaborating with other artists, commenting, [...] "If I were to write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, that would be good enough {{to be part of that}} history." [...] Stefani resumed work with Linda Perry, who invited Dallas Austin, and many other artists, {{including}} Outkast's André 3000, the Neptunes, and Dr. Dre. Stefani announced the album's release in early 2004, marketing it as a [...] "dance record" [...] and a [...] "guilty pleasure".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} on September 5, 2001, in high-definition video at Nimoy's home, under the {{direction}} of Peter Jaysen. There was no script; the conversation between Shatner and Nimoy was ad lib. The title sequence of Mind Meld is narrated by veteran voice actor Billy West, who had previously voiced such characters as Zim in the television series Invader Zim, Ralph in Joe's Apartment, and Elmer Fudd in [...] While the filming session resulted in approximately two hours of footage, a significant portion of this was not used, resulting in a final runtime of 75 minutes. In an interview with science fiction magazine Starlog, Shatner said, [...] "I don't think... that anything was cut because it was <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> or inflammatory. Edits were only made for time." [...] The title of the film refers to a fictional practice in Star Trek; a mind meld is a telepathic link that Spock is able to create with other organisms because he is half-Vulcan. Shatner summarized the film as being [...] "two friends talking one-on-one".|$|E

500|$|Friedrich {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the Berlin Academy in 1810 {{following}} the purchase of two of his paintings by the Prussian Crown Prince. Yet in 1816, he sought to distance himself from Prussian authority and applied that June for Saxon citizenship. The move was not expected by his friends, as the Saxon government of the time was pro-French, while Friedrich's paintings to date were seen as generally patriotic and distinctly anti-French. Nevertheless, with the aid of his Dresden-based friend Graf Vitzthum von Eckstädt, Friedrich attained not only citizenship, but in 1818, a membership in the Saxon Academy with a yearly dividend of 150 thalers. Although he had hoped to receive a full professorship, it was never awarded him as, according to the German Library of Information, [...] "it was felt that his painting was <b>too</b> <b>personal,</b> his point of view too individual to serve as a fruitful example to students." [...] Politics too may {{have played a role in}} [...] stalling his career: Friedrich's decidedly Germanic subjects and costuming frequently clashed with the era's prevailing pro-French attitudes.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How do we want to do this? What do {{we want it to be}} about? What do we want to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|When World War I {{broke out}} some Australians, such as Rix Nicholas, fled to England, however Rae stayed and became, along with Jessie Traill, {{one of only}} two Australian women artists to portray the war while living in France. When in 1918 Australia first {{appointed}} official war artists, sixteen men were chosen; Rae, despite having lived in France {{for the duration of the}} conflict, was not included. She nevertheless documented prolifically the experience of the war in her adopted home town, creating over two hundred drawings. Most of these portrayed the Étaples Army Base Camp, [...] "the largest of its kind ever established overseas by the British", which at its zenith housed 100,000, including hospital services for up to 22,000 patients. Most of the drawings are of nocturnal scenes, possibly because during the war Rae and her sister both worked in the Voluntary Aid Detachment, and would have had little spare time during the days. Few of these works were acquired by public galleries, with art historian Sasha Grishin arguing that they were [...] "generally regarded as too intimate, <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> and too feminine to be included".|$|E

25|$|Privacy {{concerns}} with social networking services {{have been raised}} growing concerns among users {{on the dangers of}} giving out <b>too</b> much <b>personal</b> information and the threat of sexual predators. Users of these services also {{need to be aware of}} data theft or viruses. However, large services, such as Myspace and Netlog, often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing <b>too</b> much <b>personal</b> information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may in fact be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site Quechup harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a spamming operation.|$|R
500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E
2500|$|During her 55-year {{career as}} a comedian, her tough-talking style of satirical humor was both praised and criticized as truthful, yet <b>too</b> <b>personal,</b> too gossipy, and very often abrasive. Nonetheless, with her ability to [...] "tell it like it is," [...] she became a pioneer of {{contemporary}} stand-up comedy. Commenting about her style, she told biographer Gerald Nachman, [...] "Maybe I started it. We're a very gossipy culture. All {{we want to know}} now is private lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of his restorations, {{such as that}} of the Château de Pierrefonds, {{have become}} very {{controversial}} because they were not intended so much to recreate a historical situation accurately as to create a [...] "perfect building" [...] of medieval style: [...] "to restore an edifice", he observed in the Dictionnaire raisonné, [...] "is not to maintain it, repair or rebuild it, but to re-establish it in a complete state that may never have existed at a particular moment". The idea and the very word restoration applied to architecture Viollet-le-Duc considered part of a modern innovation. Modern conservation practice considers Viollet-le-Duc's restorations too free, <b>too</b> <b>personal,</b> too interpretive, but some of the monuments he restored might have been lost otherwise.|$|E
2500|$|The album's themes include {{mortality}} and growing older, or, as Taylor described it, [...] "just realizing, 'I'm not {{as young as}} I used to be, what am I {{going to do with}} myself? I don't have eternity to stay here so I need to get up and do something and make it worthwhile'—whatever that means." [...] Pierre's lyricism includes a mix of fact and fiction, which is intended to leave the listener guessing. The album's tone is reflective, which was spurred from Pierre having time to sit at home to write and think. He looked at his relationship with lead guitarist Joshua Cain, noting that the two had written and played music together for 15 years at that point. Pierre felt [...] "overwhelmed with the eventual demise of everything," [...] and considered the fact that [...] "nothing lasts forever" [...] is one of the album's most important points. Occasionally, Pierre's lyricism was considered <b>too</b> <b>personal</b> or dark by other members. One lyric from [...] "Timelines", paraphrased by Pierre in an interview as [...] "rushing into every pore, the whiskey stench of open sores", was changed to [...] "scattered seeds of sycamore," [...] as Cain found the lyric gross, noting it [...] "literally made [...] stomach sick." ...|$|E
