However, these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973, and the two Mirage fighter squadrons in 1988. Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft, support personnel, and an infantry company known as Rifle Company Butterworth have been maintained, as well as occasional deployments of F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft. Australian submarines reportedly undertook a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War. Airforce and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region. Since then the Orions have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway, conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean, Strait of Malacca and South China Sea. They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights.|$|E

5|$|The Belgians much {{preferred}} {{an alliance}} with the United Kingdom. The British had entered the First World War {{in response to the}} German violation of Belgian neutrality. The Belgian Channel ports had offered the German Imperial Navy valuable bases, and such an attack would offer the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe bases to engage in strategic offensive operations against the United Kingdom in the coming conflict. But the British government paid little attention to the concerns of the Belgians. The lack of <b>this</b> <b>commitment</b> ensured the Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the day before the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The lack of opposition to the remilitarisation served to convince the Belgians that France and Britain were unwilling to fight for their own strategic interests, let alone Belgium's. The Belgian General Staff was determined to fight for its own interests, alone if necessary.|$|E
5|$|His brother {{claims that}} Stauskas scored about 50 {{points a game}} in middle school. For much of his youth, he and future Gonzaga point guard Kevin Pangos {{attended}} basketball camps together, regularly playing one-on-one while other campers took breaks from basketball for other activities. Until 2009, Stauskas played for Loyola Catholic Secondary School. He averaged 15 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 2007–08 and 32 points, 14 rebounds and 7.5 assists in 2008–09. Its basketball team nearly disbanded before Stauskas's grade 10 season in 2008–09, when Loyola {{was in danger of}} not fielding a team because school policy required the presence of a teacher. Although his father, a computer consultant, was willing to volunteer as a coach, no teacher was willing to serve. Stauskas's father finally found a French teacher who sat in the gym and graded papers while his father coached. In the meantime, Stauskas joined the premier Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team in Toronto, run by Ro Russell. Some of Russell's prior players, such as Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph had gone to the United States to complete their scholastic years. Stauskas, not wishing to risk not having a team to play on after the crisis of 2008–2009, spent the 2009–10 academic year at South Kent School, but the forested rural campus made him homesick and he transferred to St. Mark's School the following year. He missed the 2009–10 basketball season {{as a result of a}} hip injury. Michigan Wolverines men's basketball head coach John Beilein became familiar with Stauskas during the Summer 2010 NBA camp prior to Stauskas's junior year. Stauskas visited Michigan that summer and was also being recruited by Villanova, Iowa State, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Florida and Providence. By the time he arrived at St. Mark's, he was expected to be an All-State performer. In the 2011 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game, Stauskas led St. Mark's in scoring with 17 points against Nerlens Noel and the Tilton School, but St. Marks lost 72–56. On March 26, 2011, Stauskas made a verbal commitment to Michigan. <b>This</b> <b>commitment</b> made him the second member of Michigan's recruiting class of 2012. That summer he scored 27 points in an exhibition of Canadian high school all-stars against the Baylor Bears men's basketball team.|$|E
