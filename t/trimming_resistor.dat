In the above example, the second stage might use 3 kΩ resistors instead of 2 kΩ; connecting a (trimmable) resistor of 60 kΩ in parallel with the second stage brings the total input resistance of the second stage down to the 20 kΩ required.|$|E

40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) had stringent requirements that made the thermal design unique. To meet instrument stability requirements the system had to be designed to keep temperatures of all components within acceptable limits without heater cycling. Although the spacecraft remains at a fixed 22 sun angle at L 2, the variations in solar constant, property degradation, and bus voltage range all significantly affect the temperature. Large portions of the fuel lines are external to the structure and all components are mounted to non-conductive composite structure. These two facts made the sensitivity to the MLI effective emissivity and bus temperature very high. Approximately two years prior to launch the {{propulsion system}} was redesigned to meet MAP requirements. The new design utilized hardware that was already installed {{in order to meet}} schedule constraints. The spacecraft design and the thermal requirements were changed to compensate for inadequacies of the existing hardware. The propulsion system consists of fuel lines, fill and drain lines/valve, eight thrusters, a HXCM, and a propulsion tank. A voltage regulator was added to keep critical components within limits. Software was developed to control the operational heaters. <b>Trim</b> <b>resistors</b> were put in series with each operational heater circuits and the tank survival heater.

40|$|Abstract—Precision {{electrical}} trimming of stacked Si/SiGe poly-crystalline resistors {{available from}} the extrinsic base structure of a SiGe BiCMOS technology has been demonstrated for the first time. It is shown that pulse current trimming techniques {{can be used to}} <b>trim</b> the poly-SiGe <b>resistors</b> by up to 50 % from their orig-inal values with accuracy better than 0. 5 %. The temperature co-efficient of resistance (TCR) is shown to be linearly proportional to the percent change in electrically trimmed poly-SiGe resistance. Fi-nally, we demonstrate resistance cycling using an electrical trim/re-covery sequence, indicating that the technique is reversible and is governed by dopant segregation/diffusion mechanisms. The results are consistent with those obtained on conventional polysilicon re-sistors suggesting that the introduction of a strained SiGe layer does not adversely affect the electrical trim properties of these re-sistors.

40|$|The {{effect of}} high voltage pulses on the {{resistance}} of polymer thick film resistors (PTFR) is studied. It is found that the resistance decreases with both the amplitude and duration of the high voltage pulses and {{with the number of}} pulses. The change in resistance is attributed to the dielectrophoretic motion of graphite granules in the PVC medium when high voltage pulses are applied to PTFR. A model has been proposed through which the percentage change in resistance can be estimated {{in terms of the number}} of pulses, duration of pulses etc. Based on these investigations, we suggest a downward trimming method for PTFR through the application of high voltage pulses.

40|$|Electrical trim {{techniques}} {{for reducing the}} value of a trimmable single crystal silicon resistor (trimistor) are presented. Computer-controlled current pulses are used to incrementally decrease the value of the trimistor through metal/silicon alloying. Variations of both single and multipulse current pulses are investigated. Physical mechanisms, based on electron microscopy of trimistors trimmed under various conditions, are hypothesized to explain the observed trim behavior. Threshold currents are dependent on the initial value of the resistor, the applied current density and the trim method. The electrical trim technique for a single trimmable resistor element is optimized.

While memorizing his Latin class vocabulary words, Mims conceived a computer that could translate twenty words from one language to another. The input was six potentiometers (variable resistors) each having a dial with 26 letters. Entering the first six letters of the word on the potentiometers set a total electrical resistance. The memory of known words was a bank of 20 screwdriver-adjustable <b>trimmer</b> <b>resistors.</b> (Mims later referred to this as [...] "Screwdriver-Programmable Read Only Memory", SPROM.) The memory was searched by a motor driven switch that compared the resistance of the input word with each memory resistor. When a match was found the motor would stop and one of 20 output lamps would be on. This was not a practical language translator, but it was an impressive science fair project for the early 1960s.

This requirement, when coupled with circuits of moderate to high density and associated layer buildup prior to resistor application, results in printing on surfaces with significant topography surrounding the resistor, compared to required as-printed resistor thicknesses. Due to the technological requirement to print resistors after most other thick film processing has been completed, resistor printing is seldom performed on a flat surface.
