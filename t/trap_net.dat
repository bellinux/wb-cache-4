[...] We {{examined}} Minnesota’s muskellunge Esox masquinongy waters using various {{data sets}} including spring <b>trap</b> <b>net</b> assessments, angler diary surveys, and stocking re-cords. In many cases, data limitations prevented us from drawing strong conclusions. Currently, 107 lakes {{have been identified}} as muskellunge waters, of which 63 lakes have been created and maintained by stocking. Anglers averaged more muskellunge specific angling trips in 1996 - 98 than in 1986 - 89.

In the first experiment, a commercial <b>trap</b> <b>net</b> made entirely from 25 mm mesh and designed for use in shallow water was alternatively fished with a fine-meshed (9. 5 mm netting) <b>trap</b> <b>net</b> (used as a control). In the second experiment, two trap-net configurations designed for use in deeper water and comprising the same anterior section (made from 25 mm mesh), but with different bunts made from (i) the conventional 25 mm mesh and (ii) 31 mm mesh were alternately fished against the control. Both of the conventional trap nets (comprising 25 mm mesh throughout) had low amounts of bycatch and similarly selected eastern king Penaeus plebejus, greasyback Metapenaeus bennettae and school prawns Metapenaeus macleayi across narrow selection ranges (< 3. 4 mm) and at 50 % retention lengths (between 18. 53 and 21. 50 mm) that were larger than the average commercially-accepted sizes (15 - 17 mm CL). Analyses of the selectivities and relative efficiencies of the trap-net configurations comprising the 25 and 31 mm bunts showed no benefit, in terms of maintaining prawn catches and reducing unwanted bycatch, associated with increasing mesh size in these gears.

40|$|Abstract. —Trap nets {{of varying}} design are {{commonly}} used to assess fish populations, but {{the effect of the}} design on gear selectivity is not well known. In particular, it may be advantageous to use multiple net designs with different mesh and throat sizes to maximize the catch of specific length-classes and to minimize the risk of predation on small fish by larger fish. We compared the species composition, catch rate, and length distribution of fishes caught by three <b>trap</b> <b>net</b> designs with dimensions differing only in mesh size and throat size (0. 6 -cm delta mesh and 3. 8 -cm 3 3. 8 -cm square throats, 1. 3 -cm square mesh and 7. 6 -cm 3 7. 6 -cm square throats, or 2. 5 -cm square mesh and 12. 7 -cm 3 12. 7 -cm square throats). A total of 3, 473 fish of 18 species were captured from Sandy Lake, Portage County, Ohio, during 24 sample dates from June to August 1999. The large net design had a significantly higher average number of species captured (mean 5 11) than the medium or small net design (means 5 9 and 8, respectively). Whereas nets with larger mesh and throat size combinations typically caught larger fish for the six most commonly captured species, only rarely did nets capture fish as large or as small as possible based on their physical dimensions.
