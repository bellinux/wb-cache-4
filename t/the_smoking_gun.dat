5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E

Wrestling now full-time as The Brooklyn Brawler, his career was seemingly devoid of momentum as he dropped matches to Lex Luger, Duke Droese, Man Mountain Rock, and Doink (Ray Apollo). For the first time in over a year, he resumed his partnership with Horowitz yet again and faced off against Tekno Team 2000 in their Monday Night Raw debut on May 16.

5000|$|According to American Idols producers, Clark did not {{disclose}} his arrest record when joining the competition, although Clark maintains in Chapter 6 of his book entitled [...] "American Paulatics" [...] that he spoke with them and with judge Paula Abdul about his legal troubles. Producers also explained that the background checks conducted on all contestants did not uncover his arrest because of a misspelling of Clarks name in the police report. Clark maintains that this could not be true, as all background checks are conducted via social security numbers, which Clark had provided to producers in his contract. The producers disqualified Clark from further participation in the competition nine hours after <b>The</b> <b>Smoking</b> <b>Guns</b> story broke.|$|R
40|$|The {{first run}} of the LHC was {{successful}} in that it saw {{the discovery of the}} elusive Higgs boson, a particle that is consistent with the SM hypothesis. There are a number of excesses in Run 1 ATLAS and CMS results which can be interpreted as being due to the existence of another heavier scalar particle. This particle has decay modes which we have studied using LHC Run 1 data. Using a minimalistic model, we can predict the kinematics of these final states and compare the prediction against data directly. A statistical combination of these results shows that a best fit point is found for a heavy scalar having a mass of 272 ^+ 12 _- 9 GeV. This result has been quantified as a three sigma effect, based on analyses which are not necessarily optimized for the search of a heavy scalar. <b>The</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>guns</b> for <b>the</b> discovery of this new heavy scalar and the prospects for Run 2 are discussed. Comment: When first manuscript was submitted a number of experimental Run I results were not avaiable. In this new version of the manuscript a complete set of Run I experimental results has been analyzed in a global fit. More {{attention has been paid to}} the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian, leading to a discussion on an intermediate real particle. <b>The</b> list of <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> final states has been expande...|$|R
25|$|Grand jury {{proceedings}} (without {{defense counsel}} {{and without a}} judge present) in Santa Barbara, starting in March 2004, led to Jackson's indictment on April 21, 2004.

The judge ruled that witnesses {{before the grand jury}} could talk to defense attorneys about their knowledge of the case as long as the witnesses did not tell what they saw in the grand jury room or what questions they were asked and their answers. Many grand jury witnesses were sneaked into the building where the grand jury was meeting, sometimes covered in blankets to hide their identities.

After several more losses, Horowitz appeared at SummerSlam when he lost to Owen Hart in a dark match. A month later, Horowitz gained another pair of victories in television dark matches, defeating Mike Davis and Scott Taylor. In November Horowitz made his pay-per-view debut under a mask at the 1993 Survivor Series as The Red Knight, teaming with Shawn Michaels (who was substituting for Jerry Lawler) and the Black and Blue Knights to lose to Bret, Owen, Keith, and Bruce Hart. Following the pay-per-view, Horowitz began teaming with his old partner Steve Lombardi as The Red & Black Knights on the house show circuit, losing to Men on a Mission multiple times in December.|$|R

500|$|Finkelstein noted 20 instances, {{in as many}} pages, where Dershowitz's book {{cites the}} same sources and {{passages}} used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with ellipses in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims. Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas. Examining {{a copy of a}} proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his secretarial assistant, Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book. Dershowitz answered the charge {{in a letter to the}} University of California's Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up <b>the</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> quotation, in that he had changed its wording (from 'cite' to 'copy') in his book. In public debate he has stated that if [...] "somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether Mark Twain had said that, obviously that would be a serious charge"; however, he insisted emphatically that he himself did not do that, that he had indeed checked the original source by Twain.|$|E
500|$|American Life is Madonna's {{second album}} {{to bear a}} [...] "Parental Advisory" [...] label after Erotica (1992), due the profanity used in the title song.

To counter illegal downloads of the album's songs {{before and after the}} release, Madonna's associates created a number of false MP3 files of similar length and size. Some of these files delivered a brief message from Madonna saying [...] "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" [...] followed by minutes of silence.

40|$|The {{pursuit of}} the {{progenitors}} of short duration-hard spectrum gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) draws strongly upon similar quests for the origin of supernovae (SNe) and long duration-soft spectrum GRBs (LSBs). Indeed the notion that, in <b>the</b> absence of <b>smoking</b> <b>guns,</b> <b>the</b> progenitors of cosmic explosions betray their identities both on the global and local scale, motivates the study of SHB redshifts, host galaxies, and locations with respect to hosts. To this end, we suggest both a historical and emergent physical analogy of GRBs with SNe: long-soft GRBs are to core-collapsed supernovae as short-hard GRBs are to Type Ia supernovae (“LSB:CC::SHB:Ia”). Still, the SHB progenitor pursuit is just beginning and we caution that while there are some substantive differences between observations of LSBs and SHBs on large-scales, particularly in host demographics, neither the offset nor the redshift distributions of SHBs are statistically inconsistent with those of LSBs...|$|R
