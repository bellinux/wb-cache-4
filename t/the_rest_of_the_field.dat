5|$|From 26 to 30 December, Carlsen {{played in}} the World Rapid and Blitz Championships held in Doha, Qatar. He scored 11/15 in the rapid tournament, {{finishing}} third on tiebreak behind Ivanchuk and Grischuk. In the blitz tournament, he scored 16½/21, finishing second on tiebreak behind Karjakin, and 2 points clear of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rosenqvist won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his start line advantage {{on the first}} lap. He pulled away from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> and kept the lead until the mandatory round of pit stops when Buemi took over the first position for one lap until he made his stop. Rosenqvist regained the lead but was required to conserve his car's electrical energy usage because of making a pit stop one lap earlier than <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> allowing Buemi to narrow the time deficit between the two drivers. Buemi passed Rosenqvist for the lead on the 27th lap and held it {{for the remainder of}} the race to clinch the win. There were two lead changes among two different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|The two Ferrari {{cars and}} the Renault of Kubica became the first cars to queue up behind the safety car, while <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> had enough notice to divert to the pitlane for their first stop. The {{significance}} of these events was that both Vettel and Hamilton {{were able to make}} their first stops before their advantage over <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> was cancelled out by catching the safety car, while Alonso, Massa and Kubica fell down the order. Hamilton's stop was for a replacement front wing. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 14 and the cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel locked his tyres and ran deep driving into the final turn, and resisted Hamilton's attempt at overtaking him. Alonso immediately pushed hard and passed Hülkenberg for ninth place at turn 17 on the 15th lap. A line of cars formed behind Kobayashi while Vettel and Hamilton pulled away from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> as the front two began trading the fastest lap time of the event. Button gained a large amount of top speed but remained behind both Sauber cars. Schumacher passed both Virgin cars to move into the 17th position by lap 17.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the announcement of entries for the 2015 FIA World Endurance Championship and the European Le Mans Series seasons, the ACO announced the full 56 car entry list for Le Mans, plus seven reserves. In addition to the 35 guaranteed entries from the World Endurance Championship, 13 entries came from the European Le Mans Series, three from the United SportsCar Championship, two from the Asian Le Mans Series, while <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> was filled with one-off entries only competing at Le Mans.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn {{four and}} the safety car had to be deployed; Hamilton had pitted just before the incident. Thus the pit lane was closed but Alonso and Nico Rosberg were forced to pit {{in order to avoid}} running out of fuel, and were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties. When the pit lane was re-opened and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> pitted, Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella left the pit lane while the red light was still on. Both were later disqualified from the race on lap 51.|$|E

5|$|In Q3, Nico Rosberg ran wide at turn 15 on {{his first}} flying lap and lost the chance to seek areas of {{improvement}} for his second run. Lewis Hamilton, who was fastest in all three sessions, capitalized on his teammate's problem and took pole position by over half a second. It was his 39th pole position and his 4th at Albert Park. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> {{was more than a}} second behind Hamilton's time, with Felipe Massa in the Williams best of the rest in third position. The two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen proved their regained competitiveness by taking fourth and fifth on the grid respectively.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher, the {{eventual}} Drivers' Champion, led the Championship {{going into the}} race and started from fourth position alongside Barrichello. At the first corner BAR's Ricardo Zonta ran into the rear of Michael Schumacher. The incident forced the German to retire and caused a safety car deployment. After the safety car pulled in after one lap Häkkinen and Coulthard extended a comfortable lead over <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> When Häkkinen made his pit stop on lap 38, he rejoined behind Coulthard, but ahead of Barrichello. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 41, allowing Häkkinen back into the lead which he held to clinch his second victory of the 2000 season.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Turvey won {{the pole}} {{position}} after Daniel Abt was penalised for a tyre pressure infringement and maintained his advantage {{on the first}} lap. He came under pressure from José María López until {{he retired from the}} ePrix with power issues, handing the lead to López. Di Grassi and Jérôme d'Ambrosio made early pit stops for the switch into their second cars and di Grassi became the leader on lap 26 when <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> made their stops. D'Ambrosio held off pressure from Vergne for second place until he was passed on the 43rd lap and di Grassi remained the leader {{for the rest of the}} race after conserving electrical energy to win.

5|$|Returning to Churchill Downs on Derby Day, May 5, 2012, Shackleford raced in the $400,000 Grade 2 Churchill Downs Stakes {{at seven}} furlongs on the dirt. In that race, he beat the favorite, American Champion Sprint Horse Amazombie, by a length. The two horses {{separated}} themselves from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> by five lengths with Shackleford on the inside. Just inside the sixteenth pole, he edged away and beat Amazombie under jockey Mike Smith by a length. Gantry was another {{five and a}} half lengths back in the third. The time was 1:21 on a fast track.|$|E
5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid off the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
5|$|The {{next three}} {{stages of the}} race were all {{primarily}} flat, had no real impact on the overall standings, and all concluded with a bunch sprint. Ján Svorada won stage nine and then stage eleven after dodging a crash that marred the stage's finish. Djamolidine Abdoujaparov out-sprinted <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> to win the race's tenth stage. The Giro's twelfth stage featured a few categorized climbs as the race made its way into Slovenia for the stage's finish in Kranj. Despite the climbs, the stage ended with a field sprint that was won by Andrea Ferrigato. Italian Michele Bartoli won the race's undulating thirteenth stage by {{being a part of}} the stage's initial breakaway and then attacking later on and soloing to the stage's conclusion in Lienz, Austria.|$|E

5|$|Turvey's team {{asked him}} to reset his vehicle and a yellow flag was shown to warn drivers about his {{stranded}} car. After three laps, however, {{he was unable to}} restart his vehicle and retired, causing the safety car to be sent onto the track for the second time. With the field closed up, di Grassi and d'Ambrosio opted to make the mandatory switch into their second cars on the 18th lap. Although the switch would allow di Grassi and d'Ambrosio to gain positions when other drivers made their stops, it required them to conserve electrical energy towards the race's conclusion. The race restarted when the safety car drove into the pit lane on the following lap with López remaining in first place, followed by Heidfeld, Vergne, Bird and Buemi. López built a small lead over <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> and attention switched to Heidfeld who came under pressure from Vergne, Bird, Buemi and Rosenqvist. Although he had enough electrical energy to do another lap, Vergne became the first of the leading drivers to make a pit stop to switch into his second car at the end of lap 24 in an effort to drive in clean air and undercut the field. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> followed in response one lap later. Swift work from López's team allowed him to remain narrowly ahead of Vergne, who in turn, moved in front of Heidfeld. The Mahindra driver lost seven positions while Buemi moved from fifth to tenth, both as a result of slow pit stops. Prost led the field for one lap before making his stop on lap 26.|$|E
5|$|After passing slower cars, Vettel {{began to}} resume his battle with the Ferrari drivers. Button made a pit stop on lap 22 and reemerged in fifth {{position}} behind his teammate Hamilton. The Ferrari cars began to set faster lap times than <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> as Massa started {{to pull away from}} Alonso and held a lead of three seconds over his teammate. Alonso responded to Massa's newfound pace by recording a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:18.075 on lap 28, having backed out to see how fast his car was in clean air, before the two drivers began to trade fastest times over the next three laps. Webber attempted to place pressure on Button in a battle for fifth place, although Button was using a defensive strategy by using his McLaren's straight-line speed advantage. De La Rosa caught up to Hülkenberg and passed him at the turn six hairpin on lap 35. Three laps later, Hamilton was instructed by McLaren to conserve fuel usage in the event they could use an aggressive fuel saving mode {{towards the end of the}} race.|$|E
5|$|Alonso made a {{complaint}} about Hamilton and asked {{his team to}} work with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting to discuss the issue with the safety car. Massa attempted to pass Liuzzi around the outside heading into turn 17 but Liuzzi turned right to defend the position. Shortly afterwards, Massa made a slight mistake which allowed Alguersuari to close the gap. Hamilton started to conserve fuel and prepare for a late attack on lap 20. On the following lap, it was announced Hamilton would be investigated by the stewards for his safety car overtake for which he was given a drive-through penalty which he served on the 27th lap. He remained in second position due to Kobayashi holding up <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> Massa placed further pressure upon Liuzzi but was unable to pass him. A glass bottle appeared {{on the outside of the}} track on lap 28 which was retrieved by a marshal three laps later to allow racing to continue unaffected. Massa made an error at the final turn on lap 35 which meant he fell behind Liuzzi in the battle for 14th place.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{was able}} to further open up a twenty-two second lead over <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> and {{maintained}} it {{for the remainder of}} the race to secure the victory. Ceccon finished one with one second covering Evans in third and Nasr in fourth; Evans narrowly fended off Nasr for the final podium place. Calado secured fifth with Coletti taking sixth and Binder seventh. Quaife-Hobbs passed Richemi for eighth place in the final stages of the race and thus earned the sprint race pole position. Richelmi and De Jong rounded out the top-ten points-scoring positions. Dillmann, Lancaster, Trummer, Rosenzweig and Canamasas took the next five places and Abt was the last of the classified finishers. It was Bird's third win in the GP2 Series, his (and Russian Time's) second of the season, and his first victory at the circuit since his 2012 Formula Renault 3.5 Series Monaco round triumph. After the race, the stewards deemed Cecotto responsible for causing the first lap accident that triggered the race's sole stoppage and Cecotto was barred from competing in the following day's sprint event.|$|E
5|$|Gordon led on the lap-38 restart, {{followed}} by Truex and Burton. One lap later, Burton, with assistance from Johnson, passed Gordon for the lead. Kenseth claimed first position on lap 40 after {{driving on the}} outside lane. Vickers followed Johnson on the inside line to reclaim the lead on the following lap, before Sadler passed Vickers around the outside for the lead on the 44th lap. On lap 45, Mears led after passing Sadler, and debris was located on the backstretch, triggering a second caution. All drivers, including Mears, elected to make pit stops. Sadler reclaimed first position and led the field back up to speed at the lap-49 restart, ahead of Mears and Kyle Busch. Hamlin and Kyle Busch led the cars driving on the outside lane, with Busch claiming the lead on lap 51, pulling away from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> Kurt Busch, with help from Vickers, got ahead of Kyle Busch to move into first place.|$|E
5|$|Hamlin was {{extracted}} from his car, {{and placed on}} a stretcher and transported to a local hospital for further evaluation. Riggs led the field back up to speed at the restart on lap 104, ahead of Menard. On the following lap, Riggs lost the draft allowing Menard {{to move into the}} lead. The field went three abreast, as Menard lost the lead to Stewart on the 107th lap, but Menard reclaimed the position one lap later. Stewart retook the lead on lap 112 after he received assistance from Montoya. Burton challenged Stewart for the lead on lap 115 as both drivers ran side-by-side at the start-finish line, before Burton moved in front of Stewart two laps later. Harvick moved back into the lead on lap 120, after running on the inside lane. Harvick, Ragan and Stewart formed a single line, as <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> ran in double-file.|$|E
