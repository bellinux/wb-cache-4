40|$|Abstract. We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of visual feedback on the <b>tactual</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> both speed and spatial period of a rotating texture. Participants were placed {{in a situation of}} perceptual conflict concerning the rotation speed of a cylindrical texture. Participants touched a cylindrical texture of gratings rotating around its axis at a constant speed, while they watched a cylinder without gratings rotating at a different speed on a computer screen. Participants were asked to estimate the speed of the gratings texture under the finger and the spacing (or spatial period) of the gratings. We observed that the tactual estimations of both speed and spacing co-varied with the speed of the visual stimulus, although the cylinder perceived tactually rotated at a constant speed. The first effect (speed effect) could correspond to the resolution of the perceptual conflict in favor of vision. The second effect (spacing effect) is apparently surprising, since no varying information about spacing was provided by vision.

40|$|Our tactual perceptual {{experiences}} {{occur when}} we interact, actively and passively, with environmental objects and surfaces. Previous {{research has demonstrated}} that active manual exploration often enhances the <b>tactual</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> object shape. Nevertheless, the factors that contribute to this enhancement are not well understood. The present study evaluated the ability of 28 younger (mean age was 23. 1 years) and older adults (mean age was 71. 4 years) to discriminate curved surfaces by actively feeling objects with a single index finger and by passively feeling objects that moved relative to a restrained finger. While dynamic cutaneous stimulation was therefore present in both conditions, active exploratory movements only occurred in one. The results indicated that there was a significant and large effect of age, such that the older participants' thresholds were 43. 8 percent higher than those of the younger participants. Despite the overall adverse effect of age, the pattern of results across the active and passive touch conditions was identical. For both age groups, the curvature discrimination thresholds obtained for passive touch were significantly lower than those that occurred during active touch. Curvature discrimination performance was therefore best in the current study when dynamic cutaneous stimulation occurred in the absence of active movement...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if subjects could be trained to discriminate surfaces by experiencing a series of structured training tasks utilizing apparatus developed for training discrimination in <b>tactual</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> surfaces perceived by the finger tips. The subjects of the study were the legally blind male and female students in the kindergarten, first, and second grades at a midwestern residential institution for blind children. The age range of the 15 subjects who participated in the study was six years one month through twelve years six months. These subjects represented 65 % of the total population of the three grades. The study was a pretest-posttest control group design. Each subject received a pretest and a posttest which utilized the Roughness Discrimination Test, a test designed to predict Braille reading readiness. Each subject of the experimental group experienced a series of game-type activities utilizing two sets of wooden blocks with surfaces covered with # 100, # 80 -D, # 60, # 50, # 40, and # 36 production paper. Each subject of the control group experienced the series of game-type activities utilizing one set of wooden blocks with surfaces finished to the extent that no textural surface variation existed. The pretest, experimental group treatment, control group activity, and posttest were all administered by the examiner to each subject on an individual basis. The data were examined both descriptively and statistically utilizing measures of central tendency, the Mann-Whitney U-test, and analysis of variance. The measures of central tendency yielded a mean increase of 8. 37 points for the experimental group and an increase of 2. 28 points for the control from pretest to posttest. The median score increased 23. 50 points for the experimental group and decreased four points for the control group. The analysis of data through the Mann-Whitney U-test and analysis of variance yielded no statistically significant difference at the 0. 05 or the 0. 01 levels of significance. Within the limits dictated by this study, the following conclusion was made. The tactual training tasks as designed and utilized in this study do not change in a positive direction the ability to discriminate surfaces as measured by the Roughness Discrimination Test. Based upon the results of the study, the following recommendations were made for further research:A study similar to the present one should be conducted introducing practice as a variable. A study similar to the present one should be conducted comparing and contrasting the performance of day school and public school blind children with residential school blind children.

This led to a similar experiment involving varying amounts of tactual training. Although little support was obtained for the hypothesis that when vision and touch are placed in conflict the demonstrated dominance of vision is due, at least in part, to a difference in previous experience obtained by the two senses at the tasks involved, further experiments were carried out suing Doveprism apparatus. The effects of tactual training with verbal feedback, tactual feedback and no feedback were investigated. While results of a control group showed that there was little change in repeated judgments when not actual training was given, visual dominance was shown to decrease when verbal or tactual knowledge of results (feedback) accompanied tactual training. This decrease did not occur when no feedback was given.

40|$|As {{laparoscopic surgery}} {{continues}} to gain widespread {{popularity in the}} world of surgery, the lack of one fundamental sensation at times put surgeons in a state of apprehension. Tactile feedback, the missing sensation, is claimed by surgeons to be an essential process to secure accurate knowledge of the region that is being operated on. In cases where visual cues alone fail to allow distinction of tissues of an area, tactile information may be the only remaining alternative the surgeon can rely upon to make a correct judgement. It is therefore imperative that this form of perceptual feedback may also be portrayed to surgeons using laparoscopic surgery, thereby recreating their more familiar environment, and assist them increase the chances of successfully completing a surgical procedure. In an attempt to remedy the present situation where tactile information in laparoscopic surgery is lacking, conditions that are thought to influence the surgeons' <b>tactual</b> <b>perception</b> during surgery were chosen to be investigated. Namely, these conditions are composed of bare hand, gloved, and the use of an intermediate tool. Unfortunately, the exact tactual dimensions that are relevant during surgery in general remain ambiguous and unclear. Therefore, as a preliminary investigation, it was proposed to take the dimension "softness", a dimension that is in general accepted as one <b>of</b> the fundamental <b>tactual</b> <b>perception</b> dimensions, and examine how the aforementioned examination conditions affect <b>tactual</b> <b>perception</b> for a material that differs in "softness" alone. Modified two alternative forced choice tasks were performed as a first experiment through which fruitful and promising outcomes were seen. To build on the finding of this experiment, a second experiment, which involved the softness magnitude estimations of the stimuli set, again under the same examination conditions, was carried out. The standalone results from the two experiments showed some interesting outcomes, primarily that softness was perceived differently under different examination conditions. Upon comparison, however, behaviours and activities which were to some extent, remarkable and perplexing, were encountered, leading to conclusions which in part were contradictory.

40|$|The {{shape of}} objects cannot only be {{recognized}} by vision, but also by touch. Vision has the advantage that shapes {{can be seen at}} a distance, but touch has the advantage that during exploration many additional object properties become available, such as temperature (Jones, 2009), texture (Bensmaia, 2009), and weight (Jones, 1986). Moreover, also the invisible backside of the objects can provide shape information (Newell et al., 2001). In active touch, both the cuteanous sense (input from skin receptors) and the kinesthetic sense (input from receptors located in muscles, tendons, and joints) play a role. For such active <b>tactual</b> <b>perception,</b> the term “haptic perception” is used (Loomis and Lederman, 1986). Typical exploratory movements to determine shape by touch are “enclosure” for global shape and size, and “contour following” for exact shape (Lederman and Klatzky, 1987; Klatzky and Reed, 2009). By means of touch, both three-dimensional and two-dimensional shapes can be recognized, although the latter is much harder...|$|R
