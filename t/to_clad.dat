25|$|Craftsmen and {{designers}} utilize copper’s inherent benefits to build aesthetically pleasing and long-lasting building systems. From cathedrals to castles and from homes to offices, copper {{is used in}} many products: low-sloped and pitched roofs, soffits, fascias, flashings, gutters, downspouts, building expansion joints, domes, spires, and vaults. Copper is also used <b>to</b> <b>clad</b> walls and other surfaces in the exterior and interior environment.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the grain}} of Yule Marble that gives an {{appearance}} of smooth texture, a homogeneous look, and a luminous surface that polishes well. These qualities are why it has been chosen {{for a number of}} major national and state landmarks, most notably the Lincoln Memorial. Because of its aesthetic value, architect Henry Bacon successfully urged that it be used <b>to</b> <b>clad</b> the whole exterior of the Memorial, even though it was the most expensive material.|$|E
500|$|A {{final design}} for the [...] "Freedom Tower" [...] was {{formally}} unveiled on June 28, 2005. To address security {{issues raised by the}} New York City Police Department, a [...] concrete base was added to the design in April of that year. The design originally included plans <b>to</b> <b>clad</b> the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building might have looked uninviting and resembled a [...] "concrete bunker". However, the prisms were later found to be unworkable, as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards. As a result, it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast-resistant glass.|$|E

500|$|A {{few years}} later, the field (which had no common ownership) was {{acquired}} by Joshua Flesher Hanson, a businessman. [...] By this time, Brighton's popularity was such that speculators were commissioning architects and builders to design and lay out large-scale sea-facing residential developments to attract wealthy long-term visitors or permanent residents. [...] Royal Crescent was already thriving; Clarence Square, Russell Square, Marine Parade and New Steine were being developed, and work had started on Bedford Square. [...] Hanson decided to follow the trend but take it in a new direction: he divided Belle Vue Field into 70 plots, leased them individually and put strict covenants in place, demanding that each house be built in a specific style {{in order to ensure}} architectural harmony. [...] In return, the leaseholders (mostly private builders) would have the right to buy, and would end up with houses much larger than average for the town, with excellent sea views and with exclusive access to the large central garden. [...] Most leaseholders bought the houses as soon as they could, which was to Hanson's advantage as he made money and had no ongoing responsibility for the buildings. [...] Restrictions in the covenants included the requirement to erect a façade with an iron balcony, <b>to</b> <b>clad</b> the area below the balcony in stucco, to paint the façade at least every three years, to repair any damage, and to pay towards maintenance of the central garden. [...] No stucco was to be applied above the balcony line.|$|E
2500|$|The common method {{they all}} used was <b>to</b> <b>clad</b> the timber {{centring}} (also known as falsework) with planks, known as [...] "laggings", laid {{parallel with the}} abutments and carefully planed and levelled to approximate closely the required curve of the intrados of the arch. The positions of the courses {{in the vicinity of}} the crown were first marked out at right angles to the faces using long wooden straight-edges, then the remaining courses were marked out in parallel. The masons then laid the stones, cutting them to shape as required.|$|E
2500|$|The {{localized}} geology {{created a}} marble that is 99.5% pure calcite, {{with a grain}} structure that gives a smooth texture, a homogeneous look, and a luminous surface. [...] It is these qualities {{for which it was}} selected <b>to</b> <b>clad</b> the exterior of the Lincoln Memorial {{and a variety of other}} buildings throughout the United States, in spite of being more expensive than other marbles. [...] The size of the deposits enables large blocks to be quarried, which is why the marble for the Tomb of the Unknowns, with its [...] die block, was quarried from Yule Marble.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{size of a}} Hopper Hut was either [...] by [...] or [...] by , though some were as large as [...] by [...] Early huts were of timber, and during {{the latter half of}} the 19th century corrugated iron sheets were used <b>to</b> <b>clad</b> them. Following the abolition of the brick tax in 1850, brick huts were built. Exterior walls were [...] thick and partitions between individual huts 4½" [...] (115mm) thick. During the 1930s and 1940s, some Hopper Huts were built of [...] by [...] breeze blocks, these being cheap and plentiful after the end of the war. A few huts were made from pre-cast concrete at this time. Nissen Huts were also used as accommodation for hop-pickers.|$|E
2500|$|One World Trade Center {{itself was}} met with {{criticism}} early in its planning and construction stages. The original design, which was asymmetrical, significantly shorter, and called for an off-center spire, {{was met with}} much disapproval, causing a new one to be devised. A key feature of the final design, the fortified, windowless base, was also denounced as looking dreary and unwelcoming. To alleviate this problem, the designers decided <b>to</b> <b>clad</b> it with prismatic glass panels. The name change from Freedom Tower to One World Trade Center was met with some criticism.

2500|$|William Hardwick succeeded Beasley as the Principal Architect in 1917 and {{oversaw the}} project {{from that point}} until its completion. [...] Although the end date given in the {{construction}} contract was October 1917, the building was not nearing completion and this term in the contract was waived. Over the course of construction, {{the design of the}} building had been modified several times, largely in an effort to reduce costs. In 1921 it was resolved to add a further two storeys {{to the top of the}} building for use by other Commonwealth departments. These additional storeys were to be walled with brickwork, rather than the stone used <b>to</b> <b>clad</b> the rest of the building's facade.

40|$|The dynamic; {{elastic modulus}} for {{directions}} {{in the plane}} of the cladding of a reactor pressure vessel was found to have an unusual low value of 165 GPa.
