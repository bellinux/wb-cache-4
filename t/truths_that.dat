5|$|Southey {{uses the}} poem to {{describe}} various superstitions and myths, {{with a heavy}} reliance on repetition of various themes that link the myths together. Although based in Islamic theology, most of the action is mechanical instead of emphasising possible moral <b>truths</b> <b>that</b> {{can be drawn from}} the plot. Though the main character is purported to be a Muslim, the story actually takes place thousands of years before Islam, in ancient Babylon. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the strong morality within the work or the quality of the poetry. However, other critics felt that the lack of a strong lyrical structure and the use of Middle Eastern myths detracted from the poem.|$|E
25|$|Theologians {{give the}} name mystery to {{revealed}} <b>truths</b> <b>that</b> surpass {{the powers of}} natural reason, so, in a narrow sense, the Mystery is a truth that transcends the created intellect.

25|$|In Christian faith, {{theologians and}} {{philosophers}} {{make a distinction}} between: (a) preambles of faith and (b) articles of faith. The preambles include alleged truths contained in revelation which are nevertheless demonstrable by reason, e.g., the immortality of the soul, the existence of God. The articles of faith, on the other hand, contain <b>truths</b> <b>that</b> cannot be proven or reached by reason alone and presuppose the truths of the preambles, e.g., the Holy Trinity, is not demonstrable and presupposes the existence of God.|$|E

25|$|What ontological hermeneutics {{is saying}} is here that the {{therapist}} strives to avoid an attitude of “expert” or “specialist” on human suffering and healing. Even though many mainstream counseling theories assume such roles, the position of ontological hermeneutics is that such roles create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client and should therefore be avoided. In fact, hermeneutic theory states that such positions are nonexistent. Therefore, therapist does not intervene with objective <b>truths</b> <b>that</b> are intended to disprove the client’s previously perpetuated ways of thinking and feeling. Fusing horizons “is, instead, a matter of integrating another’s horizon {{in such a way}} that the one’s own outlook is changed in the process”) so that both therapist and client are thus both authentically benefited. And, ontological hermeneutics holds that this process is only possible via authentic dialogue during which both therapist and client utilize their memory and imagination to develop therapeutic possibilities. Furthermore, through this process, empathy is seen as a deeper phenomenon (intropathy) for relating to others; the entire process being what may be referred to as empathic envisioning, and compels therapists to become subjective in their value-laden conversations.|$|E

500|$|For Whitehead {{the core}} of {{religion}} was individual. [...] While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact {{for its own sake}} before it is an external fact relating to others. [...] His most famous remark on religion is that [...] "religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious." [...] Whitehead saw religion as a system of general <b>truths</b> <b>that</b> transformed a person's character. [...] He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good – an idea which he called a [...] "dangerous delusion" [...] (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).|$|E
500|$|According to the Statement of Fundamental Truths, [...] "All believers are {{entitled}} to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek" [...] the baptism in the Spirit. It also states, [...] "This was the normal experience of all in the early Christian Church". It is a separate experience from and occurs after salvation. This baptism gives to the receiver an [...] "enduement of power for life and service, the bestowment of the gifts and their uses {{in the work of}} the ministry". There are four experiences listed in the Fundamental <b>Truths</b> <b>that</b> result from Spirit baptism: [...] "overflowing fullness of the Spirit", [...] "a deepened reverence for God", intensified consecration and dedication to God and his work, and [...] "a more active love for Christ, for His Word and for the lost". In addition, this experience initiates the believer in the use of spiritual gifts. The [...] "initial physical sign" [...] of having received this baptism is [...] "speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance".|$|E

500|$|To most philosophers, {{the word}} [...] "consciousness" [...] connotes the {{relationship}} between the mind and the world. To writers on spiritual or religious topics, it frequently connotes {{the relationship between}} the mind and God, or {{the relationship between the}} mind and deeper <b>truths</b> <b>that</b> are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world. [...] Krishna consciousness, for example, is a term used to mean an intimate linkage between the mind of a worshipper and the god Krishna. [...] The mystical psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke distinguished between three types of consciousness: [...] Simple Consciousness, awareness of the body, possessed by many animals; Self Consciousness, awareness of being aware, possessed only by humans; and Cosmic Consciousness, awareness of the life and order of the universe, possessed only by humans who are enlightened. [...] Many more examples could be given, such as the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by Prem Saran Satsangi and Stuart Hameroff. The most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be Ken Wilber's book The Spectrum of Consciousness, a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind. Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at higher levels.|$|E
500|$|Priestley's major {{argument}} in the Institutes was that the only revealed religious <b>truths</b> <b>that</b> could be accepted were those that matched one's experience of the natural world. Because his views of religion were deeply tied to his understanding of nature, the text's theism rested on the argument from design. The Institutes shocked and appalled many readers, primarily because it challenged basic Christian orthodoxies, such as the divinity of Christ and the miracle of the Virgin Birth. Methodists in Leeds penned a hymn asking God to [...] "the Unitarian fiend expel / And chase his doctrine back to Hell." [...] Priestley wanted to return Christianity to its [...] "primitive" [...] or [...] "pure" [...] form by eliminating the [...] "corruptions" [...] which had accumulated over the centuries. The fourth part of the Institutes, An History of the Corruptions of Christianity, became so long that {{he was forced to}} issue it separately in 1782. Priestley believed that the Corruptions was [...] "the most valuable" [...] work he ever published. In demanding that his readers apply the logic of the emerging sciences and comparative history to the Bible and Christianity, he alienated religious and scientific readers alike—scientific readers did not appreciate seeing science used in the defence of religion and religious readers dismissed the application of science to religion.|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those <b>truths</b> (<b>that</b> are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
