60|$|I {{heard the}} {{landlord}} yelling, {{and there was}} a long and systematic thumping somewhere, thump, thump, thump, and banging. I wondered where it was. I could not locate it at all, because my room lay beyond another large room: I had to go through a large room, by the foot of two beds, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> door; so I could not quite tell where anything was.|$|E

60|$|There was a {{crash and}} a sharp point cut my nose, but I was out upon the grass. Then there were twenty other crashes, and all the hounds were out too, for Tom had cheered them on. I ran {{to the edge of}} the lawn and saw a steep slope leading to the sands and the sea. Now I knew what the sea was, for after Tom had shot me in the back I lived by it for a long while, and once swam across a little creek <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> form, from which it cut me off.|$|E
6000|$|... “Midshipman Howard is killed, sir, and Lieutenant Ayling and Midshipman James very {{severely}} wounded. I myself had a {{very narrow}} escape. I slipped upon some blood, and two Moors rushed at me and would have killed me had not that boy Gilmore thrown himself between us. He waved his cutlass about wildly, and, principally from good luck, I think, cut down one of them. On this the other attacked him, and I had time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> feet again. As soon as I was up I ran the Moor through, but not before he had given the boy a very ugly wound on the arm.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{will be a}} dance {{when the}} croquet is over. I don't dance--and I shall not be missed. There will be time, and {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own room. I shall leave a letter there for Lady Lundie, and a letter"--her voice trembled for a moment--"and a letter for Blanche. Don't interrupt me! I have thought of this, as I have thought of every thing else. The confession I shall make will be the truth in a few hours, if it's not the truth now. My letters will say I am privately married, and called away unexpectedly to join my husband. There will be a scandal in the house, I know. But {{there will be no}} excuse for sending after me, when I am under my husband's protection. So far as you are personally concerned there are no discoveries to fear--and nothing which it is not perfectly safe and perfectly easy to do. Wait here an hour after I have gone to save appearances; and then follow me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was anxious}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> regiment, sir, as I was afraid that, if I {{did not return}} before the next {{campaign}} opened, some other officer might be appointed to its command." ...|$|R
60|$|No; I can't harness up one horse. But I can four, which compels me to back {{up again}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> beginning. Having {{selected}} Sonoma Valley for our abiding place, Charmian and I decided it was about time we knew what we had in our own county and the neighbouring ones. How to do it, was the first question. Among our many weaknesses is the one of being old- fashioned. We don't mix with gasolene very well. And, as true sailors should, we naturally gravitate toward horses. Being one of those lucky individuals who carries his office under his hat, I should {{have to take a}} typewriter and a load of books along. This put saddle-horses out of the running. Charmian suggested driving a span. She had faith in me; besides, she could drive a span herself. But when I thought of the many mountains to cross, and of crossing them for three months with a poor tired span, I vetoed the proposition and said we'd have to come back to gasolene after all. This she vetoed just as emphatically, and a deadlock obtained until I received inspiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tell me 'if it could'--it must be done. Do {{you think}} I could sleep under this roof, propped {{up by the}} timbers of that ruined tienda? Do you think I could wear those {{diamonds}} again, while that termagant shop-woman can say that her money bought them? No! If you are my husband's friend you will do this--for--for his sake." [...] She stopped, locked and interlocked her cold fingers before her, and said, hesitating and mechanically, [...] "You meant well, Captain Poindexter, in bringing me here, I know! You must not think that I blame you for it, or for the miserable result of it that you have just witnessed. But if I have gained anything by it, for God's sake let me reap it quickly, that I may give it to these people and go! I {{have a friend who}} can aid me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> husband or to my home in Kentucky, where Spencer will yet find me, I know. I want nothing more." [...] She stopped again. With another woman the pause would have been one of tears. But she kept her head above the flood that filled her heart, and the clear eyes fixed upon Poindexter, albeit pained, were undimmed.|$|E
6000|$|DEAREST AUNT,--I {{think you}} hardly know {{what are my}} [...] sufferings. I truly believe that I have {{deserved}} them, but [...] nevertheless they are insupportable. I cannot marry Peter [...] Steinmarc. I have tried it, and cannot. The day is very [...] near now; but were it to come nearer, I should go mad, or I [...] should kill myself. I think {{that you do not}} know what the [...] feeling is that has made me the most wretched of women since [...] this marriage was first proposed to me. I shall go away [...] to-morrow, and shall try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle's house in [...] Cologne. It is a long way off, and perhaps I shall never get [...] there: but if I am to die on the road, oh, how much better [...] will that be! I do not want to live. I have made you [...] unhappy, and everybody unhappy, but I do not think that [...] anybody has been so unhappy as I am. I shall give you [...] a kiss as I go out, and you will think that it was the [...] kiss of Judas; but I am not a Judas in my heart. Dear [...] aunt Charlotte, I would have borne it if I could,--Your [...] affectionate, but undutiful niece, ...|$|E

6000|$|My first John Knox is in proof, and {{my second}} {{is on the}} anvil. It is very good of me so to do; for I want so much <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> real tour and my sham tour, the real tour first; it is always working in my head, and if I can only turn on the right sort of style at the right moment, I am not much afraid of it. One thing bothers me; what with {{hammering}} at this J. K., and writing necessary letters, and taking necessary exercise (that even not enough, the weather is so repulsive to me, cold and windy), I find I have no time for reading except times of fatigue, when I wish merely to relax myself. O--and I read over again for this purpose Flaubert's Tentation de St. Antoine; it struck me a good deal at first, but this second time it has fetched me immensely. I am but just done with it, so you will know the large proportion of salt to take with my present statement, that it's the finest thing I ever read! Of course, it isn't that, it's full of longueurs, and is not quite [...] "redd up," [...] {{as we say in}} Scotland, not quite articulated; but there are splendid things in it.|$|E
6000|$|He had a {{house now}} at Mortlake on the Thames with a great ivy tod {{shadowing}} door and window, and one night there he shocked and startled a roomful of men by showing how far he could be swept beyond our reach in reveries of affection. The dull man, {{who had tried to}} put Wilde out of countenance, suddenly said to the whole room, roused by I cannot remember what incautious remark of mine made to some man at my side: [...] "Yeats believes in magic; what nonsense." [...] Henley said, [...] "No, it may not be nonsense; black magic is all the go in Paris now." [...] And then turning towards me with a changed sound in his voice, [...] "It is just a game, isn't it." [...] I replied, not noticing till too late his serious tone, and wishing to avoid discussion in the dull man's company, [...] "One has had a vision; one wants to have another, that is all." [...] Then Henley said, speaking in a very low voice, [...] "I want to know how I am <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> daughter. I was sitting here the other night when she came into the room and played round the table and went out again. Then I saw that the door was shut and I knew that I had seen a vision." [...] There was an embarrassed silence, and then somebody spoke of something else and we began to discuss it hurriedly and eagerly.|$|E

5000|$|To Rap-Up, he {{recently}} explained {{about the concept}} of the song 'Speedin' itself. [...] "The concept of the song is that I'm racing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> girl because I love her and I care about her," [...] He gushed. [...] "It has so many meanings too, not just racing time. We're racing like whether or not we're gonna be together." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, {{regarding}} right-to-work legislation, Walker {{told reporters}} at the state Republican Party convention that [...] "It's not going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> desk ... I'm {{going to do everything}} in my power to make sure it isn't there because my focal point (is) private sector unions have overwhelmingly come to the table to be my partner in economic development." [...] While campaigning for re-election in 2014, Walker again said he had no plans to pursue right-to-work legislation focused on private unions.|$|E
5000|$|Christian Broadcasting Networks Lisa Webber said [...] "so often music {{tends to}} remain {{background}} noise. Believer {{is not one}} of those records. As cliché as it may sound, it compels you {{to make a difference in}} the world and to draw closer to God. The tempo of the music changes quite drastically between some of the songs, but the underlying tone never changes. Although their style is certainly not for everyone, this may be one of their best albums yet. It features several songs of a more rock style and several traditional Contemporary Christian music sounding tracks." [...] Webber further noted [...] "On most albums, one or two songs usually stand out above the rest. With Believer, there is no need to skip over songs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> favorites." [...] Webber called the favorite tracks on the album are [...] "Even If", [...] "Carry On", [...] "All Yours".|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was for me to write two {{complete}} songs and <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know <b>my</b> creative process better. I wrote two songs, made musical arrangements for them, transcribed the music in Sibelius, rehearsed the material with two musicians and at last recorded it in a studio. Throughout this I kept track of my own creative process. The project resulted in two complete songs with arrangement. I learned that I have some difficulty handling adversities in my songwriting, {{and that it was}} not so easy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know <b>my</b> own creative process as I thought. But the most important thing I will bring with me from this project is the great value of being truly proud of something I created of my own. Bilaga: 1 CD</p...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] After {{several months}} of {{thinking}} {{about what is happening}} to the working class, particularly the steel industry and the whole system of labor, this poem came to me. I drive by Homestead Mill every morning <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> job and to get home I drive past the J 2 ̆ 6 L Steel Mill. Occasionally, I drive through Braddock to the house and street where most of my life was spent. These are some of the contributing factors which also helped to crystallize this poem...|$|E
40|$|I {{start this}} chapter by reprising and adding to {{a quote from}} Robert Cover that has already {{appeared}} in this book. Stripped back {{to a form of}} aphorism, or principle, these remaining words look like a formula that inevitably disregards the 2 ̆ 7 sacared stories/texts 2 ̆ 7 of literature and tradition that Cover avers as law. I realise that to not step into the story a little would be to frustrate, the desire to know what happened next appealing to most of us. but I have already distorted the narrative, for the aphorism does not begin Cover 2 ̆ 7 s tale, but sits smack in the middle. While it will take me a little while <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> point, I will let you know now that my use of cover will not go in quite the direction that you might expect. My act of disuption is theatrical, written to perturb the comfortable experience of following through an argument that has defined contours and patterns, as form of Brechtian disruption, a form of encounter that I hope will demand a response, though it mut be through text rather than actual encounter...|$|E
