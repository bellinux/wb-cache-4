5|$|A {{consensus}} formed {{within the}} European diplomatic community in Constantinople that {{the persecution of}} the accused Jews had to be stopped.

Consequently, the way was open for Lord Ponsonby, by far the most powerful diplomat in Constantinople, to intervene unopposed on behalf the Jews of Rhodes.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Wilhelm Fränger {{argued that}} the triptych's center panel portrays a joyous world when mankind will {{experience}} a rebirth of <b>the</b> <b>innocence</b> enjoyed by Adam and Eve before their fall.

This radical group, active in the area of the Rhine and the Netherlands, strove for a form of spirituality immune from sin even in the flesh and imbued the concept of lust with a paradisical innocence.|$|E

5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that {{there ought to be a}} political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes <b>the</b> <b>innocence</b> of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Nebraska <b>Innocence</b> Project works {{primarily}} with cases involving DNA testing. According to <b>the</b> New York <b>Innocence</b> Project, more than 75% {{of people who}} have been exonerated in the United States through DNA testing, have served in prison on the basis of faulty eyewitness accounts. Meanwhile, a recent change to Nebraska state law will allow the project to look at cases not involving DNA such as arson cases, Shaken Baby Syndrome, bite marks, and show print-analysis. <b>The</b> Nebraska <b>Innocence</b> Project relies on the work of volunteers and essentially works without a budget. A partnership between the Nebraska chapter and <b>the</b> Midwest <b>Innocence</b> Project, which launched in October 2015, allows Nebraska to take advantage of <b>the</b> Midwest <b>Innocence</b> Project's paid administration, which they intend to do by hiring a paid legal director. To exonerate wrongfully convicted prisoners, <b>the</b> Nebraska <b>Innocence</b> Project sends requests to <b>the</b> Midwest <b>Innocence</b> Project, based in Kansas City, Missouri who prepares the cases and sends them back to Nebraska for investigation and possible litigation. Legal director, Tricia Bushnell assists the Nebraska chapter by organizing cases and finding experts who could help the case.|$|R

5|$|On 5 August 1869, {{shortly after}} The Vicar {{had begun to}} appear in the form of monthly numbers, Dion Boucicault's Formosa; or, The Railroad to Ruin opened at Drury Lane. The title {{character}} of Boucicault's play was a harlot, and her representation on stage provoked an exchange in the pages of The Times. Critics argued that the depiction of a prostitute in the theatre would tarnish <b>the</b> <b>innocence</b> of unmarried girls attending the performance. Supporters, including Boucicault himself, responded that worse women were regularly portrayed in Italian operas such as La traviata and Lucrezia Borgia, which were considered eminently suitable for young women, and in the police and court news of The Times itself.|$|E
5|$|When Allen completes his Exorcist {{training}} he {{is sent to}} Black Order headquarters, {{where he}} meets other Exorcists. With his new comrades, he goes with other Exorcists on missions to recover other Innocences scattered around the world. Allen finds people compatible with <b>the</b> <b>Innocence,</b> who become his allies. He fights the Millennium Earl, his army of Akuma and the Noah Family, a group of immortal humans who help the Earl and want to destroy the world. Allen and four other Exorcists are sent to locate and protect Cross, since the Millennium Earl has attacked Exorcist generals in his search for the Heart (the most powerful Innocence). Allen leaves the group to save a traitor from the Black Order, and a Noah (Tyki Mikk) nearly kills him. Allen stays at the Black Order's Asia Branch headquarters {{to recover from the}} experience.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} Allen's {{interactions}} with other characters during the series, and IGN's Richard Osborn enjoyed the comic relief of his clashes with Kanda against the series' dark plot. John Rose of the Fandom Post considered {{the team of}} Allen and fellow Exorcist Yu Kanda the greatest strength of the manga's second volume. In a later review, Rose enjoyed the plotline in which Allen was unable to distinguish innocents from Akumas. Allen's rematch with enemy Noah Tyki Mikk was praised by Casey Brienza of Anime News Network. Brienza also liked his new abilities, <b>the</b> <b>Innocence</b> Crown Clown and Allen's sword, comparing it to a sword in Final Fantasy VII wielded by protagonist Cloud Strife. Reviewing the same fight, Otaku USAs Joseph Luster praised Allen's development during the series and enjoyed his battle with Tyki. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin liked Allen's situation in volume 21, and wanted {{to see more of}} the same instead of the focus on Kanda's fight against the Akuma of Alma Karma. During Allen's imprisonment for saving Alma, Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network found the growing camaraderie between Allen and Tyki interesting; it led to Allen's decision to leave the Order after putting his comrades in danger, and his goodbye to Lenalee was mournful.|$|E

5|$|Set in an {{alternate}} 19th century, the story focuses on {{an organization of}} exorcists, named the Black Order, as they defend humanity against the Noah Family, reincarnations of Noah and his 12 apostles whom bear hatred towards humanity and God led by a man known as the Millennium Earl. The exorcists' main weapon against the Noah Family are sentient holy artifacts called Innocence. Innocence comes {{in a variety of}} forms, varying from everyday objects such as boots to grandfather clocks, to weapons such as swords and guns; regardless of their form, each Innocence possesses unique offensive and supportive abilities and will only work for the wielder of their choosing. Out of the 109 Innocence hidden and scattered throughout the world, {{one of them is the}} master Innocence; whichever side obtains this Innocence first will win the war. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>Innocence,</b> the Noah Family's weapons are derived from a power source known as Dark Matter. Dark Matter, grants the Noah superpowers, along with the ability to create and control demons.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and his concept of justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker. The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to <b>the</b> <b>innocence</b> of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals {{the extent to which they}} have been desensitized by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E
