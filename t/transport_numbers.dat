For example, {{in a solution}} of sodium chloride, {{less than half of}} the current is carried by the positively charged sodium ions (cations) and more than half is carried by the negatively charged chloride ions (anions) because the chloride ions are able to move faster, i.e., chloride ions have higher mobility than sodium ions.

Measurement of the concentration changes in the anode and cathode compartments determines the <b>transport</b> <b>numbers.</b> The exact relationship depends {{on the nature of}} the reactions at the two electrodes. For the electrolysis of aqueous copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) as an example, with Cu2+(aq) and SO(aq) ions, the cathode reaction is the reduction Cu2+(aq) + 2 e− → Cu(s) and the anode reaction is the corresponding oxidation of Cu to Cu2+. At the cathode, the passage of [...] coulombs of electricity leads to the reduction of [...] moles of Cu2+, where [...] is the Faraday constant. Since the Cu2+ ions carry a fraction t+ of the current, the quantity of Cu2+ flowing into the cathode compartment is t+ moles, so there is a net decrease of Cu2+ in the cathode compartment equal to (1-t+) = t-. This decrease may be measured by chemical analysis in order to evaluate the <b>transport</b> <b>numbers.</b> Analysis of the anode compartment gives a second pair of values as a check, while there should be no change of concentrations in the central compartment unless diffusion of solutes has led to significant mixing during the time of the experiment and invalidated the results.|$|E

50|$|The liquid {{junction}} potential {{interferes with}} the exact measurement of the electromotive force of a chemical cell, so its effect should be minimized {{as much as possible}} for accurate measurement. The most common method of eliminating the liquid junction potential is to place a salt bridge consisting of a saturated solution of potassium chloride (KCl) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) with lithium acetate (CH3COOLi) between the two solutions constituting the junction. When such a bridge is used, the ions in the bridge are present in large excess at the junction and they carry almost the whole of the current across the boundary.

50|$|For example, the <b>transport</b> <b>numbers</b> of {{hydrochloric}} acid (HCl(aq)) may {{be determined by}} electrolysis between a cadmium anode and a Ag-AgCl cathode. The anode reaction is Cd → Cd2+ + 2 e− so that a cadmium chloride (CdCl2) solution is formed near the anode and moves toward the cathode during the experiment. An acid-base indicator such as bromophenol blue is added to make visible {{the boundary between the}} acidic HCl solution and the near-neutral CdCl2 solution. The boundary tends to remain sharp since the leading solution HCl has a higher conductivity that the indicator solution CdCl2, and therefore a lower electric field to carry the same current. If a more mobile H+ ion diffuses into the CdCl2 solution, it will rapidly be accelerated back to the boundary by the higher electric field; if a less mobile Cd2+ ion diffuses into the HCl solution it will decelerate in the lower electric field and return to the CdCl2 solution. Also the apparatus is constructed with the anode below the cathode, so that the denser CdCl2 solution forms at the bottom.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was {{to demonstrate that the}} efficiency of iontophoretic transport across the skin (which is measured in terms of an ion's <b>transport</b> <b>number),</b> either for drug delivery or for therapeutic drug monitoring, depends implicitly on the molar fraction of the species of interest over a wide range of experimental conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Three sets of data from the literature were assessed to establish the direct relationship between <b>transport</b> <b>number</b> and mole fraction. Linear regression between these parameters yielded slopes which correlated with the charge-carrying efficiency of the ion considered.

The donor solutions comprised the single ion and binary mixtures of the two cations at different pH. Sodium and lithium iontophoretic fluxes showed low inter-nail variability and were significantly greater than passive fluxes. Cationic <b>transport</b> <b>numbers</b> clearly increased as the pH was sequentially raised from 4. 0 to 5. 0 and then to 7. 0, in agreement with a net negative charge of the human nails at physiological pH. Sodium transport number was maximal when the ion was formulated as a single ion (absence of competing co-ions) and decreased as the molar fraction of lithium was increased in the vehicle. The magnitude of the <b>transport</b> <b>numbers</b> measured and their response to changes in the cations' molar fraction and pH in the donor solution were remarkably similar to those observed during the transdermal iontophoresis. The ratio of lithium and sodium <b>transport</b> <b>numbers</b> was directly proportional to their relative concentration ratios; the proportionality constant being remarkably similar in the 4. 0 - 7. 0 pH range {{as well as to the}} ratio of the cations' aqueous mobilities.
