5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>{{prisoner}}s</b> <b>were</b> {{marched to}} the city of Trier, with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were {{marched to the}} river Scheldt and were sent by barge to the Ruhr. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> then sent by rail to prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority (those below the rank of corporal) then worked in German industry and agriculture {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In September 1862 Helm {{and several}} other {{citizens}} from Hardin County were arrested by Colonel Knox. After several days of confinement in Elizabethtown <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> conducted to Louisville. By chance, Kentucky governor James F. Robinson recognized Helm in the group and negotiated with General Jeremiah Boyle to get him released. Shortly after returning home Helm learned of Benjamin's death at the Battle of Chickamauga.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days of the battle, the {{evacuation}} of the Vukovar hospital was negotiated between Croatian authorities, the JNA and the European Community Monitor Mission in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The JNA subsequently refused the ICRC access to the hospital despite the agreement and removed approximately 300 people from its premises. The group, largely consisting of Croats but also including Serbs, Hungarians, Muslims and two foreign nationals who fought on the side of the Croatian National Guard, was initially transported to the JNA barracks in Vukovar. Several prisoners were identified as hospital staff and removed from the group to be returned to the hospital while the rest of them were transported to the Ovčara farm south of Vukovar. Once at the farm, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> beaten for several hours before the JNA pulled its troops from the site, leaving the prisoners in the custody of the Croatian Serb TO and Serbian paramilitaries. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> then taken to a prepared site, shot in groups of ten to twenty and buried in a mass grave.|$|E
50|$|Under Nebraska's {{discretionary}} parole system, all <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> reviewed {{each year}} {{regardless of whether}} they were yet eligible for parole. At this initial hearing, the Board examined <b>the</b> <b>prisoner's</b> entire preconfinement and postconfinement record and considered any statements or letters <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> presented on his own behalf. If the Board determined at this initial hearing that <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> not suitable for parole, then parole <b>was</b> denied and <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> informed as to the Board's reasons for denying parole. If, however, the Board determined at the initial hearing that <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> suitable for parole, then it scheduled a final parole hearing. At this final parole hearing, <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> permitted to present evidence on his behalf and to be represented by private counsel of his choice. He was not, however, permitted to cross-examine witnesses or hear any evidence presented against him. The hearing was recorded.

50|$|As of March 2013 a {{prisoner}} typically {{comes from his}} regularly assigned unit to Jester IV for several days of psychiatric treatment.

5|$|On July 18, 1947, Speer and his six fellow prisoners, all {{former high}} {{officials}} of the Nazi regime, were flown from Nuremberg to Berlin under heavy guard. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> taken to Spandau Prison in the British Sector of what became West Berlin, where they were designated by number, with Speer given Number Five. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> kept in solitary confinement for all but half an hour a day, and were not permitted to address each other or their guards. As time passed, the strict regimen was relaxed, especially during the three months in four that the three Western powers were in control; the four occupying powers took overall control on a monthly rotation. Speer considered himself an outcast among his fellow prisoners for his acceptance of responsibility at Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{fourteen}} killed, {{including the}} captain, and 44 wounded, while the French suffered five killed and ten wounded. The privateers were then granted {{one hour of}} free pillaging on Kent before Surcouf restored order; however, the female passengers were strictly protected and sentries were {{placed in front of}} their apartments. Amongst <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> General Frederick St. John and his wife, Arabella Craven.|$|E
5|$|The {{battered}} Junon {{was taken}} in tow to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she was repaired and later commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> also landed in Nova Scotia, including Rousseau, who died from his wounds soon afterwards. The French lost approximately 130 casualties; British losses were seven killed and 26 wounded on Horatio, six wounded on Latona and one man wounded on Driver.|$|E
50|$|Once a <b>prisoner</b> enters <b>the</b> prison, {{his or her}} {{original}} name is no longer used. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> referred by number. The number consists of two parts, with the first two digits indicating <b>the</b> year <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> sent to Qincheng prison, while the remaining digits are the sequential number. For example, prisoner 6299 means that <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> sent to <b>the</b> prison in 1962, while he or she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 99th <b>prisoner</b> sent to Qincheng Prison that year.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> supervillain <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> jailed in an {{area known}} as [...] "the Pipeline." [...] The Pipeline is the dark, dank {{basement}} of Iron Heights where <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> treated under awful living conditions with little food or water. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> kept in their costumes so the guards can identify them immediately. Guards have orders to shoot any [...] "mask" [...] spotted outside the Pipeline.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> {{forced to}} perform hard and {{dangerous}} slave labor with primitive means in mining and agriculture. The food rations are very small, so <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> constantly on <b>the</b> brink of starvation. In {{combination with the}} hard work, this leads to huge numbers of prisoners dying. An estimated 40% of prisoners die from malnutrition. Moreover, many <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> crippled from work accidents, frostbite or torture. There is a rigid punishment system in <b>the</b> camp. <b>Prisoners</b> who work too slowly or do not obey an order are beaten or tortured. In cases of stealing food or attempting to escape, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> publicly executed.|$|R
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E
5|$|According to Leutnant zur See Hans-Otto Brodt, their {{commanding}} officer Korvettenkapitän Heinz Bucholz and another 50 {{men of the}} crew of 64, went down with the ship. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> sent to the sick bay for treatment of shock and exposure and supplied with fresh clothing that had been provided by the Red Cross. Until Omaha put in at Bahia, on 15 February, where they debarked and were transported to Recife, the Germans were placed under armed guard.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{organizational}} problems, the weakened detachment {{reached an}} {{area near the}} village of Košute where they were engaged by Ustaše Militia backed by Italian reinforcements. After a day of fighting and the death of one of their commanders, members of the detachment began to retreat. In the end, the Partisans suffered four killed in action and 25 taken prisoner, while 13 managed to escape. All but three of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> later executed by firing squad. A Split Detachment was reformed, but most of its fighters were part of the 3rd Dalmatian Assault Brigade.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, Italians {{were chosen}} to carry the {{oilcloth}} litter which covered <b>the</b> <b>prisoner.</b> Yet according to Pagnol, carriers who did not speak <b>the</b> <b>prisoner's</b> language <b>were</b> chosen {{to prevent him from}} making revelations, which indicates that <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> not Italian.|$|R

5|$|Al-Kharrat {{commenced}} guerrilla {{operations in}} September, targeting French forces posted {{in the eastern}} and southern Ghouta. His prominence rose as he led nighttime raids against the French in Damascus, during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage. In al-Shaghour, Souk Saruja and Jazmatiyya, al-Kharrat and his band burnt down all French-held buildings. In {{the first week of}} October, sixty French gendarmes were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al-Kharrat and his fighters. The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al-Malihah's mukhtar (village headman). In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, killing one gendarme and capturing the rest; <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> eventually all returned unharmed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E
5|$|Between late February {{and early}} March 1945, with {{the advance of}} the Allied armies, all {{production}} of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. The equipment and supplies were packed and transported, with the prisoners, to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, arriving on 12 March. Shortly afterwards Krüger arranged for a further transfer to the Redl-Zipf series of tunnels where they were to restart production. The order to resume production was soon rescinded, and <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> ordered to destroy the cases of money they had with them. That which was not burnt by the prisoners was loaded onto trucks with the printing equipment and sunk in the Toplitz and Grundlsee lakes.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, {{in which}} Portugal joined the Allies, Caldas {{had one of}} three {{internment}} camps in the country. In 1916, most Germans in Portugal were deported, but men aged 15–45 were imprisoned to prevent their joining the German military. Originally, all of the approximately 700 prisoners were shipped to Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island in the Azores, where they were held at the Fortress of São João Baptista. In 1918, to reduce overcrowding at the fortress, 168 internees were moved to Caldas, where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I (Pavilhões do Parque). <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> released the following year, {{after the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} repatriations, {{returned}} prisoners were generally treated with pity, suspicion and disdain by French civilians. Many {{believed that they}} had only been allowed to return in exchange for agreeing to collaborate. Later Vichy propaganda had implied that prisoners lived in good conditions, so many civilians believed that the prisoners had suffered much less than civilians during the conflict. As veterans of the 1940 Battle of France, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> blamed for the French defeat and portrayed as cowards who had surrendered, rather than fight to the death. They were also unfavourably compared with other men of their generation who {{had served in the}} Free French Forces or Resistance.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs {{founded the}} Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. Trade unions were legal {{but because the}} members swore an oath of allegiance, they were arrested and tried in the Shire Hall. Beneath the {{courtroom}} are cells where <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> held while awaiting trial. Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013. Plans have since been made to erect 189 dwellings and a museum on the site.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Republika Srpska {{authorities}} charged seven Bosnian Croat {{officials and}} HVO officers with the killings of 19 Serb civilians and 20 {{members of the}} Bosnian Serb TO {{in the area of}} Kupres in 1992. The charges also pertained to the abuse of 18 prisoners of war captured in the Battle of Kupres. In 2013, Croatian authorities in Šibenik charged 21 former members of the JNA with the abuse of 23 HVO prisoners of war. The charges specify that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> detained and abused in Knin prison between 24 April and 14 May. The abuse is alleged to have caused the deaths of two of the prisoners and grave injuries to three others.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They {{were unable to}} find any, but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable to find any evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{first ten}} months of Nayyouf's {{sentence}} were served in Sednaya Prison outside Damascus. While at Sednaya, Nayyouf tried {{to organize a}} prisoner revolt. He was moved to Palmyra prison near Tadmur. In 1993, Nayyouf went on a thirteen-day hunger strike at Palmyra in order to protest the torture of prisoners. While at Palmyra, Nayyouf was able to pass evidence that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> being tortured to the press outside, which led to another transfer to Mezzeh prison, a military prison outside Damascus. Most of his ten-year sentence was spent in solitary confinement in Mezzeh.|$|E
