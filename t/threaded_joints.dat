First, the critical relative slippage (Scr), {{less than the}} displacement in which the <b>thread</b> <b>joints</b> can keep the fastening, are obtained by the cyclic loading tests. Then, this critical relative slippage is estimated according to the theoretically ob-tained equation by considering the bending deformation of bolt and the geometrical constraint condition. The inclination compliance (kw) of the bolt head used in this equation is evaluated by comparing the experimental result with the corresponding analytical one. In consideration of the nonlinearity of kw {{with respect to the}} bolt axial tension, the Scr is well estimated by this equation.

50|$|When {{stainless}} steel parts such as {{nuts and bolts}} are forced together, the oxide layer can be scraped off, allowing the parts to weld together. When forcibly disassembled, the welded material may be torn and pitted, a destructive effect known as galling. Galling can be avoided {{by the use of}} dissimilar materials for the parts forced together, for example bronze and {{stainless steel}}, or even different types of stainless steels (martensitic against austenitic). However, two different alloys electrically connected in a humid, even mildly acidic environment may act as a voltaic pile and corrode faster. Nitronic alloys, made by selective alloying with manganese and nitrogen, may have a reduced tendency to gall. Additionally, <b>threaded</b> <b>joints</b> may be lubricated to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling.

Dynamic properties are defined by exciting transient process between bolt head and tightened by this bolt detail using as short as possible force impact.
