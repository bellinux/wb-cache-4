50|$|<b>Crop</b> <b>tops</b> {{have been}} worn by men {{generally}} during the 1970s and the 1980s. The protective gear of American Football with no shirt resembles a <b>crop</b> <b>top.</b> Eventually <b>cropped</b> jerseys became available which carried over to several 1980s telecasts. Men also started to wear <b>crop</b> <b>tops</b> regardless of sport. Because of the varied acceptance for men wearing no shirt (eliminating {{the need for}} a <b>crop</b> <b>top),</b> and due to a change in school dress codes as well as peer pressure, men usually have no need nor wish for <b>crop</b> <b>tops.</b> Various <b>crop</b> <b>tops</b> have been worn by rappers as well as American Football athletes. However, in 2015 the NCAA has increased restrictions on men wearing <b>crop</b> <b>tops</b> which also includes rolling up longer jerseys. However, the NFL has permitted to Elliott to wear rolled up jersey until September 2016. This is an isolated event, as most other sport uniforms (including the NFL) require men to wear long shirts.|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s, cutoff crop tops {{became more}} common {{as part of}} the aerobic craze {{and as a result of}} the {{popularity}} of the movie Flashdance. Singer Madonna wore a mesh crop top in her video for the song Lucky Star. It became common for women to crop sections of workout wear, such as sleeves, collars, and the hem of the shirt to create a loose-fitting top which was often worn over a body suit or tank <b>top.</b> <b>Crop</b> tops were also often paired with low-slung belts in the 1980s, angled at the side of the hip. But its popularity embarks on the 1990s. As mesh fabrics and oversized aerobics gear went out of fashion by the 1990s, the crop top reappeared in the form of the bustier, a lingerie-style shirt which revealed the midriff and was typically worn under a blazer or shirt. By the mid-1990s, the crop top took on the form of the babydoll shirt, a cropped, tight-fitting T-shirt which often featured graphic logos. Long-sleeved crop tops and even crop turtleneck tops also became fashionable for the first time, popularized by such public figures as country singer Shania Twain. By the late 1990s, crop tops had become so mainstream that many schools expressly banned garments that expose the midriff in their dress code.|$|E

The inevitable generation of reactive oxygen species was countered to a significantly smaller extent in the O 3 -sensitive cultivar, because of constitutively lower activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase than the O 3 -tolerant cultivar.

40|$|An ozone {{treatment}} of 165 nL L− 1 for 3 h evoked differential {{responses in the}} primary leaves of two bean cultivars of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). While cv ‘Cannellino’ showed visible symptoms of injury within 24 h of exposure, no visible symptoms at all were evident in the cv ‘Top Crop’. In primary leaves of the sensitive cultivar Cannellino, we observed an increase in carbon breakdown (an increase in PFK and Fumarase) {{and a reduction in}} CO 2 photoassimilation, linked also to the diminished synthesis of sucrose (a decrease in SPS activity) and to the stimulation of the degradation of this sugar (an increase in SuSy and Invertase activities). A strong stimulation of PEPcase activity indicates both an increased synthesis of OAA and an enhanced replenishment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Finally, in Cannellino leaves the activity of NADP-malic enzyme increased indicating a stimulation of enzymes delivering NADPH. The findings of this research suggest that the visible symptoms in Cannellino represent an active response that this cultivar initiates to cope with excess oxidative load. The pattern in <b>Top</b> <b>Crop</b> was different. This cultivar did not show visible symptoms of injury, nor any responsive changes at the physiological and biochemical levels. Oxidative pathways are partially enhanced, e. g., increases in Invertase, PFK and IDH. Therewere also increases in some enzyme linked to the production of cytosolic NADPH as G 6 PD, probably caused by the slight increase in activity of the enzymes SKDH and PAL involved in synthesis of phenolic compounds. However, the absence of visible injury in <b>Top</b> <b>Crop</b> leaves is confirmation that, in this cultivar, the need to produce carbon skeleton and NADPH used in detoxification and repair process is lower...|$|E

40|$|Decisions {{pertaining}} to crop termination and late season pesticide applications are best made {{with an understanding}} of the maturity status of late season cotton bolls. Research conducted by Silvertooth (2001) has shown that the standard Arizona cotton heat unit (HU) system (Brown, 2013) can be used to predict boll maturity (hard, green boll; fiber elongation completed) and boll opening. This work indicates 600 HUs are required after flowering for a boll to reach physiological maturity, and an additional 400 HUs are required for the mature boll to open (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Approximately 600 HUs are required after flowering for a boll to reach physiological maturity (hard green boll). An additional 400 HUs are required for the mature boll to open.

In the 1960 s, about 1, 000 sod farms encompassing 105, 000 acres were estimated to be generating annual farm-level revenues of roughly $ 100 million nationally (Lokey, 1984). By 1995, the industry was estimated to include 30 million acres generating $ 45 billion in revenue (Duble, 1996).

40|$|A foliar {{spray of}} 10 mm cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (CHC), a {{component}} of the growth stimulant naphthenic acid, to primary leaves of 14 -day-old plants of bush bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., cv <b>Top</b> <b>Crop,</b> resulted in increased vegetative growth and pod production. One minute after the application of 0. 5 mm CHC- 7 - 14 C (CHC*) to a primary leaf, CHC* was present within it. The chief conversion of the CHC* in the leaf during the interval 15 minutes to 4 hours after the acid had been applied appeared to be CHC* to its glucose conjugate (CHC*-G), and during 4 to 48 hours, CHC*-G to CHC*-aspartate and an unknown metabolite. Radioactivity was confined to the leaf for at least 1 hour, but by the 12 th hour was detected throughout the plant. In the interval 1 to 4 weeks after CHC* application, the mean percentage distribution of radioactivity was: treated leaf, 65. 3; roots, 18. 8; stem, 7. 7; trifoliate leaves, 5. 9; flower buds-flowers-pods, 2. 3. During this period CHC*-G was the most prominent metabolite in all organs; no free CHC* was detected. Light favored the movement of CHC* conjugates out of the leaf; glucose fed to dark-grown plants substituted for light to some extent but aspartate was relatively ineffective, suggesting the dependence of outward movement on ATP. The presence of the glucose and aspartate conjugates of the acid in all organs of CHC-treated plants and the absence of free CHC from them suggest that one or both conjugates, rather than the acid itself, are involved in growth stimulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of pyrophosphate: fructose 6 -phosphate phosphotransferase (PFP) and ATP: fructose- 6 -phosphate 1 -phosphotransferase (PFK) was studied in germinating bean (Phaseolus vulgaris cv <b>Top</b> <b>Crop)</b> seeds. In the cotyledons the PFP activity was comparable {{with that of}} PFK. However, in the plumule and radicle plus hypocotyl, PFP activity exceeds that of PFK. Approximately 70 to 90 %, depending {{on the stage of}} germination, of the total PFP and PFK activities were present in the cotyledons. Highest specific activity of both enzymes, however, occurred in the radicle plus hypocotyl (64 - 90 nanomoles·min·milligram protein). Fractionation studies indicate that 40 % of the total PFK activity was associated with the plastids while PFP is apparently confined to the cytoplasm. The cytosolic isozyme of PFK exhibits hyperbolic kinetics with respect to fructose 6 -P and ATP with Km values of 320 and 46 micromolar, respectively. PFP also exhibits hyperbolic kinetics both in the presence and absence of the activator fructose- 2, 6 -P 2. The activation is caused by lowering the Km for fructose 6 -P from 18 to 1. 1 millimolar and that for pyrophosphate (PPi) from 40 to 25 micromolar, respectively. Levels of fructose 2, 6 -P 2 and PPi in the seeds are sufficient to activate PFP and thereby enable a glycolytic role for PFP during germination. However, the fructose 6 -P content appears to be well below the Km of PFP for this compound and would therefore preferentially bind to the catalytic site of PFK, which has a lower Km for fructose 6 -P. The ATP content appears to be at saturating levels for PFK...|$|E
