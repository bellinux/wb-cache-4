5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E
25|$|Sometime after 1:00 pm on 26 June, Gambin {{organized}} and led a last-gasp charge which {{burst out of}} the encirclement. The French managed to save their eagles and their one remaining cannon. As they withdrew, they met Marmont's relief column which was marching <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of battle. Immediately, the XI Corps stormed into Graz, smashing down Austrian resistance and ejecting Gyulai's corps from the town. The attackers then ran amok, killing numbers of Austrian wounded and prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Moving on Murat's {{left flank}} on the 28th, Milhaud reached {{the village of}} Bandelow, about halfway between Prenzlau and Pasewalk. From there, he marched <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the guns from the Battle of Prenzlau. His brigade arrived in time to witness Prince Augustus' {{surrender}} to Beaumont. His troopers bivouacked that night in Bandelow and rode to Pasewalk the next morning. After Hohenlohe capitulated at Prenzlau, Lasalle rode northeast to Löcknitz on the Randow stream. At 4:00 PM, {{he arrived at the}} village, which was on the direct road between Pasewalk and Stettin. The French general deployed his cavalrymen in Löcknitz and in the hamlet of Bergholz facing northwest in the direction of Pasewalk.|$|E

2500|$|While Colonel Munford's {{division}} kept Devin's men {{away from}} Five Forks, Pickett moved {{off to the}} west of Chamberlain's Bed with his infantry and Rooney Lee's and Rosser's cavalry under [...] Fitzhugh Lee to capture the fords and attack Sheridan from the left or rear and disperse his force. Not waiting for the infantry to begin their attack, Lee's troopers attacked Fitzgerald's Ford, the southern ford, and got some troops across. They were driven back by dismounted Union troopers of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Charles H. Smith's brigade armed with Spencer repeating carbines. Coming up as Lee's attack faltered, Pickett reorganized his forces. At about 2:00p.m., Lee attacked again without success but Pickett's force crossed the northern ford, Danse's Ford. The attack was helped in part by the unnecessary move ordered by General Crook of most of the blocking force of Brigadier General Henry E. Davies's brigade to south <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of gunfire presumably to help Smith's brigade, which in fact continued to hold the position.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{small band}} of between eight and twenty paratroopers of the 505th, Gavin began to march <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the guns. “He had no idea where his {{regiment}} was and only a vague idea as to exactly where he was. We walked all night,” said Major Vandervoort. The paratroopers did not pose a real threat as a fighting force, but their guerilla tactics were nevertheless very effective. They aggressively took on enemy forces, leaving the impression of a much larger force. At one point on the morning of July 10, Gavin’s tiny band encountered a 35-man Italian anti-paratroop patrol. An intense firefight ensued, and the Italians were driven back. Several paratroopers were wounded before Gavin and his men were able to gradually disengage. Gavin was the last man to withdraw. “We were sweaty, tired and distressed at having to leave [...] wounded behind,” said Vandervoort. “The colonel looked over his paltry six-man command and said, ‘This is a hell of a place for a regimental commander to be.’” ...|$|E

Although he grew up surrounded by country music and bluegrass, he gravitated more <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of jazz, citing Dizzy Gillespie as a source of inspiration during his high school years.

2500|$|One {{significant}} change to police tactics following Columbine {{is the introduction}} of the Immediate Action Rapid Deployment tactic, used in situations with an active shooter. Police followed the traditional tactic at Columbine: surround the building, set up a perimeter, contain the damage. That approach {{has been replaced by a}} tactic that takes into account the presence of an active shooter whose interest is to kill, not to take hostages. This tactic calls for a four-person team to advance into the site of any ongoing shooting, optimally a diamond-shaped wedge, but even with just a single officer if more are not available. Police officers using this tactic are trained to move <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of gunfire and neutralize the shooter as quickly as possible. Their goal is to stop the shooter at all costs; they are to walk past wounded victims, as the aim is to prevent the shooter from killing or wounding more. David Cullen, author of Columbine, has stated: [...] "The active protocol has proved successful at numerous shootings during the past decade. At Virginia Tech alone, it probably saved dozens of lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|The process {{requires}} the transport to and assembly of a speaker {{circle around the}} test article. The size of the circle {{is dependent on the}} size of the test article. Generally, a circle [...] in diameter larger and [...] taller than the test article is required. The arrangement should avoid symmetry to reduce the potential for adverse coupling of plane waves. The test article can be mounted on a platform or suspended. Multiple microphones, eight to sixteen, should be used for control with either the SISO or MIMO methods. The microphones should be placed randomly around the test article. The distance from the surface of the drivers to the surface of the control microphones should be [...] The distance from the control microphones to the surface of the test article should be [...] The height of the control microphones should be centered at mid-height of the test item and randomly varied up and down by about one-eighth of the test item height. The orientation of the free-field microphones in a DFAT test arrangement is not critical. However, reflections from the test article can be minimized with the microphone oriented <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> source with a 0 degree incidence. Most modern day, quality measurement, free-field microphones are factory adjusted to compensate for incident angle. This phenomenon is most pronounced at high frequencies, above 10kHz for a 1/4" [...] microphone, and is inversely proportional to microphone diaphragm diameter.|$|E

60|$|Anxious {{to report}} himself alive, and relieve his mother's anxiety, he pressed on till he struck the path, and soon saw, not far away, the old cabin Abner had spoken of.
