25|$|Attorneys for Blagojevich {{appealed the}} former governor's conviction, citing issues of {{judicial}} bias by Zagel and a tainted jury pool. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> also long contended {{that there was}} critical evidence the jury never heard, including witness testimony and recorded phone calls that Zagel did not allow to be played during the trial. They have also argued that Blagojevich's own testimony was restricted by Zagel's rulings.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> {{obtained}} city records {{showing that}} Moore {{was up to}} date in her rent payments. Prosecutors clarified that the dispute was not about the rent but rather a scheme by Bonie to increase those payments by coercing Moore to file false documentation that would have boosted her Section 8 subsidies. To bolster this theory, in late 2015 they subpoenaed the unedited footage from an interview Bonie gave to a local cable channel that had closely covered the case. The cable channel has vigorously opposed giving up the footage to the police. It is appealing the judge's decision requiring them to let him review footage and release relevant portions to the police. A month-long trial in July 2016 ended with the jury acquitting Bonie of murder charges but convicting him of the lesser included charge of manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|Entering {{their second}} {{game of the}} season against Baltimore, the Steelers' defense ranked first in the league, while the Ravens' defense ranked second. [...] "We're going to win by any means necessary. If <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> to score, if the special teams have to kick in a score, or if the offense has to score 50 points – {{whatever}} it takes to win," [...] stated James Harrison prior to the game.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{attention}} focused on Auburn's two star running backs, the team also boasted a capable corps of wide receivers as well. Prior to the game, Auburn receiver Ben Obomanu said, [...] "When you have your running game making big plays and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> to load the box (defensive line) to make plays and {{try to stop the}} running game, that opens up things in the passing game." [...] Auburn averaged more yards passing (241.4per game) than running (189.4per game).|$|E
2500|$|With an {{imperfect}} cut, the position is a draw if the defending rook {{is on the}} file adjacent to the pawn. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> more possibilities against a central pawn [...]|$|E
2500|$|A {{less common}} {{situation}} is when <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> a bishop versus a rook and rook pawn; the wrong rook pawn {{is the one}} that promotes on the square not controlled by the bishop because the defending king and bishop can form a blockade in the corner (on the pawn's promotion square) and draw the game. [...] (This is also called the safe corner for the defending king.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Besides {{the basic}} checkmates, {{there are other}} endings with no pawns. They do not occur very often in practice. [...] Two {{of the most common}} pawnless endgames (when <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> a piece in {{addition}} to the king) are (1) a queen versus a rook and (2) a rook and bishop versus a rook. [...] A queen wins against a rook — see pawnless chess endgame#Queen versus rook. [...] A rook and bishop versus a rook is generally a theoretical draw, but the defense is difficult and there are winning positions (see Rook and bishop versus rook endgame).|$|E
2500|$|In {{ultimate}}, {{the most}} popular throws are backhand, and forehand/flick and less frequently, hammer and scoober or any other throw. Part of the area of ultimate where skill and strategy meet is a player's capacity to plot and execute on throwing and passing to outrun another team, which is colloquially known as [...] "being a deep threat." [...] For example, multiple throwing techniques {{and the ability to}} pass the disc before <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> had a chance to reset helps increase a player or team's threat level, and merging that with speed and coordinated plays can form a phalanx that is hard for competitors to overcome.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most basic}} {{positional}} set up {{is known as}} a [...] "3–3", so called because there are two lines in front of the opponent's goal. Another set up, used more by professional teams, {{is known as a}}n [...] "arc", [...] "umbrella", or [...] "mushroom"; perimeter players form the shape of an arc around the goal, with the hole set as the handle or stalk. Yet another option for offensive set is called a 4–2 or double hole; there are two center forward offensive players in front of the goal. Double hole is most often used in [...] "man up" [...] situations, or when <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> only one skilled [...] "hole D", or [...] to draw in a defender and then pass out to a perimeter player for a shot ("kick out").|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{noted that}} the Confrontation Clause creates two kinds of witnesses: those whom the {{prosecution}} is obligated to call, and those whom <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> the discretion to call. [...] The Court rejected {{the argument that the}} analyst was not a conventional witness because he or she recorded the immediate results of a chemical test rather than recalled a historical event. [...] Even though evidence may be so contemporaneous that it meets the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule, it may nevertheless be a violation of the Confrontation Clause. [...] The Court referred to the companion case to Davis v. Washington, where it ruled that statements to police immediately after an incident of domestic violence were [...] "non-testimonial" [...] and part of [...] "an on-going emergency" [...] and therefore admissible.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{throughout}} Bonin's {{trials and}} in the years prior to his execution, much speculation was given {{as to whether the}} root cause of Bonin's crimes lay in his abusive, dysfunctional upbringing. Opponents and advocates of the death penalty alike were in agreement Bonin had endured extensive physical and sexual abuse in his childhood, but much scorn was given to the claims from Bonin's attorneys and supporters that the murders had been a direct manifestation of the abuse he had endured as a child and adolescent, and an attempt to purge his frustration and anger onto his victims. In one article published in the San Francisco Chronicle three days prior to Bonin's execution, an editor named Robert Morse opined: [...] "Bonin was abused as a child. The abuse seems to have been bad, but not nearly as gruesome as the abuse he dealt out. [...] world is filled with articulate people who can write and paint and were abused as children; very few of them become serial killers. The crime rate among the mentally ill is lower than among so-called 'normal' people. To call Bonin's evil a psychiatric disorder, as <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has,</b> or an illness, is to slander the mentally ill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{retorted}} Le Drieux eagerly; [...] "here {{are also}} the pearls from the necklace of Princess Lemoine, and the London collection of Lady Grandison.

50|$|<b>The</b> prevent <b>defense</b> uses {{five or more}} {{defensive}} backs. <b>The</b> nickel <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> five backs, {{so named}} because the nickel is <b>the</b> five-cent coin. <b>Defenses</b> with additional backs take {{the name of the}} next coin, but numerically, they are misnomers so <b>the</b> dime <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> six backs.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{evidence}} submitted in {{proof of}} the alleged fact that the prisoner is Jack Andrews, and that Jack Andrews may have robbed the Countess Ahmberg, of Vienna, of her valuable collection of pearls, is in the judgment of this court clear and convincing," [...] he said. [...] "The lawyer for <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> further succeeded in entangling his client by exhibiting an additional assortment of pearls, which may likewise be stolen property. The attempt to impose upon this court a mythical island called Sangoa is--eh--distinctly reprehensible. This court is not so easily hoodwinked. Therefore, in consideration of the evidence advanced, I declare that the prisoner is Jack Andrews, otherwise Jackson Dowd Andrews, otherwise parading under the alias of 'A. Jones,' and I recognize the claim of the Austrian police to his person, {{that he may be}} legally tried for his alleged crimes in the territory where it is alleged he committed them. Therefore I order that the prisoner be held for requisition and turned over to the proper authorities when the papers arrive. The court is adjourned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Court has {{listened to}} the words of the father with {{peculiar}} interest. The Court is a father, and has been at a loss to understand the relations existing between father and son in this case. The Court thinks he understands them better now. As counsel for <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> said, I am an old man, soon to leave my seat upon the bench, and I do not intend to let foolish pride or dry legal formalities stand between me and the doing of justice. The jury has decided that the boy is guilty, but has recommended him to the mercy of the Court. The plea of the father has enlightened the Court on one or two most vital points. Nothing is further from the mind of the Court than the desire to do injury to a handsome and talented boy. Believing that the father and son are about to become more closely united, the Court here transmutes the sentence to one hundred dollars fine and six months in the county jail. This will make it possible for the son and father to meet often, and the father can continue his duties to the church. This the Court decides upon as the final disposition of the accused. The case is closed. Call the next case." ...|$|E

25|$|At the trial's {{conclusion}} — {{after the}} prosecution and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> presented their cases — the jury took 54 minutes on March 1, 1969, to find Clay Shaw not guilty.|$|R
50|$|The Roughriders offense had 361 points for, while <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> 221 points allowed. This is {{the most}} recent season (as of 2016) where the Roughriders {{finished}} first overall in the CFL.|$|R

50|$|The quarterback kneel {{is mainly}} used {{when the team}} in the lead has {{possession}} of the ball with {{less than two minutes}} on the game clock. With the 40-second play clock in the NFL and NCAA, two minutes (120 seconds) is in theory the maximum amount of time that can be run off on three consecutive quarterback kneels; this assumes it is first down and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> no timeouts remaining. A team cannot run more than three consecutive quarterback kneels as doing so on fourth down turns the ball over to the opponent and guarantees them at least one opportunity to score. The decision to run the quarterback kneel depends on the amount of time remaining in the game, the down, and the number of timeouts <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> remaining. For example, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on first down, and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> one timeout left, the offense may use two successive quarterback kneels to completely run out the clock, and if the defense uses its timeout the offense can simply run a third kneel to run out the clock. However, if there is one minute remaining on the game clock on third down, then regardless of how many timeouts <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has,</b> quarterback kneels will not completely run out the clock and the offense must try to make a first down.|$|E
50|$|If the {{offensive}} team commits pass interference in their opponent's end zone, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> {{the choice of}} 15 yards from the previous spot {{and a loss of}} down, or a touchback.|$|E
50|$|Moving {{on to the}} non-constitutional arguments, {{the court}} was {{similarly}} unpersuaded. The letters to the Bass Berry paralegal, and her testimony, spoke directly to Perry's possible motive in committing the crime, especially since <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> not objected {{to the introduction of}} his 1996 deposition where he had said the payments were not much of an issue between him and Janet. Other than two or three sentences, Woodall added, the letters were not that sexually explicit. As for the novel manuscript, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> not objected to its introduction at trial and therefore had waived its right to a consideration of the issue on appeal.|$|R
5000|$|The Packers {{would travel}} to Oakland {{to take on}} the Raiders. This game was all Packers, as they never trailed at any point. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> a good day, intercepting Derek Carr twice, as the Packers won 30-20.|$|R
50|$|Before jury selection, the Smiths' {{attorneys}} {{stated that}} <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>had</b> {{made a deal}} with prosecution to limit the church's involvement in the trial.
