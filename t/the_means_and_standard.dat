5000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> {{deviations}} {{were broken}} down by gender and age, they were consistent with those reported by U.S. samples. [...] The rank ordering of strengths were comparable to the patterns found in the U.S. and other international samples.

5000|$|A serious {{limitation}} of norm-reference tests {{is that the}} reference group may not represent the current population of interest. As noted by the Oregon Research Institute's International Personality Item Pool website, [...] "One should be very wary of using canned [...] "norms" [...] because it isn't obvious that one could ever find a population of which one's present sample is a representative subset. Most [...] "norms" [...] are misleading, and therefore {{they should not be}} used. Far more defensible are local norms, which one develops oneself. For example, if one wants to give feedback to members of a class of students, one should relate the score of each individual to <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviations derived from the class itself. To maximize informativeness, one can provide the students with the frequency distribution for each scale, based on these local norms, and the individuals can then find (and circle) their own scores on these relevant distributions." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{test was}} {{developed}} using {{a sample of}} responses from the comparison of 504 sets of results from a trial by students, taken from a larger sample of 950 first year university student responses.The test was then normed on a sample of 1044 males and 1870 females aged between 17 and 69 years, across participants of varying backgrounds, including university students, nurses in training and blue and white collared employees of a major airline, bank, railway workshop and naval dockyard. The scores were subsequently checked for validity against outpatient groups including patients suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders, insomniacs, myocardial infarction patients, as well as patients undergoing treatment for sexual, menopausal and depressive disorders. While the test was not normed against samples younger than 17, due to the simplicity of language, {{there has been no}} compelling evidence against the use of the scales for comparison against children as young as 12.The reliability scores of the scales in terms of Cronbach's alpha scores rate the Depression scale at 0.91, the Anxiety scale at 0.84 and the Stress scale at 0.90 in the normative sample. <b>The</b> <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviations for each scale are 6.34 and 6.97 for depression, 4.7 and 4.91 for anxiety and 10.11 and 7.91 for stress, respectively. The mean scores in the normative sample did vary slightly between genders as well as varying by age, though the threshold scores for classifications do not change by these variations. The Depression and Stress scales meet the standard threshold requirement of 0.9 for research, however, the Anxiety scale still meets the 0.7 threshold for clinical applications, and is still close to the 0.9 required for research.|$|E
