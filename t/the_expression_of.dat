40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of recipes for {{replenishing}} qi and activating blood on p 16, p 21, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D 1 and cyclin E gene <b>expressions</b> in <b>the</b> liver <b>of</b> aging rats. Methods: A recipe for replenishing qi and a recipe for activating blood were administered to aging rats respectively, and {{the effects of}} the above recipes on <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> senescence related genes (p 16, p 21, PCNA, cyclin D 1 and cyclin E) were examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting methods. Results: <b>The</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> p 16, p 21 and cyclin D 1 mRNAs and proteins in the liver of the untreated aging rats were up-regulated, while <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> PCNA and cyclin E mRNAs and proteins decreased. As compared with the untreated aging rats, both recipes could down-regulate <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> cyclin D 1 mRNA and protein and up-regulate <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> cyclin E mRNA and protein, but had no obvious effects on <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> mRNAs and proteins of p 16, p 21 and PCNA. Conclusion: Recipes for replenishing qi and activating blood can improve the liver cell proliferation of aging rats via down-regulating <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> cyclin D 1 mRNA and protein and up-regulating <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> cyclin E mRNA and protein...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> and their significances of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) mRNA and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and lymph node tissues. Methods <b>The</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> VEGF-C mRNA and EGFR mRNA were detected in tumor tissues and lymph node tissues by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR.

Results <b>The</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> VEGF-C mRNA and EGFR mRNA in tumor tissues and lymph node tissues were significantly higher than those in control group (P < 0. 05). <b>The</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> VEGF-C mRNA and EGFR mRNA were much higher in patients with lymph node metastasis than those without lymph node metastasis (P < 0. 05). <b>The</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> VEGF-C mRNA and EGFR mRNA in tumor tissues and lymph node tissues were significantly correlated (r= 0. 834, P < 0. 001; r= 0. 817, P < 0. 001).

5|$|The {{choice of}} poly(A) site can be {{influenced}} by extracellular stimuli and depends on <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the proteins that take part in polyadenylation. For example, <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results {{in the selection of}} weak poly(A) sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like lysozyme and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins. RNA-binding proteins other than those in the polyadenylation machinery can also affect whether a polyadenyation site is used, as can DNA methylation near the polyadenylation signal.|$|E
