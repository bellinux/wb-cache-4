25|$|Wholesalers in Manhattan faced {{expensive}} time, transportation, {{and labor}} costs when importing and then re-sending goods. So in 1895, Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush,</b> {{working under the}} name of his family's company, The Bush Co., organized six warehouses and one pier on the waterfront of South Brooklyn as a freight handling terminal. There had only been one warehouse on the site in 1890, and before that, the land contained an oil refinery belonging to the Bush & Denslow company of Rufus <b>T.</b> <b>Bush,</b> Irving T. Bush's father. Standard Oil bought this refinery in the 1880s and dismantled it, but after Rufus T. Bush's death in 1890, Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush</b> later bought the land back using his father's inheritance.|$|E
25|$|From 1985 to 1992 the Chairman of the Board of Trustees was William H. <b>T.</b> <b>Bush</b> (younger {{brother of}} former President George H. W. Bush). The younger Bush also taught {{classes at the}} school.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy first commandeered the piers and {{warehouses}} of the Bush Terminal Co. on Dec. 31, 1917. By June 1918, Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and later President of the United States) Franklin D. Roosevelt {{wrote to}} Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush</b> {{to tell him}} that the navy would also be commandeering four of Bush Terminal's twelve manufacturing buildings, meaning that 64 manufacturers employing 4,500 people would have to vacate. The United States Navy tied its rail lines into those of the Bush Terminal in 1918. Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush</b> not only complied but also helped to design its southern neighbor, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, in 1918.|$|E

25|$|Bush Terminal {{is named}} after its founder Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush.</b> His family name came from Jan Bosch, {{who was born in}} the Netherlands and immigrated to New Amsterdam (now New York) in 1662. Bush Terminal is in no way related to the Bush {{political}} family. Bush Terminal was unique from other rail-marine terminals in New York due to its distance from Manhattan, the magnitude of its warehousing and manufacturing operations, and its fully integrated nature.|$|E
25|$|The Bush Company {{terminal}} business {{became the}} Bush Terminal Co. in 1902 when Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush</b> bought {{the land from}} the Standard Oil Co. The warehouses were built circa 1892–1910, the railroad from 1896 to 1915, and the factory lofts between 1905 and 1925. Together, Bush Terminal offered economies of scale for its tenants, so that even the smallest interests had available to them the type of facilities normally only available to large, well-capitalized firms.|$|E
25|$|Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush</b> died in 1948 and {{a statue}} {{to him was}} {{dedicated}} in 1950 at Bush Terminal's Brooklyn administration building by his niece Helen Tunison in front of 3,000 notables and terminal employees. Shortly thereafter, starting in the early 1950s and continuing into the 1960s, the Topps company, of chewing gum and baseball card fame, produced baseball cards at Bush Terminal. Topps moved production to Pennsylvania in 1965 and its offices to Manhattan in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Bush Tower, {{also called}} the Bush Terminal International Exhibit Building is a {{historic}} 30-story skyscraper located just east of Times Square at 130-132 West 42nd Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was built in 1916-18 for Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush's</b> Bush Terminal Company, owners of Bush Terminal in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Bush Tower's unique original purpose as commercial display space and social space, its notable design that combined narrowness, height, and Neo-Gothic architecture, {{and its role in}} the evolution of Times Square and of New York skyscrapers after the 1916 Zoning Resolution all qualify it as an exceptional structure.|$|R
50|$|The Sardonyx was {{originally}} a steel-hulled yacht with diesel engines, built in 1928 as the Queen Anne for Mr. Alexander Dallas Thayer at the Germania-Werft shipyards in Kiel, Germany.

25|$|Officially the {{kinetoscope}} entered Europe {{when the}} rich American Businessman Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush</b> (1869–1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kinétoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines {{for the market}} in France. In {{the last three months}} of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-österreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck of the Schokoladen-Süsswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne.|$|E

2500|$|The {{terminal}} in {{its early}} days was derided as [...] "Bush's Folly." [...] Railroad officials would not ship directly to Brooklyn, which required the extra cost of loading freight cars on car floats for the trip across New York Harbor to the ferry slips at the terminal, unless they first had orders of freight. Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush</b> resorted to sending an agent to Michigan with instructions to buy 100 carloads of hay, then to attempt to have the hay sent in its original railcar to Bush's terminal in Brooklyn. Eastern railroad companies declined their western agents' request to send the hay until eventually the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad agreed to accept the offer and negotiate directly with the new terminal. Other railways followed. To demonstrate that ocean vessels could (and should) dock at the piers, Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush</b> leased ships and entered the banana business (and made a profit doing so). Likewise, to induce businesses to store goods at his terminal's warehouses, he warehoused coffee and cotton himself. Once Bush Terminal succeeded and expanded, sources credited Bush's [...] "keen foresight" [...] for undertaking such a [...] "quixotic" [...] business venture.|$|E

[...] She became known to the press as Lady Bountiful of the Bowery. While engaged in this work she met Irving <b>T.</b> <b>Bush,</b> founder and president of Bush Terminal Company in New York City, and Bush House in London. They were married in Reno on June 9, 1930, an hour after Bush's divorce from his second wife became final.
