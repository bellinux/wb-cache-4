5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on the island.

The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Chantal began affecting Bermuda on July 30, producing scattered {{storms and}} increased cloud cover.
