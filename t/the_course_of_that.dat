50|$|The {{present form}} of RPD has three main variations.

What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

5|$|Hananu {{and some}} of his aides {{traveled}} to Mar'ash to request support from the Anatolian insurgents and on 7 September, he signed a deal with them in which they recognized him as the representative of the Arab government of Syria and promised military aid. In <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> month, Hananu began receiving significant financial and military support, and military advisers, from the remnants of the Ottoman Second Army. Despite the mutual suspicion between the nationalists in Aleppo and Turkey, who were leading their respective revolts, both sides agreed that they were confronting a common French enemy. In addition, the Turkish struggle to oust French forces from Anatolia was popularly supported by Syria's inhabitants, and in northern Syria in particular, there were widespread feelings of religious solidarity with the Turks. In the second week of September, Saleh al-Ali announced that he was ready to coordinate with Hananu's rebels.|$|E

5|$|Wendy Oxenhorn, {{director}} of the Foundation, arranged for housekeeping and free medical care for Norman, as well as helping him plan for his future, providing back rent and negotiating with Norman's landlord. In <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> housekeeping, in July 2002, Norman's rare tape of his jam session with Marley was located in his apartment and placed on auction, retrieving considerably above its estimated value when auctioned at $26,290. During the same housekeeping session, Norman rediscovered old notebooks containing his compositions. Producer Kerryn Tolhurst recorded Norman performing the songs on a tape recorder in his apartment, taking the tapes into the studio later to add parts by other musicians. Judy Collins, whose drummer Tony Beard contributed to the project, released the resultant album under her own Wildflower label in 2004. The project, titled Little Pieces, is the first album Norman has ever released with wide distribution. In 2006, Little Pieces won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.|$|E
5|$|Once {{in front}} of Schumacher, Hill was able to {{gradually}} extend his lead to 3.4seconds by lap30 despite carrying a heavier fuel load for one fewer planned pit stop. However, he lost second gear during <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> lap, and then spun off at turntwo on lap31, retiring from the race with a suspected gearbox seizure. On the same lap, Herbert also retired from the race after suffering damage in a collision with Suzuki, who himself had to make an unscheduled pit stop to replace his car's damaged nosecone. Schumacher thus assumed the lead {{as a result of}} Hill's retirement, leading by 11.5seconds from Coulthard. Salo was third in the remaining Tyrrell, 39.4seconds behind Coulthard. Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars completed the top sixpositions. Schumacher made his secondpit stop on lap37, exiting in second position behind Coulthard. Salo and Häkkinen, both performing much better than had been expected prior to the race, battled over thirdposition until lap39, when Salo, suffering from cramp and driving with one hand, spun at the final bend. He made a pit stop soon after for fresh tyres, dropping to eighthposition. Häkkinen, having moved up to third, made his secondstop on lap43, exiting behind the two Ferrari cars, Berger moving {{in front of}} Alesi as the latter made his stop on the following lap, rejoining in seventh. Coulthard made a pit stop from the lead on lap47, the gap between him and Schumacher not big enough to allow him to maintain the lead. Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race, 1:30.921, extending his lead {{to such an extent that}} when he made his own final stop on lap52, he maintained the lead. After his final stop, Schumacher gradually opened his leading margin 11seconds, winning the race after 71 laps in a time of 1:48:49.972s, with Coulthard finishing second in his Williams. The Ferrari cars of Berger – who made his final stop on lap49 without losing a place – and Alesi were third and fifth respectively, but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages. Häkkinen, despite losing part of his rear wing after his car was struck by a bird, split them both to take fourth position. In the closing stages, Morbidelli and Blundell both overtook Salo, only for the Footwork driver to retire on lap62 with a blocked fuel line. Blundell, who had earlier changed his steering wheel and was driving without the use of third gear, thus took the final point in sixth place, ahead of Salo, Suzuki, Montermini – who completed the race distance despite struggling with a broken floor on his chassis, taking the Pacific team's first race finish – and Diniz. The race saw a high attrition rate; only ten out of the 25 starters finished the race. Of the other late retirements, Wendlinger suffered a broken battery cable on lap41, Roberto Moreno and Badoer retired on lap47 due to a spin and gearbox problem respectively, and Inoue's car caught fire on lap48. The Japanese driver was in any case due to receive the black flag for receiving an illegal push-start from the marshals following a spin on the circuit.|$|E
