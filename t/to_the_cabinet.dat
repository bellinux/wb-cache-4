5|$|Gladstone {{returned}} to power after the 1892 general election; he was 82 years old. Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing the Radical MP Henry Labouchère <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> so Gladstone {{agreed not to}} appoint him. In 1894, Gladstone retired and, without consulting the outgoing prime minister, Victoria appointed Lord Rosebery as prime minister. His government was weak, and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him. Salisbury remained prime minister {{for the remainder of}} Victoria's reign.|$|E

5|$|The {{text of the}} Imperial Rescript on {{surrender}} was finalized by 19:00 August 14, {{transcribed by}} the official court calligrapher, and brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabinet</b> for their signatures. Around 23:00, the Emperor, with help from an NHK recording crew, made a gramophone record of himself reading it.

5|$|As the war progressed, this dissatisfaction {{increased}} {{and there were}} frequent changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabinet.</b> Toombs, who had wished to be president himself, was frustrated as an advisor and resigned {{within a few months}} of his appointment to join the army. Robert Hunter of Virginia replaced him as Secretary of State on July 25, 1861. On September 17, Walker resigned as Secretary of War due to a conflict with Davis, who had questioned his management of the War Department and had suggested he consider a different position.

Benjamin left the Attorney General position to replace him, and Thomas Bragg of North Carolina (brother of General Braxton Bragg) took Benjamin's place as Attorney General.|$|E

5|$|Churchill's and the British {{response}} was officially restrained. This {{was due to}} the strong-willed defence of the Belgian defensive campaign presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabinet</b> by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May. The French and Belgian ministers had referred to Leopold's actions as treacherous, but they were unaware of the true events: Leopold had not signed an agreement with Hitler in order to form a collaborative government, but an unconditional surrender as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Dacey's {{involvement}} in politics {{began when he}} was elected to the Alexandria Municipal Council. He served on the council for ten years from 1886 to 1896 and as the mayor in 1888 and 1889. Dacey began his {{involvement in}} state politics as the Returning Officer for the district of Redfern from 1889 to 1891. He joined the Redfern Labor Electoral League, the local branch of the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales, in 1891, but was defeated for pre-selection by James McGowen, who would later serve as Premier and appoint Dacey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabinet.</b>|$|E

5|$|Heffron's reformist {{attitude}} in education also {{extended to the}} tertiary level, in which he intended to significantly expand NSW's capacity for higher-level learning. On 9 July 1946 he presented a proposal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabinet</b> outlining {{the creation of a}} technological-based university in NSW, as a separate institution to the existing Sydney Technical College and a year later cabinet authorised the appointment of a Developmental Council, chaired by Heffron, to bring the new tertiary institution into existence. First meeting in August 1947, the council established all the guidelines and regulations that would set-up the future institution and by March 1948, 46 students had already enrolled to study.|$|E
5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister of Justice Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabinet.</b> This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E
5|$|If the Spanish monarch ever refused in {{conscience}} {{to grant}} royal assent, a procedure {{similar to the}} Belgian handling of King Baudouin's objection {{would not be possible}} under the current constitution. If the sovereign were ever declared incapable of discharging royal authority, his or her powers would not be transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> pending the parliamentary appointment of a regency. Instead, the constitution mandates the next person of age in the line of succession would immediately become regent. Therefore, had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010, a declaration of incapacity would have transferred power to Felipe, then the heir apparent.|$|E
