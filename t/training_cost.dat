Nevertheless, significant market forces can result in changes (as in Turkish adoption of QWERTY), and non-core keys are more prone to change, as they are less frequently used and less subject to the lock-in of touch-typing. The main, alphanumeric portion is typically stable, while symbol keys and shifted key values change somewhat, modifier keys more so, and function keys most of all: QWERTY dates to the No. 1 (1874) (though 1 and 0 were added later), shifted keys date in some cases to the No. 2 (1878), in other cases to the Selectric (1961), and modifier key placement largely dates to the Model M (1985); function key placement typically dates to the Model M, but varies significantly, particularly on laptops.|$|E

30|$|First, set-up {{costs are}} the net costs that a firm invests to train its {{apprentices}}. Net <b>Training</b> <b>Costs</b> in Euros include the average gross costs, e.g., costs for apprentices (wages), costs for trainers, physical costs and other costs, minus the corresponding {{benefits such as}} productive contribution of apprentices during their training. 10 Net <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> can be positive (i.e., a net investment) or negative (i.e., a net benefit). Empirically, non-training firms might not train apprentices because of significantly higher net <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> in contrast to training firms (Wolter et al. 2006). Therefore, <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> for non-training firms would systematically differ if these firms were {{to switch to a}} training policy. Muehlemann et al. (2010) provide a solution to this problem by using selection models to investigate the potential costs and benefits of non-training firms. Analogously, we estimate <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> for non-training firms with identical selection models and the same exclusion restriction, i.e., availability of skilled workers. 11 Subsequently, we multiply these net <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> per year and per apprentice by the Training Duration for a specific training occupation in years (ranging from 2 to 3.5  years) to calculate the net <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> for the whole training duration of one apprentice.|$|R

40|$|We empirically {{investigate}} the joint training decisions {{of workers and}} firms. The aim of our study is to learn how various cost components affect workers’ (non-) participation in training. In particular, we separately consider monetary and non-monetary <b>training</b> <b>costs,</b> which is possible thanks to an especially rich dataset that includes both participants and non-participants. Our estimation results show that workers whose firms cover some of their <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> would generally {{be more likely to}} have assumed the full <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> themselves had they not received employer support. Moreover, the share of self-financed training, as compared to employer-supported training, is generally low. Thus, firms moderate virtually all training decisions and, as a result, considerably influence (non-) participation patterns. Interestingly, although training non-participation can be attributed to both monetary and non-monetary costs, the latter seem to comprise the more binding restriction. That is, time is more costly than money. <b>Training</b> <b>costs,</b> employer-supported <b>training,</b> time vs. money...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} location choice that draws on insights from the incomplete contracts and investment flexibility (real option) literatures. Our analysis indicates that the choice of locating within rather than away from industry clusters {{is influenced by the}} extent to which <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> are borne by firms versus employees. In addition, the uncertainty about future productivity shocks and the ability of firms to modify the scale of their operations also influence location choice. In particular, we show that locating in clusters is preferred when <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> are borne by workers and when firm-specific productivity shocks can potentially be large. However, there is an incentive for firms to choose isolated locations when significant <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> are borne by firms. Copyright 2007 The Review of Economic Studies Limited. ...|$|R

Worker types are continuously distributed within {{the population and}} {{a finite number of}} firms have specific skill requirements. Specific human capital investment is the <b>cost</b> of <b>training</b> a worker {{to be able to work}} for a particular firm and depends on the difference between the worker’s skill type and the firm’s skill requirement. A firm’s profit equals its output minus wages, its share of <b>training</b> <b>costs,</b> and a fixed cost. We solve for symmetric free-entry Nash equilibria of the wage offer game under two different information structures. When firms can identify worker types before employment, firms can pay different net wages to workers with different <b>training</b> <b>costs.</b> When firms cannot identify worker <b>training</b> <b>costs</b> in advance, firms pay workers equal wages, but workers absorb <b>training</b> <b>costs.</b> The level of fixed costs, the size of the labor market, and the cost of investment in human capital all affect the equilibrium settings.
