50|$|Bruce McLaren crashed the M8D on the Lavant {{straight}} {{just before}} Woodcote corner at Goodwood Circuit in England on 2 June 1970. He had been testing his new M8D when the rear bodywork <b>came</b> <b>adrift</b> at speed. The loss of aerodynamic downforce destabilised the car, which spun, left the track, {{and hit a}} bunker used as a flag station. McLaren lost {{his life in the}} accident.|$|R

Arriving in Rome, he and Moss were told they were leading from Taruffi, Herrmann, Kling and Fangio, but from then on they had no way of knowing whether any of their rivals had gone ahead on elapsed time. Soon after Rome, Kling's race ended when he went off the road avoiding spectators and crashed into a tree.|$|R
50|$|In August 1929, {{following}} {{a dispute with}} the Trophy organizers, France decided {{to pull out of}} the contest but the aircraft development programme continued; delayed by engine problems it was not until February 1930 that flight trials, piloted by Sadi Lecointe, began. On 10 April long runs on the water at Hourtin were made. The exact date of the first flight is not known but had occurred by 1 June when, during a high speed run, a section of cowling <b>came</b> <b>adrift.</b> The aircraft sustained damage which took it back to the factory for several more months.|$|R
50|$|William Moore, {{who spent}} much of his life in the village, tells us that his {{grandfather}} was estate bricklayer and chimney sweep for Rainthorpe Hall. To sweep the great chimneys at the hall, his grandfather would take one of his eight sons to climb up into the dark chimney as far as he safely could, carrying a hoe to scrape away the soot. While up the chimney, enveloped in clouds of soot, the lad would be required to help the sweeping rods on their way up the chimney and to try to rescue any brush which <b>came</b> <b>adrift.</b>|$|R

Four lifeboats were launched, but only one managed to release from the lowering cables. (A safety device did not allow release until the strain {{was removed from the}} cables.) A fifth lifeboat <b>came</b> <b>adrift</b> and surfaced upside down; its occupants righted it and gathered 19 men from the water. Two of Kielland's rafts were detached and three men were rescued from them. Two 12-man rafts were thrown from Edda and rescued 13 survivors. Seven men were taken from the sea by supply boats and seven swam to Edda.|$|R
50|$|For 20 {{hours each}} day, while the rock {{was covered by}} up to 12 ft of water, the men lived on a ship moored 1 mi off the rock. The first task was to build a beacon house on tall wooden struts, so the men would {{have a place to}} stay on the reef, instead of the {{time-consuming}} row to and from the ship each day and after an incident whereby one of the boats <b>came</b> <b>adrift.</b> The beacon house had places for 15 men. The foundations and beacon legs were raised during the first season. During the winter, work on the lighthouse was paused as stonemasons cut rocks for the lighthouse out of Aberdeen granite.|$|R
5000|$|In April, {{the band}} had another Top 20 {{hit with the}} re-released [...] "Treason" [...] (featuring the earlier Kilimanjaro line-up of the band) which reached No. 18 in the UK singles chart. Another single, [...] "When I Dream", {{received}} airplay on progressive radio in the U.S., introducing the band to new fans. In June 1981, the band embarked on another American tour. The tour {{proved to be a}} chaotic affair: neither Agius nor Hammer fitted into the group socially and Cope was retreating further into an LSD-fuelled isolation, retaining only Dwyer as trusted companion. The tour finally <b>came</b> <b>adrift</b> on the East Coast in a mess of bad business arrangements and infighting.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is my opinion, too," [...] {{the lawyer}} agreed. The general {{theory was that}} the captain had {{remained}} too long on board trying to save something of importance. Perhaps the chart which would clear him, or else something of value in his cabin. The painter of the boat had <b>come</b> <b>adrift</b> of itself it was supposed. However, strange to say, some little time before that voyage poor Whalley had called {{in his office and}} had left with him a sealed envelope addressed to his daughter, to be forwarded to her in case of his death. Still it was nothing very unusual, especially in a man of his age. Mr. Van Wyk shook his head. Captain Whalley looked good for a hundred years.|$|R
40|$|There is no stillness {{and there}} is no lack: in this evocative new pamphlet, internationally-recognised poet Eleanor Rees taps into the flow that runs through {{everyday}} acts of being. From the liminal spaces of suburbia to the wild, sacred landscapes of the west, Rees’ fluid lyric style draws us into a motion between the real and the imagined where temporal lives <b>come</b> <b>adrift</b> in a timeless current. Sometimes drawing on her native Liverpool and sometimes roaming beyond into surreal, formless space, both Rees’ subtle voice and acute intellect are effortlessly displayed in these poems; intended as a companion volume to her recent collection, ‘Blood Child’, this pamphlet is a unique opportunity to gain a fresh perspective on one of the UK’s most distinctive poet...|$|R

25|$|The ship <b>came</b> <b>adrift</b> on 22October and {{the party}} spent three days recapturing her. She was {{evacuated}} on 12November due to crushing by ice, but it was deemed safe for the crew to return until 21December when the vessel was crushed beyond repair. On 22January 1904 the ship disappeared, either sinking or drifting away during night. The first attempt to reach the pole began on 7March with 26 men and Fiala acting as cook.

"It {{appears that}} when he heard my shout 'Come up,' he {{understood}} at once what was the matter, caught up his wife, ran on deck, and across, and down into our boat, which was fast to the ladder.

He set her down on a thwart, {{and was ready to}} climb back on board when the painter <b>came</b> <b>adrift</b> somehow, and away they went together. Of course in the confusion we did not hear him shouting. He looked abashed. She said cheerfully, 'I suppose it does not matter my losing the train now?' 'No, Jenny--you go below and get warm,' he growled. Then to us: 'A sailor has no business with a wife--I say. There I was, out of the ship. Well, no harm done this time.

5000|$|On 24 October 1942, Barnegat {{received}} {{orders to}} transport VP-73 to Derry, Northern Ireland. During the passage, Barnegat encountered heavy seas and, at 15:41 on 26 October 1942, took a “rapid, heavy roll to starboard” [...] while efforts were underway topside to secure depth charges that had <b>come</b> <b>adrift</b> on deck. A torrent of water cascaded across the fantail and swept Ensign George V. Grabosky and two sailors over the side. Barnegat herself {{had to try}} to recover her drifting men, since the stiff gale precluded the lowering of a boat. Men on board worked lifelines and tended knotted lines, grapnels, and lifebuoys, as she struggled against the elements to maintain proper position for a rescue. The two enlisted men finally were recovered, but Ensign Grabosky was not found. On 27 October 1942, Barnegat arrived at Lissahally, Ireland, where found another set of sailing orders waiting: She was to participate in Operation Torch, the Allied landings in French North Africa. She got underway again on 29 October 1942 and steamed with British Convoy WS 24 until rendezvousing with Task Force (TF) 34 and Convoy UGF 1.|$|R
5000|$|A {{piston engine}} has {{a part of}} the {{combustion}} chamber that is always out of reach of the piston; and this zone is where the conventional spark plug is located. A Wankel engine has a permanently varying combustion area; and the spark plug is inevitably swept by the tip seals. Clearly, if a spark plug were to protrude into the Wankel's combustion chamber it would foul the rotating tip; and if the plug were recessed to avoid this, the sunken spark might lead to poor combustion. So a new type of [...] "surface discharge" [...] plug was developed for the Wankel. Such a plug presents an almost flat face to the combustion chamber. A stubby centre electrode projects only very slightly; and the entire earthed body of the plug acts as the side electrode. The advantage is that the plug sits just beneath the tip-seal that sweeps over it, keeping the spark accessible to the fuel/air mixture. The [...] "plug gap" [...] remains constant throughout its life; and the spark path will continually vary (instead of darting from the centre to the side electrode as in a conventional plug). Whereas a conventional side electrode will (admittedly, rarely) <b>come</b> <b>adrift</b> in use and potentially cause engine damage, this is impossible with a surface discharge plug, as there is nothing to break off. Surface-discharge spark plugs have been produced by inter alia, Denso, NGK, Champion and Bosch.|$|R
