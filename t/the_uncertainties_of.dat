30|$|Another {{feature of}} WSNs is their uncertainty, which cannot be ignored when energy issues are addressed. <b>The</b> major <b>uncertainties</b> <b>of</b> WSNs result {{primarily}} from (1) uncertain environmental conditions inside the sensor and (2) uncertain environmental conditions outside the sensor. The former includes <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> time {{in each of}} the power modes, <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> actual lifetime, <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number of transitions between different power modes, <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensing process, <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitting and receiving processes, and <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> packet delay. <b>The</b> latter includes <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number of sensors in the area to be covered, <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> relaying requests from neighboring sensors, <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> routing to <b>the</b> head or <b>the</b> gateway, <b>the</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> their topologies, and many other related <b>uncertainties.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> energy-efficient WSNs and their uncertainties is a crucial issue because it offers promise for future developmental improvements in WSNs. Once a system has been designed, additional energy savings can be achieved by using dynamic power management, which shuts down the sensor node if no events occur. Every component in a node can be in different states, e.g., each sensor can be in active, idle, or sleep mode. Mathematically speaking, each sensor will have a finite number of different statuses and the state space of each status also is different. The sensor node stays in each status for a random time and then transfers into another status where it stays for another random duration. A very special case occurs when each sensor only has two different statuses, e.g., active and sleep, similar as those in [7 – 9]. The sensor node alternatively stays in active or sleep status for a probability distributed duration. In this article, we are going to start this investigation by concentrating on the development of energy consumption in a stochastic WSN and expect our research to improve existing WSN development significantly in both theory and applications.|$|R

5|$|Before the 1080s, the {{majority}} of officials drafted came from a regionally diverse background; afterwards, intraregional patterns of drafting officials became more common. Hartwell writes that during the Southern Song, the shift of power from central to regional administrations, the localized interests of the new gentry, the enforcement of prefectural quotas in preliminary examinations, and <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> <b>of</b> a successful political career in the factionally split capital led many civil servants to choose positions {{that would allow them}} to remain in specific regions. Hymes demonstrates how this correlated with the decline in long-distance marriage alliances that had perpetuated the professional elite in the Northern Song, as the Southern Song gentry preferred local marriage prospects. It was not until the reign of Emperor Shenzong (r. 1068–1085) that the now heavily populated regions of South China began providing a quantity of officials in policy-making posts that were proportionate to their share of China's total population. From 1125 to 1205, about 80% of all those who held office in one of the six ministries of the central government had spent most of their low-grade official careers within the area of modern southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces. Almost 100% of these officials were born and buried within this southeastern macroregion.|$|E
5|$|In February 1945, Walters was {{promoted}} to acting air commodore and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Northern Command, directing its operations in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville {{until the end of}} the war.

Northern Command's operational formations included No.71 Wing in northern New Guinea, No.74 Wing at Port Moresby, and No.84 Wing on Bougainville. No.71 Wing, commanded by Group Captain Val Hancock, supported the Australian 6thDivision during the Aitape–Wewak Campaign, despite ordnance deficiencies that at one stage led to its squadrons arming their Bristol Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs.

5|$|As Rana Bahadur Shah's {{bodyguard}} and advisor, Bhimsen Thapa also {{accompanied him}} to Varanasi. Rana Bahadur's retinue included his first wife, Raj Rajeshwari Devi, while his second wife, Subarna Prabha Devi, stayed back in Kathmandu {{to serve as}} the regent. Since Rana Bahadur was willing to do anything to regain his power and punish those who had forced him to exile, he served as a focal point of dissidenting factions in Varanasi. In November 1800, he first sought help from the British in exchange for which he was willing to concede a trading post in Kathmandu and grant them 37.5% of the tax revenue derived from the hills and 50% from the terai. However, the British were in favor of working with the existing government in Nepal, rather than risk <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> <b>of</b> restoring an exiled ex-King to power. The Kathmandu Durbar was willing to appease the British and agreed to sign a commercial treaty so long as the wayward Rana Bahadur and his group were held in India under strict British surveillance. This arrangement was kept a secret from Rana Bahadur and his group; but when they eventually became aware of the strictures on their movement, and hence the treaty, they were incensed at the British as well as the proponents (Damodar Pande and his faction) of this treaty in Nepal. An intrigue was set in motion with the aim of splitting the unity of courtiers in Kathmandu Durbar and fomenting anti-British feelings. A flurry of letters were exchanged between the ex-King and individual courtiers in which he tried to set them up against Damodar Pande and tried to woo them by promises of high government positions, which they could hold for their entire life, and which could be inherited by their progeny. Baburam Acharya holds Bhimsen responsible for all these schemes, reasoning that Rana Bahadur did not have the mental capacity for such negotiations and intrigues. He contends that Bhimsen was responsible for negotiation with the British as well as responsible for writing letters {{in the name of the}} ex-King, while the ex-King was bidding his time in debauchery.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of faunal succession {{is based on}} the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks.

25|$|Wavelet {{theory is}} {{applicable}} to several subjects. All wavelet transforms {{may be considered}} forms of time-frequency representation for continuous-time (analog) signals and so are related to harmonic analysis. Almost all practically useful discrete wavelet transforms use discrete-time filterbanks. These filter banks are called the wavelet and scaling coefficients in wavelets nomenclature. These filterbanks may contain either finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. The wavelets forming a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) {{are subject to the}} uncertainty principle of Fourier analysis respective sampling theory: Given a signal with some event in it, one cannot assign simultaneously an exact time and frequency response scale to that event. The product of <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> <b>of</b> time and frequency response scale has a lower bound. Thus, in the scaleogram of a continuous wavelet transform of this signal, such an event marks an entire region in the time-scale plane, instead of just one point.

25|$|Taking its {{example from}} other European modernists like Joan Miró, the Color Field {{movement}} encompasses several decades from the mid 20th century {{through the early}} 21st century. Color Field painting actually encompasses three separate but related generations of painters. Commonly used terms {{to refer to the}} three separate but related groups are Abstract expressionism, Post-Painterly Abstraction, and Lyrical Abstraction. Some of the artists made works in all three eras, that relate to all of the three styles. Color Field pioneers such as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb and Robert Motherwell are primarily thought of as Abstract Expressionists. Artists like Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis, Richard Diebenkorn, Jules Olitski, and Kenneth Noland were of a slightly younger generation {{or in the case of}} Morris Louis esthetically aligned with that generations point of view; that started out as Abstract Expressionists but quickly moved to Post-Painterly Abstraction. While younger artists like Frank Stella, Ronald Davis, Larry Zox, Larry Poons, Walter Darby Bannard, Ronnie Landfield, Dan Christensen, began with Post-Painterly Abstraction and eventually moved forward towards a new type of expressionism, referred to as Lyrical Abstraction. Many of the artists mentioned as well as many others have practiced all three modes at one phase of their careers or another. During the later phases of Color Field painting; as reflections of the zeitgeist of the late 1960s (in which everything began to hang loose) and the angst of the age (with all of <b>the</b> <b>uncertainties</b> <b>of</b> the time) merged with the gestalt of Post-Painterly Abstraction, producing Lyrical Abstraction which combined precision of the Color Field idiom with the malerische of the Abstract Expressionists. During the same period of the late 1960s early 1970s in Europe, Gerhard Richter, Anselm Kiefer and several other painters also began producing works of intense expression, merging abstraction with images, incorporating landscape imagery and figuration that by the late 1970s was referred to as Neo-expressionism.|$|E
