5|$|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis paired {{up to do}} slapstick comedy for {{the first}} time at the 500 Club on July 25, 1946. While Martin was trying to get gigs as a singer, Lewis {{performed}} as a comedian at the club. One night a different act failed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> Lewis suggested to the owner that he hire Martin to do comedy with him. The owner was skeptical, but the two went ahead and tried to devise an act on paper in their hotel room, which did not work. The next night, they went on stage and improvised for three hours, bringing the house down. The comedy duo of Martin and Lewis was popular in nightclubs and in film from 1946 to 1956.|$|E

500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} special a grade of C, criticizing it {{as a mere}} promotional vehicle for Gaga with the Muppets a last-minute addition. The {{production}} was unable to balance Gaga's album promotion with a Muppets holiday special: [...] "Nothing in Lady Gaga & The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular destroys {{the sanctity of the}} Muppets ... However, the potential for a Muppets holiday special was never given room to materialize amidst a Lady Gaga concert special designed to sell her new album. The choice to combine the two may have reached out to a broader audience, but the incongruence of the special's various parts... was bound to frustrate a sizable portion of that audience." [...] Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times agreed, criticizing the special's commercial nature; he also said its songs were [...] "less fit for a Muppet-like music special, and no one seemed willing to stray too far from the show's message of selling a product. Rather than aim for holiday timelessness, this was self-promotion, with the Muppets often coming to Gaga's world than the other way around." [...] Billboards Chris Willman also gave it a negative review, citing the show's palpably-low budget and its dialogue, guest appearances, Gaga's lip-syncing and production: [...] "There was a familiar 'why is this happening?' question hovering over the star-crossed proceedings, albeit without the benefit of any guest stars as seriously wacky as that ones <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> redeem the incongruousness." ...|$|E

But Robert does not surface which angers Paul. He begins to shout and orders Robert <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> confront him. Robert is entised by Paul's goading and he approaches his father. Dennis said that the pair have a [...] "massive showdown" [...] and the psychotic character pulls a gun and shoots Paul. Following his latest crimes Robert surrenders and is arrested. The fake wedding provided Paul writers with the chance to explore Paul and Gail's relationship which had served their characters during 1980s episodes of Neighbours. Dennis said that the chemistry that existed in 1987 was still present between the pair. On-screen his relationship with Izzy begins to suffer but the wedding makes Paul remember his past shared with Gail. The actor recalled filming the wedding made him question whether Paul and Gail were still in love. In the episode various character's notice their feelings which angers Izzy. The story ends in tragedy and loss for Paul. Katya accepts a lift from Cameron and their neighbour Max Hoyland (Stephen Lovatt) spots Katya in the car. Max mistakes Cameron for Robert and believes Katya is in danger. In an attempt to rescue her Max knocks Cameron over and kills him.

2500|$|Reimer entered {{office with}} an ambitious agenda, {{but she was}} unable to {{implement}} much of it due to a fractured city council. [...] Notoriously, alderman Sheila McKay dumped a pitcher of water over the head of alderman Brian Mason during one heated dispute; McKay later blamed her actions in part on Reimer's failure to censure Mason for telling her to [...] "shut up". [...] Faced with a divided and at times hostile city council, Reimer attempted to advance much of her agenda in the council's Executive Committee, but was criticized for this by alderman and former ally Patricia MacKenzie, who alleged that Reimer was attempting to disempower council. [...] Council further impeded her ability to implement her agenda by changing the rules such that the chairs standing committees were elected by standing committees rather than appointed by the mayor; Reimer considered using the mayor's ex-officio status as a member of every standing committee <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> vote for her preferred candidate, but ultimately decided that [...] "it was best they try to sort it out among themselves." ...|$|E

[...] However, in season seven the dynamic between the two Slayers has changed. As Rebecca Rand Kirshner explains, [...] " [...] is no longer such a complete opposite of Buffy. And there's sort of a subtler and more complicated dynamic between them". As Buffy struggles with her unwanted position of mentor to the Potential Slayers, the writers used Faith to create an outside conflict about Buffy's leadership abilities. Although Faith is questioning Buffy and her choices she is making, she is no longer an enemy to her either. In the episode [...] "Empty Places", the Potentials lose trust in Buffy and appoint Faith as their leader instead, a decision that literally blows up in their faces. As Drew Goddard explains, [...] "Faith is like the cool aunt that everyone loves, because the cool aunt doesn't have the responsibility of raising the children. She just gets <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> have fun. The problem is, Faith is not ready to lead. She's damaged in her own way. She's just beginning to pull herself together.

I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life."

2500|$|Jordan Chandler, who was 25 at {{the time}} of the trial, chose to leave the country rather than testify, and the only person in his family who {{appeared}} for questioning was his mother, June. She denied having seen any molestation, but talked about Jordan and Michael sleeping in the same room on numerous occasions, explaining that she initially didn't want them to, but was persuaded by Jackson, who had cried and been hurt that she didn't trust him. She testified about Jackson buying all kinds of gifts for the family, the trips they'd been on together, and how fun it was to be part of Jackson's world. She said she'd been concerned that her son was starting to dress like Jackson and wanting to spend all his time with him. When asked about the lawsuits that resulted from her family's involvement with Michael Jackson, June Chandler made the distinction that even though she was listed as a plaintiff and received settlement money, it was not she who sued Jackson, but rather Jordan and his father Evan who did so. [...] She claimed not to recall that Jackson had counter sued for extortion, or that her second husband, Dave Schwartz, had sued Jackson, or that Evan Chandler had sued Jackson a second time. Thomas Mesereau said in a Harvard lecture later that year, [...] "the prosecutors tried to get [...] <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say.

2500|$|In a {{surprise}} altercation, {{the next night}} on Raw, Austin refused <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> took a week-long break without the company's consent, claiming exhaustion. McMahon claimed his actions caused fury among fans who had paid to see him that night. Austin returned on the April 1, 2002 episode of Raw, {{the first of the}} new [...] "brand extension" [...] era. The show was centered on which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with The Undertaker that resulted in a number-one contender's match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at Backlash, which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope when he was pinned. He would later be betrayed by Big Show, who went on to rejoin the nWo, and Ric Flair. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at Judgment Day. In an interview on WWE's premier Internet program, Byte This!, in May 2002, Austin stunned the company and fans by launching a verbal attack on the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they previously did. The commentators struggled to keep Austin's opinions on a neutral wavelength, leading to the WWE apologising to fans for the outburst and stated it was not part of Austin's current or upcoming storylines. McMahon responded a week later on the same show playing down the outburst, claiming that Austin was merely the type of wrestler who was occasionally difficult to work with. The WWE rehired Eddie Guerrero for Austin to feud with, while also prepping Austin for a feud with Brock Lesnar. However, Austin vetoed any matches that would result in him losing to Lesnar and ultimately walked out of the company. Austin later explained that he thought hot-shotting a rookie made Austin look weak and did not give Lesnar a proper stage for such a big win over a star of the magnitude that Austin held. Further fanning the flames amongst Austin's growing number of detractors was a well-publicized domestic dispute incident between Austin and his wife Debra.|$|E
