5000|$|A {{year before}} the election, the Frieden {{government}} had a limited margin for manoeuvre. Various pressure groups presented their demands to the government, especially the Farmers' Central and the unions. The Frieden government continued {{the policy of the}} preceding government, putting more emphasis on reforms in education and culture. The law of 7 July 1958 introduced a new training regime for teachers. Their secondary studies would be complemented by two years at the [...] "Institut pédagogique". The law of 3 August 1958 created the [...] "Institut d'enseignement technique". The law of 5 December 1958 gave a legal status to the National Library and the State Archives. Other reforms, such as those of the state museums and professional education, could not be completed due to the premature death of the Prime Minister. The continual growth of the number of pupils required the construction of new school buildings. In 1958, construction was started for a new school campus on Boulevard Pierre Dupong, of which the first completed building was that of the new Athénée. The government also pursued the modernisation of the country's infrastructure. On 10 July 1958, it signed an agreement with the German Land Rhineland-Palatinate on the development of a pumping station on the Our, near Vianden. To achieve this, a private company with some investment by the Luxembourgish State had been created in 1951, the Société électrique de l’Our (SEO). The signing of the agreement allowed construction <b>t</b> <b>start</b> on the hydroelectric plant. The pumping station started working in 1963.|$|E

It 2 ̆ 7 s been brewing for a long time. But Attica touched it off. Since then we have had {{recurrent}} disorders and unrest accompanied by wide public debate. Newspapers and periodicals nowadays often include articles and editorials on the shortcomings of corrections. The courts, legislative committees, church groups, chambers of commerce, and similar community organizations have joined in. Last December at the National Conference on Corrections called by President Nixon, the message was loud and clear. The country expects change and it expects action to bring about that change. To put it bluntly, the field of corrections is experiencing a crisis in public confidence, and the crisis shows no sign of abating. Unlike times past we can 2 ̆ 7 t expect to handle the problem by letting it wear itself out. The question we have to face is: What are we going to do ourselves to restore confidence in our corrections system? First, we must change our attitudes toward the courts. Second, we must change our attitudes toward lawyers. Third, we have to change our attitude toward the media—the press, radio, and television. Fourth, we must take a different attitude toward the public. Fifth, we must take a different attitude toward our own field. A final word, let 2 ̆ 7 s take a different attitude toward our own organization, the American Correctional Association...|$|E
40|$|Timed-released {{disassembly}} of nanoparticles {{without a}} remote trigger or environmental cues is demonstrated in this work. The reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization allowed the fine-tuning {{of the chemical}} composition in the diblock copolymers, in which the first block consisted of a hydrophilic monomer (DMA) and the second random block consisted of three different monomers: (a) the thermoresponsive NIPAM, (b) the self-catalyzed hydrolyzable DMAEA, and (c) the hydrophobic BA. These diblock copolymers were solubilized in water below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the thermoresponsive second block, and heated to 37 C (i. e., >LCST) to form small micelle nanoparticles with a narrow particle size distribution. As DMAEA hydrolyzed to acrylic acid groups, the LCST of the diblock increased, and the time {{at the start of}} micelle disassembly (<b>t</b> <b>start)</b> corresponded {{to the point where the}} LCST was equal to the solution temperature (i. e., 37 C). The high water content in the PNIPAM core allowed an even degradation of the core over time. The copolymer composition allowed fine control over tstart, as this time was linearly dependent upon the BA units in the second block. These nanoparticles could also be designed to be stable (i. e., not disassemble) over a wide pH range or disassemble below a pH of 7. 3. Additionally, the time from the start of disassembly to full unimer formation (tdegrade) could be controlled by the amount of DMAEA units in the second block. A longer tdegrade (∼ 5. 5 h) was found when the number of DMAEA units was 42 compared to t degrade of 1. 1 h for 25 units. The nanoparticles designed in this work, through fine control of the polymer chemical composition, have the potential for drug delivery purposes for timed-release of drugs and prodrugs and other wide-ranging applications where timed-release would be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|The Philosopher 2 ̆ 7 s Mail {{is a new}} news organisation, with bureaux in London, Amsterdam and Melbourne, run and staffed {{entirely by}} philosophers. It is written and {{published}} by The School of Life {{in association with the}} book The news: a users manual written by Alain de Botton. It is committed to bringing you the latest, biggest stories, as interpreted by philosophers rather than journalists. Why did this organisation start? Because today, the most attractive, charming, sexy and compelling news outlets enjoy unparalled influence over the minds of tens of millions of people. But unfortunately, they rarely put out content that might {{make the world a better}} place. At the same time, there are lots of serious, earnest good people attempting to change things, but they put out publications full of very interesting and dense articles that only reach tiny and already-convinced audiences. So the good ideas go nowhere and the not-so-great ideas mesmerise us from every screen. Therefore, the world doesn 2 ̆ 7 t change. The goal of the Philosopher 2 ̆ 7 s Mail is to prove a genuinely popular and populist news outlet which at the same time is alive to traditional philosophical virtues. For too long, philosophers have been happy merely to be wise and right. This has offered them huge professional satisfaction but it has not influenced the course of society. The average work of philosophy currently reaches 300 people. Socrates: Very interesting but not that many people care. Hence the challenge that explains the birth of The Philosophers 2 ̆ 7 Mail, a new media outlet rooted in popular interests, sensibilities and inclinations of the day - but that tries to read and caption the news with an eye to traditional central philosophical concerns - for compassion, truth, justice, complexity, calm, empathy and wisdom. The site views the rolling succession of the day 2 ̆ 7 s news as an occasion for the development of insight, generosity and emotional intelligence. News is not simply information about what is happening in the world. It is one of the key places where we daily shape our underlying assumptions about life - about what is important, admirable, scandalous, normal; where we rehearse attitudes to fear, hope, good and evil. This is why the news is a major target of concern for real philosophers. The Philosophers 2 ̆ 7 Mail makes use of popular starting points - the stories a lot of people like to read and talk about already. It is generous to our natural inclinations: to read celebrity gossip, look at erotic images and read shock stories. It is sympathetic (as a starting point) to popular biases: anxiety about whatever feels foreign, a taste for vengeance, lack of empathy for the very poor, envy of the very rich, resentment of the powerful, suspicion of those who seem clever, dislike of awkward truths [...] . We start by acknowledging such attitudes: it isn 2 ̆ 7 t strange to be unnerved by a Romanian family begging on a French train; it would be thrilling to have sex with Jennifer Lawrence; one can empathise with the feeling that George Osborne doesn 2 ̆ 7 t quite know what real life is like; it is natural to want to switch off when hearing about trouble in Africa. We don 2 ̆ 7 <b>t</b> <b>start</b> by asking what the wise or good or serious outlook might be. There are plenty of people pushing such lines already - for that one could turn to the Economist, or the New York Times. The epochal challenge is to reach the people who don 2 ̆ 7 t engage with complex news. Ripe for philosophical insights. Kim in party mode.  ...|$|E
