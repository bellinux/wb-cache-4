30|$|By {{distinguishing}} the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution,</b> it {{is possible}} to identify the groups of users that are highly active and/or experts only in certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution.</b> Identifying the existing user groups in this perspective can, in turn, help manage the community and coordinate the contributors. Usenet has been thoroughly studied with varying methods, and the resulting literature consistently points to a description of newsgroup participants that include answer persons, question persons, and trolls, and lurkers[9 – 12]. In the context of Wikipedia, distinct contributors of different profiles are chiefly responsible for certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> [16], and inexperienced and experienced users have been observed to contribute differently [14]. Welser et al. [16] also show that none of these profiles are formed by a large majority of experienced users. This observation suggests that the community does not depend heavily on experienced users for the service provided by editors in any of the profiles.|$|R

40|$|The vast open {{sharing of}} digital content {{has become a}} driving force on the {{internet}} in 2008. A large and growing number of online systems support massive collaboration to produce public repositories of information. As the prevalence, scale, and variety of these systems grows, {{it is essential to}} examine the motivations of individuals who contribute to them. This project is founded on the premise that just two categories – contributors and non-contributors – do not accurately capture either the specific products of online collective action or the variety of incentives that drive it. We need not assume, for example, that the same incentives will motivate an individual to edit content on Wikipedia, to join a social networking site like LinkedIn, or to respond to queries on Yahoo! Answers. Instead, I present an exploratory framework that identifies four common <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution.</b> Based on these types, I then explore existing research in social psychology that may lend insight into designing incentives for promoting specific <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> behavior. Background This project focuses on examining the relationships between social psychological incentives – incentives that provide benefits through internal feelings and perceptions (Cheshire and Antin 2008) – and specific <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution.</b> Social psychological processes have been shown to influence the behaviors o...|$|R
40|$|At the quark level {{there are}} {{basically}} two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> R-parity violating SUSY (RPV SUSY) to neutrinoless double beta decay: the short-range contribution involving only heavy virtual superpartners and the long-range {{one with the}} virtual squark and neutrino. Hadronization of the effective operators, corresponding to these two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions,</b> may in general involve virtual pions {{in addition to the}} close on-mass-shell nucleons. It is known that the short-range contribution is dominated by the pion exchange. In the present paper we show that this is also true for the long-range RPV SUSY contribution and, therefore, the RPV SUSY contributes to the neutrinoless double beta decay dominantly via charged pion exchange between the decaying nucleons.

Our results point out to a difference regarding the number of participations of genders. We found some differences in the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> of both sexes...|$|E

For the sake of simplicity, this paper only uses additive models. However, the proposed algorithm may assess the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> (linear, non linear, etc.) of each variable.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of emotional speech constitutes quite a multidisciplinary research field.

Methodological issues that might contribute to the fruitfulness of studies of expressive speech are discussed.

We use a public goods game to classify subjects by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> preference and by belief about the contributions of others; and we measure betrayal aversion for different categories of subject.

This is consistent with their social risk taking in public goods games, as the pessimistic conditional cooperators tend to avoid contribution to avoid exploitation, whereas the optimistic ones typically contribute to the public good and thus take the social risk of being exploited...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how contributions to household resources, indicated by employment status, influence satisfaction with household income (SWHI) {{for members of}} male/female couples. We take changes in SWHI, which may differ within couples, to indicate changes in perceived benefits from their common household income, benefits that can go beyond individual consumption. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey for 2, 396 couples from 1996 to 2007, three gender effects are identified. First, men predominate in making the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution</b> that most positively influences SWHI, namely full-time employment. Second, the effect of contributions depends on {{the gender of the}} contributor, with men’s employment being more influential than women’s. Third, within couples, making the more influential contribution, as men tend to do, leads to relatively greater SWHI. We conclude that gender asymmetry in contributions made to household resources is one way in which gender inequalities invade and inhabit households...|$|E
