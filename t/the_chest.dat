5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> is compressed {{from front to}} back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> wall because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside of <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity; thus when <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination of these three mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E

5|$|Gunshot wounds are the commonest form of {{penetrating}} {{trauma that}} cause TBI. Less commonly, knife wounds and shrapnel from motor vehicle accidents can also penetrate the airways. Most injuries to the trachea {{occur in the}} neck, because the airways within <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> are deep and therefore well protected; however, up to a quarter of TBI resulting from penetrating trauma occurs within <b>the</b> <b>chest.</b> Injury to the cervical trachea usually affects the anterior (front) part of the trachea.|$|E
5|$|Injuries to the tracheobronchial tree within <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> {{may occur}} due to {{penetrating}} forces such as gunshot wounds, but {{are more often}} the result of blunt trauma. TBI due blunt forces usually results from high-energy impacts such as falls from height and motor vehicle accidents; the injury is rare in low-impact mechanisms. Injuries of the trachea cause about 1% of traffic-related deaths. Other potential causes are falls from high places and injuries in which <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> is crushed. Explosions are another cause.|$|E

5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of <b>the</b> <b>chest)</b> with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Queen Elizabeth {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} <b>the</b> <b>Chest</b> of Saint Simeon in 1381. <b>The</b> <b>chest,</b> located in Zadar, is of great importance {{for the history of}} the city, as it depicts various historical events– such as the death of her father– and Elizabeth herself. According to legend, she stole the saint's finger and paid for the creation of the casket in order to atone for her sin. The casket contains a scene which allegedly depicts the queen gone mad after stealing the relict.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E

5|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{may occur}} when <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> is suddenly decelerated, as occurs in vehicle accidents, producing a shearing force. The lungs are mobile in <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> cavity but their movement is more restricted near the hilum. Areas near the cricoid cartilage and carina are {{fixed to the}} thyroid cartilage and the pericardium respectively; thus if the airways move, they can tear at these points of fixation.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas.|$|E
