40|$|Pattern {{regulation}} of malic enzyme (ME) distribution in D. melanogaster/D. simulans (mel/sim) hybrid eye-antennal discs was investigated. Both cis- and trans-{{regulation of}} the spatial distribution pattern was observed within <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>portion</b> of the disc complex. D. simulans possesses gene(s) that operate in trans in the hybrids to suppress ME staining along the morphogenetic furrow, {{a region that}} always stains in D. melanogaster. ME structural genes of both species were expressed in cis within the ommatidial preclusters and clusters of the hybrids. Malic enzyme was not expressed elsewhere in the eye disc of either species. Restoration of the D. melanogaster furrow pattern element occurred in partial hybrids that were homozygous for the D. melanogaster 3 R where the structural gene resides. Therefore, a dominant gene(s) in the D. simulans 3 R suppresses the D. melanogaster furrow pattern, while a recessive gene(s) in the D. melanogaster 3 R restores the pattern when the trans-suppressor is removed. These conclusions agree with those found for regulation of aldehyde oxidase distribution in D. melanogaster/D. simulans hybrid wing discs...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has established a}} relationship between prenatal testosterone and sex-linked behavior, such that higher levels of prenatal testosterone are related to more masculine behaviors. Yet, {{little is known about}} the postnatal androgen surge, that occur around three-months of age. Preliminary research suggests that higher levels of postnatal testosterone may also result in the masculinization of some sex-typed behaviors (e. g., visual preferences and toy preferences). The primary purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the relationship between postnatal testosterone and behaviors in early childhood, including behaviors characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorders. Sixty-six children, between 4 - and 7 -years of age, and their parents participated in this study. Saliva samples were obtained and assayed for testosterone levels when children were 3 - to 4 -months of age. Second to fourth digit ratios were measured and used as indicators of prenatal testosterone exposure. Parents completed one self-report questionnaire (Autism Spectrum Quotient) and several parent-report questionnaires (Autism Spectrum Quotient-Children?s Version, Empathy Quotient-Children?s Version, Systemizing Quotient-Children?s Version, and Child Behavior Checklist), while children participated in various experimental tasks (Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, Playmate and Play Style Preferences Structured Interview, mental rotation task, two false belief tasks, an emotion recognition task, and an eye-tracking task). Overall, lower digit ratios, indicative of greater prenatal testosterone exposure, were associated with more masculine behaviors. For example, lower digit ratios were predictive of less time required to complete a mental rotation task and were correlated with lower empathy scores, smaller vocabularies, lower emotion recognition scores and less visual interest in viewing <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>portion</b> of faces. A novel finding of this study was that higher postnatal testosterone levels at 3 -months of age were predictive of less visual interest in people compared to objects at 5 -years of age. This finding supports the idea that the postnatal surge of testosterone that occurs in early infancy could have organizational effects on behavior, especially behaviors required for socialization. However, future research establishing a link between postnatal testosterone and behaviors beyond early childhood is required before establishing this postnatal phase as another critical period for the development of later behaviors...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} iris recognition, the most accurate form of biometric identification. The robustness of iris recognition comes from the unique characteristics of the human, and the permanency of the iris texture as it is stable over human life, and the environmental effects cannot easily alter its shape. In most iris recognition systems, ideal image acquisition conditions are assumed. These conditions include a near infrared (NIR) light source to reveal the clear iris texture as well as look and stare constraints and close distance from the capturing device. However, the recognition accuracy of the-state-of-the-art systems decreases significantly when these constraints are relaxed. Recent advances have proposed different methods to process iris images captured in unconstrained environments. While these methods improve {{the accuracy of the}} original iris recognition system, they still have segmentation and feature selection problems, which results in high FRR (False Rejection Rate) and FAR (False Acceptance Rate) or in recognition failure. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a novel segmentation algorithm for detecting the limbus and pupillary boundaries of human iris images with a quality assessment process is proposed. The algorithm first searches over the HSV colour space to detect the local maxima sclera region as it is the most easily distinguishable part of <b>the</b> human <b>eye.</b> <b>The</b> parameters from this stage are then used for eye area detection, upper/lower eyelid isolation and for rotation angle correction. The second step is the iris image quality assessment process, as the iris images captured under unconstrained conditions have heterogeneous characteristics. In addition, the probability of getting a mis-segmented sclera portion around the outer ring of the iris is very high, especially in the presence of reflection caused by a visible wavelength light source. Therefore, quality assessment procedures are applied for the classification of images from the first step into seven different categories based on the average of their RGB colour intensity. An appropriate filter is applied based on the detected quality. In the third step, a binarization process is applied to <b>the</b> detected <b>eye</b> <b>portion</b> from <b>the</b> first step for detecting the iris outer ring based on a threshold value defined on the basis of image quality from the second step. Finally, for the pupil area segmentation, the method searches over the HSV colour space for local minima pixels, as the pupil contains the darkest pixels in <b>the</b> human <b>eye.</b> In <b>the</b> second part, a novel discriminating feature extraction and selection based on the Curvelet transform are introduced. Most of the state-of-the-art iris recognition systems use the textural features extracted from the iris images. While these fine tiny features are very robust when extracted from high resolution clear images captured at very close distances, they show major weaknesses when extracted from degraded images captured over long distances. The use of the Curvelet transform to extract 2 D geometrical features (curves and edges) from the degraded iris images addresses the weakness of 1 D texture features extracted by the classical methods based on textural analysis wavelet transform. Our experiments show significant improvements in the segmentation and recognition accuracy when compared to the-state-of-the-art results...|$|R
