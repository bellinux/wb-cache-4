5|$|Civil War <b>tokens</b> {{are divided}} into three types—store cards, {{patriotic}} <b>tokens,</b> and sutler <b>tokens.</b> All three types were utilized as currency, and are differentiated by their designs. The collectible value of the <b>tokens</b> is determined chiefly by their rarity.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, {{the second}} year of the Civil War, government-issued coinage began {{vanishing}} from circulation. American citizens hoarded all coins with gold and silver, and eventually began hoarding copper-nickel cents as well. This made it extremely difficult for businesses to conduct transactions. In response, many merchants turned to private minters to fill the void left by the hoarded coins. The first of these privately minted <b>tokens</b> appeared in the autumn of 1862, by H. A. Ratterman, in Cincinnati, Ohio. New York issues followed in the spring of 1863, first with Lindenmueller currency store card <b>tokens</b> issued by New York City barkeep Gustavus Lindenmueller and then with Knickerbocker currency patriotic <b>tokens</b> issued by William H. Bridgens. It is estimated that by 1864, there were 25,000,000 Civil War <b>tokens</b> (nearly all redeemable for one cent) in circulation, consisting of approximately 7,000–8,000 varieties.|$|E
5|$|Civil War <b>tokens</b> are token coins {{that were}} privately minted and {{distributed}} in the United States between 1861 and 1864. They were used mainly in the Northeast and Midwest.

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{technical}} developments, Ferrari upgraded their engine for their home race by using {{three of their}} development <b>tokens</b> while Mercedes spent all seven of their remaining engine <b>tokens.</b> As a result of this, Mercedes became the first team in 2015 to use all their <b>tokens,</b> with both Honda and Ferrari having four <b>tokens</b> remaining and Renault having twelve <b>tokens</b> left for later in the season. Because of these changes both Mercedes cars were on their third powerplants, whilst both Ferrari cars were on their fourth power units. Additionally, Toro Rosso, Red Bull and McLaren received grid penalties for exceeding their parts usage, forcing them {{to start at the}} back of the grid. McLaren went back to using their snub nose design, which they had replaced earlier in the season ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, in order to achieve better aerodynamics and lower drag for the high-speed Monza circuit.|$|E
5|$|Celtiberian is {{documented}} as a written language only after {{contact with the}} Romans in the 2nd century BC. Of 103 Celtiberian inscriptions, thirty in Iberian script are hospitality <b>tokens</b> (tesserae hospitales), twenty {{of which are in}} the shape of animals. The social custom of pledging mutual support among families or communities was compatible with hospitium in Roman culture, and the Celtiberians continued to produce the <b>tokens,</b> though switching to Latin, into the 2nd century of the Imperial era. Under Augustus, the territory of the Celtiberians became part of the Tarraconensis province. Written Celtiberian ceases early in the reign of Augustus, if not before.|$|E

5|$|The Great North {{had opened}} using {{a system of}} telegraphic train orders, and as the {{signalling}} was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange <b>tokens</b> {{in a process that}} frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token exchange system based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first <b>tokens</b> were exchanged at , but soon they were exchanged at line speed.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{decentralized}} <b>token</b> generation scheme for token-based mutual exclusion algorithms. In this scheme, when a site does not receive the <b>token</b> to access the critical section within a timeout period, it {{sends a message to}} every site to generate a new <b>token.</b> When site i receives the message to generate a new <b>token</b> from site j, it generates a new <b>token</b> and sends it to the site to which i had sent the <b>token</b> most recently only if site i had executed critical the section later than site j. On receiving the <b>token</b> from site l, a site retains the <b>token</b> only if it had not executed critical section since site l had executed critical section the last time. Unlike other <b>token</b> generation schemes, this scheme is distributed in nature and is more fault-tolerant and efficient.

5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden <b>tokens</b> in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal <b>tokens</b> were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given <b>tokens</b> for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining <b>tokens</b> rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{efficient}} fault-tolerant token-based algorithm for achieving mutual exclusion in distributed systems. In Nishio et al. 's [7] faulttolerant mutual exclusion algorithm, when a site detects {{the loss of}} <b>token,</b> it requires a positive acknowledgment from every other site to generate a new <b>token.</b> This could be time consuming {{in the presence of}} failed sites or failed communication links because the failure of even a single site would delay the <b>token</b> generation until that site comes up and sends a positive acknowledgment. Moreover, in this algorithm, if a site falsely detects <b>token</b> loss, it could cause the deletion of the existing <b>token,</b> thereby reducing the availability of the <b>token.</b> The algorithm proposed in this paper solves these problems.
