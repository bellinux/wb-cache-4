5|$|Although it {{made little}} impact on its first publication, the 1906 novel Love Among <b>the</b> <b>Chickens</b> {{contained}} what French calls the author's first original comic creation: Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge. The character, an amoral, bungling opportunist, is partly based on Wodehouse's Globe colleague Herbert Westbrook. The two collaborated between 1907 and 1913 on two books, two music hall sketches, and a play, Brother Alfred. Wodehouse {{would return to the}} character in short stories over the next six decades.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Jo {{is furious}} to {{discover}} that all <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> have been slaughtered. Blaming a local fox, she lays traps for the animal and goes after it with a rifle, assisted by Jessica and Kator. When the hunt fails, Kator tracks and kills the fox {{on his own and}} presents it to Jessica and Jo as a trophy. The trio celebrate with a champagne party for which Jo dresses Kator in drag. A subsequent game of hide-and-seek brings out more of the hunter in Kator. Later, Jo is disturbed to find the fox carcass stripped bare and realises that the animal was not caught in a trap as she and Jessica thought. Jessica angrily rejects her warnings about Anders, interpreting Jo's fear as jealousy and revealing that she knows the truth about Simon.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake is a {{difficult}} bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so {{than that of the}} African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the open, this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may feign death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.|$|E

5|$|Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) is the 15-year-old {{daughter}} of Somayya (Ramachandriah Marikanti), a poor, low caste fisherman from rural Andhra Pradesh. Somayya struggles {{to support his}} family due to dwindling catches at sea and mounting debts. One day, Vanaja and her teenage friend Lacchi (Bhavani Renukunta) watch a theatrical performance by a former Kuchipudi (a native classical Indian dance form) great, Rama Devi (Urmila Dammannagari). The sequence of events lead to a soothsayer predicting to Vanaja {{that she will be}} a great dancer.

25|$|In 1879, his assistant, Charles Chamberland (of French origin), {{had been}} {{instructed}} to inoculate <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> after Pasteur went on holiday.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chickens</b> {{were used}} on {{a limited number of}} routes, from 4 July 1954 on lines 0, 8 and 13, {{variously}} serving the Vippetangen Line, the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, the Sagene Line and the Sinsen Line. From 1955 they also started running on the Rodeløkka Line. The TO trailers were usually run with <b>the</b> <b>Chickens,</b> although they were also hauled by the larger Høka units. The tramway experienced that <b>the</b> <b>Chickens</b> did not have sufficient pneumatic capacity to keep a tram and trailer at ease while stopped on slopes, as separate compressors in the trailers were not installed. This made operating trailers with <b>the</b> <b>Chickens</b> a safety hazard and soon they were only seen i solitude.|$|E

25|$|In December 1879, Pasteur used a {{weakened}} {{culture of the}} bacteria to inoculate chickens. <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> survived, and when he inoculated them with a virulent strain, they were immune to it.

25|$|Chickens {{are kept}} indoors {{but with more}} space (around 12 to 14 birds per square metre). They have a richer {{environment}} for example with natural light or straw bales that encourage foraging and perching. <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> grow more slowly and live {{for up to two}} weeks longer than intensively farmed birds. The benefits of higher welfare indoor systems are the reduced growth rate, less crowding and more opportunities for natural behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur's {{later work}} on {{diseases}} included work on chicken cholera. He received cultures from Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint, and cultivated them in chicken broth. During this work, {{a culture of}} the responsible bacteria had spoiled and failed to induce the disease in some chickens he was infecting with the disease. Upon reusing these healthy chickens, Pasteur discovered he could not infect them, even with fresh bacteria; the weakened bacteria had caused <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> to become immune to the disease, though they had caused only mild symptoms.|$|E

25|$|The {{city council}} voted in 1960 to {{gradually}} close down the tramway {{and replace it}} with the metro and diesel buses. Operations could continue with the existing rolling stock, although all investments were halted. In the following eight years the least trafficked tram lines were closed. SM53 was most commonly used on lines 1, 2, 7 and 11 in this period, specifically serving the Briskeby Line, the Frogner Line, the Ullevål Hageby Line, the Sinsen Line, the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line and the Kjelsås Line, as well as the suburban lines. <b>The</b> <b>Chickens</b> were used on the Sagene Line. The last SM53 ran on the Lambertseter Line on 17 May 1966 and on the Østensjø Line 29 October 1967, as these were converted to metro lines. From then all SM53s were stalled at Grefsen.|$|E
25|$|The {{city council}} voted in February 1978 to not close the tramway and instead invest in new rolling stock.

Except for being underpowered, making them unsuitable for service on the Ekeberg Line, they worked well and Oslo Sporveier therefore decided to retire <b>the</b> <b>Chickens</b> {{and replace them with}} additional MBG and TBG trams and trailers. Four more such pairs were delivered in 1980. The first two Chickens were retired {{at the end of the}} 1980 and were chopped in October 1981. With the delivery of the twenty-five first SL79 trams in 1982, the remaining Chickens could be retired on 1 September. No. 38 was preserved by Oslo Tramway Museum, while the rest of the units were scrapped in the course of the month. This was the last twin-axled trams to run in revenue service in Oslo.|$|E
25|$|Work {{continues}} on substituting vegetable proteins and protein concentrates for fish meal in the salmonid diet. As of 2014, an enzymatic {{process can be}} used to lower the carbohydrate content of barley, making it a high-protein fish feed suitable for salmon. Many other substitutions for fish meal are known, and diets containing zero fish meal are possible. For example, a planned closed containment salmon fish farm in Scotland uses ragworms, algae and amino acids as feed. However, commercial economic animal diets are determined by least cost linear programming models that are effectively competing with similar models for chicken and pig feeds for the same feed ingredients and these models show that fish meal is more useful in aquatic diets than in chicken diets, where they can make <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> taste like fish. Unfortunately, this substitution can result in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 content in the farmed product. However, when vegetable oil is used in the growing diet as an energy source and a different finishing diet containing high omega-3 content fatty acids from either fish oil, algae oils or some vegetable oils are used a few months before harvest, this problem is eliminated.|$|E
