5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees {{marriage as a}} unique bond between <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light.

Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern seen for centuries among European rulers.|$|E

500|$|Lombard {{appeared}} in five films released during 1931, {{beginning with the}} Frank Tuttle comedy It Pays to Advertise. Her next two films, Man of the World and Ladies Man, both featured William Powell, Paramount's top male star. Lombard had {{been a fan of}} the actor before they met, attracted to his good looks and debonair screen persona, and they were soon in a relationship. The differences between the pair have been noted by biographers: she was 22, carefree, and famously foul-mouthed, while he was 38, intellectual, and sophisticated. Despite their disparate personalities, Lombard married Powell on June 6, 1931, at her Beverly Hills home. Talking to the media, she argued for the benefits of [...] "love between <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> diametrically different", claiming that their relationship allowed for a [...] "perfect see-saw love".|$|E
500|$|Cortese {{believed}} that Ruby {{fell in love}} with Sam {{over the course of the}} season, though she questioned whether this was [...] "true love" [...] or her being [...] "in love with what he can do". As Cortese noted, [...] "He has something she can nurture. It's almost like a mother bear and her cub [...] how protective she is... Sam's all , so it's almost like giving birth, in a weird, messed-up way." [...] She stated that the sex scene between her character and Sam was [...] "about <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> so broken and sad" [...] and compared it to similar sex scenes from the film Monster's Ball. Although Ruby eventually reveals herself as a traitor, Kripke wrote her final scene with the intention of depicting Ruby as [...] "the opposite of evil" [...] and to show that Ruby does care about Sam, despite her manipulation of him to free Lucifer; Kripke explained that, in Ruby's mind, she had to lead Sam down that path because [...] "it was for his own good".|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the first day, one ballot (referred to as a [...] "scrutiny") may be held, but is not required. If a ballot takes place on {{the afternoon}} of the first day and no-one is elected, or no ballot had taken place, a maximum of four ballots are held on each successive day: two in each morning and two in each afternoon. Before voting in the morning and again before voting in the afternoon, the electors take an oath to obey the rules of the conclave. If no result is obtained after three vote days of balloting, the process is suspended for a maximum of one day for prayer and an address by the senior Cardinal Deacon. After seven further ballots, the process may again be similarly suspended, with the address now being delivered by the senior Cardinal Priest. If, after another seven ballots, no result is achieved, voting is suspended once more, the address being delivered by the senior Cardinal Bishop. After a further seven ballots, there shall be a day of prayer, reflection and dialogue. In the following ballots, only the two names who received the most votes in the last ballot shall be eligible in a runoff election.

[...] Merv and Betty were brought together by Byron Paul, producer of [...] "The Jane Froman Show", and Irving Mansfield, the show's creator. [...] Mansfield remembered Merv for his singing in the Grace Moore picture and for his hit song, [...] "I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts." [...] The producer of the show (Byron Paul) had already considered Miss Grove for the summer replacement show, but [...] "it {{was just a matter}} of finding a boy," [...] Byron said.

2500|$|The series {{introduced}} {{new love}} interests for both Tony and Ziva {{in the latter}} half of Season 8, and in February 2011, Michael Ausiello from TVLine announced that Ziva's boyfriend [...] "Ray arrives in this season's 20th episode and is described as a handsome, charming, intelligent federal agent of Mediterranean or Latin American descent. He has a strong, nice-guy demeanor but—I'm quoting from the casting notice here—'there's a hint of a mystery behind his smile.'" [...] A week later, Glasberg described the character as a [...] "fun, smart, exciting addition", and Michael Weatherly commented, [...] "I think it’s going to be interesting. Tony cares about Ziva and wants to make sure she’s not mixed up with the wrong kind of guy, so he’s going to be watchful and protective of her." [...] After Enrique Murciano was cast for the role of Ray Cruz, Cote de Pablo said, [...] "You never know if you're gonna have chemistry, and since I had no say in the casting, I was sort of waiting to meet this famous Enrique Murciano." [...] She went on to describe his appearance in the show: [...] "There's a lovely scene in which he basically brings his interpretation of 'fancy' candlelight dinner, which takes place by the vending machines at NCIS. It's really funny. There's kissing involved. We kept it light and we kept it fun, and we kept it like <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> genuinely in to each other and wanting to move things along.

2500|$|Starting in {{the middle}} of the second season, the writing staff began to draw {{inspiration}} from the premise of The Contender (2000). Schur explained that The Contender was about a female politician trying to succeed amid intense scrutiny in a political arena dominated by men, which is similar to challenges Leslie Knope occasionally encounters. The financial difficulties Pawnee experiences during the late second season and third-season episodes were reflective of the financial crisis facing the nation and much of the world when the episodes were produced. The introduction of Chris Traeger and Ben Wyatt as state auditors visiting Pawnee, and the subsequent government shutdown, were inspired by news reports at the time of a number of states considering a shut down of schools, parks and other services due to the global recession. The third season included a seven-episode story arc about the characters organizing a harvest festival, and staking the financial future of their department on its success. The festival served as a device to unite the characters, much like the construction pit had earlier in the show. Schur said this was done because the first six episodes were written and filmed early, and the writing staff felt that having one concise storyline to tie them together kept the writers focused and, in Schur's words, helped [...] "organize our tired, end-of-the-year brains". For the romance arc between Leslie and Ben in seasons three and four, The Remains of the Day was used as an inspiration, as a story about <b>two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> forced not to convey their romantic feelings for each other due to a repressive social system, which Schur compared to modern-day government.|$|E
2500|$|At first, the Twelfth Doctor {{explicitly}} {{rejected the}} idea of having a romantic relationship with his companion Clara Oswald. He implied that in his previous form, he had come to see himself as Clara's [...] "boyfriend" [...] in an attempt to avoid confronting his extreme age and alien nature. Initially it was reported that Peter Capaldi told tabloids there would be [...] "no flirting" [...] between him and Clara, likening such a potential relationship to Papa and Nicole, but the actor himself discarded that. The episode [...] "Deep Breath" [...] introduces a character named Missy who identifies the Doctor as her boyfriend. Missy is later revealed to be a female incarnation of the Master. As the character of the Twelfth Doctor evolved, so did his relationship with Clara, and subtle elements of romance began to filter back in though not to the same degree as with his predecessor. In a spring 2015 interview, Steven Moffat indicated that the Doctor had never stopped being [...] "besotted" [...] with Clara, and that he [...] "loves them (companions) more than they love him." [...] In a media roundtable interview at the 2015 San Diego Comic Con, Capaldi went further, saying the two were romantically involved, just not in the traditional sense, [...] "It's romantic in the old sense. <b>Two</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> really crazy about each other..." [...] The narrative of series nine culminated in a three-part story arc in which Clara dies and the Doctor spends the next 4.5 billion years executing a gambit to change history and save her life. Further romance for the Twelfth Doctor was implied in the 2015 Christmas special, [...] "The Husbands of River Song", in which this incarnation meets his one-time wife, River Song, for the first (and, narratively, the last) time.|$|E
