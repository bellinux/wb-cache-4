5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|June 12.— After we had dined with Mr. Pageatt, {{where we}} had a neat dinner and strawberries, longest <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> {{we went to a}} house called Dole-hoof, where we saw the {{pictures}} made in wax most liveyly...|$|E
25|$|In one {{department}} {{however the}} 1974–75 combination excelled any other <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> They {{were the best}} fielding combination I have ever witnessed on the cricket field... everyone chased like demons, caught like angels, and, unfortunately, occasionally swore like troopers. Looking back at the Perth Test , I still {{find it difficult to}} believe that some of the catches that were taken were even in the bounds of possibility.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not mention}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him take them from his hat and slip them into his coat-tail pocket.|$|R

5000|$|... "At {{the end of}} the quarter, {{the earth}} started to tremble, there was a distant rumble that {{continued}} to grow. Some excited fan in the stands bellowed, 'Hold your horses, the elephants are coming,' and out stamped this Alabama varsity. It was the first time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it {{and the size of the}} entire eleven nearly knocked me cold, men <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> play last year looking like they had nearly doubled in size." ...|$|R
500|$|Maryland {{head coach}} Jim Tatum, who had {{previously}} coached eight first-team All-Americans at Oklahoma and coached six aside from Ward at Maryland, said that Ward was [...] "the greatest football player I've seen ounce-for-ounce, and the best I've ever coached." [...] Quarterback Jack Scarbath considered Ward one of Maryland's best all-time linemen alongside Randy White. Teammate and first-round NFL Draft pick Ed Modzelewski said, [...] "I still believe he was the greatest player, pound for pound, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in either pro or college ball." [...] Ward {{was inducted into the}} College Football Hall of Fame in 1980, and into the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame in 1984.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{lingering}} shadow of these accusations, [...] "Cog" [...] drew an unprecedented amount of critical acclaim. It received more awards than any commercial in history; {{so many that}} it was both the most-awarded commercial of 2004 and the 33rd-most-awarded commercial of 2003. The jury for the British Television Advertising Awards gave the piece the highest score of any commercial ever recorded; the jury's chairman Charles Inge commented: [...] "My own opinion {{is that this is}} the best commercial <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> for at least ten years." [...] After awarding [...] "Cog" [...] with several Silver awards, the president-elect of the D Awards, Dick Powell, said of the piece: [...] "It delights and entrances, [...] it communicates engineering quality and quality of thinking, and leaves you with a smile." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{appearances}} outside Silent Hill 2 {{have received}} mixed critical reaction. Critics {{generally agreed that}} Pyramid Head's appearance in Homecoming struck them as fan service, though Chris Hudak of Game Revolution called it [...] "damned effectively-employed." [...] Film critics commented on {{his role in the}} film adaption, with several finding him disturbing. DVD Reviews praised Campanella's portrayal of Pyramid Head and another monster, writing: [...] "These are without a doubt some of the most striking bogeymen <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> on screen in a long time." [...] His appearance in New International Track & Field received mixed critical reaction. GameDaily disliked it, finding it awkward that a character like Pyramid Head was competing in sporting events with characters like Frogger and Sparkster, while The Escapist called it enjoyable and [...] "hilarious".|$|E
60|$|Then I remembered at once {{where it}} was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him--at the broker's in the city, before we sailed for America.|$|R
60|$|A little surprised, <b>I</b> {{answered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a good deal, but I did not add <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not found}} what I was looking for.|$|R

500|$|As {{a result}} of his {{military}} background and experience, Ismay became [...] "more closely involved in defence matters than is usual for a Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations," [...] and often served as de facto Minister of Defence and serving as temporary Minister of Defence until the permanent appointee, Harold Alexander, was able to take office. Through his close involvement in defence matters, Ismay began to be involved with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In January 1952, he accompanied Churchill to a meeting in Ottawa about the alliance, and in February 1952 he attended the NATO Lisbon Conference as the British Ministry of Defence representative. When leaving the conference, Ismay remarked to Alfred Gruenther, [...] "this is the first <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> of NATO, and thank heaven it's the last." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was shocked}} at by the inhuman {{conditions}} [...] [...] [...] where over 300 prisoners are incarcerated. One would hardly allow an animal to remain in such conditions let alone a human being. The nearest approach to it <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> was the spectacle of hundreds of homeless people living in sewer pipes in the slums of Calcutta." ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, after a miner survived {{traversal}} of {{his skull}} by a gas pipe [...] in diameter (extracted [...] "not without considerable difficulty and force, owing to {{a bend in the}} portion of the rod in his skull") his physician invoked Gage as the [...] "only case comparable with this, in the amount of brain injury, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> reported".|$|E
5000|$|... "Ever since I saw the View of Delft in {{the museum}} in The Hague, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the most {{beautiful}} painting in the world".|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah,--I wish I knew. <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> every {{shilling}} <b>that</b> {{came into}} the house; but I know nothing of this cheque,--whence it came." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} not at all; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> much to admire among the Highlanders; and if he came to that, Mr. Campbell himself was a Highlander.|$|R
2500|$|... "All the Poles <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> assure me {{that the}} so sudden {{surrender}} of the town was entirely owing to appearance of the fleet which cut off all hopes of succours, and therefore they look on you, as the main instrument {{of the loss of}} their liberty, for that is their ordinary term for us who have been employed on this side of Poland." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a survey}} of leading {{football}} writers, historians and academics by Total Sport magazine, Revie's Leeds United were voted {{as one of the}} fifty greatest football teams of all time. In a 1973 episode of the Big Match, Manchester City manager Malcolm Allison rated Leeds as the greatest British club side of all time, stating; [...] "they play the best football I've seen from any English side ever and probably comparable to some of the great teams <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> like Hungary".|$|E
2500|$|The title {{refers to}} Ecclesiastes 6:1, which reads, [...] "There is an evil <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> under the sun, and it lies heavy upon humankind." [...] (New Revised Standard Version of the Bible) Ecclesiastes 6:2 continues, [...] "those to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, {{so that they}} lack nothing of all that they desire, yet God does not enable them to enjoy these things, but a {{stranger}} enjoys them. [...] This is vanity; it is a grievous ill." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{from its}} mirror looked the lean Thing I'd become, each wrinkle and score The image of me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> In jest there fifty years before.|$|R
60|$|The {{view that}} opened before {{me was the}} most {{surprising}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever <b>seen.</b> In the hollow, which must have covered several hundred acres, were numerous fields of growing things, and working all about with crude implements or with no implements at all other than their bare hands were many of the brute-men engaged in the first agriculture <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> within Pellucidar.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> at last [...] That girl my unremembering nights hold fast [...] Or else {{my dreams}} that fly, [...] If I should rub an eye, ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{talk was}} unusual because it {{violated}} unofficial policy {{of not having}} top officials publicly criticize member nations. The interim US ambassador John R. Bolton, appointed by President George W. Bush, {{was reported to have}} told Annan on the phone: [...] "I've known you since 1989 and I'm telling you this is the worst mistake by a senior UN official <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in that entire time." [...] Observers from other nations supported Malloch's view that conservative politicians in the US prevented many citizens from understanding the benefits of US involvement in the UN.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 February 2009, it was {{reported}} that Sutcliffe was [...] "fit to leave Broadmoor". On 23 March 2010, the Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw, was questioned by Julie Kirkbride, Conservative MP for Bromsgrove, in the House of Commons seeking reassurance for a constituent, a victim of Sutcliffe, that he would remain in prison. Straw responded that whilst the matter of Sutcliffe's release was a parole board matter, [...] "that all the evidence <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> on this case, and it's a great deal, suggests to me that there are no circumstances in which this man will be released".|$|E
2500|$|Later Tolkien hesitated {{about the}} true {{identity}} of [...] "Trotter" [...] {{for a long}} time. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be hobbits as originally planned, and that this would mean that Trotter was either a man, or a hobbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was [...] "very well known" [...] (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an early comment of Bingo: [...] "I keep on feeling <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> him somewhere before". Tolkien considered that Trotter might be Bilbo Baggins himself, but soon rejected that idea after Aragorn identified himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it wise?" [...] she murmured. [...] "If my enemies {{knew that}} you were alive, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> you here, what chance should <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> do you think, before the courts?" ...|$|R
60|$|I put {{the seal}} which was {{like no other}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> being {{the work of an}} early and simpler age, round my neck beneath my mail and we went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{meant to}} give you away <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> told Mrs. Fitzgerald at once <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> you take her bracelet, instead of {{following}} you out on to the roof." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Six hundred {{thousand}} {{or whatever they}} guessed at is just, it's not credible," [...] Bush said, and he dismissed the methodology as [...] "pretty well discredited." [...] In December , Bush estimated that 30,000 Iraqis {{had died in the}} war. Asked at the news conference what he thinks the number is now, Bush said: [...] "I stand by the figure a lot of innocent people have lost their life." [...] At a separate Pentagon briefing, Gen. George Casey, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, said that the figure [...] "seems way, way beyond any number <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> I've not seen a number higher than 50,000. And so I don't give it that much credibility at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1906 Iowa {{game was}} {{refereed}} {{by one of}} the top football officials in the country, West Point's Lt. Horatio B. [...] "Stuffy" [...] Hackett, who {{became a member of the}} American Intercollegiate Football Rules Committee in December 1907. Hackett later told a reporter, [...] "It was the most perfect exhibition... of the new rules ... <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> all season and much better than that of Yale and Harvard. [...] St. Louis' style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... The fast throw by St. Louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and it struck me as being all but perfect." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-January, Clinton made a four-country {{trip to the}} Middle East, visiting Yemen, Oman, The United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Speaking at {{a conference}} in Doha, she criticized Arab governments' failure to move more rapidly vis à vis reform in unusually blunt language, saying, [...] "In too many places, in too many ways, the region's {{foundations}} are sinking into the sand. The new and dynamic Middle East <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> needs firmer ground if it is to take root and grow everywhere." [...] Her visit to Yemen, the first such visit by a Secretary of State in 20 years, found her focusing on the dangers of terrorism emanating from that country. An impromptu tour around the walled old city of Sana'a found Clinton being cheered by onlooking schoolchildren. A trip and fall while boarding the departing airplane left Clinton unhurt but news services making predictable witticisms.|$|E
6000|$|Nigel {{scratched}} his head. [...] "Surely, fair sir, I would {{be content to}} say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a number of lions, if indeed I could say aught after so wondrous an adventure." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{made the}} {{customary}} reply, and explained <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{her at the}} opera. [...] "Are you staying in London?" [...] I asked. [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the honor of calling on you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Two weeks {{afterward}} {{the postman}} {{brought me a}} large, fat envelope. I opened it, and took out something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> before, and this typewritten letter from a magazine that encourages society fiction: ...|$|R
