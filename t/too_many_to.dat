Before he could make contact with nearby Guadeloupe, he was discovered by patrolling British warships and a warning sent to Cochrane, who was on his flagship HMS Neptune off Martinique. Within hours Neptune was cruising off the Saintes, joined by the ships of the line HMS Pompee, HMS York, HMS Belleisle, HMS Captain, HMS Polyphemus and a number of smaller warships that could operate closer inshore. Blockading the Saintes was a difficult task: the French had three channels through which they could escape, <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>to</b> be effectively blocked by the forces at Cochrane's disposal. In addition, Troude's force could not be attacked directly, the width of the channels making it impossible for the British ships to attack in full strength.|$|E

25|$|October 2006 saw {{the opening}} of the town's first {{dedicated}} Municipal Art Gallery and visual arts centre, the Highlanes Gallery, housed in the former Franciscan Friary on St. Laurence Street. The Highlanes Gallery houses Drogheda's important municipal art collection, which dates from the 17th century, as well as visiting exhibitions in a venue which meets key international museum and gallery standards. Drogheda's most famous visual artist was the abstract expressionist painter Nano Reid (1900–1981). There are many highly regarded visual artists working in Drogheda at the present time. <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> <b>to</b> list they include; Richard Moore, Kieran McNulty, Raphael Hynes, Mary Mc Donnell, Vivienne Byrne, John Moloney, Maureen Finn, Jackie Hudson Lalor, Patrick Dillon, Nuala Early, Roger Hudson and Ronan Halpin.|$|E
25|$|Pakistanis {{generally}} eat {{three meals}} a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea without sugar, which goes along with baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or prepared at home). During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to sehri and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>to</b> fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is {{spread out on the}} floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their shoes off. Most Pakistanis used to eat on a takht. Pakistanis often eat with their hands, scooping up solid food along with sauce with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{initially}} planned out 50 songs, {{but this}} was far <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>to</b> record and fit into the game within allotted time and budget estimates, so the number was cut down to 24. The number was further cut down toe seven, but Hiroi was brought close to tears by this. Faced with this issue, Tanaka asked how much music the team could manage, {{and was told that}} one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game. The lyrics of all the songs were written by Hiroi, despite his repeated protests about not being a professional lyricist. Due to Hiroi's self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him. As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter Yū Aku, and bought old records of vintage songs. The learning process took between one and two months before Hiroi was competent at writing song lyrics. The songs of Sakura Wars all started with Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music.|$|E

25|$|There was {{tremendous}} agrarian expansion {{during the}} rule of the imperial Chola Dynasty (c.900-1270 AD) all over Tamil Nadu and particularly in the Kaveri Basin. Most of the canals of the Kaveri River belongs to this period e.g., Uyyakondan canal, Rajendran vaykkal, Sembian Mahadegvi vaykkal. There was a well-developed and highly efficient system of water management from the village level upwards. The increase in the royal patronage and also the number of devadana and bramadeya lands which increased the role of the temples and village assemblies in the field. Committees like eri-variyam(tank-committee) and totta-variam(garden committees) were active as also the temples with their vast resources in land, men and money. The water tanks that came up during the Chola period are <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>to</b> be listed here. But a few most outstanding may be briefly mentioned. Rajendra Chola built a huge tank named Solagangam in his capital city Gangaikonda Solapuram and was described as the liquid pillar of victory. About 16 miles long, it was provided with sluices and canals for irrigating the lands in the neighbouring areas. Another very large lake of this period, which even today seems an important source of irrigation was the Viranameri near Kattumannarkoil in South Arcot district founded by Parantaka Chola. Other famous lakes of this period are Madurantakam, Sundra-cholapereri, Kundavai-Pereri (after a Chola queen).|$|E

500|$|The episode {{generally}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a C+, finding that {{it to be}} ambitious but ultimately feeling that it attempted too much at once. VanDerWerff found the episode [...] "entertaining", but added that it [...] "feels like something that’s been rewritten at least one time <b>too</b> <b>many,</b> <b>to</b> incorporate more and more ideas until the center cannot hold". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4 out of 5, praising Williams' guest appearance. Gibron also felt positively about the episode's complexity, feeling that it displayed [...] "a certain intelligence" [...] in assuming such a pace. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Sense and Antisense" [...] two stars out of five, describing it as [...] "too thin and too obvious". Shearman praised Williams' guest appearance, but felt that the episode seemed too close thematically to The X-Files to work well on its own.|$|E

[...] High responds that this is indeed true, that a huge amount are already in Valhalla, but yet this amount will seem to be too few when [...] "the wolf comes." [...] High describes that there are never <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>to</b> feed in Valhalla, for they feast from Sæhrímnir (here described as a boar), and that this beast is cooked every day and is again whole every night. Grímnismál stanza 18 is then recounted. Gangleri asks if Odin himself eats the same food as the Einherjar, and High responds that Odin needs nothing to eat—Odin only consumes wine—and he gives his food to his wolves Geri and Freki. Grímnismál stanza 19 is then recounted. High additionally states that at sunrise, Odin sends his ravens Huginn and Muninn from Valhalla to fly throughout the entire world, and they return in time for the first meal there.|$|E

2500|$|Deterministic {{numerical}} integration algorithms {{work well}} in {{a small number of}} dimensions, but encounter two problems when the functions have many variables. First, the number of function evaluations needed increases rapidly with the number of dimensions. For example, if 10 evaluations provide adequate accuracy in one dimension, then 10100 points are needed for 100 dimensions—far <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>to</b> be computed. This is called the curse of dimensionality. Second, the boundary of a multidimensional region may be very complicated, so it may not be feasible to reduce the problem to an iterated integral. 100 dimensions is by no means unusual, since in many physical problems, a [...] "dimension" [...] is equivalent to a degree of freedom.|$|E
