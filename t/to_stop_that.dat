During his recovery, he was personally encouraged by fellow NHL players Eric Lindros and Pat LaFontaine, who were also dealing with serious concussions.

Leading up to the 1998–99 season, Kariya told reporters he was ready to play a rougher style to protect himself from the opposition, including [...] "getting [...] stick up" [...] against oncoming players.

During his recovery, Kariya was outspoken regarding the culture of the league regarding excessive physicality, as well as the lack of deterrence.

If the league wants <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>that</b> kind of conduct, it will have to punish players ... Ten-game suspensions ... and more, have to be brought back to help wake up players."
