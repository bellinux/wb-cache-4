5|$|This is {{shutting}} the stable door after the horse has well and truly bolted. We argued this train should not replace visual inspections. Inspectors who walk the track are {{the eyes and}} ears of the railway. They don't just check {{the safety of the}} track, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the area surrounding it, check for signs of potential trouble such as gaps in the fence where vandals could get in.|$|E
5|$|At Quantico, someone slips a {{newspaper}} article under Scully's door enabling her to identify the original body as a crew member on a Russian ship. Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that {{this would have been}} an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{visit the}} {{headquarters}} of First Person Shooterss developers in Inland Empire, California, where they meet the Lone Gunmen, who work as consultants for the game. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the body of the}} player, which clearly displays a gunshot wound. Ivan claims there is no way a real gun could have been brought into the highly-secured building. The agents are shown a video from the game, featuring the female character who killed the player. Mulder takes the printout of the character and shows it to a detective, as he believes she is the killer.|$|E

5|$|According to {{government}} regulations concerning seagoing ships, the larger ones can carry several hundred men, {{and the smaller}} ones may {{have more than a}} hundred men on board. One of the most important merchants is chosen to be Leader (Gang Shou), another is Deputy Leader (Fu Gang Shou), and a third is Business Manager (Za Shi). The Superintendent of Merchant Shipping gives them an unofficially sealed red certificate permitting them to use the light bamboo for punishing their company when necessary. Should anyone die at sea, his property becomes forfeit to the government...The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars, and in the day-time by the sun. In dark weather <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the south-pointing needle (i.e. the magnetic compass). They also use a line a hundred feet long with a hook at the end which they let down to take samples of mud from the sea-bottom; by its (appearance and) smell they can determine their whereabouts.|$|E

25|$|Voices {{are heard}} from the outdoor: “Arshin mal alan…”, and arshin malchy appears with commodities. Girls fly to him as birds. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the goods, but Asker looks at them. He shoots a glance at Gulchohra. She is that girl, of whom he dreamed. Gulchohra has also charmed by arshin malchy. Young men make a {{declaration}} of love when girls go away.|$|E
25|$|According to the movement's leaders, {{peoples who}} have renounced their own gods have no future, because their spiritual {{betrayal}} {{has led to}} deep injury of the people's soul. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Japanese people, who have preserved their popular faith, {{as a model of}} better prospects. Only peoples who find in themselves the strength to take the step of returning to their roots have any prospect for the future.|$|E
25|$|One {{challenge}} studying sleep {{evolution is}} that adequate sleep information is known only for two phyla of animals- chordata and arthropoda. With the available data, comparative {{studies have been}} used to determine how sleep might have evolved. One question that scientists try to answer through these studies is whether sleep evolved only once or multiple times. To understand this, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> sleep patterns in different classes of animals whose evolutionary histories are fairly well-known and study their similarities and differences.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Flintwinch dreamed, that, for {{the space}} of a minute or two, <b>they</b> {{remained}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> each other with the candle between them, and that she somehow derived an impression that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other fixedly.|$|R

25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{who study the}} historical Jesus and early Christianity believe that the canonical gospels and life of Jesus must be viewed within his historical and cultural context, rather than purely in terms of Christian orthodoxy. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Second Temple Judaism, the tensions, trends, {{and changes in the}} region under the influence of Hellenism and the Roman occupation, and the Jewish factions of the time, seeing Jesus as a Jew in this environment; and the written New Testament as arising from a period of oral gospel traditions after his death.|$|E
25|$|Card and Krueger {{expanded}} on {{this initial}} article in their 1995 book Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage. They {{argued that the}} negative employment effects of minimum wage laws are minimal if not non-existent. For example, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the 1992 increase in New Jersey's minimum wage, the 1988 rise in California's minimum wage, and the 1990–91 increases in the federal minimum wage. In addition to their own findings, they reanalyzed earlier studies with updated data, generally finding that the older results of a negative employment effect did not hold up in the larger datasets.|$|E
25|$|In the Torah the Israelites are {{commanded}} to dye one of {{the threads}} of their tallit (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; when <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds {{to the color of}} the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) Blue in Judaism has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.|$|E

25|$|RoboMary {{can examine}} the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots when <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a red tomato, and see exactly how they react {{and what kinds}} of impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know exactly {{what it is like to}} see a red tomato.|$|E
25|$|Dreams do {{not involve}} {{actually}} sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake. Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water. When they look away from that stimulus, the next thing <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> appears to be moving in a wave like motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus {{is no longer the}} focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant. However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.|$|E
25|$|As <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the burning}} night sky over the Underworld Storybrooke, Hades and Zelena {{are on a}} date, as he {{explained}} why he created the world for her, then tells Zelena {{that he wants to}} follow her back to the real Storybrooke, if he is able to restore his heart and become human again. However, he also tells Zelena that {{in order to do that}} he wants to leave the outsiders in the Underworld forever, then he asks her to be his partner in chaos (a modified version of a wedding proposal), leaving Zelena feeling awkward. Hades also tells her that he took the precaution of adding the remaining outsiders' names to more tombstones, after Mary Margaret had her name replaced by David's. Unfortunately for Zelena, Regina saw this through a magic mirror, and then confronts Zelena afterwards, as the latter thinks that Hades, like Robin Hood (or Regina), might not be a villain forever. Regina explain this to the rest of the outsiders, saying that Zelena was thinking irrationally and in danger, and telling them that the only way to solve this problem was to go to Cora, to break them up. Cora is working in the Underworld Mill, situated above the Lethe, the yellow-colored River of Forgetfulness, and supervised by two guards. She finds a hook hidden under the stalks on grain, cuts off the black anti-magic handcuff, and uses her magic to knock out the guards. Escaping, she bumps into Hook who retrieves his hook and brings her to Regina.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Kip Thorne {{approached}} Bethe and Brown about LIGO, the [...] Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, {{designed to}} detect the gravitational waves from merging neutron stars and black holes. Since Bethe and Brown were good at calculating things {{that could not be}} seen, could <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the mergers? The 90-year-old Bethe quickly became enthused, and soon began the required calculations. The result was a 1998 paper on the [...] "Evolution of Binary Compact Objects Which Merge", which Brown regarded as the best that the two produced together.|$|E
500|$|Examples of Smith's {{penchant for}} zany wordplay include the lines [...] "Never over-sits he under-stands" [...] and [...] "Get lined up come Sikh come Czar" [...] – {{the latter being}} partly a {{misappropriation}} of the French phrase [...] "comme ci comme ça". In the second verse, the line [...] "People think he's loopy loo when <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his shoes" [...] refers to the comedian's unusual dress sense, which included [...] "toy cows grazing on his shoes", according to Harrison biographer Alan Clayson, while [...] "rocking sausage roll" [...] was Smith's phrase for rock 'n' roll.|$|E
500|$|Rodman {{admitted}} {{his frequent}} transgressions, but asserted {{that he lived}} his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people: [...] "I just took {{the chance to be}} my own man... I just said: 'If you don't like it, kiss my ass.' ...Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me and see someone trying to do that... I'm the guy who's showing people, hey, it's all right to be different. And I think they feel: 'Let's go and see this guy entertain us.'" ...|$|E
