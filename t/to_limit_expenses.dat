It focuses on the problem from the perspective of pathogenetic mechanisms, highlights opportunities for further research, raises questions about accepted views, and suggests that recently developed techniques may prove useful in gaining new insights about this particular infectious process;The second manuscript is titled 2 ̆ 2 Comparative usefulness of tissue fixatives for in situ viral nucleic acid hybridization. 2 ̆ 2 It deals with the student 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to adapt one of the newer research techniques for its use in pseudorabies-infected cattle tissues. The work was actually carried out with mice in order <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>expenses</b> and conserve resources. It established that the available hybridization probes could detect the nucleic acids of pseudorabies virus effectively and specifically. In addition, the paper offers a detailed account of the various fixatives tested for degree of usefulness and compatibility with in situ hybridization. A modification of Carnoy 2 ̆ 7 s fluid (MOCA) was devised and found to be well-suited for fixation of bulky cattle tissues;The third manuscript is titled 2 ̆ 2 Reproducibility of in situ hybridization when applied to MOCA and formalin-fixed pseudorabies-infected cattle tissues. 2 ̆ 2 It documents the reproducibility of in situ hybridization as well as its degree of correspondence to quantitative virus isolation when it was applied {{to a wide range of}} MOCA-fixed, pseudorabies-infected bovine tissues. In addition, the paper offers the results of a limited retroactive study carried out with 7 year old formalin-fixed infected neural bovine tissues. Reliable specific in situ hybridization occurred in MOCA-fixed neural tissues, but suspicious, seemingly false positive reactions were not uncommon in other tissues, particularly those rich in lymphocytes and macrophages. A strong hybridization signal was present in the formalin-fixed material despite its age, so that type of material is suitable for retrospective studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSteel alloys are the {{material}} that is most used in protective constructions today. The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>expenses</b> from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. Case hardening is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile core. Case hardened products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable cores. Case hardening is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by case hardening. Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by case hardening did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the case hardened steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the case hardening process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum case hardening process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce case hardened steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of core hardness was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range of case hardening courses. A total of 11 case hardening courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including direct hardening, a modified single hardening process and traditional and modified versions of double and triple hardening. Before the case hardening the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity of the case hardened and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities of the case hardened samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable surface decarburization of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the case hardening did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The core hardness proved difficult to retain, the highest core hardness value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with core hardness of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side of the case hardened target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|E

The purpose of this Nursing That Works article is to describe the history of pay for performance practices and discuss the implications for the nursing profession as a participant in this emerging movement. The History of Payment Systems Prior to the 1980 ’s, hospitals were paid in a fee-for-service arrangement. Basically, for each patient treatment or admission, healthcare providers were reimbursed in full for every case. With rising healthcare costs and a poor economy during the 1970 ’s, the primary form of insurance for the aging population, Medicare, sought methods to classify types of patients in an effort <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> the <b>expenses.</b> Under a request from Congress in 1983, a Yale University group worked with the former Health Care Financing Administration, {{now known as the}} Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to develop a method for monitoring the quality of care {{and the extent to which}} services were used. In 1983, a patient classification system, entitled diagnostic related groups (DRGs), was implemented. This system, although refined and frequently updated, is the method by which many hospitals are still reimbursed today. Most hospitals are now paid a fixed amount, determined in advance for the operation cost of the DRG. Each DRG is weighted according to historical and current Medicare cost data. (Beaty, 2005) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{constant}} need {{to improve}} helicopter performance requires the optimization of existing and future rotor designs. A crucial indicator of rotor capability is hover performance, which depends on the near-body flow {{as well as the}} structure and strength of the tip vortices formed at the trailing edge of the blades. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers must balance computational expenses with preservation of the flow, and <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> computational <b>expenses</b> the mesh is often coarsened in the outer regions of the computational domain. This can lead to degradation of the vortex structures which compose the rotor wake. The current work conducts three-dimensional simulations using OVERTURNS, a three-dimensional structured grid solver that models the flow field using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The S- 76 rotor in hover was chosen as the test case for evaluating the OVERTURNS solver, focusing on methods to better preserve the rotor wake. Using the hover condition, various computational domains, spatial schemes, and boundary conditions were tested. Furthermore, a mesh adaption routine was implemented, allowing for the increased refinement of the mesh in areas of turbulent flow without the need to add points to the mesh. The adapted mesh was employed to conduct a sweep of collective pitch angles, comparing the resolved wake and integrated forces to existing computational and experimental results. The integrated thrust values saw very close agreement across all tested pitch angles, while the power was slightly over predicted, resulting in under prediction of the Figure of Merit. Meanwhile, the tip vortices have been preserved for multiple blade passages, indicating an improvement in vortex preservation when compared with previous work. Finally, further results from a single collective pitch case were presented to provide a more complete picture of the solver results...|$|R
