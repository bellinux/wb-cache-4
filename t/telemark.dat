5|$|An inter-municipal railway {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1941. Led by Sigval Bergesen, it considered the possibility of extending the Ålgård Line towards Hunnedalen via Setesdalsheiene to Lunde in <b>Telemark.</b> The line would be built with a higher standard than the Sørlandet Line and have a shorter route, allowing travel time from Stavanger to Oslo to be reduced to four to five hours. A detailed plan was made for the extension from Ålgård to the county border with <b>Telemark.</b> To consider the proposal, parliament established a committee in 1949 {{to look at the}} various proposals. After considering the impact and value of the various railways that had been proposed in the 1940s, it recommended not building the Inner Trunk Line, as the expansion had been christened.|$|E
5|$|Hol {{stood for}} {{election}} {{again in the}} 1924 parliamentary election, when the voting system had changed completely. The constituency was now Market towns of <b>Telemark</b> and Aust-Agder counties, {{and it was a}} plural-member constituency where representatives were selected from the party lists with the most votes. Hol was fielded as the second candidate on the ballot of the Radical People's Party (Labour Democrats), the new name of the Labour Democrats. The first candidate was A. Jørgensen, police chief of Kragerø. The Radical People's Party fared well in Skien and Kragerø. With 1,050 votes in Kragerø the party prevailed over the Social Democrats and Communists. With 2,075 votes in Skien the party prevailed over Labour. However, it fared much worse in the other six cities, carried 4,571 votes in total and lost the election in the Market towns of <b>Telemark</b> and Aust-Agder counties.|$|E

5|$|In 1828, Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on Løvøya island, <b>Telemark</b> county, Norway. He was a Norwegian {{priest and}} amateur {{mineralogist}} {{who studied the}} minerals in <b>Telemark,</b> where he served as vicar. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as this one, to his father, Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Oslo. The elder Esmark determined {{that it was not}} a known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample by reducing KThF5 with potassium metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source mineral thorite.|$|E

Hagen belonged to the Oslo chapter, but {{the leader of the}} chapter, Peter N. Myhre, stated beforehand that Hagen's proposal would probably be rejected. It was speculated that rejections could come from the Buskerud and Finnmark's conventions as well. On 7 February, Hagen confirmed his leadership candidacy for the electoral committee.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{cross-country}} skiing {{is similar to}} the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and <b>Telemark</b> skiing. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Northern Europe, Canada, Russia and regions in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans to}} build a railway line along the route of the Ålgård Line was as part of the main route between Stavanger and Oslo. In 1873, County Engineer Th. Sejersted {{proposed}} a line running through Høgsfjord, Dirdal, Hunnedalen, Sirdal and Hylestad and onwards through <b>Telemark</b> to Kongsberg. Through Rogaland, it would run further east than the Jæren Line, which was under construction from Stavanger to Egersund. When the plans for a Sørlandet Line—which would connect Stavanger to Oslo via Kristiansand—started to be developed in 1892, some of Sjersted's plans were reconsidered.|$|E

5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim is to}} land on, or ideally surpass, a line marked {{across the}} hill called the 'K-point', 'critical point', or 'calculation line'. In order to attain the most points from the style judges, athletes strive for a 'Telemark' landing: instead of landing with simply both feet together (a 'two-footed' landing), one foot is planted clearly {{in front of the}} other (without sliding the skis), both feet held no more than four ski widths' apart, and the body held stable with a straight back and arms outstretched. This pose must be maintained until the 'outrun' – a line at the very end of the hill, where the slope has fully flattened out – is reached. The exact placement of landing is measured between the athlete's front and back feet. Failing to make a <b>Telemark</b> landing results in a loss of style points. Considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before the outrun line, such as falling over or touching the ground with any part of the body except the feet. However, when the hill begins to flatten out, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a <b>Telemark</b> landing.|$|E

Following the announcement, Wam stated that NSB would continue to operate the service, and use the Timetoget concept. An internal document the newspaper Varden received access to showed that NSB needed to calm down the heated discussions with the labor unions, and that their negativity to Timetoget was a tactical move to satisfy the labor unions. Minister of Transport, Terje Moe Gustavsen from the Labour Party, stated in a meeting with two parliamentarians from <b>Telemark,</b> that he would allow a new private company, without NSB ownership, to operate the line.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 {{national}} {{convention of the}} Progress Party of Norway was held from 15 April to 17 April at the hotel Bolkesjø Turisthotell in Bolkesjø, <b>Telemark.</b> It was originally set {{up to be a}} normal convention with 157 delegates in a non-election year, but because of mounting antagonism between a traditionalist and a libertarian faction, it became clear some months before the conventions that personal positions could be at stake. The party leader seat, held by Carl I. Hagen since 1978, was up for re-election. The deputy leaders Ellen Wibe and Hans J. Røsjorde was not up for election until 1995, but there were talks about forming a motion of no confidence against Wibe. The political disagreements roughly corresponded to a cleavage between two factions.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent times}} is the {{northern}} part of Falkum known for being a dense and diverse residential neighborhood of Skien. Suburban development began in the late 1950s, and today the area is characterized by a mix of Low-rises and high-rise apartment buildings. The residential section of Falkum was originally designed as a planned community for 5,000 residents, but now houses 10,000. It consists of 3 high-rise buildings. These massive residential towers were built in the 1970s.

Cross country skiing has become increasingly popular with over 50 km of tracks that criss-cross Villars and its neighbouring town of Gryon through undisturbed natural beauty. There are snow shoeing trips organized by the Tourist Office and <b>telemarking</b> is also seeing a comeback on the pistes. There is a large indoor ice-skating rink {{as well as a}} smaller outdoor one in Gryon during the winter season. For the more adventurous there is ski touring and paragliding.|$|R
40|$|A new {{interest}} in the existence and operation of the many small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) as active partners for the newborn regional universities in Norway has recently been registered. This interest has been expressed by the political parties, the employees and employers’ organisations, and from the universities and colleges themselves. This paper will point out and discuss some of the SME’s expectations and relate these to {{the powers of the}} newborn Högskolen i <b>Telemark’s</b> College of Engineering (HiT-TF). The SME’s expectations are, in short, that graduating engineers have a practical and broadbased background and, in addition, that these engineers should recognise the need for human and organisational matters as equally important as technical literacy. Finally, the SMEs expect the Engineering College to reflect their real-life operating problems when choosing their curricula, working methods, and forms for contact/co-operation with local enterprises. Provided that the definition of academic excellence is expanded to cover co-operation along three axes, the auspices for a future close co-operation between HiT-TF and local industry, including the SMEs, look promising...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Telemark</b> power-based {{industry}} {{started in}} 1902 when Sam Eyde, along with Norwegian and Swedish investors, bought Rjukan Falls—establishing A/S Rjukanfos on 30 April 1903. The same year, on 13 February, Eyde and Kristian Birkeland had met and {{started working on}} refining the electric arc to produce an electric flame; allowing Eyde to complete his process of converting air and electricity into fertilizer. On 19 December 1903 Det Norske Kvælstofkompagni was founded, followed by Det Norske Aktieselskap for Eletrokemisk Industri (today Elkem) in 1904; both were in part owned by the Wallenberg family, Stockholms Enskilda Bank and Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} owned by NSB (34%), two {{individuals}} from Notodden, Gjermund Jamtveit and Halvor Grene (51%), <b>Telemark</b> County Municipality and some municipalities (15%). The trains would operate with a one-hour headway, twenty-four hours a day. It was the first private company allowed to operate passenger trains since the amalgamation of operations into the Norwegian State Railways. The concept was based on TIMEkspressen, an hourly coach service between Notodden and Oslo, that was operated by the Jamtveit and Grene-owned Øst-Telemark Automobilselskap. The company bought three used Y1 diesel railcars from SJ of Sweden, despite that the Bratsberg Line is electrified. The trains cost NOK6 million each, and have a capacity of 70 passengers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans for}} an airport serving Notodden were {{launched}} in 1954 by Reidar Hedwig-Dahl, director of the tourist office. In late 1954 or early 1955, he held a meeting with Ludvig G. Braathen, owner of Braathens SAFE, and representatives for his airline. They saw Notodden as a possible gateway to <b>Telemark</b> and Braathen promised to start flying to an airport serving Notodden, should one be built. At the time, Braathen had started flying to several smaller airports in Norway using a fleet of de Havilland Heron aircraft. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted more but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Røros.|$|E

40|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of skiing which all produce somewhat different strains and possibilities for injury, and snowboarding presents still different strains on the body. By far, the most prevalent recreational type of skiing is still Alpine or downhill skiing. Cross-country skiing has gained a lot in popularity, too, and provides {{the opportunity for a}} superb aerobic workout outside the usual ski resorts. <b>Telemarking</b> and ski mountaineering are fairly uncommon forms of skiing and since little data exists for these types of skiing injuries, we will not cover them in this article. Snowboarders, though they are on the slopes with the downhill skiers, do not share the same type of techniques nor injuries as skiers. In contrast to most other sports, skiers and snowboarders appear to suffer many more trauma injuries than overuse injuries. Data may be misleading, however, since most studies include data from medical facilities at ski resorts that treat primarily traumatic injuries. In fact, one paper discarded data from any reported injuries that were not traumatic. 1 Overuse injuries are likely treated by a medical practitioner at some later time, even months or years after suffering mild discomforts of overuse. Proper conditioning prior to the snow season is important for all of these sports. It will increase your endurance and control, and it will decrease your chances for injury. If you plan to head to the snow this winter, plan on tuning up your body ahead of time and be ready to enjoy yourself injury-free this winter...|$|R

5|$|After {{finishing}} their active careers, some of Ull's members {{entered the}} ranks of sports officials and administrators. Most notable was Karl Roll, who became the first chairman of the Norwegian Ski Federation in 1908. Several members had already held positions in the older organization Association for the Promotion of Skiing, founded three weeks before Ull, in 1883. Johan Bechholm was its first secretary, from 1883 to 1886, and many others followed. Johan Sverre (member since 1896) was a notable Olympic administrator after the Norwegian independence in 1905, and Hjalmar Krag (member since 1887) became chairman in the Confederation of Sports. Fritz R. Huitfeldt also became a known figure in his field; for his ski bindings, and for pioneering <b>Telemark</b> skiing. Huitfeldt's ski factory, which he started together with Richard Blichfeldt, was named Ull.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion {{as to what to}} do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and <b>Telemark.</b> In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E
50|$|The ski {{season in}} Geilo is from late October until late April. Geilo has {{numerous}} small ski centres {{that make up}} one resort, which {{goes by the name}} Geilo Skiheiser. This includes slopes on the town side of the valley, Havsdalen over {{the back side of the}} mountain, and across the valley at Geilolia (formerly Vestlia) which also connects to the Kikut area. All the ski hires offer free helmet rental for children, which is an excellent safety measure for worried parents. Geilo Skiheiser has 39 slopes covering 33 km accessed by 20 lifts (14 plate, 6 chair). Geilolia skisenter (formerly Vestlia skisenter) tends to have the easier green and blue runs and is where the major ski school that operates in Geilo takes place, whereas Slaatta skisenter has the blue and red runs. There is also an extensive cross country system in Geilo, offering 220 km of tracks, including 5 km under floodlight. There are free pamphlets available showing the cross country trails and lengths. Skiing options include alpine skiing, cross country (XC) skiing, <b>telemarking,</b> snowboarding, dog sledging, toboggan, ski orienteering, and evening skiing most evenings. Another activity that has become very popular of late is 'kiting' (skiing or snowboarding whilst attached to a 'kite' or parasail) with the area around Geilo being rated among the best in the world. You will also see paragliders floating down from the top of the slopes with courses run in the area occasionally, although mostly in the summer months.Both sides offer a 'big air bag' where all with twin-tip skis or snowboards can jump onto an enormous air bag. This is a hit with people of all ages, with children as young as 4 having a go.Getting to Geilo is easy as the main rail line between Oslo and Bergen runs right through the centre of town. There are also bus routes from Oslo and Bergen as an alternative and the RV7 highway also runs through the town if you are coming by car. Accommodation is not overly expensive with most hotels and cabins being listed on the internet and offering special prices out of the high season times. If travelling with friends, consider renting a cabin which can sleep up to 18 people and can make for very good value when the costs are divided up. With 4 supermarkets in Geilo, and food prices not too far removed from other European countries, it can be a surprisingly affordable and refreshing change to the standard Hotel experience.|$|R
5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where compacted snow may prevail. Sidecut on <b>Telemark</b> skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E
5|$|Operation Freshman was the codename {{given to}} a British {{airborne}} operation conducted in November 1942 during World War II. It was the first British airborne operation conducted using gliders, and its target was the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant in <b>Telemark,</b> Norway which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany. By 1942, the German nuclear weapons programme had come close {{to being able to}} develop a nuclear reactor, but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water. The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied in 1940; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon. Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical, and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant, demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden.|$|E
