5|$|The role of <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> <b>is</b> {{administrative}} and political. On the administrative side it {{is responsible for}} procedures and organising {{the work of the}} Council during its term. This includes summoning the Council for meetings along with directing the work of COREPER and other committees and working groups. The political element is the role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council. In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence {{in the work of the}} Council during its term. The Presidency also plays a major role in representing the Council within the EU and representing the EU internationally, for example at the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|The Presidency of the Council of the European Union is {{responsible}} for the functioning of the Council of the European Union, the upper house of the EU legislature. It rotates among the member states of the EU every six months. <b>The</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> not an individual, but rather the position is held by a national government. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the President of the European Union. The presidency's function is to chair meetings of the Council, determine its agendas, set a work programme and facilitate dialogue both at Council meetings and with other EU institutions. <b>The</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> currently (as of July 2017) held by Estonia.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{responsibility}} of <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> <b>is</b> to organise and chair all {{meetings of the}} Council, apart from the Foreign Affairs Council which is chaired by the High Representative. So, for instance, the Minister of Agriculture for the state holding the presidency chairs the Agriculture council. This role includes working out compromises capable of resolving difficulties.|$|E

President Aquino strongly declined the requests for her to seek reelection and wanted to set an example to both citizens and politicians that <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> not a lifetime position.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> {{a nonpartisan}} office as {{guarantor}} of Italy's Constitution, Napolitano was a longtime {{member of the}} Italian Communist Party (and of its post-Communist social democratic successors, from the Democratic Party of the Left onwards). He was a leading member of a modernizing faction {{on the right of}} the party. First elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1953, he took an assiduous interest in parliamentary life and was President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1992 to 1994. He was Minister of the Interior from 1996 to 1998 under Romano Prodi.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution, the President Elect {{must take}} the Oath of Office on December 1, before {{a joint session of}} Congress; the Constitution also states that the presidential term begins on December 1. Members of Congress {{belonging}} to the parties in the Coalition had threatened to disrupt the ceremony, with actions similar to those that prevented Vicente Fox from delivering his State of the Union address on September 1. According to the Constitution, if the elected president does not take the Oath of Office on 1 December before a joint session, <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> declared vacant and an interim president must be named and new elections called.|$|E
50|$|Between 1847 and 1980, <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> {{exclusively}} held by Americo-Liberians, {{the original}} American settlers of Liberia and their descendants. The original two-party system, with the Republican Party and the True Whig Party, ended in 1878, when {{the election of}} Anthony W. Gardiner {{marked the beginning of}} 102 years of single-party rule by the True Whigs. Following a coup d'état by disgruntled army officers led by Samuel Doe in 1980, <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> vacated until <b>the</b> election of Doe in the 1985 general election. After the overthrow and murder of Doe in 1990, <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>was</b> again vacated for seven years during the First Liberian Civil War and again for two years following the conclusion of the Second Liberian Civil War in 2003.|$|R

500|$|After again {{considering}} a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with {{remaining in the}} Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he might run. [...] He added: [...] "I know this decision means I may never be president. But the pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> not my life. Public service is." [...] Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. [...] By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed [...] "the best strategist in the Senate," [...] who always knew when best to move legislation. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.|$|E
500|$|During his campaign, Biden {{focused on}} the war in Iraq and his support for the {{implementation}} of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy. Despite speculation to the contrary, Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, [...] "I know a lot of my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" [...] Other candidates' comments that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's, saying of the latter, [...] "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. <b>The</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>is</b> not something that lends itself to on-the-job training." [...] Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas. Biden was noted for his one-liners on the campaign trail, saying of Republican then-frontrunner Rudy Giuliani at the debate on October 30, 2007, in Philadelphia, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] Overall, Biden's debate performances were an effective mixture of humor, and sharp and surprisingly disciplined comments.|$|E

2500|$|Hamilton anticipates and refutes the {{argument}} that a unitary executive is too similar to the British monarchy. [...] Some academics have noted that Hamilton viewed the British monarchy as a superior system of government and potential model for the United States. In fact, scholar Edward S. Corwin asserts that [...] "the Presidency was designed in great measure to reproduce the monarchy of George III with the corruption left out, and also of course the hereditary feature."

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1990 and the President would, {{according to the}} altered constitution, be elected by the Soviet people by direct and secret ballot. However, {{the first and only}} Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev, was elected by the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies. In connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union national elections for the office of President never took place. To be elected to the office a person must have been a Soviet citizen and older than thirty-five but younger than sixty-five years. The same person could not be elected president for more than two terms. <b>The</b> <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> highest state office, and was the most important office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition, eclipsing that of Premier and General Secretary. With the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> executive power <b>was</b> shared between the President and the Prime Minister. <b>The</b> <b>Presidency</b> <b>was</b> given broad powers, such as being responsible for negotiating the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers with the Supreme Soviet; the Prime Minister, however, was responsible for managing the nomenklatura and economic matters.|$|R

[...] The film was watched by 56 million {{television viewers}} in the United States, and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Trustees Award for it at the Emmy Awards in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by Lady Bird Johnson.

2500|$|To prevent {{deadlocks}} from {{keeping the}} nation leaderless, the Twelfth Amendment provided {{that if the}} House did not choose a President before March 4 (then {{the first day of}} a Presidential term), the individual elected Vice President would [...] "act as President, {{as in the case of}} the death or other constitutional disability of the President." [...] The Twelfth Amendment did not state for how long the Vice President would act as President or if the House could still choose a President after March 4. Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment, adopted in 1933, supersedes that provision of the Twelfth Amendment by changing the date upon which a new presidential term commences to January 20, clarifying that the Vice President-elect would only [...] "act as President" [...] if the House has not chosen a President by January 20, and permitting Congress to statutorily provide [...] "who shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected" [...] if there is no President-elect or Vice President-elect by January 20. It also clarifies that if there is no President-elect on January 20, whoever acts as President does so until a person [...] "qualified" [...] to occupy <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> <b>is</b> elected to be President.|$|E
