40|$|Although {{there are}} few {{published}} studies of residential exposures to environmental contaminants in Nepal, there may be substantial exposures to multiple contaminants in Nepali households. Pesticides, which can be harmful to human health, are often used by Nepali farmers, and many farmers lack {{an understanding of the}} appropriate procedures for the safe use, handling and storage of pesticides. In addition, many Nepali families use wood burning stoves, leading to the potential for exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from wood smoke. This study measured the levels of four organophosphate <b>pesticides,</b> 22 <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides,</b> and over thirty polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in house dust from two rural Nepali villages. Floor dust samples were collected in early summer from a total of 18 households, including nine households in the village of Keraghari, in Kavrepalanchok District, and nine homes in the village of Kafaldanda, in Lalitpur District. These villages have similar environmental features and are located at an altitude of approximately 2, 000 meters. In these two villages, many of the homes have improved cookstoves to reduce smoke levels in the homes. The dust samples were collected using pre-ashed glass fiber filter cloths saturated with isopropyl alcohol. In both villages, the <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> that was present in the highest concentrations was the DDT metabolite p,p?-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (4, 4 ?-DDE). Among the organophosphates, methyl parathion accounted for much of the organophosphate mass detected.

40|$|Despite their incontestable {{services}} in agriculture, {{the use of}} pesticides is not without consequences on the environment. So, {{in an attempt to}} access the impacts of pesticides usage in agriculture in Benin, research of some residual organochloride pesticides have been conducted both in rainy and dry seasons in two cotton growing areas: the northern and central part of Benin. The analytical technique used is GC-ECD. During the dry season we notice that the DDT and its metabolites (DDE and DDD) represent 36 % of all <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> (POCs) against 64 % of cyclodiens. Endosulfan comes first representing 57 % of all <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> (POCs), then follows DDT with 17 %. During the rainy season these two types of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> (POCs) represent 73 % for cyclodiens and 23 % for DDT and its by-products. Endosulfan comes first by representing 47 % of all <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> (POCs) followed by DDT representing 12 %. In the sediments and regardless of the season, the cyclodiens come first by representing 70 % of all <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> (POCs) and then follows the DDT and its by-products which represent 30 %. Since in the water column, the sediments are more contaminated in rainy season than in dry season (25273 ppb of all <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> (POCs) in rainy season against 2. 256 ppb in dry season), it is derived from this study that northern areas are more contaminated than the central areas. Also a strong correlation has been established between the content of different moleculars of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> (POCs). This means that the famers still use prohibited pesticides in the two areas despite existing laws like “Stockholm convention” which strictly ban the usage of those moleculars...|$|R

40|$|<b>Organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> {{contaminants}} detrimentally affect {{wildlife in}} many ways, including lowered reproductive success, endocrine disruption, and embryonic defects. Most <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{have been banned}} in the United States after the recognition of these effects. However, these pesticides are still used in Central and South America, and little information is available concerning the levels of pesticide contamination in wildlife from these areas. Furthermore, little data exist regarding <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> contamination in passerines (songbirds). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the presence in passerines of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> that are of concern to the Environmental Protection Agency. Neotropical resident species (i. e. those living year-round Central and South America) were collected from Argentina and Peru in 1996, Neotropical migrant species (i. e. those that winter in Central and South America and breed in North America) were collected in central and western Illinois from 1991 - 1996, and Nearctic resident species (i. e. those living year-round in North America) were collected in central Illinois in 1995 and 1996. Contamination levels were compared between each of the above geographic locations. Predominate pesticides found in Nearctic resident and Neotropical migrant species included DDE, dieldrin and heptachlor epoxide. No significant levels of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> were found in the Neotropical resident birds. Significantly higher pesticide levels were found in Neotropical migrants than in Neotropical residents. No difference was found in pesticide levels among the Neotropical migrants in relation to age class.

40|$|Study on the {{distribution}} and sources of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticide</b> concentrations in water samples and sediments from the Jakarta Bay was conducted in April 2011 (transition season I) and June 2011 (dry season). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine {{the distribution}} of pesticide concentrations in water and sediments and to identify possible sources of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides.</b> The concentrations of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> was measured by the GC/ECD (electron capture detection) HP 5890 series II. Concentrations found in the water column during transition I season ranged from 11. 596 to 74. 338 ng/l (average= 41. 998 ng/l) and in dry season varied from 4. 554 to 19. 119 ng/l (average= 7. 741 ng/l). In sediment samples, concentrations found in transition I season varied from 0. 936 to 2. 816 ng/g (average= 1. 782 ug/g), and in dry season about 0. 7691 to 7. 138 ug/g, (average= 2. 722 ug/g). In the water column, the average concentration in transition I was higher than that found in dry season, whereas levels in sediment during transition season I was lower. The average levels of pesticides in the water column was higher than those found in sediments. These results suggested that the seasons played a role in the distribution of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>pesticides</b> in the water column and sediments.
