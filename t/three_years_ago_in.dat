5|$|Radical Dreamers {{features}} three protagonists—Serge, Kid, and Magil—who {{seek out}} treasure as venturesome, reputable thieves. The young adult narrator, Serge, is a drifting musician who met Kid by chance <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> a remote town. Serge enjoys adventure with a carefree attitude. Kid, only sixteen years old, is a renowned professional thief {{with a reputation}} for boisterous behavior. Possessing a turbulent history, Kid dubiously fancies herself as a kind of Robin Hood. Magil is an enigmatic, handsome masked man skilled in magic who rarely speaks and can fade into shadow at will. Crowned by flowing, blue hair, Magil accompanied Kid well before Serge joined the group. They seek the Frozen Flame, a mythic artifact capable of granting any wish. It is hidden in Viper Manor—the home of a terrible and powerful aristocrat named Lynx, who gained control of the estate after usurping power from and killing the Acacia Dragoons, a familial unit of warriors.|$|E
