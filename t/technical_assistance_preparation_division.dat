40|$|Intensified {{international}} {{support of the}} anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa has permeated the investment community in recent years, {{as evidenced by the}} substantial fiduciary disinvestment of firms with South African business interests. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the shareholder wealth effects of U. S. corporate divestments in South Africa. Three hypotheses of shareholder wealth effects are developed and tested. The evidence indicates that shareholders of firms that divest South Africa assets experience negative abnormal stock returns. This evidence is more pronounced for firms that divested after 1985 when social and political pressures to divest were at their peak. Although the time period of this analysis coincides with the emergence of majority rule in South Africa, and thus of a potential declining value of divestiture in the future, our analysis points to a way of evaluating the social costs and benefits of stock divestiture as a tool of corporate social responsibility. <b>Technical</b> <b>assistance</b> in the <b>preparation</b> of the current version of this document has been provided by Monica Mocanasu, graduate assistant i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{provided}} {{an assessment of}} social skills and depression in adolescent substance abusers hospitalized in an inpatient psychiatric setting. Level of social skill was evaluated using the Adolescent Assertion Expression Scale and the Loneliness Scale. Depression and related problems were examined through administration of the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelesness Scale, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Comparisons with normative values and clinical cut-offs (by gender) indicated that female adolescent substance abusers were less submissive and more aggressive than normative counterparts; male substance abusers exhibited less assertiveness. In addition, mild to moderate levels of depression were evident in both female and male substance abusers. Further, results of correlational analyses revealed several significant relationships between measures of social skills and depression. Results are discussed in terms of: (a) the need for finer grained analyses of social functioning in adolescent substance abusers, (b) the potential value of skills intervention for a subgroup of these individuals, and (c) the need for longitudinal data to more clearly explicate patterns and sequencing of social (mal) adjustment, affective disorder, and onset of substance abuse in this population. ☆ This study {{was supported in part}} by the Center for Education and Drug Abuse Research (CEDAR) and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (No. DA 05605).

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN 2) are associated with polymorphisms or mutations in the FH gene (Cfh), suggesting the existence of a genotype–phenotype relationship. Although AMD and MPGN 2 share pathological similarities with the accumulation of complement-containing debris within the eye and kidney, respectively, aHUS is characterized by renal endothelial injury. This pathological distinction was reflected in our Cfh association analysis, which demonstrated that although AMD and MPGN 2 share a Cfh at-risk haplotype, the haplotype for aHUS was unique. FH-deficient mice have uncontrolled plasma C 3 activation and spontaneously develop MPGN 2 but not aHUS. We show that these mice, transgenically expressing a mouse FH protein functionally equivalent to aHUS-associated human FH mutants, regulate C 3 activation in plasma and spontaneously develop aHUS but not MPGN 2. These animals represent the first model of aHUS and provide in vivo evidence that effective plasma C 3 regulation and the defective control of complement activation on renal endothelium are the critical events in the molecular pathogenesis of FH-associated aHUS.

Magnetization curves for all the samples show hysteresis loops, evidencing a ferromagnetic or a permanent magnetism in the nanoparticles. The microstructure of the nanoparticles has been analyzed by x-ray absorption and transmission electron microscopy. The nature of the magnetic behavior found for all these Pd nanoparticles (NPs) is different depending on their sizes and structural features and is explained {{on the basis of}} two different suggested mechanisms. The particles protected by means of a surfactant (tetralkylammonium salts), present a ferromagnetic order related to the factors increasing the density of states just below the Fermi level. Whereas, when the nanoparticles are stabilized by covalent bonds with protective species (thiol derivatized alkane chains or surface oxidized Pd NPs), the increase of the 4 d density of holes, localized by the bonded atoms (S or O), is giving rise to the observed ferromagneticlike behavior. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

In addition, the recently described A. pseudolineare is reported from various localities and its ecology is described in detail. The new Achnanthidium species from Portugal were compared with the type material of morphologically similar taxa: Achnanthidium microcephalum, Achnanthes minutissima, A. minutissima var. cryptocephala, A. minutissima var. inconspicua and A. nana. The analysis of these type material confirmed that Achnanthes minutissima var. cryptocephala {{should be regarded as}} a different taxon, and a new combination is proposed, Achnanthidium neocryptocephalum, stat., comb. et nom. nov. Achnanthes minutissima var. inconspicua is now considered as a younger synonym of Achnanthidium lineare.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the results of GAO's review of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity-building programs. <b>Technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs {{can be defined as}} training designed to improve the performance or management of program recipients, such as teaching one-on-one procurement regulations to housing authority staff. Capacity building can be generally defined as funding to strengthen the capacity or capability of program recipients or providers [...] typically housing or community development organizations [...] thereby building the institutional knowledge within those organizations. The overall goal of both <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and capacity building is to enhance the delivery of HUD's housing and community development programs. HUD administers 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs through five program offices. From fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002, the annual funding for HUD <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> ranged between $ 128 million and $ 201 million, accounting for less than 1 percent of HUD's overall budget each year. Although the general purpose of HUD's <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> is to help program participants carry out HUD program goals, each program office designs <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> specifically related to its programs. Recipients could be states and units of local government, public or Indian housing agencies, private and nonprofit organizations, or individuals. Providers could be HUD officials or, more commonly, state or local governments, profit and nonprofit organizations, or public housing agencies. HUD awards funding for 17 of the 21 <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programs competitively. The funding for the remaining programs is awarded noncompetitively. HUD uses three types of funding instruments and determines which type to use {{on the basis of its}} relationship with the awardee and the level of federal involvement anticipated. All five HUD program offices perform basic oversight of the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> they administer, such as visually observing the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> or reviewing reports submitted by the providers to ensure that the <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> was provided.

50|$|In both Dade County and the Florida Keys, {{cooperation}} with landowners of tropical hardwood hammocks {{is essential to}} the long-term protection of this natural community. In 1979, Dade County enacted the Environmentally Endangered Lands Covenant Program which reduces taxes for owners of tropical hardwood hammocks and pine rocklands who agree not to develop these systems and to manage them for a period of 10 years. This program is still ongoing and protects many tropical hardwood hammock sites. Unfortunately, no similar system exists in Monroe County, where a significant amount of tropical hardwood hammock is still in private ownership, and much is subdivided into small parcels. Monroe County should be encouraged to adopt a program similar to the Environmentally Endangered Lands Covenant Program to help prevent the destruction and/or deterioration of privately held hammocks. In addition to the Environmentally Endangered Lands Covenant program, Dade County also has the Forest Resources Program within DERM which provides private and public owners of tropical hardwood hammocks and pine rocklands with <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> including the <b>preparation</b> of management plans, herbicide training, prescribed fire coordination, plant identification workshops, and site-specific consultations (J.
