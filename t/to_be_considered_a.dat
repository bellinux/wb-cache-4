5|$|Among {{both the}} Maguindanao and the Maranao, the agung embodies {{all that is}} {{masculine}} and thus the agung is traditionally considered a masculine instrument. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> good player, one must possess strength, stamina (playing extremely fast tempos with no mistakes) and endurance. Players must also exhibit improvisation skills for different patterns to be considered as having quality musicianship—lest the audience considers the patterns played repetitions and mundane.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, German {{experiments}} with gold at a current of only 10µA demonstrated a relative uncertainty of 1.5%. Follow-on experiments using bismuth ions and a current of 30mA {{were expected to}} accumulate a mass of 30g in six days {{and to have a}} relative uncertainty of better than 1ppm. Ultimately, ionaccumulation approaches proved to be unsuitable. Measurements required months and the data proved too erratic for the technique <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> viable future replacement to the IPK.|$|E
5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the American crow <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> nuisance. However, it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the American crow provides by eating insect pests.|$|E

5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a subtropical depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of a very broad subtropical low, as well as a poorly defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave. Environmental conditions favored tropical development, and the system gradually became better organized, although convection was initially limited near the center. On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the system <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression; at the time, it was located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated for it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade {{was due to the}} system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E
5|$|Characterized with disorganized convection, a broad surface trough {{formed in}} {{association}} with the wave the same day and environmental conditions were expected to favor gradual development. Initially, upper-level winds were only marginally favorable, and although the thunderstorms remained disorganized, the NHC estimated a 50%chance for development by early on October12. The next day, the system became better defined, and, the NHC noted that the system {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone. Although operationally not classified until 2100UTC on October 13, a post-season analysis conducted on the system revealed that it attained enough organization <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression at 1200UTC, while positioned about 645mi (1040km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E

Edun encountered problems with both quality of goods and delivery times from their African suppliers, and most of the stores originally carrying the line dropped it. It lost €9.7 million in 2007 and €12.8 million in 2008, suffering along with the rest of the apparel sector from the credit crisis of 2008.|$|E
5|$|It {{was under}} Florentino Pérez's first {{presidency}} (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition {{of becoming the}} world's richest professional football club. The club ceded part of its training grounds {{to the city of}} Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site. The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> form of state subsidy.|$|E
5|$|Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, {{released}} on September 19, 1989, by A Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, Control (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> role model for youth because of her socially conscious lyrics.|$|E

5|$|On November9, a weak {{circulation}} remained nearly stationary off {{the coast}} of Acapulco, Mexico. It did not have significant convection, although it organized enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone at 0000UTC on November10, about 230mi (365km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico. By the afternoon of the 10th, it was a tropical depression moving northeastward toward the coastline. Tara intensified, reaching hurricane status and its peak intensity of 85mph (140km/h) late on November11. Early on November12, Hurricane Tara made landfall near Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, between Acapulco and Manzanillo, near where Hurricane Iva moved ashore five months earlier. Continuing inland, it was last observed at 1200UTC on November12. At the time, it was known as Cyclone Tara, as the term cyclone was the more common equivalent for hurricane in the region.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, a trough of {{low-pressure}} {{was analyzed}} near the Lesser Antilles. The system moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without much organization. On November 7, the low-pressure area moved south of Cuba and became sufficiently organized <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression with a pressure {{of at least}} 1010 mbar (hPa; 29.83 inHg). The depression moved over Cuba and into the Atlantic, where it dissipated the following day. On November 9, a second system was detected northeast of Bermuda with a pressure of 1005 mbar (hPa; 29.68 inHg), though it remained unclear whether the two systems were related.|$|E
