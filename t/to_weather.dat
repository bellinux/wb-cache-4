5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful in {{scientific}} studies on animal physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. Kestrel metabolic rate {{has been found}} to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25⁰ C. Kestrel metabolic responses <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss.|$|E

Another 120 were damaged. Against those figures, 233 aircraft, 116 of which were lost owing <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> conditions, were destroyed.

5|$|In the 18th century Richmond and {{neighbouring}} Twickenham on {{the opposite}} bank of the Thames, {{both of which were}} distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly.

5|$|The {{design of}} HMS Glatton was also derived {{from that of}} Cerberus, {{although}} she exchanged one turret for heavier guns and armour. She was given a deeper draught for better seakeeping abilities, but retained the low freeboard of the older ships to make her a smaller target, making it difficult <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> head seas in heavy weather. Nominally intended for coast defence, she was designed to attack the defences of deep-water ports like Brest and Cherbourg.|$|E

40|$|Four {{decades after}} {{conversion}} from chaparral to grass, zero-order watersheds {{were compared to}} identify differences in topography {{and its relation to}} soil characteristics. Three watersheds of each vegetation type were topographically mapped and sampled at random points for depth <b>to</b> <b>weathered</b> bedrock and soil water content. Stepwise regres-sion was used to explain spatial variability in terms of terrain variables. In chaparral watersheds, convex slopes result in widespread infiltra-tion and significantly higher storage of water on the slopes. Topog-raphy of watersheds converted to grass is more concave, resulting in higher upslope contributing areas. This favors water convergence in the subsurface and results in significantly lower soil water content in grass watersheds. In chaparral watersheds, upslope average slope gradient best explains variability in depth <b>to</b> <b>weathered</b> bedrock. In contrast, slope gradient best explains depth <b>to</b> <b>weathered</b> bedrock i...|$|R

30|$|At present tapped wood {{of black}} pines (Pinus nigra var. austriaca) is mainly combusted. The {{priority}} of material use over thermal recycling {{has led to}} some considerations regarding the utilization of tapped wood. The high content of extractives suggests a higher natural durability, and therefore, the suitability for outdoor applications. Tapped and not tapped wood boards from black pine (sapwood and heartwood) were subjected <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> tests <b>to</b> find out its resistance against abiotic stress. Additionally tapped wood particles with a high content of resin were exposed <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> and <b>to</b> composting. <b>Weathering</b> caused roughness <b>to</b> increase. Infrared spectral characteristics revealed the differences before and after tapping and weathering. Principal component analyses supported the grouping according to the chemical changes. In heartwood the lignin band at 1510  cm−[*] 1 disappears and the typical resin band at 1688  cm−[*] 1 decreases considerably. The lignin band of resinous parts is affected neither by weathering nor by composting. However, the resin band shows an intensity decrease and broadening due <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> and disappears during composting.|$|R
