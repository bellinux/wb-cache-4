40|$|Dynamic train–track {{interaction}} {{is more complex}} in railway turnouts (switches & crossings) than on ordinary tangent or curved tracks. Multiple contacts between wheel and rail are common, and severe impact loads with broad frequency contents are induced when the nominal wheel–rail contact conditions are disturbed due to the continuous variation in rail profiles and the discontinuities in the crossing panel. The absence of transition curves at the entry and exit of the turnout, and the cant deficiency, lead to large wheel–rail contact forces and passenger discomfort when the train is switching into the <b>turnout</b> <b>track.</b> Two alternative multibody system (MBS) models of dynamic interaction between the train and a standard turnout design are developed. The first model is derived using a commercial MBS software. The second model {{is based on a}} multibody dynamics formulation that may account for the structural flexibility of train and track components (based on finite element models and coordinate reduction methods). The variation in rail profile is accounted for by sampling the cross-section of each rail at several positions along the turnout. Contact between the back of the wheel flange and the check rail, when the wheelset is steered through the crossing, is considered. Good agreement between the results from the two models is observed when the track model is taken as rigid...|$|E
40|$|In my {{graduation}} thesis I {{focused on}} curved turnouts as devices which enable the transition between tracks in curves (arc and transtiton curve). This {{is perceived as}} one of the more complexed processes in railway transport. The first part of the thesis covers the theoretical background. It therefore represents the clasification of turnouts, their labeling and components. The calculation of horizontal elements (radius of the <b>turnout</b> <b>track,</b> and lengths changes of closure rails) and altitude profile of the turnout is essential for the design of the turnouts. This is how the speed through the turnout is defined. I have used this knowledge to design the doublel track, which runs in an arc (R = 800 m) and then with the transition curve ends into the station area. Longitudinal slope of the rail is S‰ = 2 ‰. The track connection in the arc is composed by right internal curved turnout (KR 1) and right external curved turnout (KR 2). In the end of the transition curve the station track split from the internal rail track. All this enables the right internal parabolic turnout (KR 3). These calculations are all based on the turnout 60 E 1 - 500 - 1 : 12. What is more I also made the calculations for horizontal elements and the altitude profile for the entire turnout area. In the final part of the thesis I drew a ground plan and the altitude profile of the turnout area. All designing work was done accordingly to the Guideline about the railway superstructure (Pravilnik o zgornjem ustroju železniških prog, UL RS, št. 92 / 2010). ...|$|E

The {{scientific}} {{paper has}} a purpose to choose rational technological {{parameters of the}} transportation organization process, which would enable the freight train movement with the most efficient train traffic arrangement, the decrease in idle time due to the increased speed of cargo delivery {{and the increase in}} the working capacity of the marshalling yard. Methodology. The work presents the technical and operational characteristics of marshalling yards in Europe and Ukraine. The research methods include the station operation analysis, the car traffic flow analysis, analysis of the train sheet, the DU- 1 natural sheets upon arrival and departure of trains. Schemes were developed for calculating working capacity of necks, rehandling capacity of marshalling hump, acceptable levels of system loading. Findings. The research resulted in the calculated working (rehandling) capacity of the main elements of the station. Daily loads of marshalling hump and <b>turnout</b> <b>tracks</b> vary significantly by variations and gradations of movement volume. This affects the idle time of trains and, in general, the value of the criterion according to which the optimal technical equipment, optimum interaction of the subsystems and gridiron of the station will be chosen. This criterion must take into account the costs of technical equipment, construction of tracks, locomotives, as well as related operating costs in all cases. Thus, the selection of the optimal interaction should establish the economically viable level of operational reliability of the sub-systems, their technical and track capacity. Originality. By increasing the productivity of train departure channel, marshalling hump and <b>turnout</b> <b>tracks</b> it is possible the thetrain handling processes and reduce the car idle time. Intensification of production processes in marshalling yards provides a reduction in car turnover and in idle time and high economic efficiency of capital investments. The work covers the issues related to improving the efficiency of functioning of marshalling yards in the railway transport reforming conditions. Practical value. Using the methods of determining the rational working (rehandling) capacity of marshalling yards for distribution of train traffic flows between them makes it possible to improve the quality indicators of marshalling yard operation...|$|R

40|$|Pre-assembled {{turnouts}} {{have recently}} been introduced with split concrete sleepers joined by elastic coupling plates. Their effect on the forces, vibration response, and sound radiation as trains run through a turnout is studied here using a calculation model for a whole turnout based on the finite-element method. The non-linear characteristics of the ballast's support under the sleepers, {{as well as the}} special construction of the articulated joints, are included. It is shown that compared with the normal integral sleeper design, the track with articulated switch sleepers has a lower rigidity, which changes more evenly along the track and improves its dynamic performance. Furthermore, the fatigue strength of an articulated switch sleeper is higher due to its lower stress amplitudes. Additionally, when the vehicles are running on the main turnout route, as the switch sleepers’ vibration behaviour is modified, the articulated joints effectively reduce the impact loading of the ballast {{at the end of the}} sleeper under the <b>turnout</b> branch <b>track.</b> This will extend the life of the ballast bed. Finally, the sound radiation from the articulated switch sleeper is very low in the hinged short part and is reduced by about 0. 6 dB for the total length. <br/...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs an {{essential}} feature to enable rail operational flexibility, railway <b>turnouts</b> are special <b>track</b> systems used to divert a train {{from a particular}} direction or a particular track onto other directions or other <b>tracks.</b> Railway <b>turnout</b> is constructed on a complex geometry and grade, which makes {{it one of the}} most critical railway infrastructures.

40|$|Abstract: Based on turnout/bridge {{interaction}} {{principle and}} {{finite element method}} (FEM), an integrated turnout/beam/pier model of jointless <b>turnout</b> on ballasted <b>track</b> was established to analyze the influences of expansion joint on stress and deformation of the turnout. The results are concluded as follows: whether the rail expansion joint is set in front of or behind the turnout, expansion additional force of stock rail will be reduced greatly {{at the end of}} the beam; so do the expansion displacement of switch rail and nose rail, the stress of displacement restrictor and spacer block, rail break gap and the longitudinal force of one rail after the other rail broke. But when the expansion joint is set in front of the turnout, the pier’s longitudinal force of continuous beam bridge and the simply supported beam bridge (within the expansion range of the device) increase greatly. When the device is close to the turnout, longitudinal relative displacement of the stock rail to the girder also increases a lot. By comparison, it is more favorable to set the expansion joint behind the turnout, or to set the device at the both ends of the continuous beam, or to set the device at the ends of continuous beam rather than in the center of the span...|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} the working {{of the model}} in the actual traffic scenario, we conducted several experiments {{for a group of}} trains with different characteristics representing the mixed traffic. The system deals with two kinds of parameters associated with the track: operator defined which is static and deterministic such as the maximum allowable speed on the <b>track,</b> <b>turnout</b> restricted speed. The other arising in real time is dynamic and random, e.g. speed restrictions due to track faults, train equipment faults or any kind of obstacle on the track. Due to the static and dynamic parameters, trains’ normal running is affected. However, as the static parameters are deterministic, the system has prior knowledge about this. The system takes care of such restrictions while estimating moving authority for the trains. On the other hand, the occurrence of dynamic parameters is known at runtime and this is challenging while estimating moving authority for the trains. In our work, both scenarios have been taken to test the overall responsiveness of the proposed system. The results obtained are categorized into two parts: one showing the relationship between speed and location to represent the safe moving authority provided to the trains for their safe running in case of any fault scenario identified in runtime, and second, the relationship between time and location to represent the collision-free running of the trains in the same scenario. For the purpose of describing the behavioural analysis, we considered only one instance from several simulation experiments for each fault type.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Turnouts play a {{key role}} in the railway {{transportation}} process. One-sided and many-sided curved turnouts were railed over the last 20 years in difficult conditions (curved sections, yard necks). They have a number of geometric features, unlike the conventional one-sided turnouts. Today the normative documents prohibit laying such <b>turnouts</b> in curved <b>track</b> sections and only partially regulate the assessment procedure of their real condition. The question of establishment the permissible train speed within the curved turnouts is still open. In this regard, authors propose to set the train speed according to the driving comfort criterion using the results of field measurements of ordinates from the baseline for the particular curved turnout. Methodology. The article considers the criteria using which one can set the permissible speed on the turnouts. It defines the complexity of their application, advantages and disadvantages. Findings.
