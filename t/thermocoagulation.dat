50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{a survey}} found that in the mid-1970s about 150 people a year were {{undergoing}} psychosurgery. A few people underwent the standard pre-frontal leucotomy; {{the most commonly used}} operation was subcaudate tractotomy. Methods used to destroy tissue included <b>thermocoagulation,</b> suction, radioisotopes and leucotomes. By far the most common diagnosis of those undergoing psychosurgery was depression, followed by anxiety, violence, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. The 1983 Mental Health Act legislated for the use of psychosurgery. Section 57 stipulated that it could only be used on patients who had consented to it, and when a psychiatrist from the Mental Health Act Commission had authorised it and the psychiatrist and two non-medical people from the Commission considered that the consent was valid. By the end of the 1980s about 20 patients a year were undergoing psychosurgery in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, {{ablation}} is {{the same}} as removal of a part of biological tissue, usually by surgery. Surface ablation of the skin (dermabrasion, also called resurfacing because it induces regeneration) can be carried out by chemicals (chemoablation), by lasers (laser ablation), by freezing (cryoablation), or by electricity (fulguration). Its purpose is to remove skin spots, aged skin, wrinkles, thus rejuvenating it. Surface ablation is also employed in otolaryngology for several kinds of surgery, such as for snoring. Ablation therapy using radio frequency waves on the heart is used to cure a variety of cardiac arrhythmiae such as supraventricular tachycardia, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), ventricular tachycardia, and more recently as management of atrial fibrillation. The term is often used in the context of laser ablation, a process in which a laser dissolves a material's molecular bonds. For a laser to ablate tissues, the power density or fluence must be high, otherwise <b>thermocoagulation</b> occurs, which is simply thermal vaporization of the tissues.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the clinical {{results in an}} unselected group of consecutive patients with osteoid osteoma treated with <b>thermocoagulation.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 97 consecutive patients with clinical and/or radiologic evidence of osteoid osteoma at any location, the clinical symptoms were assessed before and after <b>thermocoagulation</b> with computed tomographic guidance. A good response was defined as disappearance of symptoms that were manifested at presentation and attributed to osteoid osteoma. Clinical assessment was performed prior to discharge; within 2 weeks after the procedure; and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. After 24 months, a postal questionnaire was used for assessment. RESULTS: The mean clinical follow-up after the only or the last <b>thermocoagulation</b> session was 41 months (range, 5 - 81 months). Response was good after one session of <b>thermocoagulation</b> in 74 (76 %) of 97 patients, and the 95 % CI was 68 % to 85 %. Patients with persistent symptoms did well after repeated <b>thermocoagulation</b> (good response in 10 of 12 patients), but results of repeated <b>thermocoagulation</b> were poor in patients with recurrent symptoms (good response in five of 10). The overall success rate after one or two <b>thermocoagulation</b> procedures combined was 92 % (89 of 97 patients), and the 95 % CI was 86 % to 97 %. Complications were observed in two patients. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous <b>thermocoagulation</b> is a safe and effective method for treatment of osteoid osteoma at any location.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Two {{cases are}} {{reported}} in which an osteoid osteoma of the lumbar spine was treated with CT-guided <b>thermocoagulation.</b> OBJECTIVES: To review an alternative and minimally invasive treatment for spinal osteoid osteomas. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical resection of a spinal osteoid osteoma can, depending on the location, be a formidable undertaking. Bone scintigraphy {{can be helpful in}} intraoperative identification. More recently, resection through a computed tomography-guided drill hole was found to minimize exposure. Using a <b>thermocoagulation</b> probe, as has been used in osteoid osteoma of the extremities, may be technically easier and cause less morbidity. METHOD: With the patient under general anesthesia, a bone biopsy cannula was introduced {{into the center of the}} osteoid osteoma. Material was subjected to histologic examination. A <b>thermocoagulation</b> probe was then inserted and heated to 90 C for 4 minutes. The two patients were kept overnight for observation. RESULTS: Both patients had complete pain relief and no evidence of recurrence after 2 years' follow-up. There were no complications. Scoliosis resolved in one patient and persisted in the other. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous computed tomography-guided <b>thermocoagulation</b> is a minimally invasive and technically straightforward method to achieve ablation of a spinal osteoid osteoma. No complications were encountered in these two patients. Future research should focus on the safety of <b>thermocoagulation,</b> especially cephalad to the level of the conus medullaris. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} healing pattern of osteoid osteomas on {{computed}} tomography (CT) and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) after successful and unsuccessful <b>thermocoagulation.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients were examined by CT and 18 patients by dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI before and after <b>thermocoagulation</b> for osteoid osteoma. <b>Thermocoagulation</b> was successful in 73 % (63 / 86) and unsuccessful in 27 % (23 / 86) of patients followed by CT. <b>Thermocoagulation</b> was successful in 72 % (13 / 18) of patients followed by MRI. After treatment, the healing of the nidus on CT was evaluated using different healing patterns (complete ossification, minimal nidus rest, decreased size, unchanged size or thermonecrosis). On MRI the presence of reactive changes (joint effusion, "oedema-like" changes of bone marrow and soft tissue oedema) and the delay time (between arterial and nidus enhancement) were assessed and compared before and after <b>thermocoagulation.</b> RESULTS: Complete ossification or a minimal nidus rest was observed on CT in 58 % (16 / 28) of treatment successes (with > 12 months follow-up), but not in treatment failures. "Oedema-like" changes of bone marrow and/or soft tissue oedema were seen on MR in all patients before <b>thermocoagulation</b> and in all treatment failures. However, residual "oedema-like" changes of bone marrow were also found in 69 % (9 / 13) of treatment successes. An increased delay time was observed in 62 % (8 / 13) of treatment successes and in 1 / 5 of treatment failures. CONCLUSION: Complete, or almost complete, ossification of the treated nidus on CT correlated with successful treatment. Absence of this ossification pattern, however, did not correlate with treatment failure. CT {{could not be used}} to identify the activity of the nidus following treatment. The value of MR parameters to assess residual activity of the nidus was limited in this study. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Although many {{clinical}} investigations of sleep spindles have been discussed, {{the mechanisms of}} spindle activity still remain unclear. Cortical barbiturate spindle bursts (7 - 14 Hz) in anesthetized cats before and after <b>thermocoagulation</b> were studied in duration (SDV : sec), appearance (SAV : /min), and latency (SLV:sec). Normal control spindle bursts (number of subjects, 34; number of spindles in the left, 363; in the right, 358) showed as follows : SDVs were 1. 45 ± 0. 45 sec (mean±SD) in the left and 1. 49 ± 0. 47 sec in the right;SAVs were 11. 5 /min in the left and 11. 4 /min in the right;and SLV was 0. 36 ± 0. 45 sec. These data suggested spindle activities were statistically symmet- rical and consistent. Stereotactic thermocoagulated lesions in the caudate nucleus (C group : n= 7) altered spindle duration bilaterally. SDVs after <b>thermocoagulation</b> in both hemispheres were significantly longer than those before coagulation (p＜ 0. 01). SAVs and SLVs remained unchanged after <b>thermocoagulation</b> in C group. <b>Thermocoagulation</b> in the lateral thalamus (L group : n= 8) altered spindle appearance and duration, but the medial thalamic lesions (M group: n= 7) did not affect spindle activity.

40|$|Neurolytic {{thoracic}} sympathetic ganglion blockade has only relatively recently been introduced as a clinical therapeutic strategy. To cast {{light on the}} efficacy of this procedure, data for 111 patients (21 - 78 years old, 132 affected extremities/sites) were analyzed. Methods : A comparative assessment was performed with fluoroscopic and contrast-radiographic observation of the blockade using chemical or thermocoagulative approaches, with anterior paratracheal or posterior paravertebral injection sites and upper-thoracic or lower-thoracic regions. Results : Chemical neurolytic sympathetic ganglion blockade was applied to patients 217 times, and radiofrequency <b>thermocoagulation</b> at 90 ℃ for 180 seconds a total of 64 times. Statistically, chemical neurolytiques proved longer lasting than <b>thermocoagulation</b> neurolytiques but {{no significant differences between}} anterior and posterior approaches were observed regarding the period of influence. Lower-thoracic injection was associated with a longer effective duration than evident with the upper-thoracic group. Complications were observed with chemical neurolytique including two cases of pneumothorax, two cases of Horner's syndrome and one case of nerve injury, despite radiographic evaluation. Conclusions : Chemical or radiofrequency <b>thermocoagulation</b> neurolytique can be extensively applied to patients suffering from persistent intractable pain in the cervical or thoracic regions, but performance under fluoroscopy is an absolute requiement. 個人の特定が出来ると思われる写真が掲載されているため本文PDFの登録はな...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionOsteoid osteoma is a painful, {{benign bone tumor}} that mainly affects young people. <b>Thermocoagulation</b> {{is one of the}} {{recommended}} percutaneous treatment methods. This study sought to assess its efficacy and identify risk factors for osteoma recurrence. MethodsResults were analyzed retrospectively for a group of 87 patients treated by <b>thermocoagulation</b> between 2002 and 2011. The recurrence rate was calculated and analyzed relative to patient and tumor characteristics. The treatment efficacy was determined and methods to prevent complications were analyzed. ResultsThe mean follow-up time was 34 months. The average patient age was 23 years. There were seven complications including three patients with delayed wound healing, mainly at tibial sites. The recurrence rate was 10. 4 %. The success rate for first-line treatment was 89. 6 % and it was 97. 5 % for second-line treatment. Analysis of patient characteristics and tumor locations revealed no risk factors for recurrence. ConclusionPercutaneous <b>thermocoagulation</b> is a reliable and effective technique that provides fast, long-lasting pain relief. However recurrence can occur even after the nidus is completely resected. These recurrences can be effectively managed by repeat treatment. Recent technical improvements have reduced the risk of thermocoagulation-related complications. Level of evidenceIV...|$|E
40|$|Monkeys with <b>thermocoagulation</b> or {{kainic acid}} lesions of the {{pulvinar}} and unoperated control monkeys {{were tested in}} two tasks: pattern discrimination retention and color discrimination learning in which the stimuli were located at the response sites or were separated spatially from them (S-R separation). The monkeys with kainic acid pulvinar lesions were mildly impaired in retention of the pattern discrimination, but were unimpaired in the color discrimination tasks {{with or without the}} S-R separation. The monkeys with <b>thermocoagulation</b> lesions, like monkeys with superior colliculus lesions in a prior study, were severely impaired in performing one of the color discrimination tasks with S-R separation. These findings suggest that: (a) the inferior pulvinar, unlike the superior colliculus, does not contribute to the performance of discriminations involving S-R separation; and (b) corticotectal projections traversing the pulvinar and destroyed by the <b>thermocoagulation</b> lesions are crucial to the performance of discriminations involving S-R separation. The results of an earlier experiment also suggested that interruption of corticotectal fibers passing through the pulvinar impairs performance in another task sensitive to superior colliculus lesions [...] spatial localization of light flashes. Thus, corticotectal projections may be crucial for the contribution of the colliculus to performance in a variety of visual tasks...|$|E

40|$|Acardiac twinning, or {{the twin}} {{reversed}} arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence, occurs in 1 % of monozygotic twins, or 1 in 35, 000 births. It {{is caused by}} the development of arterioarterial vascular anastomoses between the umbilical arteries of monozygotic twins early in embryogenesis. The pump twin may be associated with congenital anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, it is recommended that prenatal genetic testing be offered whenever pregnancy is complicated by acardiac twinning. The treatment options for acardiac twinning include observation, medical management, amniodrainage, and invasive treatment such as hysterotomy with selective delivery of the acardiac twin, intrafetal ablation of the acardiac twin by alcohol, laser, <b>thermocoagulation</b> or radiofrequency, fetoscope-guided funicular occlusion by ligation, laser or <b>thermocoagulation,</b> and ultrasound-guided funicular occlusion by ligation, cord compression, <b>thermocoagulation</b> or intrafunicular embolization with foreign bodies.
