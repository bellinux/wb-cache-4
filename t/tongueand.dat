The poem, as it appeared in 1599, with substantive differences from the 1609 Quarto in italics:When my love swears that she is made of truth,I do believe her, though I know she lies,That she might think me some untutor'd youth,Unskilful in the world's false forgeries.Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,Although I know my years be past the best,I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.But wherefore says my love that she is young?And wherefore say not I that I am old?O love's best habit is a flattering <b>tongue,And</b> age, in love, loves not to have years told.:Therefore I'll lie with love, and love with me,:Since that our faults in love thus smother'd be.|$|E

My niece {{that flies}} away so fast?Cousin, a word: {{where is your}} husband?If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!If I do wake, some Planet strike me down,That I may slumber in eternal sleep!Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle handsHath lopped, and hewed and made thy body bareOf her two branches, those sweet ornaments,Whose {{circling}} shadows, Kings have sought to sleep in,And might not gain so great a happinessAs half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,Like to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind,Doth rise and fall between thy ros'd lips,Coming and going with thy honey breath.But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,And, lest thou should'st detect him, cut thy tongue.Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame;And notwithstanding all this loss of blood,As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face,Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,That I might rail at him to ease my mind!Sorrow conceal'd, like an oven stopped.Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.Fair Philomela, why she but lost her <b>tongue,And</b> in a tedious sampler sowed her mind;But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,That could have better sowed then Philomel.O, had the monster seen those lily handsTremble, like aspen leaves, upon a lute,And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,He would not then have touched them for his life.Or, had he heard the heavenly harmonyWhich that sweet tongue hath made,He would have dropped his knife and fell asleep,As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,For such a sight will blind a father's eye.One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;O, could our mourning ease thy misery!:::::::(2.4.11-57) ...|$|E

40|$|Tongue, {{skin and}} brain metastases of bladder cancer are very rare and few {{cases have been}} reported. We report a case of tongue, skin and brain metastases of bladder cancer. A 61 -year-old woman was referredto our {{hospital}} with gross hematuria. Transurethral resection of the bladder (TURBT), tongue biopsy andskin biopsy were performed. Pathological findings showed urothelial carcinoma, G 2, micropapillaryvariant, pT 2 ＞ and tongue and skin metastases from urothelial carcinoma of bladder. After three cycles ofchemotherapy (gemcitabine plus paclitaxel), tongue and skin metastases disappeared. Cystoscopy revealedno tumor of bladder. Eleven months later, she was admitted to our hospital because of disturbance ofconsciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple brain metastases. Rechallenge ofchemotherapy (gemcitabine plus paclitaxel) restored from disturbance of consciousness and MRI showedpartial response of brain metastases. We performed six additional courses of chemotherapy. Skin, <b>tongueand</b> brain metastases from bladder cancer indicate poor risk. Chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus paclitaxel) could be effective against these matastases...|$|E

40|$|Flavors {{of taste}} are {{detected}} {{by a set}} of microscopical cellular aggregates calledthe taste buds, present in different arrangements on the upper surface of the <b>tongueand</b> other areas in the mouth. Taste buds are chemosensors that can detect differenttaste qualities such as sweet, sour, bitter, salt and umami. Information from thetaste buds is carried via nerve fibers to the brain where these signals are furtherprocessed, finally leading to the experience of taste. Taste buds not only help usenjoy food, they are also part of an important control and warning system, enablingus to avoid consuming hazardous substances or spoiled food. During the past severalyears, more light has been shed on many aspects of the gustatory system, includingthe local epithelial origin of taste buds and taste transduction mechanisms. However,the manner in which taste buds develop and become connected to the brain by nervefibers has long been a matter of debate. The present work now demonstrates the crucialimportance of two proteins closely related to nerve growth factor (NGF) in tastebud development and proper taste and sensory functions of the mouth. Messenger RNAcoding for the NGF-related proteins BDNF (brain derived neuro trophic factor) andNT- 3 (neurotrophin- 3) were found to be present in precisely the right locations inand around the taste buds to suggest that they are of vital importance for controllingthe arrival of nerve fibers to these structures. These hypotheses were borneout bystudies of mice in which either the gene for BDNF or NT- 3 had been selectively turnedoff. Mice that developed without BDNF had very few and abnormal taste buds and wereunable to discriminate between primary tastes such as sweet, salt or bitter. Animalsin which the NT- 3 gene had instead been turned off appeared to have a normal developmentof their taste bud system, but instead demon strated severe impairment of sensoryfunction of mucous membranes of the oral cavity. These results demonstrate key roles for the two neurotrophic proteins BDNF andNT- 3 in con trolling the development of the gustatory and somatosensory apparatusesof the mouth. These neurotrophins also seem to be important in oral gustatory andsomatosensory innervation in humans. It {{remains to be seen whether}} or not disturbancesof the genes for these neurotrophic proteins might underlie rare human conditionssuch as familial dysautonomia in which the ability to discriminate tastes is lost. These novel findings may also have implications in more common cases in problemsof loss of taste and sensation in the mouth such as those seen after injury to thenerves, either by accident or following oral or facial surgery. Knowledge about whichproteins are needed to stimulate nerve fibers to grow into mucous membranes of theoral cavity during development suggests that these same proteins might become helpfulin stimulating regeneration of injured nerves in adult patients, perhaps helpingthem to regain lost taste and sensory function. Neurotrophins are also expressed in the developing teeth. They all show temporospatiallyspecific expression patterns. We suggest that neurotrophins are involved in earlymorphogenetic events during tooth development and that NGF and BDNF are involvedin the innervation of the dental pulp. Further experiments are required to determinethe precise roles of neurotrophins in tooth development. The GDNF family of ligands and receptors are also expressed in developing <b>tongueand</b> teeth. They might be involved in the autonomic innervation ot the tongue. Inteeth, they might partici pate both in morphogenetic events during tooth developmentand participate in tooth innervation.
