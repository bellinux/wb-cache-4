5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and predictable, while others were more positive. The producers were happy to have started well, survived the ratings lull in the middle, and ended with an upward curve in the last two weeks. Audience breakdowns indicate that a higher proportion of younger viewers were <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> Survivors than many other shows.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s main {{competition}} in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions. McMahon countered Jim Crockett's successful Starrcade pay-per-view, which began airing in 1983, by creating the WrestleMania franchise. After WrestleMania III in March 1987, the most successful professional wrestling pay-per-view event in history, McMahon created the Survivor Series franchise, which aired {{the same day as}} Starrcade 1987 in November 1987. After defeating Crockett in the ratings war, McMahon created the Royal Rumble, an event airing for free on the USA Network in January 1988. The event set a ratings record for the network with eight million households <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> watch the event. In retaliation, Crockett created the Clash of the Champions event, which aired simultaneously with WrestleMania IV. WrestleMania IV garnered higher ratings, and not long after, Crockett filed for bankruptcy and sold his company to Ted Turner, who renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW).|$|E

The {{following}} Monday, {{the audience for}} Breakfast was down to 42,000. Breakfast then reduced {{to an average of}} around 40,000 viewers nationally each morning. Despite having ratings lower than other breakfast television shows, the program still beat Ten's previous line-up. Additionally, advertising revenue in the early-morning time-slot since Breakfast launched was more than double that of before.|$|E

25|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} {{something}} of a mixed bag for NBC, but still successful. NBC launched eight new series that year, with only one, comedy-drama police procedural The Mysteries of Laura, being renewed for a second season. Nevertheless, the network continued to experience success with most of its returning series, especially The Blacklist (despite a modest decline in viewership following its move to Thursdays midway through the season, due partly to an initial weak lead-in from miniseries The Slap). Combined with the record number of viewers <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> Super Bowl XLIX, NBC again finished #1 in the 18-49 demographic and in second place overall.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{continues to}} be featured heavily in high-profile storylines which have included various feuds, police enquiries, armed robbery, kidnapping, numerous affairs and relationship problems and an ongoing plot concentrating on the character's struggles to bond with his children. 2005 saw the highly anticipated screen return of both of the Mitchell brothers – six years since they last appeared together. 13million viewers tuned in to see their return giving the BBC a 52.9% audience share, a massive coup for the show which had come under heavy criticism in the British media after it drew its lowest audience in {{more than five years}} (6.6million viewers <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> one episode in September 2005).|$|E

Desperate to hold on to her husband, she announces that she is terminally ill and only has six months to live. Upon hearing this, Den becomes wracked with guilt, and so decides to revise his plans and stay with Angie. He sets about organising a second honeymoon for them in Venice. However, their holiday is ruined when Jan arrives, and upon seeing her and Den together, Angie starts drinking again having not long given up. On the way home from Venice on the Orient Express, a drunk Angie tells the barman all about her big lie. Unfortunately for Angie, Den overhears every word, and from that moment on he reverts to his original plan to leave her, although he decides to wait a while before letting Angie know that he knows about her lie. On Christmas Day that year, Den decides to get his revenge.

Viewing figures rose to 11.07million viewers for the season finale, giving Glee the highest finale rating for a new show in the 2009–10 television season. Only the first twenty episodes of the first season were accounted for when calculating the season average due to the final two episodes airing outside the traditional sweeps period.

500|$|The {{show was}} {{considered}} a [...] "national institution" [...] with audiences of between 15 and 20 million regularly <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> its 93 episodes. Barker won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1971 and 1977 for the show. The Two Ronnies ended with the 1987 Christmas special. In 1978 the two performed a stage version of the show at the London Palladium; lasting for three months, it followed the same format as the show, with old sketches and some new material, supported by variety acts. Barker's unease with appearing as himself in the stage show led him to create a fictionalised version of himself to play instead. A second stage series took place in 1983. Barker was reportedly offended by a sketch called 'The Two Ninnies' on the BBC's Not the Nine O'Clock News, which mocked their act as being based on dated innuendo-based humour.|$|E

500|$|In another {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: [...] "It's {{not that one}} hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not even about the money." [...] Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused {{to say that he}} had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur. However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract. In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: [...] "We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been {{an important part of the}} Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we know our audience will be <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see what his plans are next." [...] Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009, and made his return on January 15, 2010. That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera. In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving. Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November. Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless, furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time.

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and {{was not the first}} benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal's Highbury ground had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on {{towards the end of the}} first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to [...] "Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise." [...] The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> watch the spectacle.

In the book Seeing Things: Television in the Age of Uncertainty, author John Ellis uses the couple's combustible relationship {{as an example of}} emotional intensity and pathos: [...] "A couple like Ricky and Bianca [...] can have constantly sniped at each other for several episodes, for no apparent dramatic purpose except that it is the nature of their relationship. Then they will suddenly be confronted by a life-changing decision [...] There is suddenly a shift in emotional intensity for the audience. Every word now counts, and all the previous audience attitudes of irritation or even condescension to this 'not very bright couple' [...] become a feeling of utter absorption in their dilemma." [...] The BBC has reported that Bianca and Ricky's on-off romance [...] "captivated millions of fans", and in April 1997 attracted [...] "one of the biggest soap audiences ever", with 22million viewers <b>tuning</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see them marry. In 2000, Owen stated that the storyline he most enjoyed in EastEnders was the build up and marriage to Bianca, because [...] "the public's enthusiasm for the event was a great motivation".
