50|$|The {{traditional}} costume for khaleegy {{is composed}} of 2 pieces or dresses. The bottom or shift dress is molded to the figure and is made of a sturdier fabric than the <b>top</b> <b>dress.</b> It is usually not adorned or embroidered and when it is, the ornaments are very simple. The colors often contrast with the ones of the <b>top</b> <b>dress</b> to create nice color combinations. The <b>top</b> <b>dress</b> is a long, wide, rectangular tunic-like dress called a thobe. It is traditionally made of sheer silk to create a translucent effect and let {{a hint of the}} shift dress be seen, it is heavily embroidered from the center and the extreme wide shoulder parts with beads, yarn embroidery or anything shiny. The neckline is also beautifully ornamented. The Thobe can be any color, but very bright solid tones are the most used. Additional accessories for the costume include necklaces, bracelets, big shiny earrings and the most important one: the womanÂ´s long and well cared hair. It is danced barefoot.|$|R

40|$|Intercropping of forage cropsand the {{combined}} use of organic, chemical,and biofertilizers {{is of great}} importance. To evaluate quantitative and qualitative characteristics of corn and grass pea intercropping under organic and chemical fertilizers factorial experiments in a randomized complete block design with three replications were conducted in Yalian Farm of Qazvin, Iran, in 2013 and 2014. Levels of intercropping consisted of: corn sole croppings, intercropping of maize and 25 % grass pea, intercropping corn and 50 % grass pea, and grass pea sole cropping. Fertilizer levels were chemicals (base and <b>top</b> <b>dress),</b> cow manure (base) and avian manure <b>top</b> <b>dress,</b> cow manure (base) and chemical <b>top</b> <b>dress,</b> and cow manure (base) and chemical (<b>top</b> <b>dress</b> and spraying). In the last three treatments corn and grass pea seed inoculated with Azotobacter and mycorrhiza. The {{results showed that the}} highest corn forage yield with 84230 kg/ha produced from grass pea corn treated with 50 % chemical manure. Intercropping is a suitable method for crop production and increasing quantity of crop as compared with sole croppings. The highest forage with 46020 kg/ha was produced by grass pea chemical manure treatment because of more light penetration to the canopy and the lack of competition with corn. Highest carbohydrates % 30. 5 belonged to the use of chemical fertilizer in sole cropping of corn and the highest crude protein with % 24. 75 is produced from chemical fertilizer in pure grass pea sole cropping and the highest dry matter digestibility and higher quality forage with % 68. 08 from the use of manure % 25 grass pea/corn intercropping.

40|$|Two-year {{trials have}} been {{conducted}} in Technological Research Center in Zajecar. Research objects were six malting barley genotypes. The experimental crop was <b>top</b> <b>dressed</b> with the following amounts of nitrogen: 40, 60, 80 and 100 kg ha- 1. The control variant was not <b>top</b> <b>dressed.</b> The obtained {{results showed that the}} genotypes reacted significantly to the increased amounts of nitrogen by changing their production characteristics and seed quality. In addition, the genotypes demonstrated certain varietal differences. A new genotype, Premijum, was highest yielding and it had the lowest total proteins in the grain. The genotype NS- 525 had the highest 1000 -grain weight (46. 8 g). The effect of nitrogen on the studied characteristics depended on N quantity applied. Increasing amounts of nitrogen decrease positive effects on spike length, number of grains per spike, 1000 -grain weight and yield. However, the protein content in grain kept increasing to the highest nitrogen dose, which lowered the quality of malting barley. The highest yield was obtained by applying 80 and 100 kg ha- 1 of nitrogen, depending on the year of study...|$|R
