5|$|<b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack}} {{of sufficient}} intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E
5|$|Dinges {{wrote that}} in the early 1970s the U.S. Justice Department had enough {{evidence}} to bring an indictment of Noriega on drug charges in a U.S. court, but chose not to do so because of the diplomatic consequences involved. This evidence included the testimony of an arrested boat courier, and of a drug smuggler arrested in New York. Though Torrijos frequently promised the U.S. cooperation in dealing with drug smuggling, Noriega would have headed any effort at enforcement, and the U.S. began to see him as <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem.</b> Dinges writes that the U.S. government considered several options to move Noriega out of the drug trafficking business, including assassinating him, and linking him to a fictional plot against Torrijos. Though no assassination attempt was made, the other ploys may have been tried in the early 1970s, according to Dinges. Beginning in 1972, however, Dinges writes that the U.S. relaxed its efforts at trapping individuals involved with smuggling within the Panama government, possibly {{as a result of an}} agreement between Torrijos and U.S. president Richard Nixon. Moreover, during the same period Noriega was becoming a trusted ally of the CIA, including acting as the U.S. emissary to Cuba during negotiations following the Johnny Express incident. Noriega, too, made an effort during this period to portray Panama as a hub of enforcement against drug smuggling, possibly as a result of pressure from Torrijos. Noriega's drug-related activities came to the U.S. government's attention once again during the ratification process for the Panama Canal treaties, but were once again downplayed by the U.S. intelligence services in order to get the treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate.|$|E

There are few large brand-name hotels which makes marketing the island in the United States difficult.

25|$|PNAS has {{received}} occasional criticism for releasing papers to science journalists {{as much as}} a week before making them available to the general public; this practice is known as a news embargo. According to critics, this allows mainstream news outlets to misrepresent or exaggerate the implications of experimental findings before the scientific community is able to respond. Science writer Ed Yong, on the other hand, has argued that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> is not embargoes themselves, but the press releases issued by research institutes and universities.|$|E

At higher elevations, where farming was problematic in good years, the cooler climate did not quite support agriculture. In May 1816, frost killed off most crops in the higher elevations of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, as well as upstate New York.

25|$|Critics of New Urbanism {{have argued}} that its {{environmental}} aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> with the unsustainable nature of modern cities {{is not just about}} cars and too much driving - it is about the entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is {{less than half of the}} overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.|$|E

In the last fifteen years a ‘community machinery’ has been developed.

These deficits can be repaired (1) by acknowledging the variable roles of citizens, (2) by restraining the self estimation, (3) by relativise the community scale and (4) by a better analysis of what <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>problems</b> are. These repairs are surely possible, but it may be advisable to reframe the community machinery, using the model of the urban renewal...|$|R

25|$|The work at Dartford thus {{came to a}} halt. In {{a report}} in 1581 Schutz' design for the Dartford furnace was blamed, but recent modern {{research}} has shown that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> was that the 1400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island were not gold-bearing. Hogarth concluded that since Schutz had attempted to buy all the ore himself, he was unlikely to have tampered with the tests, and the 'inescapable conclusion' is that the assay method was at fault, perhaps because of contamination from additives necessarily used in the process. McDermott also notes that Schutz' original test while he was on Countess of Warwick Island had been on a 'rich red ore' from Jonas' Mount, but little of that ore was brought back on the 1577 voyage because the ships were already laden with black ore before the red ore was found, and Frobisher did not mine at Jonas' Mount on the 1578 voyage. Moreover, the original black stone had been found by Garrard on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage, and according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of that rich ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there was none of it to be found'.|$|E
