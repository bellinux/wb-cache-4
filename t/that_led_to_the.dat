5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after its founding, the Khitan Empire began {{a process of}} territorial expansion, with Abaoji leading a successful conquest of Balhae. Later emperors would gain the Sixteen Prefectures by fueling a proxy war <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the Later Tang (923–936) and would establish tributary relationships with Goryeo and Song China after failing to conquer Goryeo.|$|E

5|$|Art has {{sometimes}} stimulated {{the development of}} mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of projective geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the public}} uproar over the U-2 Incident, which sparked a major Soviet-American {{diplomatic}} crisis <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the 1960 Paris Summit, most of the official celebrations for Tritons submerged circumnavigation were canceled. The voyage did receive extensive contemporary coverage by the news media, including feature magazine articles by Argosy, Life, Look, National Geographic, and the Saturday Evening Post as well as television and newsreels.|$|E

This was due to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cutting the vice president out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling that Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Germany was {{dependent}} on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany's oil supplies. This forced Hitler to call off Fall Grün, originally planned for 1 October 1938.

5|$|In 837, Theophilos {{raised him}} {{to the rank of}} patrikios and sent him {{together}} with the general Theophobos in a campaign against the Abasgians, but the Byzantines were defeated. With the death of Theophilos, the young Michael III (r. 842–867) ascended the throne. As he was only two years old, a regency council was set up headed by Theodora. Bardas and his brother Petronas, as well as their relative Sergios Niketiates, were also members, but it was the logothete Theoktistos who quickly established himself as Theodora's chief advisor. Bardas still played {{an active role in the}} early days of the regency, encouraging Theodora to abandon Iconoclasm for good and taking part in the investigations <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deposition of the pro-iconoclast patriarch John the Grammarian and the restoration of the veneration of icons in 843. In 844, however, Theoktistos blamed Bardas for the desertions <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Mauropotamos against the Abbasids, even though the logothete himself led the Byzantine army, and had him exiled from Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In September 1870, Garfield, who {{was then}} {{chairman}} of the House Banking Committee, led {{an investigation into the}} Black Friday Gold Panic scandal.
