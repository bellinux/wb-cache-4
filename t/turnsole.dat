5000|$|<b>Turnsole</b> {{became a}} {{mainstay}} of medieval manuscript illuminators starting {{with the development of}} the technique for extracting it in the thirteenth century, when it joined the vegetable-based woad and indigo in the illuminator's repertory. However, the queen of blue colorants was always the expensive lapis lazuli or its substitute azurite, ground to the finest powders. According to its method of preparation, <b>turnsole</b> produced a range of translucent colors from blue, through purple to red, according to its reaction to the acidity or alkalinity of its environment, in the chemical reaction, not understood in the Middle Ages, that is most familiar in the Litmus test.Folium ("leaf"), was actually derived from the three-lobed fruit (illustration), not the leaves. In the early fifteenth century, Cennino Cennini, in his Libro dell' Arte gives a recipe [...] "XVIII: How you should tint paper <b>turnsole</b> color" [...] and [...] "LXXVI To paint a purple or <b>turnsole</b> drapery in fresco." [...] (though neither of these recipes use or describe <b>turnsole).</b> Textiles soaked in the dye vat would be left in a close damp cellar in an atmosphere produced by pans of urine. It was not realized that the oxidizing urine was producing ammonia, but the technique reminds us how foul-smelling was the dyer's art.|$|E

50|$|Helios, having loved her, {{abandoned}} her for Leucothoe {{and left her}} deserted. She was so angered by his treatment that she told Leucothea's father, Orchamus, about the affair. Since Helios had defiled Leucothea, Orchamus had her put to death by burial alive in the sands. Clytie intended to win Helios back by taking away his new love, but her actions only hardened his heart against her. She stripped herself and sat naked, with neither food nor drink, for nine days on the rocks, staring at the sun, Helios, and mourning his departure. After nine days she was transformed into the <b>turnsole,</b> also known as heliotrope (which is known for growing on sunny, rocky hillsides), which turns its head always to look longingly at Helios' chariot of the sun. The episode is most fully told in Ovid, Metamorphoses iv. 204, 234-56.|$|E

30|$|Since Antiquity, purple {{has been}} {{associated}} with the colour produced by murex [16]. Dyeing molecules extracted from <b>turnsole,</b> called folium, corresponded well with the range of ancient purple. Another purple colour enjoyed some importance in medieval painting, a dye from lichen called orchil in English [25]. However, except for folium and orchil, the medieval purple was usually produced with mixtures of red and blue pigments [17, 18, 24]. At the end of chapter 62, Cennino Cennini mentioned that “if lapis lazuli stone was not so very good, or if you worked the stone up so much that the blue did not come out violet […] take a bit of punded kermes and a little brazil, cook them together”.|$|E

30|$|There are {{multiple}} reasons {{to investigate the}} reactivity of artists’ materials; for example, knowing what was used helps us appreciate the artistic intent, and understanding the chemistry of change allows acceptance of inevitable alteration, but also helps us to mitigate change due to factors we can control—such as storage and exhibition conditions, and adverse reactions to specific treatments. Although fading of fugitive colorants, for example, <b>turnsole,</b> eosine, or tartrazine, is notable and well known to conservators, other changes may be slow or be initiated by a specific chemical event, such as a change in water content or pH, and therefore the cause is less immediately recognizable. Investigating and understanding immediate or incipient change requires research into the fast and slow chemical reactions of inorganic and organic compounds, their response to light, humidity and pollutants, crystallographic changes, and also into the interactions among the chemical constituents of paint. Without knowledge of the original pigment’s color we cannot be sure if we are observing change, we are lacking information needed to understand the artist’s original intent, and {{it is challenging to}} specify suitable display conditions and/or treatment options.|$|E

Commonly called as Indian <b>Turnsole,</b> is a herb with slightly woody at base. The present study highlights the anti hyperglycemic activity of Methanolic extract of root of Heliotropium Indicum in Streptozotocin (60 mg/kg i. p) for 15 days and Alloxan (120 mg/kg i. p) for 21 days induced Diabetic rats. The anti hyperglycemic activity of oral administration of Methanolic extract of root of Heliotropium Indicum at 100 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg was investigated in diabetic rats. Glibenclamide 10 mg/kg, p. o was used as standard drug. The extract decreased the blood glucose level, feed and water intake as well as triacylglycerols at the three doses investigated while the best result was obtained at 500 mg/Kg for both STZ and Alloxan induced diabetic rats. In addition, the weight loss of diabetic-treated rats was markedly normalized at all doses. The glucose tolerance level of diabetic animals was effectively reduced to near normal level after 90 min of extract administration especially at the dose of 250 and 500 mg/Kg. Further, the Histopathological examination of pancreas supported the anti-Hyperglycemic activity of test extract.

40|$|AbstractSome studies {{published}} {{in recent years}} have presented students’ difficulties concerning concepts of acide and base (Banerjee, 1991; Drechsler and Schmidt, 2005; Hand, 1989; Lin, and Chiu, 2007; Nakhleh, 1994; Nakhleh and Karajcik, 1994; Ouertatani and Dumon, 2008; Ross and Munby, 1991; Schmidt, 1995; Toplis, 1998;…vb.). On the contrary, not comparative study between two countries has been led on the evolution in time of the level of mastering of these concepts according to knowledge to be taught. In order to understand the misconceptions better, we have examined school science curricula and textbooks so as to identify the intended development of the conceptualization of related concepts within school curricula. The knowledge to be taught for different levels is summarized as follows:For Turkish students;Grade 9 : To recognize the essential properties of the acids and the bases,Grade 11 :- To recognize the common properties of the acids and the bases and to give examples of the everyday life,- To define an acid and a base in the sense of Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, Lewis,- To define the concepts of pH and pOH,For French students;Grade 9 :-To classify some solutions or drinks according to their “acidity”. Grade 11 :-To define an acid and a base in the sense of Bronsted,-To recognize some acide/base couples and to recognize which one is acid and which one is base: H 30 +/H 2 O, H 2 O/HO-(aq), NH 4 +(aq) /NH 3 (aq), CH 3 CO 2 H(aq) /CH 3 CO 2 -(aq) The {{purpose of this study is}} to highlight the acquired knowledge and difference according to knowledge to be taught at the level of upper secondary school (grades 11 - 12) for both French and Turkish students. We propose in this study to identify in which extent received teaching allowed the passage of description of acids and bases resting on common sense to a scientific description and to release the ideas constructed by students. Data were collected by the researcher via three teachers from France and two teachers from Turkey before the relevant teaching was conducted, using a paper-and-pencil questionnaire that included four open-ended and two multiple-choice questions from 286 French students in Pau (128 grade 11 and 158 grade 12 students); and 242 Turkish students in Karabük (119 grade 11 and 123 grade 12 students). The analysis of answers has been done through calculating the rate of students considering their levels of understanding; range of key words, and from their comparison with the expected knowledge at the end of different levels of teaching. In this study, two countries students perceptions on acid and base concepts and theirs evolution in time were examined. Moreover, models used by them to represent these concepts were identified and their reasons to choice these models have been explained. The results showed that after received teaching French students defined acids and bases using Bronsted-Lowry model. However, Turkish students used Arrhenius model, few used Bronsted model and none of them used Lewis model. Therefore, Turkish students refer to empirical register to characterize acids and bases in their explications. Turkish students defined acids and bases by color change of <b>turnsole</b> paper and by conductivity of electricity. However, French students take the pH values into consideration...|$|E
