5|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> apply hair. The hair {{can either}} be done {{in one of two}} ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E
5|$|To {{qualify for}} {{recognition}} by the American Kennel Club, a national breed club must first be established and a written request needs {{to be sent to}} the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the general}} {{area of the}} {{battlefield}} has been identified <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> identify features {{that are associated with}} the battle and help define the overall battlefield landscape.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{convergence}} of the amplitude.|$|R
50|$|Following this, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> subwavelength cavity resonator.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> {{least squares}} channel {{estimation}} and zero-forcing equalization.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{prove that}} H2(E/F) is cyclic of order exactly |E/F|; the {{previous}} section shows that it has at most this order, so it is sufficient to find some element of order |E/F| in H2(E/F).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{draw the}} small-signal {{schematic}} for the amplifier with the two-port in place using the hybrid-pi {{model for the}} transistors. Figure 5 shows the schematic with notation R3 = RC2 // RL and R11 = 1 / g11, R22 = g22.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} whether it is due to primary lactase deficiency or an underlying disease that causes secondary lactase deficiency. Physicians should investigate the presence of undiagnosed coeliac disease, Crohn disease, or other enteropathies when secondary lactase deficiency is suspected and an infectious gastroenteritis has been ruled out.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York City in April 2010.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> educate {{both the}} rights holders and the duty bearers by {{articulating}} {{the rights of}} citizens and duty of the government. This {{is an important step}} so both parties are knowledgeable about their individual rights, responsibilities, and roles in society. This enables effective communication necessary between rights holders and duty bearers.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{recover the}} natural gas liquids (NGL) for which most large, modern gas {{processing}} plants use another cryogenic low temperature distillation process involving expansion of the gas through a turbo-expander followed by distillation in a demethanizing fractionating column. Some gas processing plants use lean oil absorption process rather than the cryogenic turbo-expander process.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> form a {{cylindrical}} hole through these layers. In practice, a 128Gibit V-NAND chip with 24 layers of memory cells requires about 2.9 billion such holes. Next the hole's inner surface receives multiple coatings, first silicon dioxide, then silicon nitride, {{then a second}} layer of silicon dioxide. Finally, the hole is filled with conducting (doped) polysilicon.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{search for}} {{contemporary}} {{sources in the}} archives, which is very costly in terms of time.|$|R
30|$|Now that we {{have these}} cluster centers, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> making <b>the</b> {{decision}} {{on the type of}} the modulation.|$|R

25|$|This {{estimation}} is used {{to conduct}} a pre-feasibility study to determine the theoretical economics of the ore deposit. This identifies, early on, whether further investment in estimation and engineering studies is warranted and identifies key risks and areas for further work. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the financial viability, the technical and financial risks, and the robustness of the project.|$|E
25|$|Once policy {{alternatives}} {{have been}} evaluated, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> decide which policy alternative should be implemented. This is shown as step 5 in Figure 1. At one extreme, comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple {{if all the}} policy goals can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting. In this case, the decision method {{is an exercise in}} benefit cost analysis (BCA).|$|E
25|$|Once {{the fire}} is built, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> light the tinder, using either an {{ignition}} device such as a match or a lighter. A reasonably skillful fire-builder using reasonably good material only needs one match. The tinder burns brightly, but be reduced to glowing embers within half a minute. If the kindling does not catch fire, the fire-builder must gather more tinder, determine what went wrong and try to fix it.|$|E

25|$|Future {{research}} is targeted at further understanding mutations {{and how they}} lead to MCAP and MPPH sydnromes. The majority of studies of megalencephaly have included mice who present brain abnormalities and overgrowth. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> move to clinical trials involving humans {{in order to determine}} the exact genetic mutation causing the sequences. Additionally, scientists and pharmaceutical companies have begun to show interest in mutation inhibition and designing preventative methods to eliminate the underlying cause of megalencephaly altogether.|$|E
25|$|In the {{conclusion}} of her exposition Diotima explains that men should make an ascent {{to arrive at the}} discovery of the Ideal Form of Beauty. Men should start with the love of a particular beautiful person. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pass from this particular instance to beauty in general, and from physical to moral beauty. The fourth step is to attain the love of wisdom, and then from this to the appreciation of the absolute and divine beauty (the Form of Beauty).|$|E
25|$|Detecting an aroma is {{only part}} of wine tasting. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{describe}} or communicate what that aroma is and it is in this step that the subjective nature of wine tasting appears. Different individuals have their own way of describing familiar scents and aromas based on their unique experiences. Furthermore, there are varying levels of sensitivity and recognition thresholds among humans of some aromatic compounds. This is why one taster may describe different aromas and flavors from another taster sampling the very same wine.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>steps</b> <b>are</b> {{to shrink}} <b>the</b> battery, develop more-efficient motors, and refine the bulky {{electrodes}} {{used to read}} electrical signals in muscles.|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} is to {{construct}} foundations of the large columns that will support the elevated roadway of the YBITS. Above-grade column reinforcing is constructed and enclosed by formwork and concrete is poured. After curing, the formwork is then removed. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> build the roadway itself. The spans were cast in place, using extensive reinforcing, with post-tensioned cable tendons. The roadways consist of hollow box structures, cast in place in sections using formwork, owing both to the complex shapes involved and the necessity of maintaining traffic flow on adjacent structures during construction.|$|E
25|$|Underground {{uranium mining}} is in {{principle}} {{no different from}} any other hard rock mining and other ores are often mined in association (e.g., copper, gold, silver). Once the ore body has been identified a shaft is sunk {{in the vicinity of the}} ore veins, and crosscuts are driven horizontally to the veins at various levels, usually every 100 to 150 metres. Similar tunnels, known as drifts, are driven along the ore veins from the crosscut. To extract the ore, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> drive tunnels, known as raises when driven upwards and winzes when driven downwards, through the deposit from level to level. Raises are subsequently used to develop the stopes where the ore is mined from the veins.|$|E
25|$|While {{dealing with}} crisis, both {{personal}} and societal, there are five basic principles outlined for intervention. Victims are initially {{at high risk for}} maladaptive coping or immobilization. Intervening as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims with the tools they need to return to some sort of order and normalcy, in addition to enable eventual independent functioning. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> facilitate understanding of the event by processing the situation or trauma. This is done in order to help the victim {{gain a better understanding of}} what has occurred and allowing him or her to express feeling about the experience. Additionally, the counselor should assist the victim(s) in problem solving within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing self-efficacy and self-reliance. Helping the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of assisting the victim to become self-reliant.|$|E
