5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.|$|E
5|$|The uprising's <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> fixed at 17 July, at 5:00p.m.; {{this was}} {{agreed to by}} {{the leader of the}} Carlists, Manuel Fal Condé. However, the <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> changed: the men in Spanish Morocco were to rise up at 5:00a.m. and those in Spain itself {{starting}} exactly a day later, so control of Spanish Morocco could be achieved and forces sent to Iberia from Morocco to coincide with the risings there. The rising was intended to be a swift coup d'état, but the government retained control of most of the country.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden's father {{wrote him}} to solicit the troupe {{to come to}} Odessa in Ukraine, which was then part of Imperial Russia. The <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> opportune: {{the end of the}} war meant that much of his best {{audience}} were now in Odessa rather than Bucharest; Rosenberg had already quit Goldfaden's troupe and was performing the Goldfadenian repertoire in Odessa.|$|E
50|$|Using a {{knock sensor}} {{to find the}} correct <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> one method used to tune an engine. In this method, the <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> {{advanced}} until knock occurs. The <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> then retarded one or two degrees and set there. After achieving the desired power characteristics for a given engine load/rpm, the spark plugs should be inspected for signs of engine detonation. If there are any such signs, the ignition <b>timing</b> should <b>be</b> retarded until there are none.|$|R
50|$|Descriptions {{are taken}} from the track list on the album cover. <b>Timings</b> <b>are</b> taken from the first edition's label, which uses take four of each side. Later editions have {{alternate}} takes of side two, and <b>timings</b> <b>are</b> not shown on the labels.|$|R
5000|$|The track <b>timings</b> <b>are</b> {{taken from}} the 1990 British release (RCA PL 74828).

5|$|Initially Broccoli and Saltzman {{had wanted}} to produce the eighth Bond novel, 1961's Thunderball, as the first film, {{but there was an}} ongoing legal dispute between the screenplay's co-author, Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming. As a result, Broccoli and Saltzman chose Dr. No: the <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> apposite, with claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had {{problems}} with rockets going astray.|$|E
5|$|The IAAF ratifies {{track and}} field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first {{published}} a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes {{were made in the}} late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if fully automatic electronic <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> made compulsory for all world record runs in {{track and field}}, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January 2014, the DA {{announced}} that Mamphela Ramphele had accepted {{an invitation to}} stand as its presidential candidate in the 2014 general election, and the DA and Agang South Africa were set to merge. On the 31st, Ramphele stated {{that she would not}} take up DA party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the DA's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> not right as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics.|$|E

40|$|The Advanced Photon Source {{consists}} of five accelerators. The injection timing system provides the signals required {{to cause a}} bunch emitted from the electron gun to navigate through intermediate accelerators to a specific bucket (1 out of 1296) within the storage ring. Two linacs and a positron accumulator ring operate at 60 Hz while a booster synchrotron ramps and injects into the storage ring at 2 Hz. The distributed, modular VME/VXI-based injection <b>timing</b> system <b>is</b> controlled by two EPICS-based input/output controllers (IOCs). Over 40 VME/VXI cards {{have been developed to}} implement the system. Card types range from 352 MHz VXI timing modules to VME-based fiber optic fanouts and logic translators/drivers. All <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> distributed with fiber optics. Timing references are derived directly from machine low-level rf of 9. 77 MHz and 352 MHz. The timing references provide triggers to programmable delay generators. Three grades of <b>timing</b> <b>are</b> provided. Precision <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> derived from commercial digital delay generators, intermediate precision <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> obtained from VXI 8 -channel digital delay generators which provide timing with 25 ns peak-to-peak jitter, and modest precision <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> provided by the APS event system. The <b>timing</b> system <b>is</b> fully integrated into the APS EPICS-based control system...|$|R

5|$|Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758. In 1845 Jane Hartley mortgaged {{the brewery}} to David Backhouse and John Hartley. In 1847, Samuel Smith of Leeds {{arranged}} {{for his son}} John to enter the business. Jane Hartley died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to help him. The <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's hard water proved to be well-suited for brewing the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together {{with the arrival of}} the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and by 1861 John Smith employed eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise.|$|E
5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E
5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At {{the beginning of}} 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to intervene personally in Ireland. He took a large army into south Wales, forcing the rebels who had held the area since 1165 into submission prior to sailing from Pembroke and landing in Ireland in October 1171. Some of the Irish lords appealed to Henry {{to protect them from}} the Anglo-Norman invaders, while de Clare offered to submit to Henry if he was allowed to retain his new possessions. Henry's <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> influenced by several factors, including encouragement from Pope Alexander, who saw the opportunity to establish papal authority over the Irish church. The critical factor though appears to have been Henry's concern that his nobles in the Welsh Marches would acquire independent territories of their own in Ireland, beyond the reach of his authority. Henry's intervention was successful, and both the Irish and Anglo-Normans in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} in Weekly Shōnen Jumps Naruto Anime Profiles Episodes 1-37, Masashi Kishimoto stated that he enjoys drawing Lee {{more than any other}} character in the series. When designing Lee's appearance, Kishimoto intended to have Lee wield a variety of weapons, including nunchaku; however, due to time constraints while creating the series, he was unable to do so. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, originally drew the author a draft of Lee's appearance. While the design highly changed from its draft to the original one when Kishimoto designed it, Yahagi felt pleased because some parts were kept. Kishimoto has noted that he originally designed Lee to symbolize human weakness; Kishimoto's design of Sakura Haruno was also intended to carry the same symbolism. Kishimoto was surprised by Lee's popularity within fans. He intended to write more about him but the <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> never right. Due to the popularity Lee garnered {{over the course of the}} series, Kishimoto tends to place him towards the front of promotional artwork in which he appears.|$|E
5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> {{based on the}} Egyptian civil calendar, {{which most of the}} time was far {{out of step with the}} astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E

5|$|The RSGS {{supported}} these proposals, {{as did the}} Royal Society of Edinburgh, the University of Edinburgh, {{and other}} Scottish organisations. However, the <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> wrong; the Royal Geographical Society in London was fully occupied with Captain Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, and showed no interest in Bruce's plans. No rich private benefactors came forward, and persistent and intensive lobbying of the government for financial backing failed. Bruce suspected that his efforts were, as usual, being undermined by the aged but still influential Markham. Finally accepting that his venture would not take place, he gave generous support and advice to Ernest Shackleton, who in 1913 announced plans, similar to Bruce's, for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Shackleton not only received £10,000 from the government, but raised large sums from private sources, including £24,000 from Scottish industrialist Sir James Caird of Dundee.|$|E
5|$|The new work, {{like its}} predecessor, {{attracted}} minimal readership. On 21 June 1791, {{just days after}} it was published, all attention became focused on King Louis XVI's ill-fated flight to Varennes, and Saint-Just's theories about constitutional monarchy were made suddenly irrelevant. Yet the episode had another effect – it fostered a public anger toward the king which simmered all year until finally a Parisian mob attacked the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792. In response, the Assembly declared itself ready to step down ahead of schedule {{and called for a}} new election, this one under universal male suffrage. The <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> excellent for Saint-Just, who turned the legal age of twenty-five {{before the end of the}} month. The fear inspired by the invasion of the Tuileries made most of his opponents retire from the scene, and Saint-Just was elected as one of the deputies for the département of Aisne. He left for Paris to join the National Convention as its youngest member.|$|E
25|$|According to tests {{conducted}} by the National Transportation Safety Board, the warning lights on the railroad crossing activated 20 seconds {{before the arrival of}} the Metra train. However, the traffic light clearing the rail intersection only allowed cars to clear 18seconds after the railway signals activated, giving vehicles only 2 to 6seconds to clear the tracks. Roadway signal <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> under the jurisdiction of IDOT, while railway <b>timing</b> <b>was</b> under the jurisdiction of Union Pacific. No communication took place between both parties with regards to interconnected signal timing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSocial groups {{frequently}} {{engage in}} activities, which involve coordination of timing between group members. In many such activities, success depends on tightly synchronised timing. In some cases, for example, in rowing eights, <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> not {{the goal of}} the endeavour, yet each individual participant's <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> still closely linked to the timing of the group. In other cases, for instance small music group performance, <b>timing</b> <b>is</b> an explicit goal of the activity. In this talk, I will review a number of examples of coordinated multi-person timing and consider the question: how do participants in a group adjust their timing to each other...|$|R
