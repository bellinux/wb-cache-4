5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
5|$|For a {{property}} {{to be eligible}} for the National Register, it must meet {{at least one of the}} four National Register main criteria. Information about architectural styles, association with various aspects of social history and commerce, and ownership are all integral parts of the nomination. Each nomination contains a narrative section <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> detailed physical description of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local, state, or national history. The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following.|$|E
5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} vibrato effect <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> small {{variation in pitch}} while a note is being played, and a chorus effect where a note's sound is combined with another sound at a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E

5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of {{hands-on}} techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E
5|$|Most fish {{exchange}} gases using gills {{on either}} side of the pharynx. Gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains a capillary network <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum.|$|E
5|$|The royalist armies {{that stayed}} in the Peruvian {{countryside}} headed to Lima, led by Canterac. In a confusing episode, there was no battle, as neither one attacked. Canterac changed his path to El Callao, took resources from it, {{and returned to his}} base. There was no battle during their return either. Without resources, El Callao surrendered in a few days. Both armies took inadvisable actions: San Martín allowed Canterac to receive reinforcements, and Canterac left a key military objective incapable to resist. There is no known documentation <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> reasonable explanation of those events.|$|E

5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter.|$|E
5|$|Though {{supported}} by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, {{the project was}} canceled after objections were raised. Native Alaskans in the area protested the threatened loss of nine villages that would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred the threatened flooding of the Yukon Flats, a large area of wetlands <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> critical breeding ground for millions of waterfowl. Fiscal conservatives opposed the dam {{on the grounds of}} its large cost and limited benefit to Americans outside Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Animals is {{the tenth}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 23 January 1977 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. It {{is a concept}} album <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late-1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. Animals was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that three years later would culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis.|$|E

5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high {{for a rare}} and endangered species, but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions {{as a barrier to}} the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of the}} river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.|$|E
5|$|North of the Lewiston village limits, NY18F is {{the closest}} roadway to the Niagara River, a trait {{reflected}} in its name of Lower River Road. As it progresses northward along the eastern bank of the river, NY18F parallels both the Niagara Scenic State Parkway and NY18. At Stella Niagara, NY18F meets Pletcher Road, the first road north of Lewiston <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> connection to all three roadways. NY18F continues on, passing through the western extent of Joseph Davis State Park south of the village of Youngstown {{in the town of}} Lewiston. In Youngstown, NY18F becomes Main Street and intersects the western terminus of NY93 in the village center. At the northern fringe of the community, NY18F intersects the southern entrance to the Fort Niagara State Park. NY18F bypasses the park, turning east onto Jackson Street, then north onto Lake Road as it follows the perimeter of the park.|$|E
5|$|The Electra {{communications}} package is a UHF software-defined radio (SDR) <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It {{is designed to}} communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E

5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fancast {{is awarded}} to the best non-professional audio or video {{periodical}} devoted to science fiction, fantasy, or related subjects. The fancast must have released four or more episodes {{by the end of}} the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that year, and it must not qualify for the dramatic presentation category. It must also not provide or be published by an entity <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> quarter or more of the income of any one person working on the fancast. The name of the award is a portmanteau of fan and podcast. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required to be repeated in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category, and will appear in all future years.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E
5|$|Until September 2009, The Isle of Sheppey was {{the only}} area in Kent to still have a middle school system. On the island, primary schools taught pupils from ages 4 to 9, middle schools 9–13 and {{secondary}} schools 13–18. Minster College in the neighbouring town of Minster {{was the only}} secondary school on the island. Sheerness had one middle school, Isle of sheppey Academy, with 800 pupils, although Danley Middle School and St George's Middle School were found in Halfway and Minster, respectively. In 2006, the Cheyne Middle School's Key Stage 2 performance ranked 322nd among Kent's 386 primary and middle schools. The town's primary schools are Richmond First School, Rose Street Primary School, St Edward's Roman Catholic Primary School and West Minster Primary School, all of which cover ages 4–11. Sheppey College, in Sheerness, is a branch of Canterbury College <b>that</b> <b>provides</b> <b>a</b> range of further education courses.|$|E
