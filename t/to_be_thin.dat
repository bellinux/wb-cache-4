40|$|Wishing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner</b> has <b>been</b> {{hypothesized}} <b>to</b> {{increase the}} risk of eating disorders. A growing amount of research has established the fact that this wish is already present in childhood, and highlights parents, peers and media as important conveyors of a socio-cultural body ideal, which may promote such a wish. This research has ben limited by the use of cross-sectional data. The present study aimed to extend this research by prospectively examine the prevalence, development, stability and gender differences in an early wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner,</b> as well as how psychosocial factors predict change in this wish from age 6 to 8 years. Data were obtained from a large community sample of 6 year olds (n= 795) and their parents, with a follow-up at age 8. Predictors included children's BMI, gender, appearance satisfaction, emotional overeating, parents' weight concern and media. The results showed that a substantial proportion of the children wished for a thinner figure, i. e. almost half of the children at age 6 and one third at age 8 whereas fewer wished for a larger figure, i. e. one in five and one in 10, respectively. Hence, a larger proportion was satisfied with their current weight at age 8 than at age 6. The wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>was</b> stronger among girls than boys at age 6. Further, the results showed a moderate stability in the wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner.</b> Growth factor modeling revealed that children's BMI, emotional overeating and apperance dissatisfaction predicted an increased wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner</b> from age 6 to 8, while gender and parents' weight concern had an indirect effect on change in this wish. Possible explanations for study findings are discussed in light of theories concerning sosial and cognitive development. Results suggest that prevention efforts targeting young children's body ideals as well as parents' preoccupation with weight might alleviate an early emerging wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner...</b>|$|R

25|$|Anorexia nervosa, often {{referred}} to simply as anorexia, is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, fear of gaining weight, and a strong desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> resulting in food restriction. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight {{even though they are}} in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.|$|E
25|$|Outcomes have {{generally}} indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The {{main reason for}} this detrimental effect {{is the issue of}} body image. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the social pressure <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, boys may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} thesis <b>were</b> <b>to</b> study: 1. {{reported}} eating attitudes, dieting behavior and body image over a 1 -year period among preadolescent girls (age 7 - 8); 2. differences in eating attitudes and coping between groups of teenage girls differing in dieting frequency, and to assess changes with increasing age (age 13 - 17); and 3. to what extent eating attitudes, self-esteem and coping predict disturbed eating attitudes. A final aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> explore differences in the reported wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner,</b> dieting, and eating attitudes between two age-matched cohorts of girls in 1995 and 1999 (7 - 15 years). The project is designed as a longitudinal prospective study, spanning seven years. 1300 girls in the ages (1995) 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 years have been assessed annually for three consecutive years (1995 - 1997) (Main Cohort). An additional group matched for age with the original group was recruited in 1999 (Societal Cohort). The results suggest that dieting and the wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner</b> starts as early as at 7 years of age, and that repeated dieting attempts correlate with disturbed eating attitudes. A marked increase of the wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>was</b> evident in the 10 - to 14 -year age range, and significant increases in dieting attempts occurred mainly between ages 9 and 13. There were no differences between 1995 (Main Cohort) and 1999 (Societal Cohort) (except among 7 and 11 -year-olds) with regard to dieting, the wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner</b> and disturbed eating attitudes.

Fairey Albacores of the Royal Navy dropped flares to illuminate targets for Vickers Wellington medium bombers and for the artillery; also, the minefields that were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thin</b> turned out to be deep. The British units covering the minefields were the two brigades of the 7th Armoured Division (7th Motor and 4th Armoured), whose orders were to inflict maximum casualties before retiring.

They included General Walther Nehring, the Afrika Korps commander, wounded in an air raid, and General Georg von Bismarck, commander of the 21st Panzer Division, killed by a mine explosion.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> examine the {{development}} and prediction of disturbed eating attitudes in girls aged 7 – 20 years. The four studies {{are part of a}} seven-year longitudinal project including 1279 girls in several age groups (7, 9, 11, 13, 15 years at inclusion) and their parents. Study I showed that among girls aged 11 and 13 years, in addition to a positive relation between disturbed eating attitudes and age, eating attitudes, higher BMI than peers, a less healthy relation to family, and fathers’ eating attitudes, predicted disturbed eating attitudes two years later. Study II demonstrated that girls aged 9 – 15 years, who wished <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner</b> dieted more often, thought that they would be more popular if they <b>were</b> <b>thinner,</b> <b>were</b> skipping meals more often and had a higher BMI, over five years, compared with the girls without such a wish. Study III demonstrated an increasing trend in the wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner</b> and dieting attempts between the ages of 9 and 18 years. Motives for wishing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>were,</b> e. g., “to feel better about yourself” and “to correspond to the societal ideal”. A majority of the girls adopted healthy weight control practices, but unhealthy and extreme methods were also used. In Study IV, among girls aged 9 and 13 years, a wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner,</b> fathers’ eating attitudes and mothers’ perfectionism contributed most to the prediction of disturbed eating attitudes seven years later. Protective factors were low BMI and more healthy eating attitudes moderated by high self-esteem, and low-to-medium degree of perfectionism. In conclusion a wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinner,</b> higher BMI than peers, girls’ and fathers’ disturbed eating attitudes, mothers’ perfectionism and a less healthy relation to family predict the development of disturbed eating attitudes in girls. Low BMI and more healthy eating attitudes especially influenced by high self-esteem, and a low-to-medium degree of perfectionism protect against it. The “thin-ideal” is internalized early in girls and it <b>is</b> important <b>to</b> take a critical stand against the thinness ideal in our society, especially in families, and schools.

500|$|In 1934, Mitchell and {{the design}} staff decided to use a semi-elliptical wing shape to solve two {{conflicting}} requirements. The wing needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> to avoid creating too much drag, while still able to house a retractable undercarriage, plus armament and ammunition. An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an untwisted wing, leading to the lowest amount of induced drag. The ellipse was skewed so that the centre of pressure, which occurs at the quarter-chord position, aligned with the main spar, thus preventing the wings from twisting. Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the Heinkel He 70, which first flew in 1932; but as Beverley Shenstone, the aerodynamicist on Mitchell's team, explained: [...] "Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section {{to that of the}} Heinkel. In any case it would have been simply asking for trouble to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose." ...|$|E

In particular, it is a dominant species in Eucalyptus woodland, especially when E.diversicolor, E.gomphocephala and E.marginata trees are present. M.regularis colonies do not form mounds, but rather nest in damp, black soil or under large stones and logs with 100 to 200 workers present.

2500|$|Anorexia nervosa {{has been}} {{increasingly}} diagnosed since 1950; the increase [...] {{has been linked}} to vulnerability and internalization of body ideals.

This trend can also be observed for people who partake in certain sports, such as jockeys and wrestlers. There is a higher incidence and prevalence of anorexia nervosa in sports with an emphasis on aesthetics, where low body fat is advantageous, and sports in which one has to make weight for competition. Family dynamics can play big part in the cause of anorexia.

[...] For example, the vineyards at San Juan del Oro in Tarija are at 8,850 feet amsl. [...] The largest vineyards are located at around 6,000 feet, however, due to logistical difficulties at higher elevations. [...] Given the proximity to the equator, thermoclines are higher, with a lower probability of freezing even on winter nights. [...] The structure of surrounding mountain peaks protects growing regions from seasonal cold fronts (surazos) and hailstorms that can damage plants. [...] Mountain air tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> cold and dry, yet solar radiation is stronger, passing through both warming radiation and intense ultraviolet light. [...] Due {{to the fact that}} mountain air cannot hold heat well, grapevines experience dramatic daily air temperature fluctuations. [...] Studies of altitude vineyards by CENAVIT and other organizations suggest that fruit subject to these conditions tends to produce greater concentrations of monoterpene aromatics held in a free state rather than sequestered as oils. [...] This is important as oils do not survive the distillation process. [...] The soil is fluvial erosion from surrounding peaks, well structured deep clay and sandy loam with good pitch and permeability. [...] Water is derived from snow melt and mountain rain directly from the adjacent peaks of Iscayachi.

2500|$|Besides {{the need}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thin,</b> young, and rich, {{there is also}} a weight {{prejudice}} within our society that is brought up in media, social settings, with friends, or even by parents. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. These high standards for women to follow and live up to mixed with the practical impossibilities of achieving such standards develops an attitude from women that thinness is extremely desirable. Even the average size of clothing women wear has changed drastically within the past decades, as a size 8 used to be considered small to average and is now nearly plus size. [...] Actress/Comedian Amy Schummer spoke out on the issue of size when she was featured in Glamour Magazine as a [...] "Plus Size Woman." [...] Upon the magazines publication, Schummer fired a tweet saying, [...] "I think there's nothing wrong with being plus size. Beautiful healthy women. Plus size is considered size 16 in America. I go between a size 6 and a 8." [...] Women who value this idea of having to be extremely thin and a size 2 or 4 have body dissatisfaction, and take part in cosmetic surgeries or weight loss behaviors (such as dieting) to try to become the standard that they so commonly see. The problem in which people, specifically women, are constantly comparing themselves to the people and images in the media leads to individuals believing they are more overweight than they actually are.|$|E
