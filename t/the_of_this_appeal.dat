50|$|Following <b>the</b> filing <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>appeal,</b> <b>the</b> American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) filed amicus briefs {{supporting}} Rubashkin′s {{appeal for}} a new trial. What has united the three groups is <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judge in {{the case with the}} prosecution, as argued by Rubashkin’s defense team, which, according to ACLU′s Iowa legal director Randall Wilson, “immediately gave <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> unfairness.” <b>The</b> ACLU brief says: “Mr. Rubashkin’s conviction should be vacated and he should get his ‘day in court,’ with a tribunal that is not an arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosecution. Due Process demands it. <b>The</b> Separation <b>of</b> Powers Doctrine demands it.” However, the ACLU still sees in Rubashkin someone who exploited illegal workers and underage labor, according to Wilson, but sees these as separate issues from <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> legal principle argued in its brief. Subsequent to <b>the</b> filing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appeal, the government, in a rare move, denied consent to <b>the</b> filing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three amicus briefs, and filed a Resistance with the Eight Circuit, attempting to block the court from accepting the brief.

50|$|Any punitive {{discharge}} adjudged by a Court-Martial {{is automatically}} reviewed {{by a military}} appellate court for each respective branch. These are <b>the</b> Army Court <b>of</b> Criminal Appeals (ACCA), Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA), Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCCA), and the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals (CGCCA). These courts are staffed by appellate military judges and function as an intermediate appellate court and {{have the power to}} review de novo both any questions of legal error and <b>the</b> factual basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conviction. If either the government or the accused is dissatisfied with <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>appeal,</b> <b>the</b> conviction or the sentence can be appealed to <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> Appeals for <b>the</b> Armed Forces (CAAF). This court has <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> discretionary review, in that it can in some cases deny a petition to grant a review. This court however must hear any death penalty cases or cases certified by the Judge Advocate General of each respective service for appellate review. Litigants before the CAAF can appeal to the United States Supreme Court. However, this right only applies to any case that the CAAF has reviewed. Therefore, in most military justice cases, the CAAF is <b>the</b> court <b>of</b> last resort since a denial of a petition of review by that court prevents higher appeal.|$|R

In this case, new proceedings would be launched and the case would be re-examined while Cassez remained in custody; (3) The verdict could be reconfirmed; Florence Cassez would have to serve her sentence.

50|$|Extensive losses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's {{food supply}} left tens of {{thousands}} of residents without sustenance, leading to fears of widespread hunger in the nation. In attempts to lessen <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hunger outbreak, the WFP set up over 200 shelters across the country and was estimated to be serving 50,000 people a day by June 9. On June 11, the United Nations made an appeal to supply Guatemala with $14.5 million to aid survivors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. <b>This</b> <b>appeal</b> followed a $34 million request for the country prior to the storm for malnutrition incidents.

500|$|The Guildford pub bombings {{occurred}} in 1974, when an IRA unit planted bombs in two pubs in Guildford, Surrey, {{and the resulting}} explosions killed four soldiers and one civilian, and injured 50 others. The investigation into the bombings led to the arrest and conviction of Gerard Conlon, Patrick Armstrong, Paul Hill and Carole Richardson, an Englishwoman; dubbed as [...] "the Guildford Four". The four were jailed for life in 1975 for the bombings, and each served 15 years in jail before their convictions were quashed by <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal.</b> <b>This</b> was due to an extensive inquiry carried out by Avon and Somerset Police into the original police investigation.

5|$|After Charles's death, {{the former}} Austrian {{imperial}} family were soon to move again. Alfonso XIII of Spain had approached the British Foreign Office via his ambassador in London, and {{they agreed to}} allow Zita and her seven (soon to be eight) children to relocate to Spain. Alfonso duly sent the warship Infanta Isabel to Funchal and this took them to Cadiz. They were then escorted to the Pardo Palace in Madrid, where shortly after her arrival Zita {{gave birth to a}} posthumous child, Archduchess Elisabeth. Alfonso XIII offered his exiled Habsburg relatives <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio in <b>the</b> Bay <b>of</b> Biscay. <b>This</b> <b>appealed</b> to Zita, {{who did not want to}} be a heavy burden to the state that harboured her. For the next six years Zita settled in Lekeitio, where she got on with <b>the</b> job <b>of</b> raising and educating her children. They lived with straitened finances, mainly living on income from private property in Austria, income from a vineyard in Johannisberg, and voluntary collections. Other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exiled Habsburg dynasty, however, claimed much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> money, and there were regular petitions for help from former Imperial officials.|$|R
50|$|After 1837, Delaroche stopped exhibiting {{his work}} altogether. The disappointing public {{reception}} of his painting, St. Cecilia, {{along with his}} overall rejection of Davidian values in French society and government led him to his “self-imposed exile from the government-sponsored Salons.” Delaroche then commenced <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> his most famous work, The Hemicycle, painted on a semicircular saloon at L’Ecole des Beaux-Arts. The Hemicycle was a 27-meter panoramic that included over seventy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most famous artists since Antiquity. The artists included represent Gothic, Greek, Roman, and Renaissance art. <b>The</b> subjects <b>of</b> <b>this</b> painting <b>appeal</b> to <b>the</b> academic taste <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth-century. Delaroche paints with encaustic mixtures to create this monumental piece—a technique in which pigment is mixed with hot wax and painted onto the plaster to create a smooth surface. Delaroche did not complete this project alone; four of his students assisted him and together they worked from 1837 to 1841. In 1855 the work was severely damage by fire and Delaroche spent <b>the</b> last year <b>of</b> his life restoring his work.

In 1959, <b>the</b> governments <b>of</b> Egypt and Sudan requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, <b>the</b> Director-General <b>of</b> UNESCO launched {{an appeal to the}} Member States for an International Campaign to Save <b>the</b> Monuments <b>of</b> Nubia. <b>This</b> <b>appeal</b> resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds <b>of</b> sites, <b>the</b> recovery <b>of</b> thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number <b>of</b> important temples, <b>the</b> most famous <b>of</b> which are <b>the</b> temple complexes <b>of</b> Abu Simbel and Philae.

40|$|After exoneration, some {{innocent}} individuals seek {{financial compensation}} {{and social services}} to aid with their reintegration into society. Since not all countries or jurisdictions have compensation legislation, exonerees are left with limited alternatives to address financial, psychological, and health issues that are often consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrongful conviction and incarceration. In common law jurisdictions, one compensation remedy is the application for ex gratia, ?out of grace? payments, for wrongful convictions. Australia is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few common law jurisdictions {{that do not have}} state or federal compensation statutes for exonerees, leaving ex gratia payments as the primary means to seek restitution. However, there are no guidelines to evaluate cases or allocate awards. Furthermore, ex gratia decisions are indisputable without <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b> <b>This</b> article reviews successful and unsuccessful ex gratia applications for wrongful conviction in Australia from 1985 to 2011 and examines the state's corresponding rationales for these decisions.
