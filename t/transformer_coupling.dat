5000|$|Each terminal, RT, BC, or BM, is {{connected}} to the bus through a stub, formed of a length of cable of the same type as the bus itself. MIL-STD-1553B defines two ways of coupling these stubs to the bus: <b>transformer</b> <b>coupled</b> stubs and direct <b>coupled</b> stubs. <b>Transformer</b> <b>coupled</b> stubs are preferred for their fault tolerance and better matching to the impedance of the bus, and consequent reduction in reflections, etc. The appendix to MIL-STD-1553B (in section 10.5, Stubbing) states [...] "The preferred method of stubbing is to use <b>transformer</b> <b>coupled</b> stubs… This method provides the benefits of DC isolation, increased common mode rejection, a doubling of effective stub impedance, and fault isolation for the entire stub and terminal. Direct coupled stubs… should be avoided if at all possible. Direct coupled stubs provide no DC isolation or common mode rejection for the terminal external to its subsystem. Further, any shorting fault between the subsystems sic internal isolation resistors (usually on a circuit board) and the main bus junction will cause failure of that entire bus. It can be expected that when the direct coupled stub length exceeds 1.6 feet meters, that it will begin to distort the main bus waveforms." ...|$|R

50|$|Grid-tie {{inverters}} include conventional low-frequency types with <b>transformer</b> <b>coupling,</b> newer high-frequency types, {{also with}} <b>transformer</b> <b>coupling,</b> and transformerless types. Instead of converting direct current directly into AC {{suitable for the}} grid, high-frequency transformers types use a computer process to convert the power to a high-frequency {{and then back to}} DC and then to the final AC output voltage suitable for the grid.|$|E
50|$|Circuits driving {{balanced}} lines must {{themselves be}} balanced {{to maintain the}} benefits of balance. This may be achieved by <b>transformer</b> <b>coupling</b> or by merely balancing the impedance in each conductor.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>transformer</b> <b>coupled</b> stub, {{the length}} of the stub cable should not exceed 20 ft, but this may be {{exceeded}} [...] "if installation requirements dictate." [...] The <b>coupling</b> <b>transformer</b> has to have a turns ratio of 1:1.41 ± 3.0 percent.

50|$|Another {{consequence}} {{is that since}} the output of one stage is often at ~100 V offset from the input of the next stage, direct coupling is normally not possible and stages need to be coupled using a capacitor or transformer. Capacitors have {{little effect on the}} performance of amplifiers. Interstage <b>transformer</b> <b>coupling</b> is a source of distortion and phase shift, and was avoided from the 1940s for high-quality applications; transformers also add cost, bulk, and weight.|$|E
50|$|A transformer-isolated {{amplifier}} {{relies on}} <b>transformer</b> <b>coupling</b> of a high-frequency carrier signal between input and output. Some models {{also include a}} transformer-isolated power supply, that may {{also be used to}} power external signal processing devices on the isolated side of the system. The bandwidth available depends on the model and may range from 2 to 20 kHz. The isolation amplifier contains a voltage-to-frequency converter connected through a transformer to a frequency-to-voltage converter. The isolation between input and output is provided by the insulation on the transformer windings.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Atherton had been {{approached}} by the water sector to examine some challenges with large diameter pre-stressed pipe rupturing, along with corrosion on the pre-stressing wires. Atherton was asked {{to act as an}} international expert in pipeline inspection technology to determine if something could be done to inspect the distressed water pipe. From there, Atherton began research and developed a new technology called Remote Field <b>Transformer</b> <b>Coupling</b> (RFTC). RFTC offered water supply system managers information on the location, distribution and number of wire breaks in their pipeline infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{machines}} with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current {{on either side}} of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the <b>transformer</b> <b>coupled</b> magnetic core flux density, which would otherwise lead to core saturation.|$|R

50|$|These {{speakers}} {{were mostly}} of sufficient quality that the radio's characteristics become significant. <b>Transformer</b> <b>coupled</b> sets suffered loss of bass & reduced treble, grid leak sets where rf and af were amplified {{by the same}} valve gave some nonlinearity, and output stages always provided a little more non-linearity. However {{the quality of a}} moving coil equipped set can be pleasant, and mistakable for a modern portable radio.|$|R
50|$|Soft {{clipping}} is {{also not}} a product of lack of feedback alone: Tubes have different characteristic curves. Factors such as bias affect the load line and clipping characteristics. Fixed and cathode-biased amplifiers behave and clip differently under overdrive. The type of phase inverter circuitry can also affect greatly on softness (or lack of it) of clipping: long-tailed pair circuit, for example, has softer transition to clipping than a cathodyne. The coupling of the phase inverter and power tubes is also important, since certain types of coupling arrangements (e.g. <b>transformer</b> <b>coupling)</b> can drive power tubes to class AB2, while some other types can't.|$|E
50|$|Time Compression Multiplexing (TCM) is the {{standard}} communication protocol used by Nortel digital telephones on a 2-wire tip and ring circuit. Each digital phone line terminates at a station port on a Digital Voice Card (DVC) in the PBX. The circuit interface operates by a <b>transformer</b> <b>coupling</b> which provides foreign voltage protection between the TCM loop and the digital line. The maximum length of a normal TCM loop is 300 m (1000 ft.) Minimum voltage at telephone 10 V DC and a TCM port should have between 15 and 20 V DC across the Tip and Ring with the phone disconnected. The port connection may be through a Punch-down block or a Modular connector called a TELADAPT plug (or socket) which is Nortel parlance for phone connector.|$|E

5000|$|An {{ideal gyrator}} {{is similar to}} an ideal {{transformer}} in being a linear, lossless, passive, memoryless two-port device.

50|$|In 2006 Røde was {{approached}} by sound engineer Bruce Jackson to design a microphone system {{that could be used}} as the primary podium microphone for the Asian Games that year in Doha. The microphone has since appeared at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver,2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore, 2011 Pan-Arab Games in Doha, 2011 Rugby World Cup in Auckland, 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in London, and at the Olympics and Paralympics in Rio in 2016. Røde’s engineers designed the microphone system with two discrete microphone capsules in order to offer a high level of redundancy. The first capsule in the microphone stem sends audio directly to the broadcaster’s main digital audio network, using Røde designed preamps that are fed phantom power from an Optocore fibre network device. The second capsule is connected to a custom wireless system that is housed inside the actual lectern. This wireless system contains an RF transmitter, phantom power supply and <b>transformer</b> <b>coupling</b> amongst other components. The output is available both in analogue form, and sent to the analogue backup portion of the main audio system. It is also available in modulated RF format that is received by a radio mic receiver (or receivers) beneath the stage, and at the front-of-house (FOH) position. Originally three microphones were built, with one of these later being converted to a floor-standing unit.|$|E

The effective shunt impedance is altered by the transformer turns ratio and the coupling coefficient. It is not necessary to use a crystal, since any resonant circuit with a high Q can be used. ...|$|R
