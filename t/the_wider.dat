Originated from the basic concept of <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area relaying protection, this paper analyses the advantages, the effects and the functions of <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area relaying protection. The two main approaches to realize <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area protection, which are on-line adaptive setting (OAS) principle and fault element identification (FEI), are introduced in this paper. Aimed at improving the performance of the backup protection, the research content and the technology demand of <b>the</b> <b>wide</b> area protection are proposed, meanwhile, the basic principle and the algorithm of the fault element identification are introduced. At last, the scheme of <b>the</b> limited <b>wide</b> area relaying protection based on the existing pilot channel of the main protection is discussed.|$|R
