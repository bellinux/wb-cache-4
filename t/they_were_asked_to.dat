The three-piece band consisted of Reznor on guitars and lead vocals, Ron Musarra on drums, and Chris Vrenna on keyboards. The band was poorly received, however, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> leave the tour after 10 dates. After the Skinny Puppy tour the band was rearranged and expanded to include a fourth member; Musarra departed and Vrenna moved to drums, Gary Talpas, Nick Rushe, and later David Hymes contributed on keyboards, while Richard Patrick was added as guitarist.|$|E

Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event.

There is happily no chance of our aristocracy having to meet such a fate in this loyal-hearted, law-abiding, sober-minded country. <b>They</b> <b>are,</b> however, <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> discharge a certain obligation. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> contribute their share to the expenses of the State.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study of}} Richards and Gross (1999) and Tiwari (2013), {{participants}} viewed slides of injured men that produced increases in negative emotions, while information concerning each man was presented orally with his slide.

As predicted by the researchers, suppressors showed significantly worse performance on a memory test for the orally presented information.|$|E
