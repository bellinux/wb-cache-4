Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt he was miscast in a role previously played by both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin: [...] "Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role." [...] Affleck had an [...] "amazing experience" [...] making the thriller Changing Lanes (2002), and later cited Roger Michell as someone he learned from as a director.
