5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E

40|$|Acute {{fluroxene}} {{treatment of}} male Wistar rats decreases <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P- 450 and haem, increases {{the activities of}} hepatic δ-aminolaevulinate synthase and haem oxygenase, and increases <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of haem precursors (δ-aminolaevulinate and porphobilinogen) in the urine. All of the above effects of fluroxene are enhanced by pretreatment of the experimental animals with 3 -methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital. <b>The</b> <b>amounts</b> of porphyrins in the urine and faeces were generally unaffected by acute fluroxene treatment of uninduced or 3 -methylcholanthrene- or phenobarbital-induced Wistar rats. 2, 2, 2 -Trifluoroethyl ethyl ether, the saturated analogue of fluroxene, did not affect <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 and haem, <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> {{of any of the}} haem precursors in the urine or faeces, or the activity of hepatic haem oxygenase in phenobarbital-induced male Wistar rats. <b>The</b> <b>amounts</b> of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 and haem and of the haem precursors in urine and faeces, and the activity of δ-aminolaevulinate synthase, were generally not altered by acute fluroxene treatment of uninduced male Long–Evans rats. Chronic treatment of Wistar rats with fluroxene resulted in small increases in <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of δ-aminolaevulinate and porphyrins in urine. <b>The</b> <b>amounts</b> of porphobilinogen in urine were elevated up to 2000 %, whereas <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of <b>the</b> porphyrins in faeces were generally unaffected. After chronic fluroxene treatment, the activity of δ-aminolaevulinate synthase was increased, whereas the activity of uroporphyrinogen synthase was decreased. It is concluded that acute fluroxene treatment may affect haem biosynthesis and degradation by a mechanism similar to allylisopropylacetamide, namely by stimulating an atypical cytochrome P- 450 -dependent pathway for haem degradation. The effects of chronic fluroxene treatment on haem biosynthesis may be a consequence of this mechanism or a result of the inhibition by fluroxene of uroporphyrinogen synthase. Chronic fluroxene treatment of male rats affects the haem biosynthetic pathway {{in a manner similar to}} that seen in human genetic acute intermittent porphyria...|$|R
