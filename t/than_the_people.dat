25|$|The cult {{success of}} the series won it the BAFTA for Best Drama Series in 1998. It was notable for {{featuring}} comic characters and sub-plots that lent a lot of humour to the series. Unusually, it was produced by the BBC's in-house Entertainment department rather than the Drama department – this was because Renwick preferred working with people he knew rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> at Drama who might not share his vision. It has included guest-stars such as Bob Monkhouse, Griff Rhys Jones, Rik Mayall, Jack Dee, Bill Bailey, John Bird and Nigel Planer; who are mainly associated with comedy, but who gave straight performances.|$|E
25|$|A {{special case}} of {{geographical}} names were those {{derived from a}} building or landmark, e.g. a Busch (bush) or Springborn (spring/well). Before the advent of street names and numbers, even for long times afterwards, many important buildings like inns, mills and farmsteads were given names (see also Der Lachs zu Danzig). Such a place was often better known <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> living in it; the people would get their 'family' name from the building. This name could be combined with a profession: Rosenbauer (rose-farmer, from a farmstead called 'the rose'); Kindlmüller (child's miller, from a mill named 'the Christmas child', 'the prodigal child' or 'the king's child'). The name of the building {{could also be used}} as is: Bär (Bear); Engels (from Engel, angel).|$|E

25|$|Although the city's {{administration}} was firmly controlled by oligarchs, democratic elements {{were to be}} found as well: Carthage had elected legislators, trade unions and town meetings {{in the form of}} a Popular Assembly. Aristotle reported in his Politics that unless the Suffets and the Council reached a unanimous decision, the Carthaginian popular assembly had the decisive vote— unlike the situation in Greek states with similar constitutions such as Sparta and Crete. Polybius, in his History book 6, also stated that at the time of the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian public held more sway over the government <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Rome held over theirs (a development he regarded as evidence of decline).

500|$|The {{episode was}} marketed as an {{important}} milestone in television history {{because it was the}} debut of the first television show with an all Latina leading cast. However, {{in the days leading up}} to the debut, there was controversy surrounding the concept of having Latina actresses glorify the stereotypical roles of maids, nannies and gardeners. On May 3, Tanisha Ramirez criticized the show in The Huffington Post as a wasted opportunity, but executive producer Longoria countered that the show presents [...] "modern day woman's view on universal themes." [...] Cosmopolitan for Latinas editor Michelle Herrera Mulligan responded to Longoria by calling the show an [...] "insulting disgrace". Cherry defended the show for its substantive themes: [...] "Devious Maids deals with themes of racism, classism and immigration.

500|$|Fuller readily agreed, having focused {{much of his}} {{own career}} on racial issues. Already {{familiar}} with the novel and {{with the concept of}} [...] "white dogs," [...] he was tasked with [...] "reconceptualizing" [...] the film to have the conflict depicted in the book occur within the dog rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> In an earlier Variety magazine interview, Fuller stated that viewers would [...] "see a dog slowly go insane and then come back to sanity." [...] Before filming began, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Black Anti-Defamation Coalition (BADC), and other civil-rights leaders began voicing concerns that the film would spur racial violence. In an editorial in the Los Angeles Times, Robert Price, executive director of the BADC, criticized the studio for producing the film based on a book by a white man and using a primarily white cast and crew, rather than producing the film with African Americans in key positions. He also considered Gary's work to be a [...] "second-rate novel" [...] and questioned its use when [...] "bookshelves are laden with quality novels by black writers who explore the same social and psychological areas with far more subtlety?" ...|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{declared}} that [...] "Cheek to Cheek {{is a record}} where the music and even the songs take a backseat to the personalities". Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave the album a rating of two out of five stars. Camp criticized Bennett and Gaga's vocals in the album, adding that [...] "If not for the session musicians' top-notch work... much of Cheek to Cheek, which drags at an economical 45 minutes, would sound like glorified karaoke." [...] San Francisco Chronicle writer Aidin Vaziri was disappointed with Bennett and Gaga not [...] "highlight each other's wildly distinguishing features", adding that [...] "the background music is far more exciting <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> singing over it". Mikael Wood from Los Angeles Times complimented Gaga's vocals in the album but panned her [...] "cheap exploitation: {{of a bunch of}} important songs she brings nothing to; of an 88-year-old legend with whom she has zero chemistry; and, most disappointingly, of our eagerness to follow her down an unlikely creative path." [...] At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015, Cheek to Cheek won a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.|$|E
500|$|Jarrold {{sought to}} make Becoming Jane [...] "look and feel" [...] {{realistic}} [...] "so everything is not lit in a very glamorous Hollywood way." [...] According to him, [...] "One of the key ideas in the film was {{to get away from}} the old, stuffy costume drama kind of feel of what Jane Austen is and to look at somebody before she becomes a genius, when she is in her early twenties and on the verge of writing her great thing; she had a real exuberance for life, intelligent and independent and a sort of outsider in rural Hampshire, more intelligent <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> around her and kicking against all those pressures." [...] To further set his film apart from other costume dramas, American actress Anne Hathaway was cast as the title character. A fan of Jane Austen since she was fourteen, Hathaway immediately began rereading Austen's books, conducting historical research including perusing the author's letters, and also learned sign language, calligraphy, dance choreography, and playing the piano. She moved to England a month before production began to improve her English accent, and attempted to stay in character throughout filming, the first time she had done so for a movie.|$|E

500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E

2500|$|Cage {{returned}} to the United States in 1931. He went to Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art. He got to know various important figures of the Southern California art world, such as pianist Richard Buhlig (who became his first teacher) and arts patron Galka Scheyer. By 1933 Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting. [...] "The people who heard my music had better {{things to say about}} it <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who looked at my paintings had to say about my paintings", Cage later explained. In 1933 he sent some of his compositions to Henry Cowell; the reply was a [...] "rather vague letter", in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold Schoenberg—Cage's musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25-tone row, somewhat similar to Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil.|$|E

One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other." [...] On 17 March 1966, the Herald offered the view that: [...] "It was not his [...] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project .... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step .... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along." ...|$|E
