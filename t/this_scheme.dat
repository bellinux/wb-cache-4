On 1 March 2014, <b>this</b> <b>scheme</b> was extended to include privately owned two-axle goods vehicles. A further option was introduced giving unlimited free crossings for £20 annually.

5|$|In 1991, in {{an attempt}} to rectify this, the Ready Reserve scheme was established.

The majority of the personnel were Reservists who undertook a period of twelve months full-time service before returning to normal Reserve status for a further four years. The scheme showed considerable promise. Nevertheless, due to cost constraints it was abolished in 1996 by the newly elected Howard government.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In recent years, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is {{more and}} more popular. However, there are many {{security}} problems in the Session Initiation Protocol. In 2005, Yang et al. [2] proposed a secure authentication scheme for Session Initiation Protocol. <b>This</b> authentication <b>scheme</b> is based on Diffe-Hellman [9] concept, so the computation cost of <b>this</b> authentication <b>scheme</b> is very high. In order to improve this shortcoming, Durlanik et al. [1] also proposed an authentication Scheme using ECDH in 2005. However, the computation cost of <b>this</b> authentication <b>scheme</b> is still very high. In this paper, we propose an efficient noncebased authentication scheme. The computation cost of <b>this</b> authentication <b>scheme</b> is lower than Yang et al. ’s authentication scheme and Durlanik et al. ’s authentication scheme, and it is very suitable for low computation power equipment...|$|R

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>scheme</b> {{can be seen}} as a {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are chosen by the electorate to represent their concerns and needs in Parliament. Secondly, the Prime Minister, who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs, and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs, effectively represent the views of the electorate as he heads the Government. The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation.|$|E

In 1908, the Met joined <b>this</b> <b>scheme,</b> which included maps, joint publicity and through ticketing. UD signs were used outside stations in Central London. Eventually the UERL controlled all the underground railways except the Met and the Waterloo & City and introduced station name boards {{with a red}} disc and a blue bar. The Met responded with station boards with a red diamond and a blue bar.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} {{improvement of the}} constant V/f control induction motor drive is proposed. <b>This</b> proposed <b>scheme</b> fully compensates for the stator resistance voltage drop by vectorially modifying the stator voltage and keeping {{the magnitude of the}} stator flux constant. The simple slip frequency compensation, based on an estimation of the air-gap power and a linear torque-speed approximation, is also introduced. This method reduces the steady-state speed error to almost zero. The nameplate data and only the stator resistance are required in <b>this</b> control <b>scheme.</b> The validity of <b>this</b> control <b>scheme</b> is verified by simulation results...|$|R
5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War reinforced the economic viability of <b>this</b> <b>scheme.</b> Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} classification, {{introduced by}} B. J. Gladman, B. G. Marsden and C. Van Laerhoven in 2007, uses 10-million-year orbit integration {{instead of the}} Tisserand parameter. An object qualifies as an SDO if its orbit is not resonant, has a semi-major axis no greater than 2000 AU, and, during the integration, its semi-major axis shows an excursion of 1.5 AU or more. Gladman et al. suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility. If the object is not an SDO as per the above definition, but the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0.240, it is classified as a detached TNO. (Objects with smaller eccentricity are considered classical.) In <b>this</b> <b>scheme,</b> the disc extends from the orbit of Neptune to 2000 AU, the region {{referred to as the}} inner Oort cloud.|$|E

Plans were probably made to establish a castle and walled settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey – the future Beaumaris – but were postponed due to the costs of the other projects.|$|E
