5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, {{in which the}} object is to place your {{opponent}} on a stretcher and wheel <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> across a finish line. The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> and tried to wheel him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto <b>the</b> <b>stretcher.</b> Van Dam wheeled <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on <b>the</b> <b>stretcher.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was the condition of <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, {{which resulted in the}} loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. <b>The</b> <b>stretcher</b> bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was between Rey Mysterio and Finlay, voted by the fans to be a Stretcher match. Finlay managed to {{retrieve}} his shillelagh and attacked Mysterio's legs. Mysterio fought back and performed the 619 on Finlay, sending him onto <b>the</b> <b>stretcher.</b> Mysterio then performed a senton and pushed Finlay {{over the line}} for the win.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the effect on rower posture of raising <b>the</b> <b>stretchers.</b> Nine male university rowers completed a single 30 -s trial at each of three stretcher heights on an ergometer, at 30 strokes min- 1. The first ten strokes with complete data were averaged and data for four time points during the stroke extracted: catch, mid-drive, finish, and mid-recovery. Ankle angle was shown to increase significantly at all points during the stroke (P< 0. 01) as <b>the</b> <b>stretchers</b> were raised. Knee angle was only significantly increased into a more extended posture at mid-drive (P< 0. 05) and mid-recovery (P< 0. 01) for <b>the</b> higher <b>stretcher</b> positions, hip angle was significantly reduced into a more flexed posture at the catch (P< 0. 05) and at mid-recovery (P< 0. 05), and the trunk was significantly extended at the catch (P< 0. 01), finish (P< 0. 01), and mid-recovery (P< 0. 05) as <b>the</b> <b>stretchers</b> were raised. Our results show that <b>the</b> increase in <b>stretcher</b> height caused <b>the</b> rower's body to rotate posteriorly in the sagittal plane. This we suggest reduced the vertical component of stretcher force, thus achieving a more mechanically effective position, which could have led to the slower rate of fatigue reported previously for <b>the</b> two raised <b>stretcher</b> positions (Caplan & Gardner, 2005). The increased flexion of the hip should not be ignored, however, as this may lead to overstretching of the hip extensors if <b>the</b> <b>stretchers</b> are raised too high. Further research is required {{to determine the extent to}} which <b>the</b> <b>stretchers</b> can be raised in on-water rowing...|$|R

5|$|Batista and Orton {{decided to}} work {{together}} to assault Bryan, and the original referee returned to the match. At ringside, Batista threw Bryan down with a Batista Bomb onto the Spanish announce table, while Orton immediately combined with an inverted version of his signature RKO maneuver. As both Bryan and Orton were sent through the Spanish announce table, only Batista emerged unscathed. Medical personnel arrived and carted Bryan away on a stretcher. Batista attacked Orton, who retaliated with a DDT onto the floor. Suddenly, Bryan got off <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> and crawled back to the ring, where he was set upon by Orton.|$|E
5|$|London {{then began}} a tag team with Billy Kidman on January 29, 2004. On the July 8 episode of SmackDown!, the duo won the WWE Tag Team Championship from the Dudley Boyz. They defended the title against the Dudleys and the Basham Brothers on several {{occasions}} before losing the championship to René Duprée and Kenzo Suzuki on September 9, due to Kidman leaving London to fight by himself. Kidman's heel turn led to a feud between the two, which culminated at No Mercy where Kidman defeated London with a shooting star press. After the match, London was bleeding from the mouth and being stretchered when Kidman pulled {{him back into the}} ring with <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> and delivered another shooting star press to London's injured ribs. This storyline was put in place after London had broken his nose wrestling Booker T and needed time off to recuperate. London returned on November 25, wrestling on Velocity {{until the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. <b>The</b> <b>stretcher</b> especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{construct}} compressors and stretchers. However, a typical Ti:sapphire-based chirped-pulse amplifier requires that the pulses are stretched to several hundred picoseconds, which means that the different wavelength components must experience about 10cm difference in path length. The most practical way to achieve this is with grating-based stretchers and compressors. Stretchers and compressors are characterized by their dispersion. With negative dispersion, light with higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) takes less time to travel through the device than light with lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). With positive dispersion, it is the other way around. In a CPA, the dispersions of <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> and compressor should cancel out. Because of practical considerations, <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> is usually designed with positive dispersion and the compressor with negative dispersion.|$|E
25|$|Pryor reached D Company, whose commander, Captain G. O. O'Day, {{immediately}} set {{out with}} Lieutenant A. R. Avery's 16 Platoon. Avery found Honner, {{covered in blood}} and black ants.

Instead, he used Avery's radio to arrange an attack on the banana plantation by A, C and D Companies, which was delivered at 18:00. While the fighting was going on, <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> bearers tended to Honner's wounds, and carried him back. Seven Australians were wounded in the action, including Honner, who was flown out from Gusap the next day; 26 Japanese soldiers were killed, and one, wounded, was taken prisoner. Water was found in the A Company area, although some was also sent forward by jeep. The wounded, including Honner, were taken to the dressing station at Kaigulan II by jeep. The last one did not arrive until after midnight.|$|E

25|$|From now onwards the 1st Parachute Brigade fought {{as normal}} {{infantry}} and 16 PFA on Christmas Eve {{set up a}} Main Dressing Station (MDS) at Medjez el Bab. On 2 February the 1st Parachute battalion assaulted Djebel Mansour mountain with No. 1 Section attached. The ground was unsuitable for vehicles and the section could only take what they could carry by hand. The terrain also hindered casualty evacuation and it took ten hours, to bring the wounded from the front line to the medical post, by which time <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> bearers could go no further. In the situation Lieutenant-Colonel MacEwan, brought the remainder of 16 PFA forward {{to assist with the}} wounded, No.4 Section being sent to the top of Djebel Mansour.

25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} small brown stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from <b>the</b> <b>stretcher</b> to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|E
25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, {{seated at a}} table with a cup of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of <b>the</b> <b>stretcher.</b> The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off to her right, with some reflected light {{on the left side of}} her face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E
