500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. I always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|Muransky is also {{remembered for}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the 1983 film The Big Chill: [...] "I was in the theater watching it, not knowing {{what was going to}} happen. It was kind of interesting with all of (the characters) watching (the 1980 Michigan-Michigan State game). It was pretty cool. Watching [...] John Wangler go back was pretty cool. For a split-second as they're going back, I'm <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Oh my God, I pray to God I'm not holding or I missed a block for a sack or something on the big screen pass.' But it was a good block, and it was a fun moment. Any time I hear 'The Big Chill,' it's good memories." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Middle," [...] {{the second}} single from the album, {{includes}} a guitar solo that, according to Adkins, [...] "is {{a tribute to}} Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices". Its lyrics speak about [...] "fitting in" [...] and self-acceptance of oneself. In turn, [...] "Sweetness" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that Adkins had more doubts about because of its lyrical content: [...] "I just had this melody in my head and I was demoing it and singing it and kind of having a hard time with it. I almost didn’t bring it to the band because I was <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> ’I can’t just say nothing. I can’t just use all these sort of alyrical whoahs for this much of a song.’" ...|$|E

No--he would not care for it. He would ask what it was good for, and what could I answer? for if it was not GOOD for something, but only beautiful, merely beautiful-- ...|$|R
60|$|I {{sat there}} long in my misery, <b>thinking</b> it over <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> I didn't {{know what to}} do. I couldn't go and confide to Aunt Emma's ear this new and horrible doubt,--which was no doubt after all, for I KNEW it was impossible. I hated Jane for {{suggesting}} it; I hated her for telling me. Yet I couldn't be left alone. I was far too terrified.|$|R
500|$|... "Revolver" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Carlos Battey, Steven Battey, Lil Wayne, Justin Franks and Brandon Kitchen, and {{produced}} by Madonna and DJ Frank E. In an interview with Hiphopupdate.com, Frank E recalled that {{he had gone to}} the recording session two hours before his scheduled meeting with Madonna to set up and give the audio files to the recording engineer, and he said that the ensuing wait was incredibly nerve-racking for him. After Madonna arrived, they recorded her vocals and the song was finished the next day. [...] Reminiscing about the session, he said: [...] "I will never forget the feeling of leaving that session after vocal producing Madonna, and <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'It can’t it really get any harder than this.' I've taken that mentality into every other session I've been in, and it's helped me make the session and song more of a success. Unfortunately, the mix sounded like crap and the song flopped, but hey, you win some and you lose some." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Swift became {{interested}} in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her [...] "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure {{that she needed to}} go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since [...] "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> I need {{to figure out a way}} to be different".|$|E
500|$|Muransky was {{selected}} in the fourth round (82nd pick) by the Oakland Raiders in the 1982 NFL Draft, and he played in 24 games for the Raiders from 19821984. The Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles to play the 1982 NFL season. Thus, although he was drafted by the Oakland Raiders, he played his NFL career with the Los Angeles Raiders. In his second season in the NFL, he won a Super Bowl ring with the Raiders' 1983 Super Bowl Championship team. He played all 16 regular season games for Tom Flores' Raiders that season. The team went 124 during the 1983 NFL season and produced eight Pro Bowlers. [...] Muransky played for an offensive line that included Pro Bowlers Henry Lawrence and Todd Christensen. The team was led that season by quarterback Jim Plunkett and future Hall of Famer Marcus Allen, who rushed for nine touchdowns, caught two and threw three on a 47 passing performance. Muransky described the Super Bowl experience as a [...] "whirlwind" [...] with [...] "two weeks of hype like you've never seen." [...] He recalled: [...] "It {{was a big deal}} because offensive linemen weren't making what they make today. That year, I made $77,000, which was a pretty decent contract at the time. But if you won the Super Bowl, you won $64,000. So it wasn't peanuts. I remember walking off the field after that, <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'I have a Super Bowl ring {{for the rest of my}} life.'" [...] Although Muransky was cut in for a Super Bowl gameshare, he was not on the official gameday roster.|$|E

2500|$|Stevens {{contracted}} tuberculosis in 1969 and {{was close}} to death {{at the time of}} his admittance to the King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, West Sussex. He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of convalescence. During this time Stevens began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, [...] "to go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about <b>myself.</b> It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut." ...|$|R
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joey Ramone stated [...] "I {{spent most}} of the early 70s {{listening}} to Slade Alive! <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Wow – this is what I want to do. I want to make that kind of intensity for myself. A couple of years later I was at CBGB's doing my best Noddy Holder." [...] Steve Jones of Sex Pistols stated [...] "Slade never compromised. We always had the feeling that they were on our side. I don't know but I think we were right." [...] NME commented on Slade's legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, [...] "They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill's pudding bowl haircut. As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock's bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect." [...] In 1981, Adam and the Ants' lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} Lenihan {{claimed the}} European Central Bank forced Ireland into taking a bailout and rejected claims by a senior ECB figure {{that the bank}} warned Ireland in mid-2010 of the dangers it faced. He has also accused members of the ECB executives of briefing against Ireland and of [...] "betrayal". Lenihan criticised some of the 17 governing board members of the bank for the [...] "damaging" [...] {{manner in which they}} had briefed some media about Ireland. He said, [...] "On the betrayal issue, I did feel that some bank governors should not be speaking out of turn and that only the president should speak for the bank." [...] The position of the ECB on Ireland's seeking of assistance was {{different from that of the}} European Commission, said Mr. Lenihan. [...] "I don't think the commission were anxious to bounce member states into a programme. [...] "That was my strong impression from my discussions with Commissioner Rehn." [...] he said, adding that [...] "the ECB clearly subscribed to a different view." [...] He gave a graphic description of his feelings when the bailout talks were concluded. [...] "I've a very vivid memory of going to Brussels on the final Monday to sign the agreement and being on my own at the airport and looking at the snow gradually thawing and <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> this is terrible.

No--he would not care for it. He would ask what it was good for, and what could I answer? for if it was not GOOD for something, but only beautiful, merely beautiful-- So I sighed, and did not go. For it wasn't good for anything; it could not build a shack, it could not improve melons, it could not hurry a fruit crop; it was useless, it was a foolishness and a vanity; he would despise it and say cutting words. But to me it was not despicable; I said, [...] "Oh, you fire, I love you, you dainty pink creature, for you are BEAUTIFUL--and that is enough!" [...] and was going to gather it to my breast. But refrained. Then I made another maxim out of my head, though it was so nearly like the first one that I was afraid it was only a plagiarism: [...] "THE BURNT EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE FIRE." ...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{she reached}} forty, Elizabeth Alexeievna's beauty was largely faded; she left behind any romantic pretensions. Her husband also {{experienced}} a personal transformation {{that drove the}} couple closer than they ever were. In 1818, Alexander I, immersed in religious mysticism, broke his long relationship with Maria Naryshkina. From then on, husband and wife started {{to spend more time}} together. The Empress sympathized deeply with him and Alexander found her supportive when he lost his beloved natural daughter, Sophia. The marked reconciliation between the Emperor and the Empress caused general surprise [...] "I am reduced <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> of <b>myself</b> sometimes as Alexander's mistress, or as if we had been married secretly..." [...] Elizabeth wrote to her mother.|$|R
5000|$|When he was hospitalized, Stevens {{was often}} {{alone in a}} very spare and plain room. He was told {{that at the time}} he was admitted, he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him. The effect on the 19-year-old pop star was pronounced. He said, [...] "To go from the show {{business}} environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about <b>myself.</b> It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut."

5000|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in Honolulu, Morey began toying {{with the idea of}} making a surfboard that would be [...] "ultimately fast."

60|$|Then I {{told him}} the tale, as I have set it down already, <b>thinking</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> that of it he would {{understand}} little, being but a wild warrior-man.
