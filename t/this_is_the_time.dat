5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E
5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E

25|$|Growth is a {{function}} of the worker to larvae ratio. The more workers there are, the more opportunities there are for larvae to be fed. In B. petiolata, this ratio increased during November and December. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> period when gynes were being reared, indicating that there are more workers available to give food to the young that will become a part of the highest caste and need the most nutrition. The amount of food given to larvae influences caste.|$|E

50|$|Between 1801 and 1830, the {{population}} of the town more than doubled from 7,072 to 15,086. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when <b>the</b> factories, mines and foundries, with their spinning machines and steam engines, began to dominate the landscape.|$|R

25|$|The virus circulates between ticks and rodents, {{with humans}} being the {{secondary}} hosts. People {{at risk for}} catching the disease are hikers and campers {{that are in the}} risk areas. Also, April, May, and June are when the infections mainly occur, because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when the adult ticks are prevalent in the environment. Unfortunately, this is also when the weather is pleasant for hiking and camping. The best way to avoid getting bitten and catching this disease is wearing long sleeves or pants, avoiding high tick-infested areas, and wearing tick repellent.|$|E
25|$|Although fire {{can occur}} {{during the growing}} or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most {{effective}} at increasing the grass and forb cover, biodiversity and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies. Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire {{if they want to}} restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} impacts total CPU time needed by a {{simulation}} {{is the size}} of the integration timestep. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid discretization errors (i.e., smaller than the fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1femtosecond (10−15 s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE constraint algorithm, which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.|$|E

25|$|Subsection 3 {{reveals an}} {{abandonment}} of the cleared areas, the decline of Olea, {{and the spread of}} Pistacia, Pinus brutia and Quercus coccifera (instead of deciduous oak) on formerly cleared land and in the maquis. As <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the rise of Ionia, the palynological scenario suggests a movement of population from the land to the newly settled or expanded big cities of the Ionian League. Subsection 4 and Baf S6 go on to catalogue the return of the fruit trees, re-clearing the land for pasture, planting of rye and other cereals, ultimate destabilization of the soil through over-use, denudation and acceleration of sedimentation. After the sealing off of the bay to form the lake, population and land use declined to their current low levels around Latmus, but the river valley is cultivated.|$|E
25|$|Further explosions by {{two more}} torpedoes that hit under the second stack, port side (near frame 82 and about frame 85) {{less than two}} minutes later at about 0205 caused catastrophic and {{terminal}} damage. Men were thrown about twice with each following explosion and the force was greater the higher up in the ship's structure. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that Carpenter was injured. The forward movement of the ship along with the massive structural frame damage caused the ship to twist and jackknife around the damaged area. The ship's momentum quickly fell off and began to flood. The center part twisted to 45 degrees port sinking first. It dragged the rear of the ship down until the stern was vertical. Men quickly realized that the damage was fatal and began to abandon ship. About 22 minutes after the ship was first hit the ship sunk, at about 0225. In the meantime, Carpenter - who had been wounded in the legs - and others of the crew abandoned ship by going over the side after cutting free all the surviving lift rafts into the ocean. Even though the forward momentum of the ship dropped off rapidly the survivors were scattered over several hundred yards, at night, amidst a raging naval battle. Later currents would separate them even more.|$|E
