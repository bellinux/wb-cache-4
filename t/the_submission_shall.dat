40|$|This poster {{will present}} an {{analysis}} of the bid behavior of the 2005 JCDL program committee (Sumner, 2005). For each paper, poster, and tutorial submitted for review to the 2005 JCDL, each program committee member was asked to state their expertise with regards to the subject domain of <b>the</b> <b>submission.</b> Therefore, for each submission, each referee selected one of the four categories: 1.) expert in the domain of <b>the</b> <b>submission</b> and wants to review 2.) expert in the domain of <b>the</b> <b>submission</b> 3.) non-expert in the domain of <b>the</b> <b>submission</b> 4.) conflict of interest between referee and <b>the</b> <b>submission</b> When ignoring conflict of interest situations, the hypothesis {{of this study is that}} referee bidding is based solely on the subject domain of <b>the</b> <b>submission</b> and <b>the</b> area of expertise of the referee. In order to validate or falsify this hypothesis, submission similarity is determined according to a TFIDF (Salton, 1998) and cosine similarity calculation of the terms in their abstracts and then compared against <b>the</b> similarity of <b>submissions</b> as determined by referee bidding.

40|$|The {{objective}} of my thesis {{was to find}} out whether in individual health facilities there are internal rules for <b>the</b> <b>submission</b> of food supplements and, if this is the case, what kind of internal regulations they are.
