5|$|Following {{the first}} trial, freed slave Olaudah Equiano brought news of <b>the</b> <b>massacre</b> to the {{attention}} of the anti-slavery campaigner Granville Sharp, who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew prosecuted for murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of <b>the</b> <b>massacre</b> received increased publicity, stimulating the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the Zong events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the horrors of the Middle Passage of slaves to the New World.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 1980s on there was {{increasing}} pressure {{on both the}} Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to <b>the</b> <b>massacre.</b> Polish academics tried to include Katyn in {{the agenda of the}} 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed that Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered <b>the</b> <b>massacre,</b> and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted that the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Polish Foreign Ministry {{asked the}} {{government}} of Russia about alleged footage of <b>the</b> <b>massacre</b> filmed by the NKVD during the killings, something the Russians have denied exists.

5000|$|Included in {{this list}} are {{examples}} of newspaper articles as republished by various secondary sources. The list also includes press coverage of <b>the</b> <b>massacres</b> prior to <b>the</b> Armenian Genocide such as <b>the</b> Hamidian <b>massacre</b> and <b>the</b> Adana <b>massacre.</b> These massacres are viewed by scholars as beginning a process of exterminating the Armenian people which, in large part, culminated in the final process of genocide in 1915. Much of this is apparent in the press articles themselves since they repeatedly place <b>the</b> <b>massacres</b> of 1915 {{in the context of}} <b>the</b> previous <b>massacres.</b> Other scholars, such as the Soviet historians Mkrtich G. Nersisyan, Ruben Sahakyan, John Kirakosyan, and Yehuda Bauer subscribe to the view that the mass killings of 1894-96 during <b>the</b> Hamidian <b>massacre</b> were <b>the</b> first phase of the Armenian Genocide. Even though <b>the</b> Hamidian <b>massacres</b> ended in 1896, Armenians continued to be massacred during what many believed to be [...] "peaceful times". <b>The</b> <b>massacres</b> conducted during these times involved dislocation, disarmament, dispersion, and ultimately murder.|$|R

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as <b>the</b> <b>Massacre</b> of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, {{on the grounds that they}} had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. The brutality of the incident was embarrassing for the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered <b>the</b> <b>massacre,</b> was forced to resign. <b>The</b> <b>massacre</b> helped create greater sympathy for the Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E
