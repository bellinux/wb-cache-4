50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called <b>tension</b> <b>pin</b> or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. Spring pins have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self retaining fastener. Spring pins are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|E

30|$|How the gauze {{should be}} fixed in place {{is yet another}} topic for discussion. The Russian {{protocol}} suggests the use of bulky pressure dressings to restrict movement between the skin and pins [37]. Paley [3] also recommends minimising pin–skin motion by applying pressure to the skin, either by using gauze compressed by rubber or by using foam sponge cubes pushed down using plastic clips. In a similar approach, Hoffmann [82] recommended relieving the skin <b>tension</b> around <b>pins</b> {{in order to prevent}} infection.|$|R

A small {{number of studies have}} been published that guide the orthopaedic surgeon to choosing strategies {{to reduce the risk of}} pin site infections: hydroxyapatite pin coatings improve osseointegration, extraction torque, and pin site infection during bone transport or tibial lengthening; meticulous operative technique is an important factor—soft tissue disruption and thermal damage should be minimized when inserting pins or wires—and care should be taken to reduce the skin <b>tension</b> at <b>pin</b> or wire sites.|$|R

40|$|A new {{numerical}} procedure for determining load proportioning in multiple-hole mechanical joints in composite plates is presented. The joints are loaded in double lap fashion in <b>tension</b> with <b>pins</b> through the holes. The commercial finite-element program ABAQUS {{is used to}} predict the load proportioning among holes using two independent plane stress finite-element models, one representing the composite inner lap and one representing the two steel outer laps, interacting through rigid circular surfaces.

Experimental and computed surface strains are also found to compare well.

40|$|In {{our earlier}} works, we have {{calculated}} the correlated creep velocity of a vortex line with line <b>tension,</b> which is <b>pinned</b> {{to a perfect}} simple-cubic lattice, and creeps out under the action of a biased potential by thermal activation. In this paper, we extend the result to {{cases in which the}} biased potential, the line <b>tension,</b> and the <b>pinning</b> energy of the line are all functions of position. Although an evaluation of the exact correlated creep velocity is difficult, a good approximate form can be found. We show that the Anderson-Kim thermal-activation formula in the vortex-creep model is still valid after suitable modification even though their uncorrelated-creeping assumption is incorrect. We apply our formalism to study the motion of vortex lines in the crustal region of neutron stars. The model results suggests that the steady-state configuration of vortex lines should form a set of hyperbolic-like curves because the stronger-pinning regions (which also have higher tension) are located in the inner regions of the crust. Perturbations, like a star quake, can cause a large number of vortex lines to unpin from the stronger-pinning region and the tension forces the vortex lines to move by a macroscopic distance. Such a mechanism may be responsible for the glitches of pulsars. © 1993 The American Physical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Brittle {{fracture}} strength and crack propagation velocity {{change with the}} design factors of a single edge notched tensile specimen, for example, the length to width ratio (L/W), the location and number of the loading pins, crack length (C_) and its tip radius (ρ). Fracture strength shows a little change with an decrease in L/W when sharp tip radius specimens tensioned by two-bolts at near the left-side edge and it shows the notable change of strength when specimens <b>tensioned</b> by a <b>pin.</b> The specimens having the radius of 0. 5 mm, <b>tensioned</b> by a <b>pin,</b> show a strong effect of L/W compared with above two. Fracture strength in this case, of course, {{is larger than the}} former two cases. Fracture strength of those having a saw-cut tip decreases as the L/W decreases and the effect of L/W seems to be obvious. The measured crack velocity is genarally larger the larger the {{fracture strength}}. The crack propagates very slowy (at the order of mm/sec.) for the small L/W specimens of sharp tip radius and it does very quickly (at the order of m/s) for the large L/W ones. The crack velocity of specimens having a saw-cut tip reaches to the maximum of about 600 m/s and it decreases as the crack propagates. The fracture surface marks of both end closed mark (like an ellipse) and one end opened mark (like a parabola) are observed on the saw-cut tip specimens and the crack arrest-lines dominates in specimens having a sharp tip radius.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Devices that arepinned to the tibia to tensionananterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) graft produce joint reaction loads {{that in turn}} can affect themaintenance of graft initial tension after tibial fixation and hence knee anterior–posterior (AP) load-displacement. However, {{the effect of these}} devices on AP load-displacement is unknown. Our objectives were to determine whether tensioning by device versus tensioning by hand causes differences in AP load-displacement and intraarticular graft tension for two commonly used tibial fixation devices: a bioresorbable interference screw and a WasherLoc. AP load-displacement and intraarticular graft tension were measured in 20 cadaveric knees using a custom arthrometer. An initial tension of 110 Nwas applied to a double-looped tendon graftwith theknee at extensionusing a <b>tensioning</b> device <b>pinned</b> to the tibia and a simulatedmethod of tensioning by hand. After inserting the tibial fixation device, the 134 Nanterior limit (i. e., anterior position of the tibiawith respect to the femurwith a 134 Nanterior force applied to the tibia) and 0 N posterior limit (i. e., AP position of the tibia relative to the femur with a 0 N force applied to the tibia) weremeasuredwith the knee in 258 flexion.

The idea of controlling a musical instrument with a keyboard was already well worked out for the organ, an instrument that is far older than the harpsichord. Moreover, the psaltery was a widely used instrument of the Middle Ages. Like the later harpsichord, it had metal strings which were held at controlled <b>tension</b> with tuning <b>pins</b> and transmitted their vibrations through a bridge to a soundboard, rendering them audible. The insight needed to create the harpsichord was thus {{to find a way to}} pluck strings mechanically, in a way controlled by a keyboard. The 14th century was a time in which advances in clockwork and other machinery were being made; hence the time may have been ripe for the invention of the harpsichord.|$|R
40|$|Reliable joining {{technologies}} are increasingly required for multi-material lightweight structures.

Both single pin and multi-pin double cantilever beam specimens were examined and correlated using experimental and finite element methods. Adherend support conditions affected the single pin pull-out process and related energy absorption up to 35 % for all pin offset angles.

40|$|In graphene, out-of-plane (flexural) {{vibrations}} and static ripples {{imposed by}} the substrate relax the electron spin, intrinsically protected by mirror symmetry. We calculate the relaxation times in different scenarios, accounting for all the possible spin-phonon couplings allowed by the hexagonal symmetry of the lattice. Scattering by flexural phonons imposes the ultimate bound to the spin lifetimes, in the ballpark of hundreds of nano-seconds at room temperature. This estimate and the behavior {{as a function of}} the carrier concentration are substantially altered by the presence of <b>tensions</b> or the <b>pinning</b> with the substrate. Static ripples also influence the spin transport in the diffusive regime, dominated by motional narrowing. We find that the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism saturates when the mean free path is comparable to the correlation length of the heights profile. In this regime, the spin-relaxation times are exclusively determined by the geometry of the corrugations. Simple models for typical corrugations lead to lifetimes of the order of tens of micro-seconds. Comment: 4 + epsilon pages; 3 figure...|$|R
25|$|The {{body and}} pin meet at either a spring or hinge. The {{earliest}} design is the spring which provides <b>tension</b> to the <b>pin.</b> The spring could be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral spring winds around {{in one direction}} only. Unilateral springs are the earliest type, first appearing around the 14th century BC. Bilateral springs that wind around to {{both sides of the}} fibula body, appeared around the 6th century BC. Bilateral springs can be very short, with only one or two revolutions per side, or up to 10cm long. Most bilateral springs are made of one piece of metal and therefore have a spring cord, a piece of wire extending {{from one end of the}} spring to the other. The spring cord can pass in front of or behind the fibulae body. Bilateral springs wrap around a pin or axle. These are usually made of iron even if the rest of the fibula and spring is copper alloy. In the 1st century AD some fibulae had springs that were concealed under a metal cover that was an extension of the fibula body. These are known as covered springs, or hidden springs.|$|R
30|$|External fixator {{parameters}} {{affect the}} risk of pin site infections. Increased duration of pin fixation {{was associated with a}} higher rate of pin site infection in a cohort of 27 patients with 178 total pin site infections [17]. This study also suggested that periarticular pin placement was associated with a greater infection rate than diaphyseal placement (1.6  % vs. 4.5  %, p <  0.01) [17] possibly due to increased soft tissue motion about joints. Sites with greater soft tissue thickness over bone have been implicated as at higher risk of infection. The infection rate has been reported to be 2.5 -fold greater in patients with external fixators performing active correction than those which are not [48]. Skin <b>tension</b> around a <b>pin</b> site has also been associated with greater infection rates [57]. Pin insertion technique may influence {{the risk of}} developing a pin site infection: pre-drilling pin sites with a sharp dill bit; meticulous soft tissue handling; inserting pins by hand; and not using a tourniquet {{to reduce the risk of}} thermal necrosis to bone and skin may decrease the risk of infection. We have observed also that inadequate fixation may place excessive load on too few fixation points and lead to infection.|$|R

Changes in their properties are {{of great interest}} to professionals in order to gain greater control over tooth movements. ObjectiveEvaluate the influence of trademark and length of the spacer chain on force degradation of elastic. Material and methodWe used the following elastic chain types: TP, Rocky Mountain (RMO) and GAC short, medium and long varieties. The elastics, which contained links corresponding to 12. 5 mm, were <b>tensioned</b> between steel <b>pins</b> using Instron 4411 universal testing machine up to 25 mm. The value was recorded. After initial measurement of the force, the elastics were fixed on an acrylic resin plate and kept distended to 25 mm. They were inserted in a container with deionized water and kept in an incubator at 37 º. The elastic force data was collected at time intervals of 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days and 28 days. These records were subjected to an appropriate statistical test, with significance level of 5 %. ResultTP elastics showed significantly higher force in all periods. RMO and GAC elastics showed similar elastic forces. Short and long TP elastics exhibited significantly higher strength than the average elastic chain. As regards GAC and RMO, short elastics showed higher than average force values, and higher values than the long type.

40|$|I draw on GR Cauchy problem (CP) {{and initial}} value problem (IVP) {{mathematics}} [1] {{to make a}} number of points about Shiromizu–Maeda–Sasaki (SMS) [2] 5 -d Einstein field equation-type (EFE) braneworlds. One issue [3] is why SMS chose their particular steps in their formulation of braneworld equations explicitly in terms of Weyl tensor projections. For in the GR CP, similar steps are most commonly used to eliminate the Weyl tensor projections. Although other GR CP formulations are explicitly in terms of Weyl tensor projections, the specific reasons for these formulations do not extend to the braneworld application. There, rather, explicit formulation in terms of Weyl tensor projections is convenient for {{those who wish to}} (partly) set these projections to zero. This is not physically justifiable if these braneworlds are to be interpreted within 5 -d GR. Another issue is whether this actually bears any rigorous relation whatsoever with extracting predictions from string theory. Given a 5 -d EFE context however, surely one should judge it by GR’s dynamical content. The presence of a brane (a thin 3 + 1 hypersurface privileged by having <b>tension</b> and matter <b>pinned</b> to it) makes this a new and difficult problem. From the GR CP it is suggestive that the components of the EFE’s on a hypersurface are a means of determining the nature of nearby hypersurfaces (and thus building up the higher-dimensional spacetime), rather than being some analogue of the EFE’s (whic...|$|R
40|$|The pin {{retainer}} band is a 1 - 1 / 4 in. wide by about 1 / 32 in. thick steel band that is stretched over the pins circumferentially {{at the joints}} of the solid rocket booster (SRB) motor case segments. Its purpose is to hold the retaining pins in place during flight. Since the band is thin and is mounted stretched, or under <b>tension,</b> over the <b>pins</b> which are greased in place, {{it is necessary to}} protect it thermally. Three typical areas of the band location on the SRB motor case joints were chosen for verifying the cork thermal prection system (TPS) performance on the band: the joint in front of the attach ring, at the aft skirt joint in front of the kick ring and in an unperturbed area at the forward segments of the SRB motor cases. The kick ring area {{pin retainer}} band cork TPS passed the test requirements in the region where there are no phenolic splice caps. In the splice cap areas where the band TPS is closed out around the splice with K 5 NA, additional amounts of K 5 NA material is required to adequately protect the steel band. TPS requirements were easily met in the one location where the ends of the steel band are joined together after installation and tensioning. The attack ring area pin retainer band TPS did not quite pass the heat load requirements with the. 375 in. thick cork TPS as used for the kick ring area band.

40|$|BACKGROUND Techniques for {{treating}} complex proximal humeral fractures vary and include fixations using <b>tension</b> bands, percutaneous <b>pins,</b> bone suture, T-plates, intramedullary nails, double tubular plates, hemiarthroplasty, plant tan humerus fixator plates, Polaris nails and blade plates. Complications {{of these techniques}} include cutout or {{back out of the}} screws and plates, avascular necrosis, nonunion, malunion, nail migration, rotator cuff impairment and impingement syndromes. Insufficient anchorage from conventional implants may lead to early loosening and failure, especially in osteoporotic bones. In general, nonoperative treatment of displaced three and four-part fractures of the proximal humerus leads to poor outcome due to intraarticular nature of injury and inherent instability of the fragments. Comminuted fractures of the proximal humerus are at risk of fixation failure, screw loosening and fracture displacement. Open reduction and internal fixation with conventional plate and screws has been associated with unacceptably high incidence of screw pull out. PHILOS (the proximal humeral internal locking system) plate is an internal fixation system that enables angled stabilisation with multiple interlocking screws for fractures of the proximal humerus. MATERIALS AND METHODS 30 patients with proximal humerus fractures who were admitted in the Department of Orthopaedics, Government General Hospital, Kakinada, during the period November 2014 - November 2016 were taken up for study according to inclusion criteria. All patients were treated with PHILOS plate. These proximal humerus fractures were classified according to Neer’s classification. Patients were followed up at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months’ interval.
