The Exxon Valdez oil spill was not merely the result of the actions taken on a single tanker on a single evening; the full range of causal factors included ac-tions not just of the tanker crew and the Exxon corporate hierarchy, but also of governmental institutions. Over time, government "ownership " of mineral re-sources led to a situation where governmental agencies came effectively to have a <b>profit</b> <b>motive,</b> not vastly different from <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> <b>motives</b> of private firms, in promoting oil extraction. In addition, military interests wished to encourage domestic, rather than international petroleum-extraction activities, further in-creasing the attractiveness of Alaskan reserves. As would be predicted by Stone’s model of "systemic power " (1980), while powerful pro-development interests faced opposition during the period when pipeline issues were publicly salient, the pro-development interests subsequently eroded the safeguards that had ini-tially been implemented, ultimately increasing the probability of an accident of the sort that actually occurred...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a purely}} {{capitalist}} mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot {{limit the number}} of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. Wages work {{in the same way as}} prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. And therefore, inequality is driven by this price. Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. [...] "On the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers." [...] "Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair." [...] Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor.

While giving respect to the first two discourses, Packer himself is sympathetic to the third approach and disdainful of the fourth.

40|$|Inappropriate {{incentives}} {{as part of}} China's fee-for-service {{payment system}} have resulted in rapid cost increase, inefficiencies, poor quality, unaffordable health care, and an erosion of medical ethics. To reverse these outcomes, a strategy of experimentation to realign incentives for providers with the social goals of improvement in quality and efficiency has been initiated in China. This Review shows how lessons that have been learned from international experiences have been improved further in China by realignment of the incentives for providers towards prevention and primary care, and incorporation of a treatment protocol for hospital services. Although many experiments are new, preliminary evidence suggests a potential to produce savings in costs. However, because these experiments have not been scientifically assessed in China, evidence of their effects on quality and health outcome is largely missing. Although a reform of the provider's payment {{can be an effective}} short-term strategy, professional ethics need to be re-established and incentives changed to alter <b>the</b> <b>profit</b> <b>motives</b> of Chinese hospitals and physicians alike.

To date, policies intended to regulate or manage financial conflicts of interest appear to be unsatisfying and inadequate. The present study examined predictors of the responses of academic scientists and clinicians to hypothetical situations in which financial and other conflicts of interest may arise. Academic scientists and clinicians at five medical schools completed an anonymous survey that included vignettes that posed a potential conflict of interest. Participants indicated the likelihood that they would engage in specific actions to avoid conflicts of interest. Findings indicated that junior faculty and those whose departments received more federal grant money were more likely to respond in ways that could create conflicts of interest. These results suggest that various sub-groups of faculty may require different approaches to appropriately avoid or manage financial conflicts of interest.
