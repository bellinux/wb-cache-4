5|$|Hemorrhagic {{smallpox}} is {{a severe}} form that {{is accompanied by}} extensive bleeding into <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic smallpox <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> making it look charred and black, hence this form of the disease {{is also known as}} black pox.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, {{to lubricate}} and waterproof <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and hair of mammals. In humans, they {{occur in the}} greatest number on the face and scalp, but also on all parts of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> The pH of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E
5|$|Telangiectasia (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and mucosal linings {{of the nose}} and gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> lesions characteristically occur on the lips, the nose and the fingers, and on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of the face in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E

To make the bedding, the natives would often use <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> of <b>the</b> animals that they shared the land with. The {{mattress}} was made from <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> of bigger animals such as bears and deer.

5000|$|Maxwell {{developed}} {{her own way}} {{of preserving}} the animals by molding them in plaster and then covering these molds with <b>the</b> animals <b>skin</b> which she had preserved. [...] She later used iron frames over which to stretch <b>the</b> <b>skins,</b> rather than sewing <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> together and stuffing them, as most other taxidermists did. She also insisted that replica backgrounds portraying the animals' natural habitat were used.|$|R
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> or taken orally to treat acne and {{are thought to}} work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> over time.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E

5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, {{pale blue}} eyes and cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that pigment cells and pigment are present in <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> eyes, and coat, but at lower levels. Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> or coat. In addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E

Copper ions added to the outside solutions produced a rise in short-circuit current, as well as the known increase in potential difference. In sodium-free Ringer's (sodium replaced by choline) the orientation of the potential difference across <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> was reversed, <b>the</b> inside being negative instead of positive. The results are interpreted as direct or indirect indications of the presence of a net transfer of chloride ions from outside to inside of these frog skins...|$|R
