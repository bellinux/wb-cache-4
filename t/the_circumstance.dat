5|$|After the war, Ben Tillman, his mother, and his wounded brother James (who died in 1866) {{worked to}} rebuild Chester {{plantation}}. They signed the plantation's freedmen as workers. They were confronted with <b>the</b> <b>circumstance</b> of several men refusing {{to work for}} them and legally leaving the plantation. From 1866 to 1868, Ben Tillman went with several workers from the plantation to Florida, where a new cotton-planting belt had been established. The Tillmans purchased land there. Tillman was unsuccessful in Florida—after two marginal years, the 1868 crop was destroyed by caterpillars.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in <b>the</b> <b>circumstance</b> of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E
5|$|While campaigning against Venetian forces, Skanderbeg {{managed to}} inflict a serious defeat on July 23, 1448, seriously {{weakening}} Venetian power in Albania. The siege of Svetigrad continued, however, and Marin Barleti {{writes that the}} Ottomans bribed a soldier to throw a dead dog into {{the well of the}} fortress, forcing the garrison to refuse to drink out of it. It is more likely, however, that the Ottomans had cut off the water supply and induced the garrison to surrender. Given <b>the</b> <b>circumstance,</b> Perlati promised a surrender if the garrison were allowed a safe passage through the Ottoman lines. Prince Mehmed suggested that the garrison should be promised safe passage and then massacred, but Murad rejected his son's proposal, in fear that the rebellion would only be intensified through such an act; he decided to instead return the garrisoning force to Skanderbeg. On July 31, 1448 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore an {{alternative}} formulation of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice. <b>The</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice are <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> that make human cooperation necessary and possible, and because human cooperation {{is necessary to}} justice, they make justice both necessary and possible. For constructivists, principles of justice respond to these circumstances. Standard accounts of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice {{can be found in}} Hobbes, Hume, and Rawls, and many contemporary theorists rely on these accounts. My dissertation rejects these standard accounts of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice—on <b>the</b> grounds of exclusion and trust—and defends an alternative account. A core idea of my proposed alternative is that <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice must be understood in terms of solidarity. A proper understanding of the role of solidarity in an adequate characterization of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice requires a good grasp of the nature of solidarity itself. To that end I offer a novel account of solidarity which I argue improves existing theories of solidarity. In {{the first part of this}} project I explain the role and importance of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice. I then offer a full description of solidarity and its normative character. In the second half of the project I offer my new account of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice, including an explanation and examples of how broad the scope of this reformulation is. I conclude the project by applying my new account of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice to the problem of climate change, and ask whether we can now construe the coordination of resources between generations as a problem of justice...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is, first, to address three recent criticisms of Hume's account of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice, and secondly, to {{consider}} how an account of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice may be deployed in philosophical argument when detached from Hume's own narrow concern with rules of property. Against the criticisms lodged by Brian Barry and Martha Nussbaum, I argue that Hume does not build a conception of justice as mutual advantage into <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice. Against the criticism lodged against modern invocations of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice by Gerry Cohen, I argue that any plausible account of deliberative reflection must be at once action-guiding and world-guided. This allows an account of <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of justice-those features of the world no plausible theory of justice can idealize away-to do some justificatory work...|$|R
