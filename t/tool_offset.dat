40|$|International audienceThe {{setting of}} machine tool is to {{position}} the machined surfaces to each other relative to the reference of the machine. Traditionally the position of each cutting tool is corrected after each machining operation to get a conform part. The Total Inertial Steering (TIS) allows correcting in one time all deviations of the measured points on the work piece relative to the CAD model. In {{the case of the}} production by machine tool with numerical control, it seeks to link the parameters part to adjustable parameters on the machine (<b>tool</b> <b>offsets).</b> The relationship between part parameters and <b>tool</b> <b>offsets</b> is obtained thanks to the incidence matrix. This matrix is easily and automatically calculable in the case of matrix connecting points to <b>tool</b> <b>offsets.</b> This is not the case for a matrix linking a parameterization of the surface with dimensions to <b>tool</b> <b>offsets.</b> This paper proposes an algorithm to pass from the matrix on the points to the matrix on the dimensions, in order to obtain it automatically. This original approach allows exporting the TIS approach to apply it to the geometric tolerancing. An example of a relatively simple 2 D part is used to illustrate this problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of orthopaedic joint bearings surfaces requires exceptionally {{high levels of}} control of not only the surface finish but also the surface form. In the case of hip joints, the form of femoral head should be controlled to within ± 50 ìm from a given diameter. It {{has been shown that}} a better form control of bearing component could enhance clearances creating the correct volume of lubrication to fill the bearing surface gap and reduce wear particle generation. This element is especially critical for the new generation non-spherical head designs. Bonnet polishing which is used successfully in the area of optics is potentially an excellent finishing process to control the form and finish of artificial joints. In the process of form control polishing an “influence function” which defines the material removal rate is of vital importance in developing a corrective polishing procedure. However, the effects of polishing parameters (such as precess angle, head speed, tool pressure and <b>tool</b> <b>offset)</b> on influence function are not very clear for CoCr alloys. These elements must be assessed if a deterministic polishing process is to be developed. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to understand the contribution of each polishing factors to influence function and consequent part polishing. This study has investigated the effects of polishing parameters on influence function, including geometric size and volumetric material removal rate (MRR). The experimental results indicate that the polishing parameter of precess angle and <b>tool</b> <b>offset</b> affect the geometric size of influence function significantly; the polishing parameter of head speed and tool pressure affect the geometric size of influence function to a lesser degree; the polishing parameter of precess angle, head speed and <b>tool</b> <b>offset</b> affect MRR greatly...|$|E
40|$|During {{logging-while-drilling}} (LWD) operations, complex {{drill string}} movements {{and the weight}} of the drill pipe often lead to a measurement tool that is not centralized. Therefore, studies of the response of an off-center acoustic LWD tool are essential to facilitate better interpretation of measurements made in an actual drilling environment. Such studies will be helpful for tool design and data processing. We used a finite-difference method to simulate the response of a noncentralized monopole acoustic LWD tool at high frequency (10 kHz). We analyzed the effects on the waveforms for receivers at different azimuths caused by an off-center tool with differing amounts of offset. We used velocity-time semblance and dispersion analysis methods to help us to understand the modes in the waveforms at different azimuth receivers for different tool offsets. We have found that the waveforms {{in the direction of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>offset,</b> that is, where the fluid column is smallest, were affected the most. Waveforms in the orthogonal direction were less affected by <b>tool</b> <b>offset.</b> Collar flexural and collar quadrupole modes appear when the tool is off center. In addition, the formation flexural and quadrupole modes contaminate the Stoneley wave. Waveforms in a fast formation are more strongly affected by the offset of the tool than those in a slow formation. In a fast formation, the new collar modes make it difficult to determine the P-wave velocity in the direction of <b>tool</b> <b>offset</b> whereas it is easier in the orthogonal direction. However, P-waves are less contaminated by new modes in a slow formation. Due to the significant changes in waveforms with azimuth when the tool is off center, the simple addition of all waveforms from an azimuthal distribution of receivers will not result in a clean waveform that is sensitive to only the surrounding formation.
