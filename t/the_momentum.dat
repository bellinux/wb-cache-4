5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd.

5|$|Kansas {{received}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, and the Hokies {{attempted to}} give themselves another chance at offense by calling timeouts after Kansas rushed the ball.

Virginia Tech added a tying {{touchdown}} before halftime, {{and after}} a scoreless third quarter, two Matt Ryan interceptions resulted in 14points for Virginia Tech and a 3016 Virginia Tech win.

5|$|After Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{continued}} to struggle on offense. Quarterback Riley Skinner was sacked, threw an 18-yard completion, then three incomplete passes. Wake {{was forced to}} punt the ball away again, allowing the Yellow Jackets the possibility of expanding their lead. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Reggie Ball's pass was intercepted, allowing Wake Forest another chance on offense. The play turned <b>the</b> <b>momentum</b> {{of the game in}} favor of Wake Forest, who proceeded to move the ball with slightly more effectiveness. During the Wake Forest drive, Skinner completed a 39-yard pass to John Tereshinski, who drove the Deacons inside Georgia Tech territory, where the drive continued. Though Wake Forest was forced to settle for a 33-yard field goal from kicker Sam Swank, the score tied the game at 66 with 7:59 remaining in the game.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We derive {{an exact}} {{expression}} for the radiation pressure of a quasi- monochromatic plane wave incident {{from the free}} space onto the flat surface of a semi-infinite dielectric medium.

The last toured in North America after the London run. His final West End play was The Understanding (1982), a gentle comedy of late-flowering love. Celia Johnson was cast as his co-star, but died suddenly just before the first night.

5|$|As Ponsonby {{tried to}} rally his men against the French cuirassers, he was {{attacked}} by Jaquinot's lancers and captured. A nearby party of Scots Greys saw the capture and attempted to rescue their brigade commander. However, the French lancer who had captured Ponsonby killed him and then used his lance to kill three of the Scots Greys who had attempted the rescue. By the time Ponsonby died, <b>the</b> <b>momentum</b> had entirely returned in favour of the French. Milhaud's and Jaquinot's cavalrymen drove the Union Brigade from the valley. The result was very heavy losses for the British cavalry. A countercharge, by British light dragoons under Major-General Vandeleur and Dutch–Belgian light dragoons and hussars under Major-General Ghigny on the left wing, and Dutch–Belgian carabiniers under Major-General Trip in the centre, repelled the French cavalry.|$|E
