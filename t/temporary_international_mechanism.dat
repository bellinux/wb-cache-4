As a result, the international community suspended its international aid to the Palestinians, causing big damage to the Palestinian economy. Eventually, aid was diverted via a <b>Temporary</b> <b>International</b> <b>Mechanism</b> or directly to the accounts of President Mahmoud Abbas, bypassing the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority.|$|E
