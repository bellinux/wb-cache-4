40|$|Under certain circumstances, a three-body decay width can be {{approximated}} by {{an integral}} involving a product of two off-shell two-body decay widths. This "angle-average" approximation {{is used to calculate}} the π NN decay width of the d^*(J^π= 3 ^+, T= 0) dibaryon in a simple Δ^ 2 model for the most important Feynman diagrams describing pion emissions with baryon-baryon recoil and meson retardation. The decay width is found to be about 0. 006 (0. 07, 0. 5) MeV at the d^* mass of 2065 (2100, 2150) MeV for input dynamics derived from the Full Bonn potential. The smallness of this width is qualitatively understood {{as the result of the}} three-body decay being "third forbidden". The concept of ℓ forbiddenness and the threshold behavior of a three-body decay are further studied in connection with the π NN decay of the dibaryon d'(J^π= 0 ^-, T= 0 or 2) where the idea of unfavorness has to be introduced. The implications of these results are briefly discussed. Comment: 15 pages, RevTeX, <b>two-column</b> <b>journal</b> style, six figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} {{interactions of}} dark matter with photons are fairly restricted. Yet both direct detection as well as monochromatic gamma ray signatures depend sensitively {{on the presence of}} such interactions. For a Dirac fermion, electromagnetic dipoles are possible, but are very constrained. For Majorana fermions, no such terms are allowed. We consider signals of an effective theory with a Majorana dark matter particle and its couplings to photons. In the presence of a nearby excited state, there is the possibility of a magnetic dipole transition (Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter or MiDM), which yields both direct and indirect detection signals, and, intriguingly, yields essentially the same size over a wide range of dipole strengths. Absent an excited state, the leading interaction of WIMPs is similar to the Rayleigh scattering of low energy photons from neutral atoms, which may be captured by an effective operator of dimension 7 of the form χ̅χ F_μνF^μν. While it {{can be thought of as}} a phase of the Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter scenario where the excited state is much heavier than the ground state, it can arise from other theories as well. We study the resulting phenomenology of this scenario: gamma ray lines from the annihilation of WIMPs; nuclear recoils in direct detection; and direct production of the WIMP pair in high-energy colliders. Considering recent evidence in particular for a 130 GeV line from the galactic center, we discuss the detection prospects at upcoming experiments.
