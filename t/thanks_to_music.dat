40|$|Abstract Music {{can have}} a strong {{psychology}} effect on people in terms of affect, autobiographical memories, and also mental imagery (Juslin, & Västfjäll, 2008) [1]. Recent research indicates that music {{can be used as}} a tool to promote private writing, a type of writing which results from emotions and autobiographical memory (Ramirez, Beilock, 2011) [2]. Moreover, research indicates that such therapeutic writing can work as medium to reappraise passed events (Chen, Penhune, Zatorre, 2008; Conway, 2003) [3] [4]. This paper discusses the didactic value of music motivated autobiographical writing after music listening (Strollo, Vittoria, 2012) [5]. Moreover, results will be presented of a recent study that was conducted among 25 undergraduate psychology students to further explore this topic. As part of this research students were invited to download a list of 100 musical tracks on their I-pod and listen to this music in a classroom while writing about any memories that were recalled during this task. After listening to the music, participants were asked to respond to a questionnaire and had to write in a logbook. The questionnaire was constructed and tested ad hoc referring to the scientific literature on the topic and to the analysis of the categories emerging from the logbooks of participants of a prior study. Students could use autobiographical writing as a device of retrospection, self-reflection and selftraining. Moreover, students seem to grasp the elements of self-censorship and self-control, to test the role of music on cognitive processes and in particular the association between music, emotions and experiences (Strollo, 2011) [6]. Findings indicated that this project increased people’s awareness of the connections between music, body and cognitive processes as formative tools, particularly <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> “projective” potential which allows spontaneous memory recall...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyses}} the scientists’ {{views on}} the phenomenon of “reliability”. The author pays {{special attention to the}} fact that the concept “reliability” is considered by the scientists as the systematic characteristic, which is characterized by the specific number of professional, psychological, physiological qualities and functions at the different levels of a person’s activity. This activity provides stable and reliable work. It is found out that scientists think the quality is the most important property which provides definiteness to any phenomenon. Personal qualities that affect the maturity of emotional and volitional reliability are established. Scientific interpretation of the concept of “reliability” and the main features of performing reliability is revealed. The analysis of pedagogical and psychological literature proves that the emotional qualities are being formed throughout the life according to the person’s environmental and genetic conditions. Emotional irritability, emotional stability, emotional tone, emotional reactions, emotional stability are the qualities which depend upon a type of a person’s higher nervous activity. The person’s activity, especially music one, can’t exist without involving emotions and feelings. Music plays an important role; due to it emotions become conscious processes. <b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> the person’s higher emotions (moral, intellectual, esthetic) are formed. It is noticed that individual differences in demonstration of emotions depend on a person’s volitional qualities. Volition is considered to be a person’s psychological activity that determines purposefulness of actions. The author concluded that the maturity level of emotional and volitional reliability depends on direction and resistance of socially significant motives (needs, interests, values, attitudes); personality’s psychophysical traits (abilities, capacities), which provide the required level and effectiveness of musical activities; degree of development of personal qualities (thinking, memory, feeling, emotion, volition); completeness and depth of acquired special psychological and pedagogical skills as well as acquired musical and performing experience...|$|E

5000|$|La Guacherna unofficially {{started as}} early as the {{beginnings}} of the 20th century in barrio Abajo.
