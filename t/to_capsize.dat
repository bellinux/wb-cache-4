International regulations require that the captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> or break in half at the pier.|$|E
5|$|On Saipan, Typhoon Joan {{destroyed}} 37houses {{and caused}} an island-wide power outage. Three {{people were injured}} due to boarding up their house during the storm. On nearby Anatahan, high winds caused $200,000 (1997USD) worth of crop and property damage. Later, high waves affected southern Japan and northwestern Hawaii. On Chichi-jima, Joan caused a boat <b>to</b> <b>capsize,</b> killing one of its occupants and leaving two others missing.|$|E

5|$|Frauenlob {{spent her}} entire {{career in the}} {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She saw action during World War I at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, where she badly damaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. There, in a chaotic night engagement, Frauenlob {{was hit by a}} torpedo launched by , which caused the ship <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> and sink with the vast majority of her crew. The wreck was discovered in 2000, and is in remarkably good condition, sitting upright on the ocean floor.|$|E
5|$|The Königsberg-class cruisers had a {{standard}} crew of 21officers and 493enlisted men. This later increased to 23officers and 588591enlisted men, and during World War II, the crew size rose to between 820 and 850 officers and men. The ships carried {{a number of}} smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, one cutter, and one dinghy. The ships were moderately good sea boats, but had the potential <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> if internal stores were improperly loaded, and suffered from a slight lee helm. They heeled up to twenty degrees with the rudder hard over. They were nevertheless very maneuverable and lost little speed in a head sea. In a hard turn, they lost up to 20percent speed.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} gun batteries, {{the crew of}} Blücher, {{including}} the personnel manning the guns, were tasked with fighting the fire. By that time she {{had taken on a}} list of 18degrees, although this was not initially problematic. The fire eventually reached one of the ship's 10.5cm ammunition magazines between turbine room 1 and turbine room 2/3, which exploded violently. The blast ruptured several bulkheads in the engine rooms and ignited the ship's fuel stores. The battered ship slowly began <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> and the order to abandon ship was given. Blücher rolled over and sank at 07:30, with significant casualties. Naval historian Erich Gröner states that the number of casualties is unknown, but Henrik Lunde gives a loss of life figure ranging between 600 and 1,000 soldiers and sailors. Jürgen Rohwer meanwhile states that 125 seamen and 195 soldiers died in the sinking.|$|E

5|$|Each gun rested {{within an}} armored turret, {{but only the}} top of the turret {{protruded}} above the main deck. The turret extended either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate the turret and to elevate the guns attached to each turret. At the bottom of the turret were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. All of the compartments within the turrets were separated by flameproof bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the turret. Each turret required a crew of 7794 men to operate. The turrets were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> the turrets would fall out. Each turret cost US $1.4 million, but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship <b>to</b> <b>capsize.</b> But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the shark}} attacks the other kids, hitting {{one of their}} boats, and causing most of them <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> and crash into {{each other in the}} ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E
5000|$|The Notable Knot Index {{recommends}} the tumble hitch {{as a more}} stable hitch than the highwayman's hitch. It is a similar hitch, but less prone <b>to</b> <b>capsizing</b> because the standing part remains passive and the locking is done by two successive bights of the working part being pushed into the previous bight thus locking it.|$|R

5|$|On 14 May {{the broken}} {{remains of the}} two bower anchors, which were {{threatening}} <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> the ship, were hauled in. During the following days the pack ice thickened, and in increasingly turbulent weather the boilers were closed down, since attempting to manoeuvre under power in these conditions would merely waste coal. Replenishing the ship's supply of fresh water was a further difficulty. A large iceberg was in view, but too far away in the prevailing weather conditions to be accessible, so to obtain drinking water the crew had to gather snow. Food was less of a problem; {{they were able to}} augment Aurora's food supplies from the penguins and seals that gathered around the ship. To boost morale the crew were given a ration of rum to celebrate Empire Day on 24 May.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{seems to}} recover, {{but the next}} day, the {{producers}} find Truman sleeping in his basement. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, only to find he has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history while a citywide search for Truman is launched, going to such extreme measures as causing the artificial sun to rise hours ahead of schedule. Audiences {{around the world are}} drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> the boat. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912, Feth-i Bülend was assigned to the Reserve Division, and she saw no action during the conflict. Instead, she was disarmed and most of her weaponsincluding all four 15cm guns, and four each of the 75mm and 57mm gunswere used to bolster the defenses of Thessaloniki's harbor. The guns were manned by 90 of the ship's crew. The ship itself was converted to a barracks ship. At the time of {{the outbreak}} of the First Balkan War on 18 October 1912, the ship's commander was Captain (Binbaşi) Aziz Mahmut Bey, who also functioned as the naval garrison commander. On the night of 31 October, the Greek torpedo boat No. 11 passed by the shore batteries and searchlights and through the mine barrages at 22:20. She launched three torpedoes at 23:30 against Feth-i Bülend. One torpedo missed, hitting the quay, but the two others hit the ship, causing her <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> and sink. Seven of its crew, including the ship's imam, were killed in the sinking, while the Greek vessel exited the harbor by the same route without further incident.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{development}} of Ana, the government of Bermuda issued a gale warning for the island. Upon its classification by the National Hurricane Center, a tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda. Meandering near the island for several days while developing, the storm dropped 2.63inches (67mm) of precipitation in a six-day period at the Bermuda International Airport. Winds on the island did not reach tropical storm force. Swells from the storm impacted the coast of Florida. The combination of the swells and an outgoing tide caused a boat <b>to</b> <b>capsize</b> in Jupiter Inlet on April 20; two of its occupants drowned, and the other two were rescued. As an extratropical storm, the remnants of Ana dropped 0.87inches (22mm) of precipitation in the city of Ponta Delgada in the Azores. Moisture from the remnants of Ana also produced beneficial rainfall in the United Kingdom. Two ships recorded tropical storm force winds in association with Ana; the Atlantic Forest recorded 51mph (82km/h) and a pressure of 998mbar on April 22, and the Rosa Delmas reported winds of 47mph (76km/h) on April 23.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, Britain's {{lifeboats}} were found by the Admiralty to be unsatisfactory. In 1848, of the 100 boats available, only 55 were in good repair, and many of those were of too heavy a construction; and 21 boats were found to be unfit for use. Lifeboat design was not standardised and the boats available, though an improvement on ordinary vessels, were vulnerable to heavy seas, which could lead <b>to</b> <b>capsizing</b> and loss of life.|$|R
25|$|Catamarans {{have two}} {{distinct}} primary performance characteristics that distinguish them from displacement monohull vessels: lower resistance to {{passage through the}} water and greater stability (initial resistance <b>to</b> <b>capsize).</b> Choosing between a monohull and catamaran configuration includes considerations of carrying capacity, speed, and efficiency.|$|E

If the ship is flying a Spinnaker and it loses steering, the boat will most likely broach (head up into wind), which will, on most boats, cause a capsize in heavy weather. It is possible to sail smaller dinghies without a rudder using only sail adjustment.|$|R
