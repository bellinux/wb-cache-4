50|$|The Charity Commission for England and Wales has the {{statutory}} power <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> the <b>cy-près</b> doctrine {{on behalf of}} a charity where, for example, no trustees remain in a charity or the necessary mandate cannot be agreed. These powers extend to a corporate charity or unincorporated association (which the common law rules may not cover). Similar powers <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> the equivalent bodies in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The cy-près doctrine will not be applied where a charity has alternative powers to redirect its funds under its constitution.|$|R
5000|$|The UTC provides, in part, that [...] "if a {{particular}} charitable purpose becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve, or wasteful...the court may <b>apply</b> <b>cy-près</b> <b>to</b> modify or terminate the trust...in a manner {{consistent with the}} settlor’s charitable purposes".|$|R
5000|$|However, the UTC further {{provides}} {{that the court}} may not <b>apply</b> <b>cy-près</b> where [...] "a provision {{in the terms of}} a charitable trust...would result in distribution of the trust property to a noncharitable beneficiary" [...] and also that cy-près may not be used to violate the rule against perpetuities.|$|R
500|$|Cases {{of initial}} failure are where, {{rather than an}} {{established}} charitable trust failing, a gift has failed {{at the moment of}} its creation by having an invalid purpose. This raises different questions, as {{it is a matter of}} deciding [...] "has the original charitable gift failed, and, if it has, can the money be <b>applied</b> <b>cy-près</b> or must it go on resulting trust to the settlor's estate"? ...|$|R
5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be <b>applied</b> <b>cy-près.</b> The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the third}} issue, {{the appellate court}} also agreed with Prakash J that the Premises are {{impressed}} with a charitable trust for the joint use of the Church and the College. [...] However, it disagreed with Prakash J on the fourth issue that the Appellants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, {{that they are the}} members of the Board of Directors of the College. [...] The appellate court pointed out that if Prakash J was of the opinion that the members of the Board (who are members of the College as an unincorporated association) cannot be ascertained, she should have ordered - which she did not - that the College be dissolved under the equitable jurisdiction of the High Court and the property that is held for the purpose of the College (i.e., that part of the Premises that is impressed with a charitable purpose in favor of the College and the money in the College’s accounts) should then either be <b>applied</b> <b>cy-pres,</b> handed <b>to</b> the Public Trustee, or turned over to the Commissioner of Charities.|$|R
50|$|The UTC codifies that <b>cy-près</b> <b>applies</b> only <b>to</b> {{charitable}} trusts {{where the}} original particular {{purpose of the}} trust has become impossible or impracticable, and {{the terms of the}} trust do not specify what is to happen in such a situation.|$|R

40|$|The {{consequences}} of quota-based hiring policies on women’s and men’s self-ascribed fit and motivation <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> for leadership positions were investigated in the European context. 389 management students (195 women, 194 men) from Switzerland, Germany, and Austria received job advertisements varying in their gender policies. Interestingly, women’s and men’s self-ascribed fit and motivation <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> {{did not differ}} when no policy was included. Instead, participant’s agency was the relevant predictor leading to higher perceived fit, resulting in higher inclination <b>to</b> <b>apply.</b> When women were either explicitly invited <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> or preferentially treated when equally qualified, they reported higher fit and inclination <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> compared <b>to</b> both the control condition and men. In contrast, when a quota of 40 % women should be established, neither women’s fit nor motivation <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> were increased beyond the levels of the control or men’s.
