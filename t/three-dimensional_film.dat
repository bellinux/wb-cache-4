He explained the work done in the Toccata and Fugue was [...] "no sudden idea... they were something we had nursed along several years but we {{never had a chance}} to try". Preliminary designs included those from effects animator Cy Young, who produced drawings influenced by the patterns on the edge of a piece of sound film. In late 1938 Disney hired Oskar Fischinger, a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films, including some with classical music, to work with Young. Upon review of three leica reels produced by the two, Disney rejected all three. According to Huemer all Fishinger [...] "did was little triangles and designs... it didn't come off at all.

Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience, Fishinger left the studio in apparent despair, before the segment was completed, in October 1939.

Geometric and transport characteristics of the hopping resistor network are shown to depend on temperature T and the dimensionality of the system. In two and three dimensions the usual Mott law applies at high T where the correlation length of the network is smaller than the sample thickness. As T decreases, the network breaks into sparse filamentary paths, while the Mott law changes to a different T-dependence, which is derived using the percolation theory methods. In one dimension, deviations from the Mott law are known to exist at all temperatures because of rare fluctuations. The evolution of such fluctuations from highly-resistive "breaks" at high T to highly-conducting "shorts" at low T is elucidated. Comment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
