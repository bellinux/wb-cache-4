25|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that local delivery of soluble neurotrophic factors {{at the site of}} autologous nerve grafting may enhance axon regeneration within the graft and help expedite functional recovery of a paralyzed target. Other {{evidence suggests}} that gene-therapy induced expression of neurotrophic factors within the <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> itself can also help enhance axon regeneration. Accelerating neuroregeneration and the reinnervation of a denervated target is critically important {{in order to reduce the}} possibility of permanent paralysis due to muscular atrophy.|$|E
25|$|Like other neurons, α-MNs send axonal {{projections}} {{to reach}} their target extrafusal muscle fibers via axon guidance, a process regulated in part by neurotrophic factors released by <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> fibers. Neurotrophic factors also ensure that each muscle fiber is innervated by the appropriate number of α-MNs. As with most types of neurons in the nervous system, α-MNs are more numerous in early development than in adulthood. Muscle fibers secrete {{a limited amount of}} neurotrophic factors capable of sustaining {{only a fraction of the}} α-MNs that initially project to the muscle fiber. Those α-MNs that do not receive sufficient neurotrophic factors will undergo apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.|$|E
50|$|Much work {{is still}} {{to be done to}} {{translocate}} the sensory feedback from the reinnervated <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> to the actual prosthesis, or to construct prostheses that are capable of providing appropriate stimuli to the reinnervated <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> according to the external stimuli received, so that the sensory feedback of the arm comes from its native physical position.|$|E

50|$|The {{patient was}} able to {{perceive}} all modalities of cutaneous sensation. However, instead of normal pressure sensing, she perceived tingling in response to touch on the targeted chest skin. The lowest threshold above which light touch could be sensed in the <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> was 0•4 g, while the control chest muscle had a light-touch threshold of 0•16 g; the thresholds were under 4 g at most points in the area while the control chest had a threshold of 0.4 g at its counterpart locations. The control chest demonstrated a much lower threshold hence higher sensibility. The patient {{was able to}} discern increasing, graded pressure. She felt more tingling as the test pressure increased. The patient also demonstrated perception of temperature. The mean threshold for coldness perception was 29•1 °C in the <b>target</b> <b>muscle,</b> and 29•9 °C in the control chest muscle. The mean threshold for warmth perception was 35•2 °C in the <b>target</b> <b>muscle,</b> and 34•7 °C in the control chest muscle. The patient was able to discern between sharp and dull stimuli and detect vibration at 19 of the 20 points selected for testing. All the above sensations perceived by the patient were described by the patient as occurring in her phantom hand.|$|E
30|$|In {{the group}} {{receiving}} injection guided by palpation, the physician identified a bony landmark and used palpation {{to identify the}} <b>target</b> <b>muscles.</b> <b>Target</b> <b>muscles</b> were selected based on the following aspects: (1) posture {{of the head and}} the neck at rest and during passive and voluntary movement, as well as biomechanical analysis of involuntary movement; (2) the location of neck pain or traction at rest and during passive and voluntary movement; (3) and the site of hypertrophy or stiffness of the neck muscles identified by observation or palpation.

Presumptive locomotor appendages, the abdominal swimmerets, were extirpated before their differentiation.

Therefore, <b>target</b> <b>muscles</b> and sense organs are unnecessary to the differentiation of normal motor output patterns in this simple invertebrate locomotor system...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{motoneuron}} growth cones {{to find and}} recognize their correct muscles has been a model sys-tem for studies on the mechanisms of target recognition in both vertebrates and invertebrates. For example, in both chick (see, e. g., Tosney and Landmesser 1985) and zebrafish (see, e. g., Eisen et al. 1986) embryos, motoneuron growth cones make stereotyped pathway choices as they extend toward the regions where their appropriate <b>target</b> <b>muscles</b> arise. Similarly, in both grasshopper (Ball et al. 1985 b) and Drosophila (see, e. g., Sink and Whitington 1990, 1991 a; Halpern et al. 1991) embryos, identified motoneuron growth cones extend toward and innervate the appropriate <b>target</b> <b>muscles</b> in a highly specific fashion. In vertebrates, much experimental evidence suggests that motoneuron growth cones make specific pathway choices (Tosney and Landmesser 1985). In addition, <b>target</b> <b>muscles</b> or other nearby mesodermal cells appear to express attractive guidance cues. For example, the growth cones of chick motoneurons normally grow to-ward the regions of their appropriate <b>target</b> <b>muscles.</b> If displaced experimentally, these growth cones often take circuitous routes to reach their same targets (Landmesser 1980; Lance-Jones and Landmesser 1981). Identified motoneurons in zebrafish establish cell-specific terminal fields primarily by directed out-growth of branches on appropriate muscle fibers (Eisen et al. 1989; Liu and Westerfield 1990; Pike and Eisen 1990). In the spt- 1 mutation that eliminates trunk mus-cles, the pattern of motoneuron axon branches is seri-ously disrupted (Eisen and Pike 1991) ...|$|R
50|$|An {{electromyograph}} (EMG) uses surface electrodes {{to detect}} muscle action potentials from underlying skeletal muscles that initiate muscle contraction. Clinicians record the surface electromyogram (SEMG) using {{one or more}} active electrodes that are placed over a <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> and a reference electrode that is placed within six inches of either active. The SEMG is measured in microvolts (millionths of a volt).|$|E
50|$|Autogenic {{inhibition}} (historically {{known as}} the inverse myotatic reflex or autogenetic inhibition) refers {{to a reduction in}} excitability of a contracting or stretched muscle, that in the past has been solely attributed to the increased inhibitory input arising from Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) within the same muscle. The reduced efferent (motor) drive to the muscle by way of autogenic inhibition is a factor believed to assist <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> elongation.|$|E
50|$|Targeted reinnervation has an efferent and an afferent component. Targeted muscle reinnervation is {{a method}} by which a spare muscle (the <b>target</b> <b>muscle)</b> of an amputated patient is denervated (its {{original}} nerves cut and/or de-activated), then reinnervated with residual nerves of the amputated limb. The resultant EMG signals of the targeted muscle now represent the motor commands to the missing limb, and are used to drive a motorized prosthetic device.|$|E

5000|$|A manual {{muscle test}} in AK is {{conducted}} {{by having the}} patient resist using the <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> or muscle group while the practitioner applies a force. A smooth response is {{sometimes referred to as}} a [...] "strong muscle" [...] and a response that was not appropriate is sometimes called a [...] "weak response". This is not a raw test of strength, but rather a subjective evaluation of tension in the muscle and smoothness of response, taken to be indicative of a difference in spindle cell response during contraction. These differences in muscle response are claimed to be indicative of various stresses and imbalances in the body. A weak muscle test is equated to dysfunction and chemical or structural imbalance or mental stress, indicative of suboptimal functioning. It may be suboptimal functioning of the tested <b>target</b> <b>muscle,</b> or a normally optimally functioning muscle can be used as an indicator muscle for other physiological testing. A commonly known and very basic test is the arm-pull-down test, or [...] "Delta test," [...] where the patient resists as the practitioner exerts a downward force on an extended arm. Proper positioning is paramount to ensure that the muscle in question is isolated or positioned as the prime mover, minimizing interference from adjacent muscle groups.|$|E

5000|$|Motor {{information}} travels {{from the}} brain down the spinal cord via descending spinal cord tracts. Descending tracts involve two neurons: the upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN).

Then, the lower motor neuron conducts the nerve signal to the spinal root where efferent nerve fibers carry the motor signal toward the <b>target</b> <b>muscle.</b> The descending tracts are composed of white matter. There are several descending tracts serving different functions. The corticospinal tracts (lateral and anterior) are responsible for coordinated limb movements.|$|E
50|$|Ophthalmologists {{specializing in}} eye muscle {{disorders}} (strabismus) had developed {{the method of}} EMG-guided injection (using the electromyogram, the electrical signal from an activated muscle, to guide injection) of local anesthetics as a diagnostic technique for evaluating an individual muscle’s contribution to an eye movement. Because strabismus surgery frequently needed repeating, a search was undertaken for non-surgical, injection treatments using various anesthetics, alcohols, enzymes, enzyme blockers, and snake neurotoxins. Finally, inspired by Daniel Drachman’s work with chicks at Johns Hopkins, Alan B Scott and colleagues injected botulinum toxin into monkey extraocular muscles.

50|$|Descending motor {{pathways}} carry motor {{signals from}} the brain down the spinal cord and to the <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> or organ. They typically consist of an upper motor neuron and a lower motor neuron. The lateral corticospinal tract is a descending motor pathway that begins in the cerebral cortex, decussates in the pyramids of the lower medulla (also known as the medulla oblongata or the cervicomedullary junction, {{which is the most}} posterior division of the brain) and proceeds down the contralateral side of the spinal cord. It is the largest part of the corticospinal tract. It extends throughout {{the entire length of the}} medulla spinalis, and on transverse section appears as an oval area in front of the posterior column and medial to the posterior spinocerebellar tract.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of descending fibers {{that arise from}} cells in the motor area of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. The impulse travels from these upper motor neurons (located in the pre-central gyrus of the brain) through the anterior column. In contrast to the fibers for the lateral corticospinal tract, the fibers for the anterior corticospinal tract do not decussate {{at the level of}} the medulla oblongata, although they do cross over in the spinal level they innervate. They then synapse at the anterior horn with the lower motor neuron which then synapses with the <b>target</b> <b>muscle</b> at the motor end plate. In contrast to the lateral corticospinal tract which controls the movement of the limbs, the anterior corticospinal tract controls the movements of axial muscles (of the trunk).|$|E
50|$|Surgery {{can be done}} in case a nerve {{has become}} cut or {{otherwise}} divided. Recovery of a nerve after surgical repair depends mainly on the age of the patient.

In contrast, a patient over 60 years old with a cut nerve in the hand would expect to recover only protective sensation, that is, the ability to distinguish hot/cold or sharp/dull. Many other factors also affect nerve recovery.
