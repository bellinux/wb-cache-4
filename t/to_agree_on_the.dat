5|$|In Westminster, {{the three}} {{government}} departments {{concerned with the}} British role in Sierra Leone—the MoD, the FCO, and DfID—struggled <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> objectives of the military deployment beyond the evacuation, which led to delays in issuing orders. Richards did not receive precise instructions until after Operation Palliser had commenced, and rules of engagement (ROEs) were not issued {{before the start of}} the operation. Commanders defaulted to the ROEs used in Northern Ireland, their most recent relevant experience.|$|E
5|$|Both {{houses of}} the National Diet designates the Prime Minister with a ballot cast under the run-off system. Under the Constitution, should both houses not agree on a common candidate, then a joint {{committee}} is allowed to be established <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> matter; specifically within a period of ten days, exclusive of the period of recess. However, if both houses still do not agree to each other, the decision made by the House of Representatives is deemed {{to be that of}} the National Diet. Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.|$|E

In November 2003, it was announced that a compromise was reached whereby Fornebu Boligspar would give the lot free to Stabæk, in exchange for a lot nearby. Two weeks later the compromise was rejected by FB. A new compromise was announced on 29 June 2004, whereby FB would give 50 million Norwegian krone (NOK) and a lot free to Stabæk in exchange for the commercial properties which would be part of the stadium. However, the following day the parties announced that they were not able <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> risk, as Stabæk demanded that FB take the full risk in the project.|$|E

5|$|Gonne's {{marriage}} to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began {{to visit him}} in London. After {{the birth of her}} son, Seán MacBride, in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.|$|E
5|$|Unsurprisingly, the {{two teams}} found much <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> French had no modern large jet engines, and had already {{concluded}} they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic Caravelle). As neither company had experience {{in the use of}} high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used– above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.|$|E
5|$|Harrison had {{developed}} {{his foreign policy}} based largely on Blaine’s ideas, and {{at the start of}} his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States' place in the world. In spite of their shared worldview, however, the two men became personally unfriendly as the term went on. Harrison was conscious that his Secretary of State was more popular than he, and while he admired Blaine’s gift for diplomacy, he grew displeased with Blaine’s frequent absence from his post because of illness, and suspected that Blaine was angling for the presidential nomination in 1892. Harrison tried to limit how many “Blaine men” filled subordinate positions in the State Department and denied Blaine’s request that his son, Walker, be appointed First Assistant Secretary, instead naming him Solicitor of the Department of State. Despite the growing personal rancor, the two men continued, with one exception, <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foreign policy questions of the day.|$|E

25|$|The fall of Saionji's second cabinet {{was a major}} reverse to {{constitutional}} government. The Taishō Crisis (so {{named for}} the newly enthroned emperor) erupted in late November 1912, out of the continuing bitter dispute over the military budget. The army minister, General Uehara, unable to get the cabinet <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> army's demands, resigned. Saionji sought to replace Uehara.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} now became extremely critical for Henry. As {{a result of}} the agitation, which was zealously fostered by the papal legate Bishop Altmann of Passau, the princes met in October at Trebur to elect a new German ruler.

25|$|In the {{constitutional}} convention that followed, a unicameral National Assembly was adopted. This {{came after the}} failure of {{the constitutional}} convention delegates <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> setup of the bicameral system that was favored by the majority. It also set the ceiling on its membership to a maximum of 120, that were to be elected every three years; similar to what the Jones Law had provided. It entitled every province, regardless of its population to have at least one representative. The convention likewise provided for the direct election of representatives from the non-predominantly Christian areas previously appointed by the U.S. Governor-General.|$|E
50|$|One {{place in}} England where the open-field system {{continues}} to be used is the village of Laxton, Nottinghamshire.

30|$|The {{demand for}} {{indigenous}} lands {{began to grow}} again when the liberals left power and the conservative period began. The haciendas, which were supported by the government, were now demanding land, and entire indigenous communities sometimes lived within a hacienda. However, communities continued to defend their rights assiduously. According to Ruiz (1997), one of their strategies was <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hacienda, but to organize themselves communally as before.|$|R
25|$|From 1847 to 1850, California had {{military}} governors {{appointed by}} the senior military commander in California. This arrangement was distinctly unsettling to the military, as they had no inclination, precedent, or training for setting up and running a government. President James K. Polk in office from March 4, 1845 – March 4, 1849, {{tried to get the}} 1848 Congress to make California a territory with a territorial government and again in 1849 but was unsuccessful in getting Congress <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> specifics of how this was to be done—the issue was the number of free states vs. slave states.|$|E
25|$|On October 20, 1883 {{hostilities}} between Chile and Peru formally {{came to an}} end {{under the}} Treaty of Ancón. Under the treaty's terms, Peru formally ceded the province of Tarapacá to Chile. Further, the agreement regulated the use of the guano and nitrate resources to repay Peru's debts. Chile was also to occupy the provinces of Tacna and Arica for 10 years, after which a plebiscite was to be held to determine nationality. For decades thereafter, the two countries failed <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terms of the plebiscite. Finally, in 1929, through US mediation, under President Herbert Hoover, the Treaty of Lima was signed by which Chile kept Arica and Peru re-acquired Tacna.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, the {{abolitionist}} movement split apart. Some advocates {{focused on}} {{working conditions and}} found common cause with trade unions and Marxists and socialist political groups, or progressive movement and the muckrakers. Others focused on the continued slave trade and involuntary servitude in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops {{became one of the}} primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the League of Nations and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery – human trafficking.|$|E
