5|$|In February 1996, {{a single}} Shore Line East weekday round <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} from Old Saybrook to New London. An additional round <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> extended in February 2010, and 3 more in May 2010 {{for a total}} of 5 daily round trips between New London and New Haven. Weekend Shore Line East service between Old Saybrook and New Haven Union Station began in 2008, but no regular weekend trains ran to New London.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, {{a single}} morning rush-hour round trip branded SLExpress was {{extended}} to Stamford, with a stop at Bridgeport plus eastbound-only stops at Stratford and Milford. An evening eastbound <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> also extended to Stamford with only the Bridgeport intermediate stop. This <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in Bridgeport and Stamford without having to make a transfer at New Haven. On June 24, 2002, additional Stamford trains were added, {{for a total of}} two westbound and three eastbound trains. When West Haven opened in August 2013, it was added to these trips as well.|$|E
5|$|The map the Workmans {{made during}} this <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> of low quality. According to Mason, the couple {{did not have}} a good sense of {{topographical}} direction, which meant that their measurements were inaccurate and unusable by the Survey of India.|$|E
50|$|A road <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> a long {{distance}} journey on the road. Typically, road <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> {{long distance}}s traveled by automobile.|$|R
40|$|The {{passive control}} of {{compressible}} boundary layer growth by boundary layer <b>trips</b> has <b>been</b> studied experimentally. Axisymmetric trips and three dimensional <b>trips</b> <b>were</b> {{used in this}} study. The nomial freestream Mach numbers are 1. 5 and 4. The results show that <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> effective in promoting boundary layer growth. <b>Trips</b> <b>are</b> more effective for Mach 1. 5 flows than for Mach 4 flows...|$|R
50|$|As {{was true}} for land use analysis, the {{approach}} developed at CATS was considerably modified in later studies. The conventional four-step paradigm evolved as follows: Types of <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> considered. Home-based (residential) <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> divided into work and other, with major attention given to work trips. Movement associated with the home end of a <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> called <b>trip</b> production, whether the <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> leaving or coming to the home. Non-home-based or non-residential <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> those a home base is not involved. In this case, the term production {{is given to the}} origin of a trip and the term attraction refers to the destination of the trip.|$|R
5|$|After {{a drunken}} and violent fight with Graham in 1938, Scott {{returned}} to Asheville. A group from Zelda's hospital {{had planned to}} go to Cuba, but Zelda had missed the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up {{when he tried to}} stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year during}} the winter holidays, Emanuel takes a family trip where his {{children}} can be exposed to other cultures {{and parts of the}} world. Prior family trips have been to Vietnam, India, Kenya, Zambia, and South America. His 2015 holiday <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> scheduled for the island of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{departure}} from Plymouth in March 1889, the Natives travelled to Melbourne, Australia. There the team played eight Victorian rules football matches and two rugby games. The team continued their journey to New South Wales and Queensland, where they played mostly rugby. This included playing each state side twice, {{as well as}} at least two association football matches. The final leg of the team's <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> another tour of New Zealand—this saw them lose only once, to Auckland in their final game.|$|E
30|$|Step 2 : If the {{destination}} information {{of the first}} <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> not available, another criterion is applied. If the time interval between the starting times of two consecutive <b>trips</b> <b>is</b> within 60 min, a transfer is identified between the two consecutive trips; otherwise, the two <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> identified as separate trips.|$|R
50|$|Road <b>Trip</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} and final album from American girl group Girl Authority. Unlike the first album, Road <b>Trip</b> <b>is</b> a mixture of cover songs and {{original}} songs performed by Girl Authority. Road <b>Trip</b> <b>is</b> also featured with a DVD, documenting a behind the scenes glance into {{the production of the}} album and the girls.|$|R
50|$|Inter-town <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> {{served by}} 403 Filcab vans and 708 jeepneys while inter-provincial <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> served {{by an average}} of 300 airconditioned and non-airconditioned buses and 88 Filcab vans.|$|R
5|$|In December 1944 Fleming {{was posted}} on an {{intelligence}} fact-finding {{trip to the}} Far East {{on behalf of the}} Director of Naval Intelligence. Much of the <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> spent identifying opportunities for 30AU in the Pacific, although the unit ultimately saw little action because of the Japanese surrender.|$|E
5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states. The general pattern of the <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> {{that he would be}} escorted between cities by the state militia, and he would enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all eager to be seen with Lafayette. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.|$|E
5|$|McGregor {{appeared}} in a two-part BBC documentary in April 2012 entitled Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission in which he travels by motorbike, boat, plane and foot to deliver vaccines to children in remote parts of India, Nepal and the Republic of Congo. The <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> part of {{his work as a}} UNICEF Ambassador.|$|E
5000|$|... 95 BLAIR - Some midday <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> {{shortened}} to end at Blair Station. Most {{of these}} <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> supplemental <b>trips</b> from Tunney's Pasture Station, {{particularly during the}} summer when service is reduced.|$|R
50|$|Senior Citizens: This is curb-to-curb demand {{response}} service {{for senior citizens}} (65 years and up). Medical <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> prioritized, and other <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> provided on a space-available basis. Passenger <b>trips</b> will <b>be</b> coordinated to serve {{as many people as}} possible and to use our vehicles in the most efficient manner.|$|R
30|$|Step 3 : If the {{destination}} {{of a bus}} <b>trip</b> cannot <b>be</b> identified in Step 1 and 2, the historical smartcard records of the bus passenger [39] <b>are</b> used. Bus <b>trips</b> that share the same route, same boarding stop, and similar boarding time with the unidentified bus <b>trip</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. The similar historical bus trip that has the most similar boarding time to the unidentified <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> identified. And {{the destination}} of the historical bus <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> inferred as the destination of the unidentified bus trip.|$|R
5|$|The airline {{operated}} seven weekly round trips from Ørland to Oslo, with weekday flights leaving Ørland at 7:40 {{and returning}} from Oslo at 18:00. No flights {{were made on}} Saturdays, but there were two round trips to Oslo on Friday, and to Ørland on Sunday. A single, weekly round <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> made to Aalborg from Oslo, leaving on Friday evening and returning Sunday afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> at {{the behest}} of The Sunday Timess {{features}} editor Leonard Russell; the paper's chairman, Roy Thomson, enjoyed the series so much he requested Fleming undertook a second trip. The book version includes material edited out of the original articles, as well as photographs of the various cities.|$|E
5|$|Adams joined Franklin and Arthur Lee in 1778 as a {{commissioner}} to France, replacing Silas Deane. He sailed for France {{with his}} 10-year-old son John Quincy aboard the frigate Boston early that year. The stormy <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> treacherous, with lightning injuring 19 sailors and killing one. Adams' ship was later pursued by several British frigates in the mid-Atlantic, but evaded them. Near {{the coast of}} Spain, Adams himself took up arms to help capture a heavily armed British merchantman ship, the Martha. Later, a cannon malfunction killed one and injured five more of the crew before the ship arrived in France.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the type of transportation systems needed to accommodate a proposed shopping center development, an understanding of the characteristics of shopping <b>trips</b> <b>is</b> essential. Shopping <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> complicated for two reasons: first, because a proportion of <b>trips</b> made <b>are</b> a part of a series of linked trips; and second, because the trips have a vwiety of origins and destinations before and after the shopping center site. The purpose of a site impact analysis is to predict the number and distribution of trips generated by a proposed new development and to identify the transportation systems needed to accommodate the combined site and background (non-site) traffic. Although the body of knowledge on the percentage of shopping <b>trips</b> that <b>are</b> linked <b>trips</b> <b>is</b> growing, no information has been published on how these <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> best distributed to and from the shopping center site...|$|R
50|$|A linked <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> a <b>trip</b> {{from the}} origin to the {{destination}} on the transit system. Even if a passenger must make several transfers during a journey, the <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> counted as one linked {{trip on the}} system.|$|R
50|$|Atthough {{most of the}} High <b>Trips</b> <b>were</b> in the Sierra Nevada, {{occasionally}} <b>trips</b> <b>were</b> {{scheduled to}} other mountain ranges of western North America, including Mount Rainier in 1905, Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and the Canadian Rockies in 1928.|$|R
5|$|After a {{year away}} from the bike, Marchant {{returned}} to cycling and turned professional in 1958. Within a year he left for Europe with Ron Murray and Alan McLellan on the professional racing circuit. The <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful. The group did not take their track bikes with them, with Marchant ordering one from Italy. The equipment never arrived and he competed in Belgium and Copenhagen on borrowed bikes. Marchant only displayed glimpses of his ability, defeating the Italian champion in one outing and also winning the La Trobe race in Tasmania. Marchant then retired in 1961.|$|E
5|$|An anchor from Fitzgerald lost on {{an earlier}} <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> {{recovered}} from the Detroit River and is {{on display at the}} Dossin Great Lakes Museum in Detroit, Michigan. The Dossin Great Lakes Museum also hosts a Lost Mariners Remembrance event each year on the evening of November 10. Artifacts on display in the Steamship Valley Camp museum in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, include two lifeboats, photos, a movie of Fitzgerald and commemorative models and paintings. Every November 10, the Split Rock Lighthouse in Silver Bay, Minnesota emits a light in honor of Edmund Fitzgerald.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E
5000|$|If {{this is the}} passenger's {{first trip}} using the card, or their {{previous}} validation was over two hours ago (for 1-4 zones, 3 hours for 5-8 zones), a <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> deducted from the card, and {{the information about the}} current <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> printed onto the front of the card. If the passenger is transferring between services, and their current <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> still valid, a [...] "T" [...] is printed onto the card (on 10-trip MultiRiders only).|$|R
50|$|Road trip, one of {{the more}} {{original}} elements of the hunt, is constrained by several factors. The furthest destination may be no more than 1,000 miles from Chicago and the <b>trip</b> must <b>be</b> completed between 8 a.m. Thursday morning and Saturday night. Additionally, road <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> completed with participants wearing ridiculous costumes. Items for the road <b>trip</b> <b>are</b> scattered throughout the main list.|$|R
30|$|Step 1 : If {{the time}} {{interval}} {{between the end}} of the first trip and the start of the second <b>trip</b> <b>is</b> within 30 min, a transfer is identified between the two consecutive trips; otherwise, the two <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> identified as separate trips.|$|R
5|$|Backed by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (present-day Argentina), a {{small band}} {{declared}} Brazil's southernmost province of Cisplatina to be independent in April 1825. The Brazilian government at first perceived the secession attempt as a minor uprising. It took months before a greater threat posed by {{the involvement of the}} United Provinces, which expected to annex Cisplatina, caused serious concern. In retaliation, the Empire declared war in December, triggering the Cisplatine War. The Emperor traveled to Bahia province (located in northeastern Brazil) in February 1826, taking along his wife and daughter Maria. The Emperor was warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of Bahia. The <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> planned to generate support for the war-effort.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{traveled}} to 79countries during this time, breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon. She {{did not hold}} a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role in}} U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's brigade {{departed}} on {{the same}} road it used to enter Wytheville, the road that leads to Tazewell Courthouse (Jeffersonville). It was a good decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for the return <b>trip</b> <b>was</b> occupied by troops {{under the command of}} Colonel John McCausland, and the other road was blocked by the command of Brigadier-General John S. Williams. Two cavalry units were in pursuit, including Major May's cavalry that had harassed the brigade as it approached Wytheville.|$|E
50|$|The no. 1 bus {{continued}} {{to follow the}} Druid Hill Park-Ft. McHenry routing until 1982, when selected hourly weekday <b>trips</b> <b>were</b> extended from Druid Hill Park to Sinai Hospital along Greenspring Avenue. In 1993, all midday <b>trips</b> <b>were</b> rerouted to Sinai Hospital.|$|R
50|$|Service {{learning}} <b>trips</b> <b>are</b> {{also offered}} {{to students in}} their final year. Destinations for these <b>trips</b> have <b>been</b> China, Nepal, India, Cambodia and Laos.|$|R
