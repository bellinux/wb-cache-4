40|$|Phonological {{field work}} is largely about {{establishing}} contrast in comparable environments. The notion of phonological contrast, however, can be confusing, particularly in {{its application to}} <b>tone</b> <b>analysis.</b> Does it mean phonemic contrast in the structuralist sense, or does it mean underlying contrast in the generative sense?

This paper critiques how tonal contrast is often supported in the literature and demonstrates that many supposed minimal pairs are invalid from a generative perspective.

It affects chewing muscles therefore the amplitude of jaw movement is decreased. It has localized pain and causes great discomfort to organs, that run almost nonstop in human lives – when we speak, eat, etc. Surface electromyography and invasive EMG are used in medical practice as muscle tone exams. Invasive electromyography is able to investigate small part of the muscle - one or more motor units. Surface electromyography covers a large number of motor units and records superpositioned myographic signal. Benefits of invasive EMG were seen during researches of muscle motor units. The action potential and its shape analysis allows basic identification and classification of motor units. Due to discomfort and risk to the patient, {{there are more and more}} attempts to capture electromyographic signs of pain using surface EMG method. Muscle tone changes are often recorded using surface electrodes, however, there is a lot of other artefacts that impact the amplitude of EMG.

In some cases this can be attributed to a sociolinguistic setting which does not favour vernacular literacy. In other cases, the orthography itself might be to blame. If the orthography of a tone language is difficult to user or to learn, then a good part of the reason, I believe, is that the designer either has not paid enough attention to the function of tone in the language, or has not ensured that the information encoded in the orthography is accessible to the ordinary (non-linguist) user of the language. If the writing of tone is not going to continue to be a stumbling block to literacy efforts, then a fresh approach to tone orthography is required, one which assigns high priority to these two factors. This article describes the problems with orthographies that use too few or too many tone marks, and critically evaluates a wide range of creative intermediate solutions.

40|$|Interaural time {{differences}} (ITDs) are {{an important}} cue for sound localization. It is generally agreed that ITDs are processed by “co-incidence detectors” specialized cells which receive input from the auditory nerve (AN) from both ears. Access to ITDs is often reduced for users of hearing aids (HAs) or cochlear implants (CIs), leading to poor localization performance. This suggests that temporal information is distorted {{by the introduction of}} HA or CI processing. In this work, we developed a model-based framework to evaluate temporal coding of ITDs at the AN level. The phenomenological model proposed by Zilany et al. (2009) was used to obtain AN responses to acoustic stimuli with varying ITDs from both ears. Afterwards, shuffled cross-correlograms (SCCs, Joris, et al., 2006) were used to quantify the ITD coding. This framework successfully predicted different ITDs imposed on various stimuli (pure tones, band-pass noise, amplitude modulated <b>tones).</b> <b>Analysis</b> showed that the predicted ITD resolution depended {{on the size of the}} SCC coincidence window. These results provide the bases for a quantification of ITD coding in normal hearing listeners.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design of}} a Low Noise ADP Research Fan stage. The fan is a variable pitch design which is designed at the cruise pitch condition. Relative to the cruise setting, the blade is closed at takeoff and opened for reverse thrust operation. The fan stage is a split flow design with fan exit guide vanes and core stators. This fan stage design was combined with a nacelle and engine core duct to form a powered fan/nacelle, subscale model. This model is intended for use in aerodynamic performance, acoustic and structural testing in a wind tunnel. The model has a 22 -inch outer fan diameter and a hub-to-top ratio of 0. 426 which permits the use of existing NASA fan and cowl force balance designs and rig drive system. The design parameters were selected to permit valid acoustic and aerodynamic comparisons with the PW 17 -inch rig previously tested under NASA contract. The fan stage design is described in detail. The results of the design axisymmetric analysis at aerodynamic design condition are included. The structural analysis of the fan rotor and attachment is described including the material selections and stress analysis. The blade and attachment are predicted to have adequate low cycle fatigue life, and an acceptable operating range without resonant stress or flutter. The stage was acoustically designed with airfoil counts in the fan exit guide vane and core stator to minimize noise.

[3 H]-Nicardipine was used as ligand. Human renal and right coronary arteries also were used as systemic reference arteries. Binding of [3 H]-nicardipine to sections of human pulmonary artery was time-, temperature- and concentration-dependent, saturable and reversible. In the human pulmonary artery, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was 0. 12 +/- 0. 02 nM and the maximum density of binding sites (Bmax) was 38. 15 +/- 2. 25 fmol/mg tissue. Kd values were 0. 3 +/- 0. 01 nM and 0. 5 +/- 0. 02 in the human renal artery and right coronary artery respectively. Bmax values were 248 +/- 16 fmol/mg tissue and 173 +/- 9. 5 fmol/mg tissue in the human renal artery and right coronary artery respectively. The pharmacological profile of [3 H]-nicardipine binding to sections of human pulmonary artery {{was consistent with the}} labeling of Ca 2 + channels of the L-type. It was similar in the pulmonary artery and in the human renal and right coronary arteries. Light microscope autoradiography revealed a high density of [3 H]-nicardipine binding sites within smooth muscle of the tunica media of human pulmonary artery as well as of human renal and right coronary arteries. A lower accumulation of the radioligand occurred in the tunica adventitia. No specific binding was noticeable in the tunica intima. Our data suggest that human pulmonary artery expresses Ca 2 + channels of the L-type sensitive to dihydropyridines. These sites have similar affinity and lower density than those expressed by systemic arteries. The presence of Ca 2 + channels of the L-type in human pulmonary artery suggests that their pharmacological manipulation may be considered in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension...|$|E

The current study employed behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures to investigate brain plasticity associated with second-language (L 2) phonetic learning {{based on an}} adaptive computer training program. The program utilized the acoustic characteristics of Infant-Directed Speech (IDS) to train monolingual American English-speaking listeners to perceive Mandarin lexical tones. Behavioral identification and discrimination tasks were conducted using naturally recorded speech, carefully controlled synthetic speech, and non-speech control stimuli. The ERP experiments were conducted with selected synthetic speech stimuli in a passive listening oddball paradigm. Identical pre- and post- tests were administered on nine adult listeners, who completed two-to-three hours of perceptual training. The perceptual training sessions used pair-wise lexical tone identification, and progressed through seven levels of difficulty for each tone pair. The levels of difficulty included progression in speaker variability from one to four speakers and progression through four levels of acoustic exaggeration of duration, pitch range, and pitch contour. Behavioral results for the natural speech stimuli revealed significant training-induced improvement in identification of Tones 1, 3, and 4. Improvements in identification of Tone 4 generalized to novel stimuli as well. Additionally, comparison between discrimination of across-category and within-category stimulus pairs taken from a synthetic continuum revealed a training-induced shift toward more native-like categorical perception of the Mandarin lexical <b>tones.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) responses in the ERP data revealed increased amplitude and decreased latency for pre-attentive processing of across-category discrimination {{as a result of}} training. There were also laterality changes in the MMN responses to the non-speech control stimuli, which could reflect reallocation of brain resources in processing pitch patterns for the across-category lexical tone contrast.

We propose using the Focus to Emphasize <b>Tone</b> (FET) <b>analysis,</b> which includes: (i) generating the constraints for foci, speaker’s intention and prosodic features, (ii) defining the intonation patterns, (iii) labelling a set of prosodic marks for {{a sentence}}.

An implementation of the system is described and the evaluation results on the CMU Communicator (CMU–COM) dataset are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{automatic}} recognition of music. Segments of digitized music are processed by means of a Continuous Wavelet Transform, properly chosen so as to match the spectral characteristics of the signal. In order to achieve a good time-scale representation of the signal components a novel wavelet has been designed suited to the musical signal features. Particular care has been devoted towards an ecient implementation, which operates in the frequency domain, and includes proper segmentation and aliasing reduction techniques to make the analysis of long signals feasible. The method achieves very good performance in terms of both time and frequency selectivity, and can yield the estimate and the localization in time of both the fundamental frequency and the main harmonics of each <b>tone.</b> The <b>analysis</b> is used as a preprocessing step for a recognition algorithm, which we show to be almost independent on the instrument reproducing the sounds. Simulations are provided [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{examined the}} distinction between single H and doubly-linked H of monomorphemic words (HL, HH) and bimorphemic words (H+L, H+H) in South Kyungsang Korean. The acoustic data in this study verify the previous transcriptions for the monomorphemic HL and HH contrast in this language. It was seen that the F 0 peak realizing a high tone occurs only in the first syllable for HL, but occurs both {{in the first and}} the second syllables for HH in monomorphemic words. However, the results do not confirm the transcription of bimorphemic H+H, that is, F 0 timing of doubly-linked H was different depending on the morpheme type, in contrast to previous research. The peak plateau is significantly longer in monomorphemic HH than in bimorphemic H+H. This suggests that the <b>tone</b> spreading <b>analysis</b> in bimorphemic H+H is not plausible and that phonetic realization, such as F 0 timing, might reflect the different morphological structure...|$|R
40|$|The neural {{mechanisms}} used in tone {{rises and}} falls in Mandarin were investigated. Nine participants were scanned while they named one-character pictures that required rising or falling tone responses in Mandarin: the left insula and right putamen showed stronger activation between rising and falling tones; the left brainstem showed weaker activation between rising and falling <b>tones.</b> Connectivity <b>analysis</b> showed that the significant projection from the laryngeal motor cortex to the brainstem which was present in rising tones was absent in falling tones. Additionally, {{there was a significant}} difference between the connection from the insula to the laryngeal motor cortex which was negative in rising tones but positive in falling tones. These results suggest that the significant projection from the laryngeal motor cortex to the brainstem used in rising tones was not active in falling tones. The connection from the left insula to the laryngeal motor cortex that differs between rising and falling tones may control whether the rise mechanism is active or not...|$|R
