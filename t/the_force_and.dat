Finally, the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> moments is used to explain the experimental results and to find out the particle-removal mechanisms...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the force}} was {{commanded}} by its commissioner, {{there was also}} an influential senior post of comptroller, created in 1880 in response to Macleod's financial mismanagement of the force. For most of the force's history the role was occupied by Frederick White, until replaced by A. A. Mclean in 1913. The comptroller was responsible for keeping account of expenditure, auditing and managing procurement, and effectively removed most of the non-operational functions from the commissioner's responsibility. White was a political client of Prime Minister John Macdonald, who took a close interest in the management of <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> <b>and</b> the post became critical for garnering support from Ottawa for investment in the police.|$|E

5|$|Du Bois {{opposed the}} U.S. {{intervention}} in World War II, {{particularly in the}} Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> <b>and</b> {{there were to be}} no African-American combat units– virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.The military later changed its policy, and units such as the Tuskegee Airmen saw combat. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.|$|E
5|$|Gales and fog {{prevented}} the British from conducting further attacks between 25 and 28 August. On 25 August Indefatigable, Formidable, two cruisers and seven destroyers refuelled from the oilers. Both of the cruisers later detached from <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>and</b> returned to Scapa Flow. Duke of York, Furious, a cruiser and five destroyers also sailed to the Faroe Islands to load supplies. Before leaving the fleet, Furious transferred two Barracudas {{and a pair}} of Hellcats to Indefatigable. As the elderly Furious was judged to be no longer capable of combat operations, she proceeded from the Faroe Islands to Scapa Flow with the cruiser and several destroyers. On 29 August Duke of York and the remaining destroyers rejoined {{the main body of the}} Home Fleet off north Norway. During this period, the flying squadrons' maintenance personnel worked to repair aircraft which had been damaged during the 24 August attacks.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, around 30 {{members of}} the Assiniboine First Nation {{were killed in the}} Cypress Hills Massacre, {{creating}} a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a Privy Council order to enact the new legislation, formally creating the North-West Mounted Police with the intention of mobilising <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>and</b> deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whiskey traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there would be a major uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the United States might choose to intervene. Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor's analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, the force's {{reputation}} {{suffered from}} the controversy and complaints persisted that the force was oversized, excessively funded and staffed by political appointees. By the 1890s, a political consensus had emerged in Ottawa that the western provinces should become autonomous and take up {{responsibility for their own}} policing; it was therefore time to plan for the closure of the force, which originally had only been intended to be a temporary organisation. The force was reduced to 850 men in 1893, and to 750 by 1898. The Conservative government stood for reelection in 1896 with plans to further reduce the size of the force, reportedly to 500 men, but lost to the Liberal party, led by Wilfrid Laurier. The new Prime Minister had stood for election on a platform of increasing the rights of the provinces to carry out law enforcement. He produced plans to halve the size of the mounted police as a first step towards eliminating <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> <b>and</b> proposed to establish a new militia regiment in the North-West Territories to fulfil any legacy military requirements.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Osan was {{the first}} U.S. ground action of the war. The fight showed that American forces were weak and {{unprepared}} for the war; outdated equipment was insufficient to fight North Korean armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better-trained North Korean troops– though the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly {{had a profound effect}} on the outcome of this and future battles. Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture. Smith also said he felt he had stayed too long in his position, allowing North Korean troops to envelop <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>and</b> cause heavy casualties as it retreated. These weaknesses would play out with other U.S. units for the next month as North Korean troops pushed them further back.|$|E

Luke is knocked out by one of them (Opie) and is found by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), who takes them to his hut. Leia's message explains that R2 contains the plans to the Death Star, which must be sent to her father on her home planet of Alderaan and asks Obi-Wan to help. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must learn the ways of <b>The</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> accompany him to Alderaan, and gives him his own lightsaber.

5|$|The first {{appearance}} of the mounted police in fiction occurred in Joseph Collin's The Story of Louis Riel, published in 1885. The police soon became a popular subject for writers, with over 150 novels about <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>and</b> its successor, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, being published between 1890 and 1940 across North America and Britain, along with magazine articles and publications for children. Gilbert Parker, James Curwood and Ralph Connor's works proved particularly popular and influential. Connor's Corporal Cameron, published in 1912, {{set the tone for}} many later books with a tale of its initially dissolute protagonist's redemption through service with the police. Numerous poems were written about the force, with the best known probably being the Riders of the Plains, which was first published in 1878 and later expanded upon several times.|$|E

5|$|The first {{contingent}} of police enlisted for a three-year term of service, but later recruits enlisted for five year periods, {{with the possibility}} of their purchasing an early discharge. Early in the force's history, the training of recruits was carried out on an ad hoc basis at the police's headquarters; in response, a depot for training new recruits created in Regina in 1885, based on the Royal Irish Constabulary Depot in Dublin, which took a much more structured approach. The use of the depot declined in line with the reduced number of new recruits joining the force after 1895, and was ultimately replaced by the new School of Instruction in 1899. Efforts were taken throughout the 1880s and 1890s {{to improve the quality of}} recruits being accepted by <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> <b>and</b> to tackle the related problems of early discharge and desertion, which was making staff retention a serious problem.|$|E
