The DIUs are 35 lb electronic units that transfer data between HST's main computer, solar arrays and other critical systems. A failure on Side A of DIU #2 experienced erratic current fluctuations and some data dropouts.

The drum brakes on the new solar array were applied to prevent them from vibrating during future observations. Claude Nicollier then took hold of the satellite with the robot arm. The satellite was then lifted and moved away from Endeavour. The telescope's aperture door was then reopened (a 33-minute procedure) and then released at 5:26 am EST. Commander Dick Covey and pilot Kenneth D. Bowersox fired Endeavours small maneuvering jets and moved the shuttle slowly away from HST.

40|$|Abstract [...] As the Department of Defense (DOD) downsizes {{there is}} a great need to reduce the cost and {{manpower}} burden associated with maintenance of weapon systems. Traditionally, technical manuals used for field maintenance of DOD systems have relied heavily on <b>troubleshooting</b> <b>procedures,</b> which are presented in "flow chart " format of fault trees. These flow charts guide the maintainer through test procedures to isolate parts that cause equipment malfunction. These procedures are static, that is, they are highly structured around a predetermined sequence of tests, do not become "smarter " over time with historical maintenance data, and only take into account those symptoms and faults which the original developer considered. They are often incomplete, sometimes wrong, and are very difficult to update and maintain. As maintenance evolved into the computer-assisted age, a major opportunity exists to significantly enhance the technical manuals, the basic logic, and information/knowledge representation underlying <b>troubleshooting</b> <b>procedures</b> [...] This paper provides the high lights of research and development results on the technical aspects as how to efficiently transition from flow-chart intensive knowledge representation to a knowledge-based system. The results of reengineering the legacy trouble-shooting procedures provides, at least, the following benefits: (1) replacing fault trees with knowledge based reasoning about faults related to symptoms; (2) providing the capability to dynamically relate faults to symptoms; (3) equipping the ability to use historical maintenance data to continuously improve maintenance capability; (4) providing more user-friendly interactive electronic technical manuals; and (5) providing the ability to house "expert " diagnostics information in a form that becomes usable and available to novice technicians.

40|$|The goal of decision-theoretic {{troubleshooting}} {{is to find}} {{a sequence}} of actions that minimizes the expected cost of repair of a device. If the device is complex then it is convenient to create several Bayesian Networks, each designed to solve a particular problem. At the beginning of a troubleshooting process, it is often necessary to help the user to select the proper model. Complications arise if the user is able to give only a vague description of the problem. In such a case we need to work simultaneously with many troubleshooting models. In this paper we show how models that were originally designed as independent models can be used together while memory space and computational time are kept low. We allow models to be overlapping, i. e., two or more models may contain equivalent troubleshooting steps and/or equivalent problem causes (device faults). We propose a <b>troubleshooting</b> <b>procedure</b> that can be used with many simultaneous models at once. The key that enables us to join the models together is the single fault assumption, which means {{that there is only one}} fault causing a device malfunction at a time. 1 SACSO Troubleshooting Approach We start with a review of the SACSO troubleshooting approach proposed for troubleshooting with a single model.

40|$|The thesis delves {{into the}} area of {{troubleshooting}} procedures, an interesting areafor industry. Many products in industry tend to be complex, which in turn makestroubleshooting procedures trickier. A fast and efficient repair process is oftendesired, since customers want the product to be repaired as fast as possible. The purpose of a <b>troubleshooting</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is to find a}} fault in a broken product,and to choose proper repair actions in a workshop. Such a procedure can besimplified by diagnosis tools, for example software programs that make faultconclusions based on fault codes. These tools can make such conclusions withthe help of algorithms, i. e. fault tracing algorithms. Before a product release, it is hard to specify all faults and connections in the system. New unknown fault cases are likely to arise after release, and somehow thisneed {{to be taken into account}} in the troubleshooting scenario. The troubleshootingprocedure can be made more robust, if new data could be easily incorporatedin the current structure. This work seek to answer how new data can be incorporatedin trouble shooting procedures. A good and reliable fault tracing algorithm is essential in the process of findingfaults and repair actions, which is the reason behind the focus of this thesis. Thepresented problem asks how a fault can be identified from fault codes and symptoms,in order to recommend suitable repair actions. Therefore, the problem isdivided into two parts, finding the fault and recommending repair actions. Inthe first part, three candidate algorithms for finding the faults are investigated,namely Bayesian networks, neural networks, and a method called matrix correlationinspired from latent semantic indexing. The investigation is done by trainingeach algorithm with data, and evaluating the results. The second part consists ofone method proposal for repair action recommendations and one example. Thetheoretical investigation is based on the Servo unit steering (SUS), which residein the IPS system of Volvo Penta. The primary contribution of the thesis is the evaluation of three different algorithmsand a proposal of one strategy to recommend suitable repair actions. In this study Bayesian networks are found to conform well with the desired attributes,which in turn lead to the conclusion that Bayesian networks is well suited for this problem...|$|E

First, we validate key FMEA parameters such as Failure Rate and Failure Mode Probability through an automated analysis of historical maintenance and operational data. Then, we update the TSM using information from the validated FMEA. Preliminary results from {{the application of the}} proposed approach to update the TSM for a commercial APU suggest that the revised TSM provides more accurate information and reliable procedures for fault isolation.
