25|$|<b>Transketolase</b> is {{an enzyme}} {{of both the}} pentose {{phosphate}} pathway in all organisms and the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. It catalyzes two important reactions, which operate in opposite directions in these two pathways. In the first reaction of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the cofactor thiamine diphosphate accepts a 2-carbon fragment from a 5-carbon ketose (D-xylulose-5-P), then transfers this fragment to a 5-carbon aldose (D-ribose-5-P) to form a 7-carbon ketose (sedoheptulose-7-P). The abstraction of two carbons from D-xylulose-5-P yields the 3-carbon aldose glyceraldehyde-3-P. In the Calvin cycle, <b>transketolase</b> catalyzes the reverse reaction, the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, the aldose D-ribose-5-P and the ketose D-xylulose-5-P.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transketolase</b> {{activity}} is decreased in deficiency of thiamine, which {{in general is}} due to malnutrition. Several diseases are associated with thiamine deficiency, including beriberi, Biotin-Thiamine-Responsive Basal Ganglia Disease, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and others (see thiamine for a comprehensive listing).|$|E
25|$|The enzymes <b>transketolase,</b> {{pyruvate}} dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are {{all important}} in carbohydrate metabolism. The cytosolic enzyme <b>transketolase</b> {{is a key}} player in the pentose phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose sugars deoxyribose and ribose. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is a major form of energy for the cell. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, while the reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and for myelin synthesis.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, <b>transketolase</b> {{connects the}} pentose {{phosphate}} pathway to glycolysis, feeding excess sugar phosphates {{into the main}} carbohydrate metabolic pathways. Its presence {{is necessary for the}} production of NADPH, especially in tissues actively engaged in biosyntheses, such as fatty acid synthesis by the liver and mammary glands, and for steroid synthesis by the liver and adrenal glands. Thiamine diphosphate is an essential cofactor, along with calcium.|$|E
25|$|Red {{blood cell}} <b>transketolase</b> {{activity}} is reduced in deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1), {{and may be}} used in the diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy and other B1-deficiency syndromes if the diagnosis is in doubt. Apart from the baseline enzyme activity (which may be normal even in deficiency states), acceleration of enzyme activity after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate may be diagnostic of thiamine deficiency (0-15% normal, 15-25% deficiency, >25% severe deficiency).|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the active site for this enzyme is made up mainly of several arginine, histidine, serine, and aspartate side-chains, with a glutamate side-chain playing a secondary role. These side-chains, to be specific Arg359, Arg528, His469, and Ser386, are conserved within each <b>transketolase</b> enzyme and interact with the phosphate group of the donor and acceptor substrates. Because the substrate channel is so narrow, the donor and acceptor substrates cannot be bound simultaneously. Also, the substrates conform into a slightly extended form upon binding in the active site to accommodate this narrow channel.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, {{individuals}} with alcoholic polyneuropathy have {{some degree of}} nutritional deficiency. Alcohol, a carbohydrate, increases the metabolic demand for thiamine (vitamin B1) because of {{its role in the}} metabolism of glucose. Thiamine levels are usually low in alcoholics due to their decreased nutritional intake. In addition, alcohol interferes with intestinal absorption of thiamine, thereby further decreasing thiamine levels in the body. Thiamine is important in three reactions in the metabolism of glucose: the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid, d-ketoglutaric acid, and <b>transketolase.</b> A lack of thiamine in the cells may therefore prevent neurons from maintaining necessary adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels as a result of impaired glycolosis. Thiamine deficiency alone could explain the impaired nerve conduction in those with alcoholic polyneuropathy, but other factors likely play a part.|$|E
25|$|Organic cofactors {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} (typically a molecular mass less than 1000 Da) {{that can be}} either loosely or tightly bound to the enzyme and directly participate in the reaction. In the latter case, when {{it is difficult to}} remove without denaturing the enzyme, it can be called a prosthetic group. It is important to emphasize that there is no sharp division between loosely and tightly bound cofactors. Indeed, many such as NAD+ can be tightly bound in some enzymes, while it is loosely bound in others. Another example is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is tightly bound in <b>transketolase</b> or pyruvate decarboxylase, while it is less tightly bound in pyruvate dehydrogenase. Other coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), biotin, and lipoamide, for instance, are covalently bound. Tightly bound cofactors are, in general, regenerated during the same reaction cycle, while loosely bound cofactors can be regenerated in a subsequent reaction catalyzed by a different enzyme. In the latter case, the cofactor can also be considered a substrate or cosubstrate.|$|E

[...] Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is a constituent of FMN and FAD which are necessary for many redox reactions. [...] Vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid or niacin), synthesized from tryptophan is {{a component of the}} coenzymes NAD and NADP which in turn are required for electron transport in the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, as well as many other redox reactions. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is a constituent of coenzyme A, a basic component of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism as well as the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxol, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine) as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is a cofactor for many enzymes especially transaminases involve in amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 (cobalamins) contain a corrin ring similar in structure to porphyrin and is an essential coenzyme for the catabolism of fatty acids as well for the biosynthesis of methionine.|$|E
