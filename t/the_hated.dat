5|$|John Heisman put {{together}} 16 consecutive non-losing seasons, amassed 104 wins, including three undefeated campaigns and a 32-game undefeated streak. From 1915 to 1918 Georgia Tech went 3012 and outscored opponents 1611 to 93 utilizing his jump shift offense. He would also muster a 5-game winning streak against <b>the</b> <b>hated</b> Georgia Bulldogs from 1904–1908 before incidents {{led up to}} the cutting of athletic ties with Georgia in 1919.|$|E

That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} panned in the state's newspapers, and by {{prominent}} citizens such as future governor James Turner Morehead. Yet Slaughter {{followed up with}} another unpopular decision, appointing Martin D. Hardin, a member of <b>the</b> <b>hated</b> Federalist Party, to fill the Senate seat of William T. Barry. Despite this, the General Assembly made the appointment permanent when it convened in December 1816. However, the administration candidate for a full senatorial term, John Adair was defeated in the General Assembly, which opted for John J. Crittenden.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>hate</b> {{speech is}} hatred expression, {{but it is}} thought that the {{constitutional}} regulation is difficult.

For example, one letter disputed the site's {{claim to have}} seen a real ninja {{on the grounds that}} [...] "there are less than 50 real ones left, and only 5 live in the US". Regarding the {{authenticity}} of <b>the</b> <b>hate</b> mail, <b>the</b> author said that some of <b>the</b> <b>hate</b> email is written by him, while others, such as the ones from an apparent real ninja signed Soke D.

5|$|The prisoners {{believed}} {{that they would be}} rewarded by the Empress Anna for getting rid of <b>the</b> <b>hated</b> Apokaukos,. She, however, was so shocked and dismayed at the loss of her principal minister, that she gave Apokaukos's supporters, who were joined by the Gasmouloi, the fleet's marines, free rein to avenge their leader's death. As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E
5|$|The silver Tetradrachm of Augustus from Antioch. Depicting Ancient Rome’s celebrated first emperor, who reigned from 27 B.C. to A.D. 14, this coin was hand {{struck in}} the great provincial city of Antioch – honored on the reverse. These coins of Biblical times were hand struck close {{to the time when}} Jesus was {{believed}} to have been born. And they were among the most prominent coins used to pay <b>the</b> <b>hated</b> temple tax, about which Jesus speaks in the biblical accounts of Matthew, Mark and Luke. Weighing about 15 grams and containing over 75% silver, these large attractive pieces are similar to the coinage circulated by Seleucid emperors in Syria before being conquered by Rome in 64 B.C.|$|E
5|$|Tyler and the Kentish men {{advanced}} to Canterbury, entering the walled city and castle without resistance on 10 June. The rebels deposed the absent Archbishop of Canterbury, Sudbury, {{and made the}} cathedral monks swear loyalty to their cause. They attacked properties in the city with links to <b>the</b> <b>hated</b> royal council, and searched the city for suspected enemies, dragging the suspects {{out of their houses}} and executing them. The city gaol was opened and the prisoners freed. Tyler then persuaded a few thousand of the rebels to leave Canterbury and advance with him on London the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The discontent finally {{erupted in}} April, when {{seven of the}} major English and Savoyard barons – Simon de Montfort, Roger and Hugh Bigod, John Fitzgeoffrey, Peter de Montfort, Peter de Savoy and Richard de Clare – {{secretly}} formed an alliance to expel the Lusignans from court, a move probably quietly supported by the Queen. On 30 April, Roger Bigod marched into Westminster {{in the middle of}} the King's parliament, backed by his co-conspirators, and carried out a coup d'état. Henry, fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned, agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen, half chosen by the King and half by the barons. His own nominees to the council drew heavily on <b>the</b> <b>hated</b> Lusignans.|$|E
5|$|As the {{celebrations}} {{in honor of}} Scott's military career continued across Kentucky, he began {{to consider the possibility}} of running for governor in 1808. By mid-1806, state senator Thomas Posey and Lexington lawyer Thomas Todd had already declared their candidacies. Posey had been chosen speaker pro tem of the state Senate and, with the death of Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell in 1804, had assumed the role of acting lieutenant governor and presiding officer in the Senate. He subsequently lost his senatorial re-election bid, but continued to act as lieutenant governor and preside over the Senate. His opponents claimed that since he was no longer a member of the Senate, he was not qualified to act as lieutenant governor; additionally, they charged that he was sympathetic to <b>the</b> <b>hated</b> Federalist Party, even though he self-identified as a Democratic-Republican. Although he was not successfully unseated as the Senate's presiding officer, the controversy diminished his chances in the 1808 election. In 1807, Todd removed himself from contention as well, accepting Governor Greenup's appointment to the Kentucky Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in late 1279 {{or early}} 1280, he {{returned}} to Euboea, landing in the norther town of Oreos and moving south towards Negroponte. His forces by now included many Spanish and Catalan mercenaries (the first time the latter are mentioned in Greece) and even former adherents of Manfred of Sicily, who had fled to Greece after Manfred's defeat and death {{at the hands of}} Charles of Anjou. As he reached Negroponte, the triarch Giberto II da Verona, Felisa's brother, and John I de la Roche, the Duke of Athens, who were present at the city, rode out with their forces to meet him. The two armies met at the village of Vatondas, northeast of Negroponte. The battle resulted in a major victory for Licario: John de la Roche was unhorsed and captured, while Giberto was either killed (according to Sanudo) or captured and taken along with de la Roche as a prisoner to Constantinople, where, according to Nikephoros Gregoras, the sight of <b>the</b> <b>hated</b> renegade, moving triumphantly among the assembled Byzantine court, caused him to drop dead.|$|E

He choked over passionate, incoherent invective. It was class <b>hate</b> first, then <b>the</b> <b>hate</b> of real manhood for a craven, then <b>the</b> <b>hate</b> of disgrace for a murder. No man so fair as a gun-fighter in the Western creed of an [...] "even break"! ...|$|R
5|$|In June 1341, Andronikos III died suddenly, and a power {{struggle}} developed between Kantakouzenos, who initially assumed the powers of regency over Andronikos's underage son John V Palaiologos, and a powerful faction around the Patriarch John XIV Kalekas, the Empress-dowager Anna of Savoy and Alexios Apokaukos on the other. The dispute soon developed in outright conflict when the Patriarch, the Empress, and Apokaukos replaced Kantakouzenos as regent and imprisoned his family and supporters. In response, Kantakouzenos proclaimed himself emperor at Didymoteichon in October. The news of Kantakouzenos's proclamation sparked a wave of popular resistance across Macedonia and Thrace. The common people, impoverished by an exploitative and over-powerful aristocracy, viewed Kantakouzenos {{as a representative of}} <b>the</b> <b>hated</b> aristocrats and rallied behind the legitimate Palaiologos line and one by one, the cities were seized {{in the name of the}} Constantinopolitan regency. Thessalonica at first remained tranquil, and Synadenos contacted his old friend Kantakouzenos with the intention of surrendering the city to him. Such a move might well prove decisive, as possession of Thessalonica would enable Kantakouzenos to control Macedonia, Thessaly and Epirus, and in March 1342, he set out from Didymoteichon with his army in the direction of the city. Before he arrived there, however, Synadenos was overthrown and driven from the city by a rebellion led by a radical popular faction, the Zealots. Apokaukos with a fleet came to reinforce the new regime, and one of his sons was installed as its new governor.|$|E
