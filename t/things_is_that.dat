500|$|Leigh's death {{received}} {{widespread and}} ongoing coverage {{in both the}} Sydney and Newcastle media, possibly due to a fascination with her reduplicated name. Between 1989 and 1994, The Newcastle Herald ran at least 39 stories on Leigh, 23 of them featured on the front page. At least ten articles on the case were published in The Sydney Morning Herald during the same period. Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a [...] "celebrity crime", and to Leigh being {{referred to as a}} [...] "celebrity victim". In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton, and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals, [...] stating [...] "I think one of the main <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people can identify with people involved. Had it of been a criminal from outside who stalked her and killed I think it would be long forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I {{thought that was a}} very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew." [...] "One of the <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dawkins expresses {{concern about}} {{increasing}} religious influence in British schools with over 7,000 faith schools already {{and the government}} encouraging more, so {{over half of the}} new City Academies are expected to be sponsored by religious organizations. He says that the most worrying development is a new wave of private Evangelical schools that have adopted [...] the American Baptist Accelerated Christian Education curriculum, and as an example calls on Phoenix Academy in London. Dawkins is shown around the school by head teacher Adrian Hawkes and remarks on how the teaching material appears to mention God or Jesus on almost every page; such as a reference to Noah's Ark in a science textbook. Hawkes responds by saying that the stories could {{have a lot to do}} with science if you believe in them, and that the science he was taught at school is laughable today. As an example, he mentions that he was taught that the moon came from the Earth's ocean and was [...] "somehow flung out into space" [...] during the early years of the Earth's life. Dawkins says that it should have been presented as a strong current theory. Another lesson talks about AIDS as being the [...] "wages of sin", so Dawkins inquires whether this might not be mixing health education with moralistic preaching. Hawkes responds that without a law-giver, [...] "Why is rape wrong? Why is pedophilia wrong?" [...] and that if people believe they can get away with committing bad deeds then they will tend to do them. Dawkins responds to this claim by asking Hawkes if the only reason he doesn't do these <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he's frightened of God and subsequently suggests that this attitude is characteristic of the warped morality that religion tends to instill in people.|$|E

6000|$|In {{this case}} the prima facie aspect of <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a thought of Mr. Bissett's about his stockbroker, dulce ridentem, somehow {{reflected}} itself into Miss Angus's mind {{by way of the}} glass ball, and was interrupted by a thought of Mrs. Cockburn's, as to her daughter. But how these thoughts came to display the unknown facts concerning the garden by the river, the felling of trees for a camp, and the bare feet, is a question about which it is vain to theorise.[17] ...|$|E

Captain What's-his-name had just {{reported}} himself under arrest, I understand, and Fletcher had received a note from you giving the grounds for this. The deplorable part of these <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they always happen in the most troublesome manner conceivable. In Berkeley's case the victim was a nephew of the Patriarch's. Samoval, now, was a person of even greater consequence, {{a close friend of}} several members of the Council. His death will be deeply resented, and may set up fresh difficulties. It is monstrous vexatious." [...] And abruptly he asked [...] "What did they quarrel about?" ...|$|E
60|$|Any {{prospect}} of awakening or coming to {{life to a}} dead man makes indifferent all times and places. The place where that may occur is always the same, and indescribably pleasant to all our senses. For the most part we allow only outlying and transient circumstances to make our occasions. They are, in fact, the cause of our distraction. Nearest to all <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> power which fashions their being. Next to us the grandest laws are continually being executed. Next to us is not the workman whom we have hired, with whom we love so well to talk, but the workman whose work we are.|$|E
6000|$|For his French Majesty, meanwhile, one of {{the worst}} <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he can get no hunting. Alas, no hunting henceforth; only a fatal being-hunted!

"Oh, I don't {{mean just}} the tree; of course it's lovely--yes, it's RADIANTLY lovely--it blooms {{as if it}} meant it--but I meant everything, the garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods, the whole big dear world. Don't {{you feel as if}} you just loved the world on a morning like this? And I can hear the brook {{laughing}} all the way up here. Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are? They're always laughing. Even in winter-time I've heard them under the ice. I'm so glad there's a brook near Green Gables. Perhaps you think it doesn't make any difference to me when you're not going to keep me, but it does. I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it again. If there wasn't a brook I'd be HAUNTED by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one. I'm not in the depths of despair this morning. I never can be in the morning. Isn't it a splendid thing that there are mornings? But I feel very sad. I've just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was to stay here for ever and ever. It was a great comfort while it lasted. But the worst of imagining <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{we are not}} at all {{concerned}} to dispute such positions as that Feeling is the right starting-point of moral education; that in forming character appeal should be to the heart rather than to the understanding; that the only basis on which our faculties can be harmoniously ordered is the preponderance of affection over reason. These propositions open much grave and complex discussion, and they are not to our present purpose. We only desire to state the evil of the notion that a man is warranted in comforting himself with dogmas and formularies, which he has first to empty of all definite, precise, and clearly determinable significance, before he can {{get them out of the}} way of his religious sensibilities. Whether Reason or Affection is to have the empire in the society of the future, when Reason may possibly have no more to discover for us in the region of morals and religion, and so will have become emeritus and taken a lower place, as of a tutor whose services the human family, being now grown up, no longer requires,--however this may be, it is at least certain that in the meantime the spiritual life of man needs direction quite as much as it needs impulse, and light quite as much as force. This direction and light can only be safely procured by the free and vigorous use of the intelligence. But the intelligence is not free in the presence of a mortal fear lest its conclusions should trouble soft tranquillity of spirit. There is always hope of a man so long as he dwells in the region of the direct categorical proposition and the unambiguous term; so long as he does not deny the rightly drawn conclusion after accepting the major and minor premisses. This may seem a scanty virtue and very easy grace. Yet experience shows it to be too hard of attainment for those who tamper with disinterestedness of conviction, for the sake of luxuriating in the softness of spiritual transport without interruption from a syllogism. It is true that there are now and then in life as in history noble and fair natures, that by the silent teaching and unconscious example of their inborn purity, star-like constancy, and great devotion, do carry the world about them to further heights of living than can be attained by ratiocination. But these, the blameless and loved saints of the earth, rise too rarely on our dull horizons to make a rule for the world. The law of <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they who tamper with veracity, from whatever motive, are tampering with the vital force of human progress. Our comfort and the delight of the religious imagination are no better than forms of self-indulgence, when they are secured at the cost of that love of truth on which, more than on anything else, the increase of light and happiness among men must depend. We have to fight and do lifelong battle against the forces of darkness, and anything that turns the edge of reason blunts the surest and most potent of our weapons.|$|E
