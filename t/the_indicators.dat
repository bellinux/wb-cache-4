5|$|Countries' peacefulness is {{measured}} {{on a wide range}} of indicators, 22 in all (originally 24 indicators, but one was dropped in 2008, and another in 2013). A table of <b>the</b> <b>indicators</b> is below. In the table, UCDP stands for the Uppsala Conflict Data Program maintained by the University of Uppsala in Sweden, EIU for The Economist Intelligence Unit, UNSCT for the United Nations Survey of Criminal Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, ICPS is the International Center for Prison Studies at King's College London, IISS for the International Institute for Strategic Studies publication The Military Balance, SIPRI for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Arms Transfers Database, and BICC for the Bonn International Center for Conversion.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of <b>the</b> <b>indicators</b> of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E

5|$|Where the Prime Minister's {{remuneration}} was concerned, the Committee {{recommended that}} it be pegged to twice of a MR4-grade minister's salary and doing away with the fixed service bonus. Instead, the Prime Minister will receive a larger national bonus. His annual bonus where the targets for <b>the</b> <b>indicators</b> have been met will be six months' salary, and 12 months' salary {{where they have been}} greatly exceeded. This will lead to a reduction in the Prime Minister's annual salary of 28% to $2.2 million (about US$1.7 million). Lee Hsien Loong said that he accepted the Committee's recommendations. He remains the best-paid head of government in the world, his proposed annual pay package exceeding that of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Donald Tsang, the political leader with the second-highest salary in the world (around US$550,000), by about three times; and that of the President of the United States Barack Obama (US$400,000) by over four times.|$|E

25|$|A study {{commissioned}} by the Norwegian government alleges methodological weaknesses, an uncertainty {{in the ability of}} <b>the</b> <b>indicators</b> to capture the underlying business climate, and a general worry that many countries may find it easier to change their ranking in Doing Business than to change the underlying business environment.|$|E
25|$|For 2012 the V70 and XC70 {{received}} a minor facelift. The front {{received a}} redesigned bumper with chrome accents, the Volvo logo {{on the front}} grill was enlarged. <b>The</b> <b>indicators</b> in the side mirrors were redesigned and changed to LED and the rear light cluster redesigned. New optional alloy wheels and exterior paint options were added.|$|E
50|$|Although {{seemingly}} ill-defined, derivatives of <b>the</b> <b>indicator</b> function can formally {{be defined}} using {{the theory of}} distributions or generalized functions: one can obtain a well-defined prescription by postulating that the Laplacian of <b>the</b> <b>indicator,</b> for example, is defined by two integrations by parts when it appears under an integral sign. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>indicator</b> (and its derivatives) can be approximated using a bump function (and its derivatives). The limit, where the (smooth) bump function approaches <b>the</b> <b>indicator</b> function, must then be put outside of the integral.|$|R

50|$|Developed by Bob English, <b>the</b> <b>indicator</b> calculates <b>the</b> {{percentage}} {{asset price}} deviation from a given MIDAS curve.

25|$|Fortunately for the codebreakers, {{the pattern}} {{predicted}} by the Herivel tip began to manifest itself soon after on 10 May, when the Germans invaded the Netherlands and Belgium.

25|$|Total CO2 {{emissions}} {{per unit}} of GDP, the “CO2 intensity”, decreased more rapidly than energy intensity: by 2.3%/year and 1.4%/year, respectively, on average between 1990 and 2007. emissions from energy combustion published in official inventories from the European Environment Agency. <b>The</b> <b>indicators</b> are not expressed under normal climate conditions (i. e. with climate corrections) {{to comply with the}} official definition of CO2 inventories.

30|$|Affecting factor can be {{classified}} into two types according to its desirability on <b>the</b> assessing <b>indicator.</b> <b>The</b> factor resulting in favour for <b>the</b> <b>indicator</b> (i.e. promoting <b>the</b> <b>indicator)</b> {{is defined as the}} desirable factor. On the other hand, the factor resulting in unfavour for <b>the</b> <b>indicator</b> (i.e. eradicating <b>the</b> <b>indicator)</b> is defined as the undesirable factor. According to the example, the higher the relative permeability of oil phase (kro), the higher the oil flow (qo). Thus, the relative permeability of oil phase (kro) is defined as a desirable factor to the oil flow (qo). Besides, the higher the oil viscosity (μo), the lower the oil flow (qo). Then, the oil viscosity (μo) is defined as an undesirable factor to the oil flow (qo).|$|R
