5|$|Meyerbeer's {{personal}} {{attachment to}} Judaism was a mature personal decision â€“ {{after the death}} of his maternal grandfather in 1811 he wrote to his mother 'Please accept from me a promise <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> always live in the religion in which he died'. In his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays, not by their Gregorian calendar occurrence, but by their Jewish calendar dates. Moreover, he regularly suffered from (and/or imagined) anti-Jewish slights throughout his life, warning his brothers frequently in his letters against richess (Yiddish for 'Jew-hatred'). Writing to Heinrich Heine in 1839, he offered the fatalistic view:I believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels: no matter how often one encounters it...it never misses its target if effectively wielded... can grow back the foreskin of which we are robbed on the eighth day of life; those who, on the ninth day, do not bleed from this operation shall continue to bleed an entire lifetime, even after death.|$|E
