5000|$|In 1884, {{the abbey}} opened a brewery inside the monastery {{in order to}} finance the monastery and {{contribute}} to charitable causes. Despite this goal, the brewery was run as a commercial enterprise. The abbey owned several bars {{in the area and}} produced lager under its own [...] "Trappist" [...] brand as well as contract brewing for several private labels. In 1969, the abbey licensed the brewing operations to the Artois Brewery (now InBev). In 1980 the deal with Artois ended, and the monks went back to brewing themselves, this time a <b>top</b> <b>fermented</b> <b>beer</b> which had only been made in limited quantities since the 1950s. Over time the brewery introduced more varieties, first with Dubbel and Tripel in 1987, then in 1992 they introduced Blond. Between 1993 and 2000, the brewery also marketed a brand called Enkel. The brewery also produces the world's only Trappist witbier. The brewery also used to produce the Jopen beer.|$|E

40|$|The {{consumption}} {{and production of}} <b>top</b> <b>fermenting</b> <b>beers</b> in South America and Brazil have great increased in the past years. Despite the great biodiversity and production of traditional alcoholic beverages, all Brazilian craft brewers still depend on imported commercial yeast strains {{as a result of}} total lack of information and studies about the use of indigenous strains in brewing. Hence, the costs of buying yeast are high and even more with the greater tendency to produce various beer styles and application of many different strains. From this perspective,this study aimed to selected indigenous South American yeasts able to produce high quality and flavorful <b>top</b> <b>fermented</b> <b>beers.</b> Ninety nine Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild strains, from different regions in South America(from North to South of Brazil, Ecuador and Galapagos Island) all from a variety of niches like environment strains (mainly tree barks) and from different musts of traditional spontaneous beverages with spontaneous fermentation (cachaça, traditional fruit wines, chicha etc.) were tested. Based on the maltose fermentation, 20 S. cerevisiae strains from the 99 tested were characterized with its different killer activity and selected to perform <b>top</b> <b>fermented</b> <b>beers</b> in different scales. Preliminary tests were performed on lab scale where it was evaluated the main fermentation parameters (attenuation degree, alcohol production etc.), fermenting sugars (HPLC) and the main aroma compounds (HS-SPME) produced by each different yeast. Based on these results, 12 strains were selected to perform brewing process on pilot scale. The same parameters described were analyzed, together with sensory analysis. Based on physiological aspects, fermentative capacity and production of desirable flavor compounds and final product, were selected yeasts with great potential and one indigenous strain was selected to be tested on an industrial scale, whereas all described parameters were also followed. In cooperation between Universities and Industry, the first beer with indigenous Brazilian yeast was produced in the facilities of a micro-brewery (Grimor Brewery, Brazil) and was released in the market. In addition to the results with high reproducibility as regards of the fermentation parameters and aroma compounds produced, the beer also was very approved by Brazilian consumers. This work showed {{for the first time the}} use of Brazilian S. cerevisiae strain as starter in the production of flavorfull <b>top</b> <b>fermenting</b> <b>beer</b> with no prior need for adaptations and attending industrial proportions. This may support and commence the building of an innovative beer yeast bank, which so far does not exist in Brazil and undoubtedly provides a basis for diversified beer brewing. This work encourages the greater autonomy to the sector in increasing expanding in the country, with knowledgeable brewing of cost-effective and flavor-rich new craft beers. The attractive results show undoubtedly a support to Brazilian sector and other yeast dependent countries that can point out the unique and high-valued biodiversity in brewing. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{distinctive}} flavours of {{many traditional}} <b>top</b> <b>fermented</b> <b>beers</b> include a significant estery component. It {{has been observed}} that when such beers are bottled and subsequently stored for a long period, they often suffer a significant loss of flavour active esters, especially isoamyl acetate. Two mechanisms of ester breakdown have been identified. One is chemical and can affect any beer, but the other involves the hydrolysis of the esters by yeast enzymes and only occurs in bottle conditioned beers and some unpasteurized brewery conditioned beers. The frequency and severity of this enzymic ester hydrolysis depends on the yeast strain used {{as well as on}} conditions during fermentation, maturation, bottling and storage. It appears that the esterases responsible are found only in the interior of the yeast cells so long as they remain viable, but are released by cell lysis. As a certain level of cell lysis is inevitable during fermentation and maturation (whether the latter takes place in the brewery or in the bottle), the only effective method of controlling this problem {{is likely to be the}} selection (or production by biotechnological methods) of yeast strains with the lowest possible esterase activity levelsstatus: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Despite of a well kept {{tradition}} over {{centuries to}} use oat as malted {{raw material for}} wort and beer production today this brewing cereal has been displaced almost completely. Ten different oat varieties where examined for their acceptability as brewing cereals and malted. The most favourable sample has even been used to brew different types of beer in pilot scale. The pilot maltings of these samples {{have been done in}} a 1 kg scale with 45 % moisture content, isotherm at 14, 5 °C (8 and 9 d vegetation time) and with a kilning temperature of 80 °C/ 3 h. The beer was brewed either in a 1, 5 kg or a 10 kg pilot plant. In both cases a lauter tun was used for solid-liquid-separation. Hot break was separated with a whirlpool. The wort was pitched at 10 °C with <b>top</b> <b>fermenting</b> wheat <b>beer</b> yeast (< 5 % dead cells, methylenblue-test) which was been cultivated several times in oat wort. After three days of main fermentation a maturation step at 16 °C and a two week storage time at 0 °C followed. The resulting beers have not been stabilised or filtered. The varieties differed only little. The malt with the extended malting time of one day demonstrated better levels of enzymatic activities and modification. Therefore the batch which was used for the brewing trials was malted with nine day vegetation time. All ten oat varieties had low levels of extract caused by the high level of husk material, which requires quite high proportion of water for mashing. The high portion of fatty acids was degraded only to a small amount. The low foam levels could be explained by the presence of fatty acids since they are not assimilated completely by the yeast. In addition fatty acids {{have a negative effect on}} flavour stability. In comparison to barley malt oat malt have considerably lower levels of enzymatic activity. On this account the enzymatic rests during mashing where noticeable laboured. Saccharification and lautering took place in a fast way. Main fermentation, maturation and storage ran smooth and efficient. All three beer types produced (Schank-, Voll- und Starkbier) offered a pleasant <b>top</b> <b>fermenting</b> aroma which still differ from the familiar southern german wheat beer aroma. The trials demonstrate that the cereal oat does contain a potential to produce a drinkable pleasing beer. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research {{carried out in}} the last few decades, continuous beer fermentation has not yet managed to outperform the traditional batch technology. An industrial breakthrough in favour of continuous brewing using immobilized yeast could be expected only on achievement of the following process characteristics: simple design, low investment costs, flexible operation, effective process control and good product quality. The application of cheap carrier materials of by-product origin could significantly lower the investment costs of continuous fermentation systems. This work deals with a complete continuous beer fermentation system consisting of a main fermentation reactor (gas-lift) and a maturation reactor (packedbed) containing yeast immobilized on spent grains and corncobs, respectively. The suitability of cheap carrier materials for long-term continuous brewing was proved. It was found that by fine tuning of process parameters (residence time, aeration) it was possible to adjust the flavour profile of the final product. Consumers considered the continuously <b>fermented</b> <b>beer</b> to be of a regular quality.
