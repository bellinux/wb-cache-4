At {{the end of}} the garden, through a five-bar gate, there lay a five-acre meadow that also belonged to the property and had been let out to two local women for their horses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> ferry road {{near the mouth}} of Little Wapwallopen Creek. A {{railroad}} bridge also crosses the creek. Historically, a road ran from a small settlement on Big Wapwallopen Creek to an even smaller one on Little Wapwallopen Creek, near where Church Road presently is. The Glen Brook Water Company once had plans to construct a dam on the creek and also on its tributary Pond Creek. The Wilkes-Barre Ice Company and the Hazleton Ice Company also dammed a stream in the creek's watershed in 1912 and 1916 respectively, forming the Ice Ponds.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi. He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall {{of the city that}} was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood, {{allowing}} the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets. He claims that the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half the height of the porphyry columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità. The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.|$|E

25|$|As an {{integral}} part of human culture and civilization, shoes have found their way into our culture, folklore, and art. A popular 18th century nursery rhyme is <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> Woman Who Lived in a Shoe. This story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a lot of children. In 1948, Mahlon Haines, a shoe salesman in Hallam, Pennsylvania, built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement. The Haines Shoe House was rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962. Since then, it has served as an ice cream parlor, a bed and breakfast, and a museum. It still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest of}} the Liepāja massacres took place on three days from Monday, December 15 to Wednesday, December 17, 1941. On December 13, Kurzemes Vārds {{published}} an order by Emil Diedrich, the Nazi police in Liepāja, which required all Jews {{in the city to}} remain in their residences on Monday, December 15 and December 16, 1941. The order came from SD headquarters in Riga; whether it was received by Kügler or his deputy, Reichle, was disputed, with both Kügler and Reichle later claiming Kügler was on leave in Germany. The Latvian police began arresting the Jews in the city on the night of December 13 to 14, bringing them to the Women's Prison, where they were confined in the courtyard. There was not enough room for the people, so they were ordered to stand facing towards the wall, and not move, look for relatives, or look at the guards, who beat people and treated them with brutality. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> wooden building, a garage, barn, or horse barn, at the beach at Šķēde. Some of the Jews were taken to this building on the evening of Sunday, December 14.|$|E

Cedd built monasteries at Tilbury {{in the south and}} at Ythancæster, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Roman fort, at what is now Bradwell-on-Sea, in north-east Essex.

At the time he saw the church, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> porch and the north door in the nave was still in use. He described the nave as [...] "unusually high", and said that the window positioned to light the pulpit [...] "disfigures the building." [...] He also thought that the [...] "high" [...] chancel walls gave [...] "great effect" [...] to the interior. A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region described it as a [...] "handsomely proportioned church" [...] It particularly noted the nave, describing it as [...] "broad, almost a square", with the chancel arch [...] "dying into the responds." ...|$|E

During that period <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> saying reflecting this characteristic: [...] "In Damascus, it takes only three men to make a political demonstration, while in Hama it takes only three men to get the town to pray." [...] The Christian population mostly adheres to the Greek Orthodox Church or the Syriac Orthodox Church.|$|E
2500|$|Zantzinger {{was convicted}} of {{manslaughter}} on August 28, 1963, and was not tried by a jury of peers but {{by a panel of}} three judges. The sentence was handed down {{on the same day that}} Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech in Washington. Bob Dylan, 22 at that time, was one of the celebrities at the march and on the journey home to New York City he read about the conviction of Zantzinger and decided to write a protest song about the case. According to a 1991 Washington Post report, Dylan wrote the song in Manhattan, sitting in an all-night cafe. A recent radio documentary on the song said rather that he wrote it both in New York and at the home of his then-lover, Joan Baez, in Carmel. According to Nancy Carlin, a friend of Baez who visited, [...] "He would stand in this cubbyhole, beautiful view across the hills, and peck type on an old typewriter... <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> piano up at Joan's... and peck piano playing... up until noon he would drink black coffee then switch over to red wine, quit about five or six." [...] He recorded it on October 23, 1963, when the trial was still relatively fresh news, and incorporated it into his live repertoire immediately, before releasing the studio version on January 13, 1964.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} year Laud initiated a visitation of all the dioceses in the Province of Canterbury, which was overseen in Staffordshire and Shropshire by Nathaniel Brent. This led to a widespread imposition of [...] "Catholic" [...] features, including altars and images. St Chad's was decorated with religious pictures, illustrating Biblical narratives. Studley, in his moment of triumph, was presented {{with the opportunity to}} leave the scene by appointment to a living at Pontesbury. Mackworth was closely involved in the issue of his replacement, as the right of appointment was claimed by the town. The bailiffs duly appointed Richard Poole on 29 March 1637. Close enquiry proved this to be unfounded. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> tradition, long since discounted, that St Chad's was a royal chapel, giving the Crown an opportunity to claim it as a royal peculiar. Laud challenged the appointment by a successful quo warranto action, and the living was taken back into royal hands. The issue was then subsumed into the town's renegotiation of its charter, in which Mackworth acted for the corporation. In 1638, a compromise engineered by Sir Richard Newport finally renewed the charter and left Poole in place, expanding the council and giving both the [...] "religious party" [...] of Mackworth and their opponents representation. Mackworth's position as an alderman of Shrewsbury was confirmed. In July of that year he married Mary Venables, his first wife having died in 1636.|$|E

2500|$|Eddington, {{of which}} ton means a small {{settlement}} or farmstead, is first mentioned in 1466 CE. [...] Between the 16th and 19th centuries {{it was a}} hamlet set among fields, with farms, tracks and roads. By 1800 {{it had become a}} junction between roads to Sea Street (Upper Bay), Underdown, Greenhill, Blacksole, Beltinge Fostal and Herne Bay. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> track which turned sharply, linking Parsonage Farm and Badcock Farm, and this track was upgraded to a turnpike road joining Herne Bay and Canterbury in 1814. In 1860 the Faversham-Ramsgate railway (now Chatham Main Line) cut through the roads to Sea Street, Beltinge and Blacksole, but the Canterbury Road had its own bridge under the railway embankment, and at that time it was realigned to fit. Terraced housing was built on Canterbury Road in the 1890s, and Parsonage and Badcock farmsteads were demolished around 1900. Parsonage Road was developed by 1930, but there was no more development until the 1950s at Eddington Lane. Between the 1950s and the 21st century, most of the remaining open land was built up, except for The Links. For example, in the 1990s Nurserylands housing estate was built to the north of Eddington Lane and facing onto Plenty Brook; however Vincent Nurseries to the south of the development retains a rural aspect. One of the more recent developments in 2001 was St Augustine's Court housing estate on the junction of Canterbury Road and the Old Thanet Way (A2990).|$|E
