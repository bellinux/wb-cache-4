5|$|World War II meant The Football League was {{suspended}} for seven years, but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post-war season, 1947–48. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the champions of England record. They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 1952–53. However, the war had <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Arsenal. The club had had more players killed than any top flight club, and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenal's resources.|$|E
5|$|On March 24, 1917, Baker {{played his}} last hockey {{game at the}} Winter Garden at Exposition Hall in Pittsburgh. The game pitted an amateur all-star team from Philadelphia, led by Baker, against an all-star team from Pittsburgh's amateur leagues. The Philadelphia team {{defeated}} Pittsburgh in overtime by a score of 3–2. Baker scored all three Philadelphia goals to net a hat trick. Baker began to tire of playing hockey after 1915; the constant physical play of opposing players on the ice had <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll,</b> and the growing professionalism of the sport went against his belief that sports should be played {{for the love of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{relationship}} having declined from friendship to hatred, Bogdan-Pitești's style and his mundane interests are occasionally seen {{as sources of}} inspiration for Caragiale's only novel, Craii de Curtea-Veche (completed in 1928). Some have noted that Bogdan-Pitești has {{a lot in common}} with {{at least one of the}} three protagonists. He and his wife were both characters in Ion Vinea's novels Venin de mai ("May Venom") and Lunatecii ("The Lunatics")—Alexandru as Adam Gună, Domnica as wife Iada Gună. Both novels portray the Bogdans' cultural circle, allude to their influence in making young people reject all conventionalism, and show them promoting vice as virtue. This lifestyle has <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Adam Gună, who is a physical ruin and slowly loses his hold on reality. Vinea's books repeat claims that Bogdan-Pitești was abusing drugs, and that Domnica was originally a prostitute.|$|E

5|$|Fears over a {{possible}} French invasion resurfaced {{several times in}} the 19th century, combined with rapid changes in technology, such as the development of steamships and shell guns in the 1840s, rifled cannon and iron-clad warships in the 1850s, and torpedo boats in the 1880s. This spurred fresh investment in those Device Forts still thought to be military valuable, and encouraged the decommissioning of others. By 1900, however, developments in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service simply too small to be practical in modern coastal defence. Despite being brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, by the 1950s the fortifications were finally considered redundant and decommissioned for good. Coastal erosion over the centuries had <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> and some sites had been extensively damaged or completely destroyed. Many were restored, however, and opened to the public as tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Australian {{commander}} {{issued a}} new operation order, reassigning {{the task of}} capturing the Christmas Hills area to the 24th Infantry Brigade and pulling the 20th Infantry Brigade back to Nongora to rest up for {{the next phase of}} the campaign, which would see them advance up the coast. The strain of the advance along the coastal route, which had been the 24th Infantry Brigade's main effort, however, had <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll.</b> As a result, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion was called forward again as the 2/28th was plagued by sickness and the 2/43rd was physically worn out. On the night of 4/5 December, the Japanese withdrew from their forward positions, leaving behind a large quantity of equipment and their dead. The following morning, a composite force of Australians from the 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions then took up the advance towards the Christmas Hills, ranging west, and undertaking a series of flanking moves in order to break into the Japanese main defensive position, where the Japanese were well-entrenched. A firefight ensued in which six Japanese and seven Australians were killed, before the Australian attack was turned back.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January {{a platoon}} of the 2/17th Infantry Battalion {{replaced}} a rope ladder, and after climbing it and two wooden ladders reached an area atop a cliff which {{had once been a}} Japanese headquarters. It would have been a formidable position if defended, but it was not. The main body of the battalion followed the next day. The Goaling River was crossed in small boats left behind by the Japanese on 13 January and it entered Nambariwa, where one prisoner was taken, six Japanese were shot, and nine found dead. On 15 January, Sio was taken. The Sio-Nambariwa area was found to have been the principal Japanese supply area, and a large number of fuel, supply, and stores dumps were found. During the advance from Fortification Point to Sio, 303 Japanese had been killed or found dead, and 22 captured. The 20th Infantry Brigade had lost 3 killed and 13 wounded, but 958 had been evacuated sick, mostly with malaria, and an epidemic of dengue had also <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll.</b> Large quantities of Japanese equipment had been captured, including six 75 mm guns, three 37 mm guns and three 20 mm guns.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1911, {{the strike}} had <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the coal companies. At least $500,000 had {{been spent on}} security, and coal {{production}} had dropped by 45 percent. The larger companies, however, used their financial reserves and income from non-mining operations (such as rental properties, company stores and even breweries) to withstand the economic pressure exerted by the miners. But all companies benefited from a significant slump in the demand for coal in 1910 and 1911, which leveled the playing field vis-a-vis their competitors.|$|E
25|$|Although Harald won the battle, {{the victory}} was not decisive since many Danish ships and men {{had managed to}} escape, {{including}} Sweyn. Denmark's economic and social fabric had been destroyed by the yearly raids, but the lengthy war had also <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> in Norway. After the Battle of Niså, Harald had trouble collecting taxes in the Uplands, and probably also in other areas. In 1064, Harald finally offered Sweyn unconditional peace without reparations or loss of land, and the two kings concluded peace.|$|E

25|$|A Javanese source, the Nagarakretagama canto 15, {{composed}} in 1365 in the Majapahit Empire, claimed Java had established {{diplomatic relations with}} Kambuja (Cambodia) together with Syangkayodhyapura (Ayutthaya), Dharmmanagari (Negara Sri Dharmaraja), Rajapura (Ratchaburi) and Singhanagari (Songkla), Marutma (Martaban or Mottama, Southern Myanmar), Champa and Yawana (Annam). This record describes the political situations in Mainland Southeast Asia in the mid-14th century; although the Cambodian kingdom still survived, the rise of Siamese Ayutthaya had <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll.</b> Finally, the empire fell, marked by the abandonment of Angkor for Phnom Penh in 1431, caused by Siamese pressure.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, time had <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Craven Park stadium, {{following}} the Bradford City stadium fire, capacity was restricted {{and the cost}} of safety work spiraled. Major renovations were needed to bring it up to scratch. Large amounts of money were spent on the ground each year repairing sections but once one section was repaired another would fall into disrepair. In 1988/89, their last full season at Craven Park, Rovers were relegated to the 2nd Division and Millward decided to stand down as coach. Wright Properties Ltd purchased Craven Park from the club and the final game was played there on 9 April 1989.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the unique}} {{structures}} of Igbo culture was the Nsude Pyramids, at the Nigerian town of Nsude, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay/mud. The first base section was 60ft. in circumference and 3ft. in height. The next stack was 45ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto, who was believed to reside at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> requiring periodic reconstruction.|$|E

25|$|The fort had {{a typical}} {{rectangular}} 'Playing Card' shape and had four gates, {{being surrounded by}} a ditch. Despite never having systematically excavated the site, archaeologists have found {{the remains of the}} headquarters buildings, a bathhouse and some barracks buildings through the use of geophysical survey. Remains of a nearby vicus have been found, and its traces can be seen through aerial photography. A cemetery was also discovered in the 20th century to the southwest of the fort, with examples of stone-lined burials and cremations sites. The fact that the fort is located on fields that have not been ploughed means its condition is remarkable, although stone robbing has <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll.</b> A column, probably from the colonnade of the Commandant's House, {{can be found in the}} nearby All Saints' Parish Church, as can an altar dedicated to the goddess Garmangabis.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the war the {{hospital}} in Martin had suffered serious damage. The consequences of fighting had <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> and buildings were in need of significant structural repair. It had also become necessary to supplement the lack of medical and technical material. Dr. Jàn Longauer became the new manager and things started to improve. A new generation of doctors arrived who contributed to the growth of professional and social prestige. One of those doctors was Dr. Vladimir Galanda who in Turiec developed a high level of medical care for children. Another was the father of modern Czechoslovak cardiac surgery Pavol Steiner, who performed in Martin the first open cardiac surgery in Slovakia. By the 1960s it had become a teaching hospital serving medical students from nearby Jessenius School of Medicine, and new departments were added continuously.|$|E
25|$|Vélez was {{involved}} in several highly publicized and often stormy relationships {{over the course of}} her career. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, she was linked to actors Tom Mix, Charlie Chaplin and Clark Gable. Her first long-term, high-profile relationship was with actor Gary Cooper. Vélez met Cooper while filming The Wolf Song in 1929 and began a two-year affair with him. The relationship with Cooper was passionate but often stormy. When angered, Vélez reportedly physically assaulted Cooper. Cooper eventually ended the relationship in mid-1931 at the behest of his mother Alice who strongly disapproved of Vélez. By that time, the rocky relationship had <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Cooper who had lost 45 pounds and was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Paramount Pictures ordered him to take a vacation to recuperate. While he was boarding the train, Vélez showed up at the train station and fired a pistol at him.|$|E
