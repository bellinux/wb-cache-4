5|$|After their capture, {{the pirates}} {{were held at}} a prison in Guayama before their {{transfer}} to San Juan. Cofresí met with mayor Francisco Brenes, offering him 4,000 pieces of eight (which he claimed to possess) {{in exchange for his}} freedom. Although a key component of modern myth, this is the only historical reference to Cofresí's hiding any treasure. Brenes declined the bribe. Cofresí and his crew remained in Castillo San Felipe del Morro in San Juan for the rest of <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> <b>On</b> March 21, 1825, the pirate's reputed servant (known only as Carlos) was arrested in Guayama.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz is commemorated as {{a leader}} of the initial {{resistance}} against French rule in Spain and, along with Velarde, is remembered in many monuments across the country. The ashes of Daoíz and Velarde, with those of others involved in the Dos de Mayo uprising, were transferred to the Monumento a los Caidos por España in Madrid after its construction in 1840. The monument originally served as a memorial to those who lost <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> the Dos de Mayo but on 22 November 1985 King Juan Carlos I redesignated it in memory of all Spaniards who died in war and it now serves as Spain's national Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.|$|E

5|$|Though {{it was one}} of the few {{combatant}} territories not {{to raise}} fighting men through conscription, proportional to white population, Southern Rhodesia contributed more manpower to the British war effort than any other dominion or colony, and more than Britain itself. White troops numbered 5,716, about 40% of white men in the colony, with 1,720 of these serving as commissioned officers. The Rhodesia Native Regiment enlisted 2,507 black soldiers, about 30 black recruits scouted for the Rhodesia Regiment, and around 350 served in British and South African units. Over 800 Southern Rhodesians of all races lost <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> operational service during the war, with many more seriously wounded.|$|E
5|$|About half {{of those}} who lost <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> the Wall {{were killed in the}} first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E

The Hull Daily Mail reported in March that Channel 5 were looking at Hull as a potential location for the series, but that the city council had urged residents not to participate.

5|$|One {{theory that}} has been {{advanced}} is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death, which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in {{a shift in the}} world view of people in 14th-century Italy. Italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art. However, this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century. The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.|$|E
