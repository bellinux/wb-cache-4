40|$|We {{describe}} an in vitro system that emulates the specific and efficient transcriptional termination {{associated with the}} human gastrin <b>gene</b> <b>terminator</b> in vivo. The system involves a dC-tailed DNA template containing the gastrin <b>gene</b> <b>terminator</b> sequence, purified RNA polymerase II, and purified elongation factor TFIIS. In this system, the basal level of termination by RNA polymerase II at the gastrin <b>gene</b> <b>terminator</b> is specifically enhanced by netropsin, an (A + T) -rich minor groove-binding peptide. This enhanced termination is maintained even with TFIIS, which normally suppresses termination at this site. In vitro termination is terminator sequence-specific. Mutant sequences that reduce or abolish termination in vivo show corresponding reductions in activity in the in vitro system. This in vitro emulation of in vivo activities of wild-type and mutant terminators strongly suggests that netropsin and a putative termination factor may share some aspects of their biochemical mechanisms. The general applicability of this system {{to the study of}} RNA polymerase II elongation and termination is suggested by the enhancement of termination seen at both the gastrin and human histone H 3. 3 <b>gene</b> <b>terminators...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to conduct a {{literature}} review to survey current technical and related literature on genetic use restriction technologies (GURTs). Topics covered include the nature of current or proposed GURTs, the potential benefits of GURTs, the risks and potential costs associated with GURTs, and a comparative study between GURTs and hybrid seed technologies. Since the initial patent for ‘terminator technology’ was granted in 1998, the issue of GURTs has been complex and divisive, with different stakeholders embracing widely opposing views. There are several strong arguments that have been put forward, both in favour and against the implementation of these types of technologies. Potential benefits include intellectual property rights protection, stimulation of private research and development, genetic diversity enhancement, transgene containment and production purposes. Potential risks and costs associated with GURTs include outcrossing of <b>terminator</b> <b>genes,</b> reduced access and increased cost of genetic material for breeders, greater necessity of regulating and field monitoring of new GURT technologies, liability for environmental damage, health risks, increased cost of seeds fo...|$|R

The first event, called GD743, is a promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> sequence to suppress the PPO transformation process. The second event, called GS784, is a marker gene which produces a protein (called NPTII) that makes the plant tissue resistant to the antibiotic kanamycin, allowing transformed plants to metabolize neomycin and kanamycin antibiotics.

40|$|The {{terminator}} {{concept and}} its impending consequences in agriculture have been hitting our daily newspaper headlines. The <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> if expressed within a seed, {{will mark the}} death of the seed and the target can be cotton, millets, rice, wheat or corn. the expression of the terminator itself can be modulated at will. the apprehension has been whether the engineered <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> will eradicate particular species of crop plants by preventing the seeds to germinate. Worse still, what if the trait spreads to nontarget crops? These questions evidently are of great concern to our farmers who have been following the age-old practice of saving a portion of their harvest for sowing the next crop and these seeds do not germinate whereas the seed he procures from the industry behaves normally! I have tried to explain here the scientific principles of the terminator concept and how it can be technically achieved without taking sides for or against...|$|E
40|$|Cross-pollination can {{be caused}} by birds, insects and wind. Genetically {{modified}} (GM) seeds are produced each year in a controlled environment to maintain their purity. However, pollen from the GM crop can be transferred to traditional crops. When the GM crop producers are in long-run equilibrium and buy seeds from a monopolistic seed producer, the resulting market equilibrium is identical to that when a seed monopolist produces the GM crop directly. When involuntary genetic contamination occurs, the monopolist eventually loses its advantage and stops its protection of GM seeds. A <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> can stop genetic contamination but imposes spillover costs on the traditional producers and reduces their outputs. genetic contamination...|$|E
40|$|Public {{opposition}} to the genetic engineering of food crops (GM food) has not been based solely on concern about biological risks. Economic risks have been widely cited too: the fear that the world's food supply will be concentrated {{in the hands of}} a few large firms, the fear that such firms will engage or are already engaging in anti-competitive practices, and the fear of the transfer of ownership rights over genetic resources to the private sector. Are these fears justified? We argue that the GM food industry may be on course for further consolidation, and this could be anti-competitive. In fact, policymakers face a dilemma: a stringent regulatory approval process enhances food safety, but at the cost of increasing market concentration. We argue also that the integration of seed and agri-chemical manufacturers may bias the introduction of GM traits in undesirable directions. Some business practices (such as tie-in contracts between seeds and complementary products such as herbicides) may have an exclusionary motive that warrants scrutiny on anti-competitive grounds, while some other practices (such as the use of <b>terminator</b> <b>genes)</b> appear more benign. Finally, we argue against granting patents on genes or even on gene 'functions'. Doing so may delay the development of socially beneficial applications. Copyright CEPR, CES, MSH, 2001. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{intergenic spacer}} {{of the mouse}} ribosomal genes {{contains}} repetitive 140 -base-pair (bp) elements which we show are enhancers for RNA polymerase I transcription analogous to the 60 / 81 -bp repetitive enhancers (enhancers containing a 60 -bp and an 81 -bp element) previously characterized from Xenopus laevis. In rodent cell transfection assays, the 140 -bp repeats stimulated an adjacent mouse polymerase I promoter when located in cis and competed with it when located in trans. Remarkably, in frog oocyte injection assays, the 140 -bp repeats enhanced a frog ribosomal gene promoter as strongly as did the homologous 60 / 81 -bp repeats. Mouse 140 -bp repeats also competed against frog promoters in trans. The 140 -bp repeats bound UBF, a DNA-binding protein we have purified from mouse extracts that is the mouse homolog of polymerase I transcription factors previously isolated from frogs and humans. The DNA-binding properties of UBF are conserved from the mouse to the frog. The same regulatory elements (<b>terminators,</b> <b>gene</b> and spacer promoters, and enhancers) have now been identified in both a mammalian and an amphibian spacer, and they {{are found in the}} same relative order. Therefore, this arrangement of elements probably is widespread in nature and has important functional consequences...|$|R

On 21 st August 2009, the Community Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed {{received from the}} German authorities a construct-specific method for {{the detection}} of flax CDC Triffid event FP 967, developed by Genetic ID, Augsburg (Germany). The method developer declared this method as specific for event FP 967 as it targets a transition sequence spanning the nopaline synthase (nos) <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> and the spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance gene, construction being found only in the flax FP 967 event. On 11 th September 2009, the CRL-GMFF received from the German authorities the FP 967 positive control in the form of DNA extracted from seeds. Seeds were provided to the German authorities by the University of California, Riverside, USA. The CRL-GMFF carried out experiments on the control sample received in order to verify the specificity and the Limit of Detection (LOD) of the construct-specific method. The CRL-GMFF observed that the NOST-Spec (nos terminator ¿ spectinomycin resistance gene) construct-specific method generates a PCR amplification product of 105 bp, whose sequence is homologous to a transition sequence spanning the nopaline synthase (nos) <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> and the dihydrofolate reductase gene. The experimental testing of the specificity indicates that the NOST-Spec construct-specific assay does not detect genetically modified events under the conditions reported.

40|$|The <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> can render seeds sterile, so forcing {{farmers to}} {{purchase}} fresh seed every year. It is a technological {{solution to the}} problem of market failure that could increase the appropriability of R&D investment more effectively than intellectual property rights legislation or patents. This paper shows that appropriability should be more than tripled and that this leads to greater private R&D investment, which may be expected to double or triple. This would bring open-pollinating varieties into line with F 1 hybrids, for which seed cannot be saved. In turn, the increased investment should raise yield increases to levels similar to those for hybrid crops. Thus, there are benefits to set against the possible ecological and environmental costs and the clear distributional and social consequences. The paper discusses the way the seed market is developing, the possible impacts, especially from a developing country viewpoint, and considers the policy changes that are needed...|$|E

40|$|During {{the closing}} {{years of the}} twentieth century, {{biotechnology}} overtook nuclear physics as the most controversial public issue in relation to scientific endeavour. The growing ability to manipulate genes, the basic building blocks of all life forms, {{gave rise to a}} range of environmental, economic, political, ethical, culrural, and spiritual concerns. Scientists and governments found themselves ill-prepared to deal with the complex issues associated with these concerns. Opposition to the technologies of genetic modification (GM) coalesced into an international social movement which saw citizens staging varying forms of protest action ranging from civil disobedience to attacks on laboratories and threats against the lives of scientists (Pringle, 2003). In India, peasant farmers marched against the Monsanto 2 ̆ 2 <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> 2 ̆ 2 which threatened the traditional practice of seed-saving from harvest to harvest.

40|$|The {{past few}} months have seen a spate of major {{companies}} getting together across the globe. It really is wild out there in 'merger mania' land, with big organisations gobbling up small ones and giants climbing clumsily into the same bed. There are big implications for ACP agriculture and food security. If {{you were looking for}} proof that the world has gone crazy, you would simply need to look back to the last few months of the past century and the opening months of the new one. You would conclude that whilst some of humanity s follies regional wars and climate change induced by human activities to mention but two continue unabated and unchanged, respect for the traditional laws of the market place appears to have been absolutely forgotten. Energy prices have soared to levels unknown since the 1970 s, pushing up the price of a bus journey from Yaoundé to Douala in Cameroon to over $ 7. In Europe, a young airline headed by a lad in blue jeans sells tickets that allow you to fly from England to Spain that s over five times the distance from Yaoundé to Douala for less than $ 20, and it claims this is profitable. In the Netherlands, in March 2000, a company selling services on the Internet announced annual losses of $ 10 million and was sold on the Amsterdam stock exchange for about $ 25 billion more than some ACP countries net worth. No wonder market analysts, and the man and woman on the street, are left shaking their heads in incomprehension. Driven by the need to maximise profits and obsessed with cost-cutting efficiency, companies worldwide are rushing to become the fittest of all, and to thus ensure their survival. The method many choose is the time-honoured practice of buying out suppliers and taking over competitors. It has happened in market places ever since traders first came together to barter and exchange. Nowadays, the language used by such companies hostile take-overs reflects the rough-and-tumble of such transactions, whereas other terms, such as strategic alliances and permanent partnerships, are less than economical with the truth in describing how big fish eat small fish. At first sight, {{it would seem that the}} dire predictions made in the heady 1960 s, about the control of the world economy falling into the hands of a few transnational corporations, are now coming true. It is easy to make a simple calculation, particularly in the area of agriculture, to 'prove' this point of view. During part of the past decade, the US corporation Monsanto expanded its activities from its established base of chemical engineering into the Brave New World of genetic engineering, focused on seed manipulation. Where has this taken the company? It is an often told story: the company identified a smart way to lock farmers into a permanent relationship by ensuring that they had a need for their products. One ploy was to introduce the so-called <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> into improved seed varieties of essential crops. By halting the natural process whereby plants generate their own seeds, this gene would mean that growers would no longer be able to select and store seeds from one harvest for growing the next. The idea has not gone ahead, at least not yet. Opinions are divided about it, to put it mildly. The chair of the Monsanto board passionately believes that by ensuring the continued high quality of its seeds, his company would make a significant contribution to world food security, as well as to its long-term profit margins. Cynics say that the latter objective, seen as greed, far outweighs the moral objective, seen as self-interested protectionism. So it may seem, but people who sit in boardrooms have a mixed bag of motives for doing what they do: a wish for personal wealth, a feeling of responsibility to the workforce and the company s dependent communities, a similar responsibility to shareholders and customers, and a general social commitment to, for example, equitable and sustainable food production. Monitoring trends The dramatic implications of the Monsanto initiative were seized upon by such bodies as GRAIN in Barcelona, Spain, and the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI) based in Manitoba, Canada. The mission of these non-governmental organisations is to promote and protect existing seed supply systems as part of the fabric of today s rural world, with special emphasis on countries of the South. They monitor trends that may endanger that equilibrium and they campaign against any undesirable developments. And campaign against the <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> they did, to such effect that Monsanto, not helped by some classic public relations blunders, announced towards the end of a turbulent 1999 that it was suspending its work on the programme. Mergers, conquests, value-added partnerships: what s in a name? Photo Corbis While the campaigners were prematurely celebrating their 'victory', Monsanto went ahead and continued a long-term strategy of mergers with related companies. The largest of its many steps along this road was to join forces with the American corporation Cargill, the largest seed distributor in North America, with activities worldwide. In January 2000, the Monsanto Corporation effectively disappeared from the map, by renaming its latest incarnation. Even if its work on the <b>terminator</b> <b>gene</b> continues to be suspended, the fact remains that much of the world s future seed supply and, equally awesome, of its research on new varieties is now concentrated in the hands of one transnational conglomerate. Similar trends are taking place in related fields of life science research: companies involved in the manufacture of agrochemicals, vaccines, and veterinary products and pharmaceutical companies like Ciba-Geigy, Rhône-Poulenc, Bayer, Hoechst have been moving in and out of mergers in the last few years, creating massive corporations with misty new names like Novartis and Aventis. The consequence of pooling programmes and patents again concentrates the knowledge of professional researchers with, some say, grave results for the future of Southern research, the ownership of indigenous knowledge, and the availability of scientific information. Their merging also tightens the links between research and the market place, with worrying forecasts that medical research priorities will be distorted. Some critics predict that research on new and resurgent strains of malaria will be dropped, since it is not as profitable as, for example, research on cosmetics based on plant materials from the rainforest. All along the food chain, mergers are concentrating power and profitability and are apparently eroding whatever flimsy influence the small farmer, trader, shipper, or processor ever had. In the field of finance, global mergers of banks are further marginalising ACP national banking services, enforcing attitudes of retrenchment and risk reduction not the sort of thinking that will encourage the innovative, and ultimately profitable, rural savings and credit schemes that are often essential to food security. Mergers and margins Perhaps the largest clouds on an already stormy horizon are in the allied fields of telecommunications and information. In Europe, North America and the Pacific Rim countries, transnational media corporations of unimaginable size are taking control of the means to exchange information, whether verbal, written or electronic, through mass media or between individuals. What, the everyday ACP agriculture professional may well ask, are the possibilities now for rural communication networks? How can the African Information Society (the jargon term for an Africa that participates fully on the global Internet and uses ICTs in all aspects of its economies and culture) flourish if it is primarily seen as a loss-making venture, with perhaps some market potential in five decades from now? And once the means to share are controlled by a few, and out of control of the many, will these few not start to dictate the content too? What will be the future for all our exciting networks of decentralised market information systems, women s banking programmes, alternative and fair trade, or specialised research? Merger mania is in the air, and not just in commercial enterprises. Non-governmental organisations in Europe are merging madly, as did the Dutch development co-funding agencies Bilance Cordaid. Environmental movements and trade unions, nationally and globally, have seen the values of pooling their work. National governments are slowly learning the benefits of partially merging, or at least sharing, their agendas. Regionalisation, whether in ACP or European terms, is also a form of merging. It might seem kind of funny, but merger mania may provide new opportunities for people who tend to think of themselves as being on the margin. Most mergers are in fact subject to the scrutiny and control of the stakeholders, in this case, the shareholders of transnational corporations (TNCs). Their accountability is often greater than that of many of the organisations that claim to operate in, and even to represent, civil society. Maybe the sincere partnerships developed by such TNCs in the food chain as Danone, Nestlé and Accor with suppliers and trade unions provide a model for moving forward, and away from a fear of mergers. Partnerships and openness there have to be. After the first wave of ACP independence there were several schools of thought that promoted self-reliance and autarchy, and 'de-linking' from the rest of the world. Globalisation, which barely allows such thinking today, may not be ours in the making, but surely it has to be ours in the taking.

In this work the feasibility of testing for the presence of viral CaMV’s DNA and analysis of screened gene sequences of interest for the usage during the analysis of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) samples. It was established that the analysis of the presence/absence of a positive result for the CaMV 35 S promoter is not giving complete answers to the absence of GMO in the sample. The appropriateness of GMO’s screening in rape seeds with NOS <b>terminator</b> and <b>genes</b> of interest...|$|R

Afterwards, the expression pattern and the maximum expression level were comparatively studied in both expression systems. The maximum enzyme activity of Cel 6 A-(His) 6 secreted in S. lividans supernatant after 84 -h of cultivation amounted to 5. 56 U/mL, which was dramatically {{higher than that}} secreted in P. pastoris about 1. 4 U/mL after 96 -h of cultivation. The maximum expression level of Cel 6 A-(His) 6 in S. lividans supernatant reached up to 173 mg/L after 84 -h of cultivation. The endoglucanase activity staining SDS-PAGE showed {{that there were some}} minor proteins in S. lividans supernatant which may be the Cel 6 A derivant by proteolytic degradation, while there was no proteolytic product detected in supernatant of P. pastoris...|$|R
40|$|The T box {{transcription}} {{termination control}} system {{is used in}} Gram-positive bacteria to regulate expression of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and other amino acid-related genes. Readthrough of a transcriptional terminator located in the leader region of the target gene is dependent on a specific interaction between the nascent leader transcript and the cognate uncharged tRNA. This interaction is required for formation of an antiterminator structure in the leader, which prevents formation of a competing transcriptional terminator stem–loop. The antiterminators and <b>terminators</b> of <b>genes</b> in this family are highly conserved in both secondary structure and primary sequence; the antiterminator contains the T box sequence, {{which is the most}} highly conserved leader element. These conserved features were investigated by phylogenetic and mutational analysis. Changes at highly conserved positions in the bulge and in the helix above the bulge reduced function, while alteration of other positions that were as much as 96 % conserved did not have a major effect. The disparity between sequence conservation and function {{may be due to the}} requirement for maintaining base pairing in both the antiterminator and terminator structures...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains {{capable of}} {{simultaneous}} secretion of bacterial glucanase and pectinase enzymes have been developed. The Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanase gene (end 1), the Erwinia chrysanthemi pectate lyase gene (pe 1 E) and E. carotovora polygalacturonase gene (peh 1) were each inserted between a yeast expression-secretion cassette and yeast <b>gene</b> <b>terminator,</b> and cloned into yeast-centromeric shuttle vectors. Transcription initiation signals {{present in the}} expression-secretion cassette were derived from the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase gene promoter (ADC 1 (p)), whereas the transcription termination signals were derived from the yeast tryptophan synthase <b>gene</b> <b>terminator</b> (TRP 5 (T)). Secretion of glucanase and pectinases was directed by the signal sequence of the yeast mating pheromone α-factor (MFα 1 (s)) These YCplac 111 -based constructs, designated END 1, PEL 5, and PEH 1, respectively, were transformed into S. cerevisiae. The END 1, PEL 5 and PEH 1 constructs were co-expressed in laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae {{as well as in}} wine and distillers' yeasts. DNA-RNA hybridization analysis showed the presence of END 1, PEL 5 and PEH 1 transcripts. Carboxymethylcellulose and polypectate agarose assays revealed the production of biologically active endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanase, pectate lyase and polygalacturonase by the S. cerevisiae transformants. Interestingly, although the same expression-secretion cassette was used in all three constructs, time-course assays indicated that the pectinases were secreted before the glucanase. It is tempting to speculate that the bulkiness of the END 1 -encoded protein and the five alternating repeats of Pro-Asp-Pro-Thr(Gln) -Pro-Val-Asp within the glucanase moiety could be involved in the delayed secretion of the glucanase.

40|$|RNA Polymerase II (Pol I 1) is {{responsible}} for the transcription of all protein-encoding genes. Pol II termination is dependent on RNA processing signals (both terminal intron splice sites, and cleavage and polyadenylation signals) as well as specific terminator elements located downstream of the poly(A) site. Detailed analysis of the human ~- globin <b>gene</b> <b>terminator</b> has shown that it contains a sequence-specific region that promotes rapid Co-Transcriptional Cleavage (CoTC) of the nascent transcript - an essential but not well understood step in the human ~-globin gene termination process. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the role of sequences within this CoTC-mediated terminator element in the termination process is investigated. Analysis of mutant terminator sequences indicate that homopolymer A tracts are important for Pol II termination. The second part of this study focuses on identifying the activity responsible for CoTC, by using the yeast S. pombe as a tool for genetic analysis. The results indicate that the human ~-globin <b>gene</b> <b>terminator</b> is inefficient in S. pombe, suggesting that a mammalian specific factor(s) are required. In the final part of this study, I describe an investigation into the possibility that the exosome subunit Dis 3 or the RNase III enzyme Dicer are involved in CoTC mediated transcription termination. While Dis 3 is not involved in the CoTC process my results on Dicer may imply a significant role.

40|$|Elevated {{sea surface}} {{temperatures}} from a severe and prolonged El Niño event (2014 – 2016) fueled by climate change {{have resulted in}} mass coral bleaching (loss of dinoflagellate photosymbionts, Symbiodinium spp., from coral tissues) and subsequent coral mortality, devastating reefs worldwide. Genetic variation within and between Symbiodinium species strongly influences the bleaching tolerance of corals, thus recent papers have called for genetic engineering of Symbiodinium to elucidate the genetic basis of bleaching-relevant Symbiodinium traits. However, while Symbiodinium has been intensively studied for over 50 years, genetic transformation of Symbiodinium has seen little success likely due to the large evolutionary divergence between Symbiodinium and other model eukaryotes rendering standard transformation systems incompatible. Here, we integrate the growing wealth of Symbiodinium next-generation sequencing data to design tailored genetic engineering strategies. Specifically, we develop a testable expression construct model that incorporates endogenous Symbiodinium promoters, <b>terminators,</b> and <b>genes</b> of interest, {{as well as an}} internal ribosomal entry site from a Symbiodinium virus. Furthermore, we assess the potential for CRISPR/Cas 9 genome editing through new analyses of the three currently available Symbiodinium genomes. Finally, we discuss how genetic engineering could be applied to enhance the stress tolerance of Symbiodinium, and in turn, coral reefs...|$|R

MultiSite Gateway cloning {{techniques}} {{based on}} homologous recombination facilitate the combinatorial assembly of basic genetic pieces (i. e., promoters, CDS, and <b>terminators)</b> into <b>gene</b> expression or gene silencing cassettes. pENFRUIT {{is a collection}} of MultiSite Triple Gateway Entry vectors dedicated to genetic engineering in fruits. It comprises a number of fruit-operating promoters as well as C-terminal tags adapted to the Gateway standard. In this way, flanking regulatory/labeling sequences can be easily Gateway-assembled with a given gene of interest for its ectopic expression or silencing in fruits. The resulting gene constructs can be analyzed in stable transgenic plants or in transient expression assays, the latter allowing fast testing of the increasing number of combinations arising from MultiSite methodology. A detailed description of the use of MultiSite cloning methodology for the assembly of pENFRUIT elements is presented.

To this end, a broad set of destination vectors and interchangeable building blocks have been constructed. The DNA modules were assembled on a scaffold of predesigned 4 nt overhangs covering three transcription units (each bearing promoter, <b>gene</b> and <b>terminator),</b> selection marker <b>gene</b> and genomic integration targeting sequences, constituting altogether thirteen elements. Previously validated DNA modules (regulatory elements and selection markers) were adopted as the Golden Gate bricks.
