5|$|CBS began a shortwave {{listening}} {{program in}} September 1939, on an experimental basis, at the National Lawn Tennis Championships at West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York. Engineers installed equipment at the CBS booth when the location was found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> reception, and monitors relayed European shortwave news to CBS headquarters in New York between tennis matches. Throughout World War II, CBS captured Allied and enemy shortwave communications {{from more than}} 60 international stations via secretly located receivers. Translations of intercepted broadcasts were teletyped to all New York newspapers, Associated Press, United Press International and International News Service, and in turn disseminated to newspapers and radio stations throughout the United States. Major headline news frequently resulted, since big stories often broke first on radio.|$|E
5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E

5|$|Frahm {{anti-roll}} {{tanks were}} fitted during construction, but these {{proved to be}} ineffective; the tanks only reduced rolling by 33%. Bilge keels were later added to improve stability, and the space previously used for the anti-roll tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage. The ship was able to carry an additional 180 t(200 short tons) of coal in the anti-roll tanks. Von der Tanns hull consisted of 15 watertight compartments, and a double bottom extended for 75% of the ship's length. The ship was known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> maneuvering characteristics, with a speed loss of 60% and a heel of 8degrees at full rudder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Catawissa Creek {{was found by}} the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> {{temperatures}} for trout habitation, {{but there was no}} aquatic life in the creek due to acid mine drainage. This situation continued through the 1960s and 1970s. However, by 1997, large populations of wild trout were found on some tributaries of Catawissa Creek. As of 2003, Catawissa Creek {{is considered to be a}} cold-water fishery between its headwaters and its confluence with Rattling Run. Several other tributaries, namely Dark Run, Davis Run, Little Catawissa Creek, and Messers Run are designated as high-quality cold water fisheries.|$|E

5|$|The Europeans (French, Dutch and English) in the Northeast {{developed}} a fur trade with natives, including the Five Nations of the Iroquois; beaver furs were most desired. However, in the 17th century, {{the dominance of}} what historian Daniel Richter refers to as “Francophiles” or French takeover, contributed to an erosion of French-native relations. The French mission to assimilate natives required the abandonment of native tradition, which was met with resistance. By 1667, large numbers of Huron and Iroquois, especially Mohawk, started arriving at the St Lawrence Valley and its mission villages, to escape the effects of warfare. Many traditionalists, including some Mohawk, resented the Jesuits for destroying traditional native society but were unable {{to do anything to}} stop them. However, traditionalists reluctantly accepted the establishment of a mission in order <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> relations with the French, whom they needed for trade. This cultural invasion increased tensions between the two factions.|$|E
5|$|The GCV {{must have}} been {{transportable}} by cargo aircraft, rail, and ship. The Army required it to meet the availability rates of the current Stryker. The Army did not limit the vehicle by {{the dimensions of the}} C-130 Hercules, which, in the past, constrained many designs. Air mobility would be provided by the more spacious C-17 Globemaster III. The GCV was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> cross-country mobility, with a baseline requirement of 30mph off-road speed. The GCV should have delivered higher sustainability levels and consume less fuel than the Bradley or other vehicles of similar weight and power. The military was accepting both tracked and wheeled designs. The operational maintenance cost requirement of the GCV was up to $200 per mile, compared to $168 per mile for the M2 Bradley.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of a reserve {{battalion}} during World War I, Himmler did not see active service. He studied agronomy in college, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed Reichsführer-SS by Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a mere 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and, following Hitler's orders, set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police). Himmler had a lifelong interest in occultism, interpreting Germanic neopagan and Völkisch beliefs to promote the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and incorporating esoteric symbolism and rituals into the SS.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{version of}} Wild Guns {{was set to}} be {{released}} {{in the third quarter of}} 1994 and was reviewed at the time, but the release was unexpectedly delayed until the third quarter of 1995. Reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly cited the cooperative multiplayer mode and challenging levels as the game's strongest points. They declared it one of the best shooters on the SNES and compared it to the Neo Geo game NAM-1975. GamePro praised the game for its intense action, fun cooperative multiplayer mode, colorful graphics, and ability to shoot almost any on-screen object. They remarked that the game is difficult even on easy, but that players are rewarded for perseverance. Nintendo Power found the game <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> graphics and control, and complimented the presence of both male and female playable characters. However, they believed the game was not as challenging as other shooters. A 32X version was reportedly planned for 1996, but never materialized.|$|E
