5|$|Alloying small {{quantities}} of tungsten with steel greatly increases its <b>toughness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fracture <b>toughness</b> is {{measured}} using a notched and pre-cracked rectangular specimen, {{of which the}} dimensions are specified in standards, for example ASTM E23. There are other means of estimating or measuring fracture <b>toughness</b> by the following: The Charpy impact test per ASTM A370; The crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) test per BS 7448-1; The J integral test per ASTM E1820; The Pellini drop-weight test per ASTM E208.|$|E
5|$|Several boron {{compounds}} {{are known}} for their extreme hardness and <b>toughness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's <b>toughness</b> or tenacity is only fair to good. <b>Toughness</b> {{relates to the}} ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it is vulnerable to breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The <b>toughness</b> of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.|$|E
5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} has {{no discernible}} odor, and its taste is unknown. It {{has been described}} as inedible due to its <b>toughness.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture <b>toughness</b> {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture <b>toughness</b> is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Between 1968 and 1991, {{the award}} {{was given to}} the highest goalscorer in any European league. This was {{regardless}} of the <b>toughness</b> of the league in which the top scorer played and the number of games in which the player had taken part. During this period Eusébio, Gerd Müller, Dudu Georgescu and Fernando Gomes each won the Golden Boot twice.|$|E
5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, structures are required to be of an acceptable strength, which is related to a material's yield strength. In general, as the yield strength of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in fracture <b>toughness.</b>|$|E
5|$|For instance, pure diamond is an {{electrical}} insulator, but diamond with boron added is {{an electrical}} conductor (and, in some cases, a superconductor), {{allowing it to}} be used in electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) and put the lattice under compressive stress, thereby increasing hardness and <b>toughness.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set {{his sights}} on Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive <b>toughness</b> and rebounding prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed. In retrospect, Auerbach's thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, and their ability to play defense was secondary.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{silicon carbide}} was studied in several {{research}} programs for high-temperature gas turbines in Europe, Japan and the United States. The components {{were intended to}} replace nickel superalloy turbine blades or nozzle vanes. However, none of these projects resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low fracture <b>toughness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} sea mussels to {{maintain}} their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles. Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus 770 times, tensile strength 58 times, and <b>toughness</b> 92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times.|$|E
5|$|When {{he signed}} with the Heat in 2010, Howard was lauded {{for his ability to}} play the power forward and center {{positions}} and for his professionalism. Howard also added frontcourt <b>toughness.</b> As an elder statesman with the Heat, he was regarded as a future NBA coach or general manager.|$|E
5|$|After an All-American {{career at}} the University of Notre Dame, Bavaro was drafted by the Giants in the fourth round (#100 overall) in the 1985 NFL Draft. He quickly emerged as a starter in his rookie season and became renowned during his Giants career for his blocking, <b>toughness,</b> and {{receiving}} skills. After a degenerative knee condition forced him to sit out the 1991 season, he returned to play three seasons for the Browns and Eagles before retiring in 1995. Since retiring Bavaro has done work as a pro-life activist. His brother David also played in the NFL for four seasons.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} criticized for not having led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he was the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and <b>toughness</b> were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability to perform well in big games.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Parker {{played the}} male lead in Rome & Jewel, a hip-hop take on Romeo and Juliet that got mothballed and re-released in 2008. Parker's title character, who is {{supposed}} to be the modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both tenderness and <b>toughness.</b> Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him but very familiar to the audience.|$|E
5|$|In {{gray iron}} the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of graphite, and also renders the {{material}} brittle {{due to the}} sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material. A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the <b>toughness</b> and strength of the material.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1934, Himmler oversaw the {{creation}} of SS-Junkerschule (Junker schools), institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and <b>toughness</b> as part of the SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence. The first schools were established at Bad Tölz and Braunschweig, with additional schools opening at Klagenfurt and Prague during the war.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular <b>toughness</b> at minimal cost.|$|E
5|$|Minutes {{before the}} NHL trade {{deadline}} on February 27, 2012, Hodgson was dealt, along with defenceman Alexander Sulzer, to the Buffalo Sabres {{in exchange for}} fellow rookie forward Zack Kassian and defenceman Marc-André Gragnani. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the trade {{as an effort to}} balance his team out by trading Hodgson's skill and finesse in return for Kassian's size and <b>toughness.</b> Analysts from TSN and The Vancouver Sun also echoed the sentiment, commenting that while the Canucks gained elements in Kassian that were required to succeed in the playoffs, Hodgson's skill set reflected the style of play that Vancouver's success was based upon.|$|E
5|$|Nickel {{is used in}} many {{specific}} and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, plating on plumbing fixtures, and special alloys such as permalloy, elinvar, and invar. It is used for plating and as a green tint in glass. Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons, in which it typically increases the tensile strength, <b>toughness,</b> and elastic limit. It is widely used in many other alloys, including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).|$|E
5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the <b>toughness,</b> strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless steels, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to {{high strength low alloy}} steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Playing college {{football}} for Louisiana State University (LSU), Taylor led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in scoring in 1956 and 1957 and earned first-team All-America honors as a senior. He {{was selected by}} the Packers {{in the second round}} of the 1958 NFL Draft and was used sparingly as a rookie, but with the arrival of coach Vince Lombardi in 1959 Taylor soon became the team's all-purpose back, especially when only a few yards were needed. In this role, his spirited performance against the Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game came to define his mental and physical <b>toughness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Browns began play in 1946, and Rymkus {{soon became}} an anchor of the team's {{offensive}} and defensive lines. He solidified his reputation for <b>toughness</b> by playing more than 50 minutes per game that year despite a knee injury for which he needed surgery immediately after the season. On defense, Rymkus helped stop opponents' rushing attacks and disrupt the opposing quarterback. On offense, he helped protect quarterback Otto Graham and opened up running room for fullback Marion Motley. Graham led the AAFC in total passing yards over its four years of existence, while Motley {{led the league in}} rushing.|$|E
5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give into American history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its <b>toughness,</b> foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E
5|$|Corley instituted {{sweeping}} changes in {{leadership in the}} regiment, hoping to improve its combat performance. He was able {{to cut down on}} straggling to a degree with more strict threats of court martial, but this had a negative effect on the regiment's morale. He began a unit newspaper, eventually called Eagle Forward, and moved to allow more discourse for the soldiers and leaders of the unit, and this was shown to improve the morale to a degree. Wanting to build a sense of pride in the unit, he sought to emphasize the <b>toughness</b> of the battles the regiment had seen, and played up its victory at the Battle of Yechon while downplaying other poor performances.|$|E
5|$|During in-game cutscenes, the polygon {{count is}} {{increased}} to nearly 2,500 polygons, especially on character faces. Capcom added detail to the zombie enemies unprecedented in the series, such as making their jaws move and eyes twitch. Claire {{was given a}} tougher appearance in Code: Veronica than in Resident Evil 2, the reason being her experiences in Resident Evil 2 built her <b>toughness</b> and confidence to handle any situation. This characterization is emphasized by her ability to dual wield sub-machine guns, and also by the opening cinematic which features her in a John Woo-inspired action scene. Mikami described Code: Veronica as 50-60% of his perfect vision for Resident Evil in February 2001, and he cited that future Resident Evil projects may make up the other half.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} Sōshū tradition, {{from the late}} Kamakura period to the {{beginning}} of the Nanboku-chō period, the smiths' goal was to produce swords that exhibited splendor and <b>toughness,</b> incorporating some of the best features of the Bizen and Yamashiro traditions. The Midare Shintōgo by Awataguchi Kunitsuna's son, Shintōgo Kunimitsu, is considered to be the first true Sōshū tradition blade. Shintōgo Kunimitsu was the teacher of Yukimitsu and of Masamune who is widely recognized as Japan's greatest swordsmith. Together with Sadamune, whose work looks modest compared to Masamune's, these are the most representative smiths of the early Sōshū tradition. Sōshū tradition sugata is characterized by a shallow torii-zori, bigger mihaba, smaller kasane, medium or large kissaki. The jihada is mostly itame-hada with ji-nie and chikei and the hamon is gunome, midareba and hitatsura. Nie, sunagashi and kinsuji are often visible in the hamon.|$|E
5|$|Louise Arbour {{began her}} job as Chief Prosecutor of war crimes at the UN in October 1996. She was {{unexpectedly}} selected by her predecessor, Richard Goldstone, as he believed she processed the <b>toughness</b> to pursue war crime suspects and the bureaucratic and diplomatic skills to function at the UN. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, contrary to Goldstone's tactic of publicizing indictments, which allowed the accused to make their arrest a risk to the ceasefire, Arbour kept hers sealed allowing for surprise arrests. In Rwanda she achieved several high-profile prosecutions, including the first conviction for rape as a war crime. By time she left in Fall 1999, her office had Slobodan Milošević, a head of state, indicted and arrested.|$|E
25|$|Fracture <b>toughness</b> is {{required}} to alter the crack propagation in ceramics. It is helpful to evaluate the serviceability, performance and long term clinical success of biomaterials. It is reported that the high fracture <b>toughness</b> material improved clinical performance and reliability as compare to low fracture <b>toughness.</b> It can be measured by many methods e.g. indentation fracture, indentation strength, single edge notched beam, single edge pre cracked beam and double cantilever beam.|$|E
25|$|HY-80 {{is a low}} carbon, {{low alloy}} steel with nickel, {{chromium}} and molybdenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) as alloying elements. It has excellent weldability and notch <b>toughness</b> along with good ductility even in welded sections. Their strength and <b>toughness</b> develops during manufacture by a heat-treatment process of quenching and tempering.|$|E
25|$|Toughness: <b>toughness</b> is {{the amount}} of energy that a {{material}} can absorb before fracture.|$|E
25|$|Case-hardened steel {{combines}} extreme hardness {{and extreme}} <b>toughness,</b> {{something which is}} not readily matched by homogeneous alloys since hard steel alone tends to be brittle.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene with {{multimodal}} {{molecular weight}} distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, <b>toughness,</b> strength, stress crack resistance and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molekularerer polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing <b>toughness</b> and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal {{molecular weight distribution}} can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.|$|E
25|$|Notch <b>toughness</b> is {{a measure}} of tear resistance, a steel's ability to resist further tearing from a {{pre-existing}} notch. It is usually evaluated as the tear-yield ratio, the ratio of tear resistance to yield strength.|$|E
25|$|Dempsey is {{also known}} for his <b>toughness</b> and {{leadership}} qualities on the field, though he has occasionally been prone to over-aggressive play including several physical altercations with opponents, teammates, and officials {{over the course of}} his career.|$|E
