5|$|In 1902, two Port Orford cedar {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} east side of City Hall. One <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> planted on the north side and the second tree on the south side of the {{building}} to reinforce the symmetrical aspects of the building. The south <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> replaced in 1999 due to poor health. In 1910, the city added passenger elevators to the open stairwells.|$|E

5|$|Following the fire, experts {{recommended}} that the Webster Sycamore be felled or fenced off as a security measure. According to the Division of Forestry, the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> finally brought down {{during the summer of}} 2010.|$|E
40|$|Each edge-weight {{appears on}} at most one more edge {{than any other}} edge-weight. Mark Hovey (1991) conjectured that all <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> k-cordial for any integer k. Cahit (1987) had shown earlier that all <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> 2 -cordial and Hovey proved that all <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> 3, 4, and 5 -cordial. We show that all <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> six-cordial by an {{adjustment}} of the test proposed by Hovey to show all <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> k-cordial...|$|R

50|$|Aluminium Christmas <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> {{a type of}} {{artificial}} <b>tree</b> that <b>are</b> made largely from aluminium. The <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> manufactured in the United States, first in Chicago in 1958, and later in Manitowoc, Wisconsin {{where the majority of}} the <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> produced. Aluminum <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> manufactured into the 1970s, and had their height of popularity from their inception until about 1965. That year A Charlie Brown Christmas aired for the first time, and its negative portrayal of aluminium Christmas <b>trees</b> <b>is</b> credited for a subsequent decline in sales.|$|R
5|$|In January 2016, the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> again {{attacked}} (along with Pi Jove) with a 10cm chainsaw {{cut into}} one of the other trunks. This damage was quickly patched up with steel straps as before.|$|E
5|$|Kuhn led an {{initiative}} to plant podocarpus trees in downtown Tampa, {{for which he}} was named Man of the Year a year before his death. A <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> planted on Bayshore Boulevard in his honor. He died at his home in Tampa on October 8, 1968.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 1995, a <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{planted in}} Columbia Park by The Friends of Madrona Marsh {{to commemorate the}} 25th anniversary of Earth Day.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the park}} {{initially}} {{had been planned}} as a pet-friendly zone, {{the decision was made}} to forbid dogs and other pets. During constructions 900 mature <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> removed, and 1000 young <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> planted. Only 38 pre-existing <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> planned to survive the construction, while 160 of the removed <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> marked for recycling.|$|R

5|$|Ownership of {{the timber}} land around the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} {{acquired by the}} Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust, which leased the timbering rights to the North East Lumber Company. Under the lease agreement, the North East Lumber Company only paid for the lumber that it cleared from the land. The company found the Mingo Oak too large to cut down, and assessed that its removal was too costly to undertake. The Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust also leased out the land where the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> located to the Island Creek Coal Company for mining.|$|E

5|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> felled on September 23 {{during a}} {{ceremony}} attended by between 2,500 and 3,000 people. Among those in attendance were state forester D.B. Griffin, {{the president of}} the Island Creek Coal Company, E.P. Rice, and representatives from other companies that had previously owned and leased the land where the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> located. In addition to standard cameras photographing the event, two movie cameras were brought to capture the felling and its associated events. Uniformed West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission officers, Mingo County sheriffs' deputies, and other law enforcement personnel were also on hand to provide security and direct traffic.|$|E

5|$|By 1906, erosion {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{at the base}} of the tree. George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although attempts were made at preservation, rot had already set in, and the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> permanently weakened.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace. The Pageant centered around the lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized reproduction of the nativity scene. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> cut and brought to the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was then followed by Christmas presentations through the holiday season.|$|E
5000|$|In graph theory, a {{recursive}} tree (i.e., unordered <b>tree)</b> <b>is</b> a non-planar labeled rooted tree. A size-n recursive <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> labeled by distinct integers 1, 2, ..., n, {{where the}} labels are strictly increasing {{starting at the}} root labeled 1. Recursive <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> non-planar, {{which means that the}} children of a particular node are not ordered. E.g. the following two size-three recursive <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> the same.|$|R
50|$|In {{the study}} of planar graphs, blossom <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> <b>trees</b> with {{additional}} directed half edges. Each blossom <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> associated with an embedding of a planar graph. Blossom <b>trees</b> can <b>be</b> used to sample random planar graphs.|$|R

5|$|In 1973, the tambalacoque, {{also known}} as the dodo <b>tree,</b> <b>was</b> thought to be dying out on Mauritius, to which it is endemic. There were {{supposedly}} only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. Stanley Temple hypothesised that it depended on the dodo for its propagation, and that its seeds would germinate only after passing through the bird's digestive tract. He claimed that the tambalacoque was now nearly coextinct because of the disappearance of the dodo. Temple overlooked reports from the 1940s that found that tambalacoque seeds germinated, albeit very rarely, without being abraded during digestion. Others have contested his hypothesis and suggested that the decline of the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> exaggerated, or seeds were also distributed by other extinct animals such as Cylindraspis tortoises, fruit bats or the broad-billed parrot. According to Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in the ecology of the Mascarene Islands, the tree, while rare, has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers several hundred, not 13 as claimed by Temple, hence discrediting Temple's view as to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 a 700-year-old oak tree, {{called the}} Domesday Oak, was {{selected}} by The Tree Council as one of 50 Great British Trees. In 2011 a crack appeared in the trunk and oak support beams were fitted to support the tree. The supports were only partly successful and {{a section of the}} tree collapsed; the remaining part of the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> pruned to reduce the weight of the surviving section.|$|E
5|$|In about 1797 a {{schoolmaster}} {{living in}} the village cultivated the Williams pear. The schoolmaster (either Mr Wheeler or his successor, John Stair) was the original cultivator, but the pear (a cultivar of the European Pear) was named after Richard Williams of Turnham Green, who grew several grafts of the original tree. On 5 December 1956, a plaque commemorating the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> unveiled {{on the wall of}} the village school.|$|E

5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party {{in the days before the}} Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree of leaves and left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree now stands at the spot.|$|E
