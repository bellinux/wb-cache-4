Using a sinusoidal model for the timing jitter, we evaluate the bit error rate (BER) degradation and cycle slip probabilities of receivers via analysis as well as simulation for uncoded offset quadrature-phase-shift-keying (OQPSK). We evaluate performance for two different symbol synchronization loops: the modified data transition tracking loop (M-DTTL) and the Gardner loop. The results are parameterized {{in terms of the}} timing jitter parameters (peak frequency jitter, <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> <b>error,</b> and cycle-to-cycle jitter) as well as symbol tracking loop parameters (loop damping factor, loop bandwidth). We present analytical expressions for BER degradation in the presence of sinusoidal timing jitter and compare results with those obtained via simulation, as well as past hardware tests of receivers. These results show that for both types of symbol synchronizers, peak BER degradation decreases as the loop damping factor increases, and that for underdamped tracking loops, the BER degradation peaks when the normalized jitter rate is approximately the same as the natural frequency of the loop transfer function. Simulated cycle-slip rates are also presented, showing the effects of varying loop bandwidths and damping factors. Finally, we illustrate how BER degradation can be characterized in terms of jitter <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> <b>error</b> and cycle-to-cycle jitter, providing predictive capabilities for receiver performance and guidelines for the specification of transmitter clock requirements.

Since dampers {{are made of}} diverse elements, have a large range of performance variables. Therefore, analytical solution for predicting damper behavior is difficult. In the absence of analytical models, one of the popular and reliable methods is statistical modeling. In this study, a modeling approach for a continuously variable damper was successfully used with variable discrete time model through Euler's approximation. Effect of changing spring constants, forces, damper constants and initial displacement in a spring- mass-damper assembly for their effects upon damper characteristics were closely investigated via simulations using PROC MODEL. Initial values were specified in a VAR statement. The mass, time step, spring constants, and damper constants were declared and initialized by a CONTROL statement.

The computational weight of the binary decomposition algorithm is compared to that of the estimator plain calculation, showing that the number of operations needed is reduced to a term proportional to log 2 instead of 2.

The error holdover is a problem that at present does not possess solution and the systems that present this type of error produce lines of erroneous synchronization in the signal of the GPS. Basic holdover algorithms are discussed along with their most critical properties.

Instead of comparing trajectories, the effect of discretization on various sets which are invariant under the evolution of the underlying differential equation is studied. Such invariant sets are crucial in determining long time dynamics. The particular invariant sets which are studied are equilibrium points, together with their unstable manifolds and local phase portraits, periodic solutions, quasi-periodic solutions and strange attractors.

40|$|Abstract—We propose and {{demonstrate}} {{a method to}} provide precise time synchronization in distributed control systems using a boundary clock scheme. The major drawback of the boundary clock scheme is the exponential accumulation of time synchronization error {{as the number of}} hops increases. To make the error accumulation linearly increase with the number of hops, we first separate the frequency compensation interval (FCI) and the offset and frequency compensation interval (OFCI) and then separately optimize each interval. To demonstrate the performance of this method, we implemented test benches using Ethernet-linked distributed control systems. We measured the peak-to-peak jitter performance along with the maximum <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> <b>error</b> to assess the short- and long-term stability after several hops in distributed control systems. Our method enables the peak-to-peak jitter to be maintained under 107 ns after seven hops. The experimental results show that the performance of time synchronization is dominated by fast jitter rather than frequency error and wander, and the proposed scheme can be used to improve the time synchronization performance in IEEE 1588 -compliant control systems using boundary clock.

A wireless webcam may help monitor indoor construction operations with enhanced mobility. The transfer time of sending a photograph from the wireless webcam, however, is slower than that of a wired webcam. It is expected that professionals may have to analyze indoor construction operations with longer interval time-lapse photographs if they want to use a wireless webcam. This research aimed to determine the maximum <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> for time-lapse photos that enables professionals to interpret construction operations and productivity. In order to accomplish the research goal, brickwork of five different construction sites was videotaped. Various interval time-lapse photographs were generated from each video.

40|$|When {{computing}} the {{radiometric resolution}} of an interferometric radiometer the correlation among the errors of different baselines is usually assumed negligible. ln this way: a) the radiometric sensitivity {{turns out to}} be pixel independent (except for antenna pattern effects), and b) the error of the average of P redundant baselines is reduced by a factor of (P) 1 / 2. While this may be the case in radioastronomy applications, for an on-board instrument where all the baselines are measured at the same <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> the <b>errors</b> will actually be correlated. This has two effects: a) The radiometric resolution changes from pixel to pixel and b) the radiometric resolution improvement introduced by redundance is reduced as compared with the case of independent errors.

These capacities could thus be employed to carry traffic from existing GSM/UMTS base stations and PBX (Private Branch Exchanges). Carrying this traffic requires an emulation of E 1 /T 1 telephone circuits over Ethernets, i. e.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model was built {{and used to}} show the motion of particles in a cascade rotary drum dryer. In a cascade rotary drum the flights pick up the particles {{at a number of}} points in {{the lower half of the}} drum while, in the upper half, the particles fall freely. A model is derived where the drag force exerted on the particles throughout the falling period is emphasised. The motion of the particles in a rotary drum is described by three actions: Cascade; Kiln and Bouncing. In this study a horizontal rotary drum was used where both the kiln and bouncing actions have minimal effect, therefore, the focus is on the cascade motion of the particles. A characteristic of the model is the 'falling number' which is found to be dependent on the curtain properties. The model has demonstrated its ability to predict the effect of many important parameters such as drying medium velocity, drum rotation speed, particle size and feeding flow rate. It has been shown that increasing the drying medium velocity by 2. 5 times results in an 85 % decrease in the residence time. Also, the number of falling is shown to be limited and a function of the drum rotation speed, in this case 0. 59 falling per second.
