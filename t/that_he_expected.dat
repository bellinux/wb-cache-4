Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E
5|$|Groves retired {{at the end}} of February 1948, and Nichols was {{designated}} as his successor with the rank of major general. At the same time, Forrestal, now the Secretary of Defense, reorganized the Military Liaison Committee. A civilian, Donald F. Carpenter, replaced Brereton as chairman, and there were now two members from each of the three services. On 11 March, Truman summoned Lilienthal, Nichols and Secretary of the Army Kenneth C.

In February 2010, Doug Gansler issued an opinion after a nine-month analysis of state laws stating that valid same-sex marriages performed in other states that permit same-sex marriage could be recognized under Maryland law. Gansler stated that the opinion was not binding on the courts and state agencies could begin immediately to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. He said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> the opinion to be quickly challenged in court.|$|E

5|$|Westerman {{was signed}} by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent on April 27, 2009. On June 9, 2009, Jets head coach Rex Ryan said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> Westerman to make the team's final roster. He ended up making the final roster as an outside linebacker and {{recorded}} two tackles and a sack in his debut against the Houston Texans on September 13. On October 9, 2011, Westerman recorded 5 tackles along with 2 sacks against the New England Patriots but in a losing effort while the Jets lost 30–21.|$|E

The tourists made 488 and Booth scored eight as Australia replied with 221 and were forced to follow on. He made 27 in the second innings before being bowled by David Allen as the hosts fell to an innings defeat. It was Australia's biggest defeat at home since the Fourth Test of the 1911–12 Ashes series when they lost by an innings and 225 runs. After the match, England captain Mike Smith told Booth <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> {{to see him in}} the Fourth Test, but his Australian counterpart prophetically predicted his downfall.|$|E

An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E

5|$|New York {{played the}} Cleveland Browns a week later. In a meeting before the game, Ryan told his players <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> {{to be fired}} {{at the end of}} the year. The Jets {{defeated}} Cleveland, 24–13, and despite the uncertainty, the players and coaches were in high spirits. Several players including Antonio Cromartie, Calvin Pace, and Willie Colon went on to publicly express their support for Ryan to return as coach. In the season finale, the Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins 20–7, eliminating them from playoff contention. In the locker room after the game, owner Woody Johnson and Idzik announced Ryan would return for the 2014 season much to the delight of the players. Ryan was praised for keeping his team competitive after being eliminated from playoff contention and keeping their spirits high throughout the year despite their inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|All five {{versions}} of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars. All versions, except that in the Gesta Francorum, generally agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society {{and the necessity of}} maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking. They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, {{it has been argued that}} Urban's subsequent preaching reveals <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along. According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of Deus vult! ("God wills it!"). However, other {{versions of}} the speech do not include this detail.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Häkkinen moved into the lead of the Drivers' Championship, on 64 points, taking the championship lead {{for the first time in}} the 2000 season. Michael Schumacher lost the lead of the Drivers' Championship, falling two points behind Häkkinen. Coulthard maintained third place with 58 points, nine points ahead of Barrichello and forty-one in front of Fisichella. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren took over the lead of the Constructors' Championship with 112 points, pushing Ferrari on 111 points to second place. Williams increased the gap to Benetton to 6 points, with Jordan jumping ahead of BAR for fifth on 12 points. Despite McLaren taking the lead of both championships, their team principal Ron Dennis acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> both his drivers would have the advantage in the most of the five remaining races although he believed that being complacent would reduce McLaren's chances of success.|$|E

5|$|Just {{weeks after}} Letcher's inauguration, William Henry Harrison {{prevailed in the}} 1840 presidential election. Soon after, Harrison visited Letcher in Frankfort to discuss the {{appointment}} of Letcher's friend John J. Crittenden to Harrison's cabinet. On December 14, 1840, Letcher wrote Crittenden {{to tell him that}} the General Assembly would shortly re-elect him to his Senate seat. If he (Crittenden) were going to accept a position in President Harrison's cabinet, Letcher would prefer he do it before March 4, 1841 so the General Assembly would still be in session to elect Crittenden's replacement in the Senate. On January 11, 1841, Crittenden replied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> to be named attorney general and believed he could accept the post before Letcher's preferred deadline. However, due to Harrison's death only a month after his inauguration, Crittenden was not able to keep Letcher's timeline; he was appointed attorney general by John Tyler on March 5, 1841.|$|E
5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} destination was Nome, {{on the coast}} of the Bering Sea. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not think that he would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Holroyd was {{assigned}} the number nine shirt following {{the departure of}} fellow striker Scott Rendell. He started the club's first match of the season, playing the whole game in a 2–0 home defeat to Barrow. Three days later, he scored twice in Cambridge's 3–1 win against Ebbsfleet United, scoring both goals. Holroyd scored his first professional hat-trick four days later, scoring against his former employers, Chester City, as Cambridge came from two goals down to win the match 4–2. One of his goals included an audacious over head kick, 15 yards from goal. Holroyd scored four goals in two games shortly after, netting against Gateshead and Forest Green Rovers respectively. He scored a further two goals in Cambridge's 4–3 home loss to Luton Town in September 2009, taking his goal tally to eleven for the season. His twelfth goal of the season came against Cambridge's local rivals, Histon, Holroyd netting with just nine minutes remaining in a 1–1 draw. A week later, he scored from the penalty spot in Cambridge's 4–0 win against Ebbsfleet United. His fine goalscoring form continued into November 2009, scoring in victories against Kidderminster Harriers and Ilkeston Town respectively. After his goal against Ilkeston Town, Holroyd did not find the net {{until the end of}} December 2009, scoring just before half-time for Cambridge as they lost 2–1 at Mansfield Town. A week later, Cambridge United assistant manager, Paul Carden, said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> Holroyd to leave the club in the January transfer window. He subsequently played his last game for the club in Cambridge's 1–0 home defeat to Eastbourne Borough. During {{the first half of the}} 2009–10 season, Holroyd scored 15 goals in 25 games for Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|Taaramäe {{took over}} the white jersey for best young rider from Rigoberto Urán on stage 18. Urán {{finished}} a distant 27th on the day, seven minutes off the pace of stage winner Andy Schleck. Taaramäe's eighth place, three minutes back of Schleck but four minutes the better of Urán, moved him into 11th place overall and into the best young rider's position, by 33 seconds over Pierre Rolland. Rolland won the stage at Alpe d'Huez the next day, with Taaramäe finishing 14th two minutes back. This gave Rolland an advantage of a minute and 33 seconds going into the stage 20 individual time trial, where Taaramäe's skills are superior. Taaramäe indeed finished better than Rolland in the time trial, tenth to Rolland's 21st, but gained only 48 seconds. This was insufficient to win back the white jersey before the final, largely ceremonial stage into Paris on the Tour's final day. Taaramäe finished the Tour in 12th place overall, at a deficit of eleven {{and a half minutes}} to Tour champion Cadel Evans. Moncoutié was not a major factor in any classification, finishing 41st overall and 25th in the mountains classification. Given his result at just 24 years of age, and that he retains eligibility for the white jersey in the 2012 Tour de France, Boyer expressed that he was quite pleased with Taaramäe's performance, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> the Estonian to be a contender for the overall podium at the Tour within two or three years.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{was happy}} to take over Abir's {{concession}} as the State had built up sufficient income {{to be able to}} afford to run tax collections by itself. In addition the Free State was embarrassed by the continuing allegations of atrocities caused by Abir and it could institute reforms more effectively if it were in control. Leopold authorised the takeover in the hope that the Free State would be able to resume rubber collection and exports and on 12 September 1906 an agreement was signed which stated that all profits from the concession would go to the Free State in return for payment to Abir of 4.5 fr per kilogram of rubber harvested until 1952. Leopold told Abir's shareholders <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> exports to return to normal levels within two years. To restore control the Free State dispatched a force of 650 men and 12 European officers under the command of Inspector Gerard to the concession. They returned four months later, leaving some areas still rebellious and with news that there were almost no rubber plants left. As a result, the quotas expected per man were cut to just 6kg of rubber per year, with some struggling to find even that much. State income was therefore negligible whilst the costs of controlling the concession continued to increase. Throughout this time Abir was still making a profit by taking its share of the rubber exported for almost no expenditure.|$|E
