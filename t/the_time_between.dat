5|$|The Moon crosses {{from south}} to {{north of the}} {{ecliptic}} at its ascending node, and vice versa at its descending node.

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E
5|$|After {{the opera}} became {{successful}} in London, Richard D'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and sometimes {{as many as}} three, played Pinafore under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again for most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> 1903 and 1940. Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued to hew closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> <b>time</b> {{interval}} <b>between</b> {{inspections of}} cold standby systems {{is a crucial}} decision to ensure the appropriated system reliability and the lowest costs possible. This paper presents a model developed to establish <b>the</b> optimal <b>time</b> interval <b>between</b> inspections for a two-unit cold standby system with component repair and subject to periodic inspection, considering reliability and costs. A Markov chain is used to define possible states, their transition probabilities and <b>the</b> mean <b>time</b> to system failure, {{as a function of}} <b>the</b> <b>time</b> interval <b>between</b> inspections. Given <b>the</b> mean <b>time</b> to system failure, the steady state availability is determined. Finally, the costs related to the system maintenance are established and a cost function is developed and optimized for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> interval <b>between</b> inspections. Numerical examples are presented and results for different system parameters are compared. Besides optimizing <b>the</b> <b>time</b> interval <b>between</b> inspections, <b>the</b> analyses also reveal the effect of repair time on system availability and mean time to system failure...|$|R
