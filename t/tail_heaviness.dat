50|$|A {{number of}} {{changes were made}} to the second prototype, {{including}} re-ballasting to move the center-of-gravity forward, increasing the size of the upper vertical tail, and reworking the rudder control linkages. This second prototype was not completed until January 1944. The aircraft flew on 23 March 1944. The pilot had difficulty lifting the nose wheel below 160 mph (257 km/h). He also reported extreme yaw sensitivity. This flight lasted less than eight minutes, but subsequent flights were longer, and the nose heaviness disappeared when the landing gear was retracted. Only relatively low speeds were attained, however. While urging NACA to investigate the inability to attain designed speeds, further flight tests were made. On the 10th flight, the pilot noted extreme <b>tail</b> <b>heaviness,</b> lack of power, and excessive fuel consumption. Flight testing was then ceased as too hazardous, and the project was abandoned after a year of inactivity. By 1946, the U.S. Army Air Forces was developing jet-powered fighters, and had no need for a new propeller-driven fighter aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In November 1916, the Gothaer Waggonfabrik {{received}} a production order for 35 aircraft; this was subsequently increased to 50 in February 1917. A further 80 aircraft were ordered from the Siemens-Schuckert Werke (SSW) and 100 from Luft-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (LVG). Compared to the Gothaer aircraft, these license-built aircraft were slightly heavier and slower because Idflieg specified {{the use of}} a strengthened airframe. In order to counteract this, SSW built a number of highly modified examples, including one driven by tractor instead of pusher engines, one with an extra bay added to its wing cellule, two with a new airfoil section for the wings, and one with a supercharger. None of these modifications had been fully evaluated {{by the end of the}} war. Late-production SSW G.IVs also usually incorporated the Stossfahrgestell auxiliary nosewheels and Flettner servo tabs developed for the G.V. Responding to a different performance issue, LVG overcame the <b>tail</b> <b>heaviness</b> of its machines by increasing the sweepback of the wings. Late production by SSW and LVG became obsolete, hence many aircraft were finished as trainers with lower performance engines (Argus As.III or NAG C.III). The SSW-built trainers relocated the fuel tanks from the engine nacelles to within the fuselage, as on the G.V.|$|E

The resulting paxameters have somewhat separate roles in determining the shape of the distribution, and this note examines those effects. 630 Effects of Parameters of Transformed Beta Distributions The transformed beta is considered parametetized so that f(x) ~ (x/d) s- 1 (1 +(x/d) c) -(a+b) /c.

40|$|The {{concept of}} heavy- or long-tailed densities (or distributions) has {{attracted}} much well-deserved {{attention in the}} literature. A quick search in Google using the keywords long-tailed statistics retrieves almost 12 million items. The concept has become a pillar {{of the theory of}} extremes, and through its connection with outlier-prone distributions, long-tailed distributions also {{play a central role in}} the theory of robustness. The concept of <b>tail</b> <b>heaviness</b> is by now ubiquitous, appearing in a diverse set of disciplines that includes: economics, communications, atmospheric sciences, climate modeling, social sciences, physics, modeling of complex systems, etc. Nevertheless, the precise meaning of ‘long-’ or ‘heavy tails’ remains somewhat elusive. Thus, in a substantial portion of the early literature, long-tailednessmeant that the underlying distributionwas capable of producing anomalous observations in the sense that they were ‘too far’ from themain body of observations. Implicit in these informal definitions was the notion that any distribution that behaved that way had to do so because its tails were longer than those of the normal distribution. This paper discusses tail orderings and several approaches for the classification of probability distributions according to <b>tail</b> <b>heaviness.</b> It is concluded that an approach based on the limiting behavior of the residual life function, and its corresponding characterizations based on functions of regular variation and asymptotic distribution of extreme spacings, provides the more natural and illuminating concepts of tail behavior...|$|E

40|$|This {{monograph}} {{is written}} for the numerate nonspecialist, and hopes to serve three purposes. First it gathers mathematical material from diverse but related ﬁelds of order statistics, records, extreme value theory, majorization, regular variation and subexponentiality. All of these are relevant for understanding fat tails, but they are not, to our knowledge, brought together in a single source for the target readership. Proofs that give insight are included, but for fussy calculations the reader is referred to the excellent sources referenced in the text. Multivariate extremes are not treated. This allows us to present material spread over hundreds of pages in specialist texts in twenty pages. Chapter 5 develops new material on heavy tail diagnostics and gives more mathematical detail. Second, it presents a new measure of obesity. The most popular deﬁnitions in terms of regular variation and subexponentiality invoke putative properties that hold at inﬁnity, and this complicates any empirical estimate. Each deﬁnition captures some {{but not all of}} the intuitions associated with <b>tail</b> <b>heaviness.</b> Chapter 5 studies two candidate indices of <b>tail</b> <b>heaviness</b> based on the tendency of the mean excess plot to collapse as data are aggregated. The probability that the largest value is more than twice the second largest has intuitive appeal but its estimator has very poor accuracy. The Obesity index is deﬁned for a positive random variable X as: Ob(X) = P (X 1 + X 4 > X 2 + X 3 |X 1 ≤ X 2 ≤ X 3 ≤ X 4), Xi independent copies of X. For empirical distributions, obesity is deﬁned by bootstrapping. This index reasonably captures intuitions of <b>tail</b> <b>heaviness.</b> Among its properties, if α > 1 then Ob(X) < Ob(X). However, it does not completely mimic the tail index of regularly varying distributions, or the extreme value index. A Weibull distribution with shape 1 / 4 is more obese than a Pareto distribution with tail index 1, even though this Pareto has inﬁnite mean and the Weibull’s moments are all ﬁnite. Chapter 5 explores properties of the Obesity index. Third and most important, we hope to convince the reader that fat tail phenomena pose real problems; they are really out there and they seriously challenge our usual ways of thinking about historical averages, outliers, trends, regression coeﬃcients and conﬁdence bounds among many other things.

In this paper, we allow the tail index α to be zero so as to embrace the class of super-heavy tailed distributions. We then present a test statistic consisting of the ratio of maximum to the sum of log-excesses in order to discern between distributions with heavy and super-heavy tails.

In this paper, we review the estimation of the extreme value index when observations are subject to right random censoring {{and the presence of}} covariate information. In addition, we propose some estimators of the extreme value index, including a maximum likelihood estimator from a perturbed Pareto distribution. The existing estimators and the proposed ones are compared through a simulation study under identical conditions.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{transition}} probability estimates for Markov chains {{and their relationship}} to the geometry of the underlying state space. The thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part (Chapter 1) we consider Markov chains with bounded range, that is there exists R > 0 such that the Markov chain (Xn) n∈N satisfies d(Xn, Xn+ 1) < R for all n ∈ N). In the second part (Chapter 2 and 3) we consider Markov chains with heavy-tailed jumps. In Chapter 1, we characterize Gaussian estimates for transition probability of a discrete time Markov chain in terms of geometric properties of the underlying state space. In particular, we show that the following are equivalent: 1. Two sided Gaussian bounds on heat kernel 2. A scale invariant Parabolic Harnack inequality 3. Volume doubling property and a scale invariant Poincar´ inequality. e The underlying state space is metric measure space that includes both manifolds and graphs as special cases. Various applications and examples are provided. An important feature of our work is that our techniques are robust to small perturbations of the underlying space. In Chapter 2, we study the long-term behaviour of random walks with heavy tailed jumps. We focus on the case where the 'index of tail heaviness' (or jump index) [beta] ∈ (0, 2). Extending several existing work by other authors, we prove global upper and lower bounds for n-step transition probability density that is sharp up to constants. In Chapter 3, we study random walks with heavy tailed jumps where the index of <b>tail</b> <b>heaviness</b> [beta] is allowed to take any positive value. We assume that the state space in this case is a graph satisfying a sub-Gaussian estimate, which is typical of many fractal-like graphs. On such graphs, we establish a threshold behavior of heavy-tailed Markov chains when the index governing the <b>tail</b> <b>heaviness</b> equals the escape time exponent of the simple random walk. In a certain sense, this generalizes the classical threshold corresponding to the second moment condition. This thesis is based on joint work with Laurent Saloff-Coste. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|E
