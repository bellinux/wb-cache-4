25|$|The diesel {{alternator}} {{sets for}} the carriages provided 3-phase 415-volt alternating current power. Only 1 phase {{was required for}} operation, so the other two phases were available for backup or for load-sharing across other carriages - useful because the ACN and BN cars required 28kW to operate and the BRN, with its additional functions, 40kW. To accommodate the extra load, the ACN and BN were upgraded midway through construction to a 35kVA supply, and the programming reworked so that the BRN would not power adjacent cars. If all alternators were off, then the cars {{was able to take}} power from an external 240vAC power supply. Around the same time as these modifications were made, the alternator set supports were modified to reduce vibration, and the radiator fan motors' <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> switches were moved to reduce unnecessary tripping. At the end of the modifications, the system was organised so that in event of a power failure, the batteries mounted under the carriages would automatically reroute all power to the lights at the ends of the train to protect from oncoming traffic. Those lights could function for over ten hours, at the expense of air-conditioning and other functions. The first six cars had plastic fuel pipes near the alternator units, but that was changed from car 7 onwards.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> relay. In one type, a {{bi-metallic}} strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|E

The impacts of EVs on a typical LV network were investigated.

50|$|A {{second type}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> relay uses a {{eutectic}} alloy, like a solder, to retain a spring-loaded contact. When too much current passes through the heating element for too long a time, the alloy melts and the spring releases the contact, opening the control circuit and shutting down the motor. Since eutectic alloy elements are not adjustable, they are resistant to casual tampering but require changing the heater coil element to match the motor rated current.|$|E

50|$|A leakage transformer, {{also called}} a stray-field transformer, has a {{significantly}} higher leakage inductance than other transformers, sometimes increased by a magnetic bypass or shunt in its core between primary and secondary, which is sometimes adjustable with a set screw. This provides a transformer with an inherent current limitation due to the loose coupling between its primary and the secondary windings.

40|$|Rapid {{proliferation}} of the {{distributed energy resources}} (DERs) poses operational challenges for the low-voltage (LV) distribution networks in terms of <b>thermal</b> <b>overloading</b> of the network assets along with voltage limit violations at the connection points. A number of market-based and direct control approaches have been widely developed to tackle these challenges with different objectives. While most of the techniques aim {{to solve the problems}} separately, an integrated and efficient method is missing to handle such correlated issues simultaneously. In this study, a unified approach combining local voltage control mechanism with a centralized congestion management scheme is proposed by utilizing an agent-based hierarchical architecture. The feasibility of the proposed approach is validated with a simulation analysis for a representative Dutch urban LV network considering up to 100 % penetration of solar PV and electric heat pumps (HPs). The quantitative analysis reveals that, local voltage control strategies can essentially aid mitigating <b>thermal</b> <b>overloading</b> of the network assets. Thus, integrating a local voltage control method with a coordinated congestion management mechanism can enhance the system flexibility while maintaining the network constraints and the comfort levels of the consumers simultaneously...|$|R

50|$|However, new {{problems}} emerge, such as interaction with strong magnetic fields and thermal management. The relatively large power at which VASIMR operates generates substantial waste heat {{that needs to}} be channeled away without creating <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> and thermal stress. Powerful superconducting electromagnets, necessary to contain hot plasma, generate tesla-range magnetic fields that can cause problems with other onboard devices and produce unwanted torque by interaction with the magnetosphere. To counter this latter effect, the VF-200 consists of two 100 kW thruster units packaged with magnetic fields oriented in opposite directions, making a net zero-torque magnetic quadrupole.|$|E
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> relays. Bi-metal <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external <b>thermal</b> <b>overload</b> protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

Both techniques aim to remove, in some optimal manner, voltage and thermal congestions stemming from base case or post-contingency states, by a simultaneous handling of operating and security constraints {{with respect to}} several contingencies. The objective of the first approach is to adjust the market-based power injections (generator output and possibly load consumption) at the least cost while the second one aims at curtailing power transactions in a transparent and non-discriminatory way.
