40|$|The adsorpition of six s-triazines of the chloro- and methoxy-analogue {{series on}} a {{bentonite}} from Uri (Sardinia) was studied. The H-bentonite shows a higher adsorption than the Na-bentonite. The order of adsorbabiIity of chloro-s-triazines was <b>trietazine</b> > atrazine > propazine; by meÂ· thoxy-s-triazines it was simetone > atratone > prometone. The amount of simetone adsorbed by the H-bentonite occurred {{in excess of}} the CEC. The relationship between adsorption, solubility and lenght of the lateral chain of the s-triazine was confirmed. The adsorption was mainly due to van der Waals forces, H-bonding and ionic exchange...|$|E
