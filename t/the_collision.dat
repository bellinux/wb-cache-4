In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that <b>the</b> <b>collision</b> avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E

40|$|We use {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to study the}} formation of surface waves in vertically vibrated granular material. We find that horizontal movements of particles, which are essential {{for the formation of}} the waves, consist of two distinct processes. First, the movements sharply increase while the particles are colliding with a bottom plate, where the duration of <b>the</b> <b>collisions</b> is very short compared to the period of the vibration. Next, the movements gradually decrease between <b>the</b> <b>collisions,</b> during which <b>the</b> particles move through the material.

40|$|Cosmic bubbles are {{nucleated}} {{through the}} quantum tunneling process. After nucleation they would expand and undergo collisions with each other. In this paper, we focus in particular on collisions of two equal-sized bubbles and compute gravitational waves emitted from <b>the</b> <b>collisions.</b> First, we study {{the mechanism of}} <b>the</b> <b>collisions</b> {{by means of a}} real scalar field and its quartic potential. Then, using this model, we compute gravitational waves from <b>the</b> <b>collisions</b> in a straightforward manner. In the quadrupole approximation, time-domain gravitational waveforms are directly obtained by integrating the energy-momentum tensors over the volume of the wave sources, where the energy-momentum tensors are expressed in terms of the scalar field, the local geometry and the potential. We present gravitational waveforms emitted during (i) the initial-to-intermediate stage of strong <b>collisions</b> and (ii) <b>the</b> final stage of weak collisions: the former is obtained numerically, in full General Relativity and the latter analytically, in the flat spacetime approximation. We gain qualitative insights into the time-domain gravitational waveforms from bubble collisions: during (i), the waveforms show the non-linearity of <b>the</b> <b>collisions,</b> characterized by a modulating frequency and cusp-like bumps, whereas during (ii), the waveforms exhibit the linearity of <b>the</b> <b>collisions,</b> featured by smooth monochromatic oscillations.
