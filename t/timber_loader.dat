40|$|Robots are {{designed}} to help humans. Space robots are of particular importance as they aid or replace astronauts in difficult possibly dangerous extravehicular activities. However, robot intelligence and autonomy are still limited. Therefore, robots need to be supervised or directly teleoperated in order to accomplish complex tasks in diverse environments. The focus of this thesis is on wireless teleoperation of robotic manipulators. The literature review introduces the reader to space robotics and other relevant achievements and prospects. State-of-the-art techniques of teleoperation on Earth as well as in space are examined. A damped least squares algorithm was developed to solve the inverse inematics problem and avoid joint limits, thus enabling continuous teleoperation of simulated robot arms. The motion sensing capabilities of the Wii remote controller by Nintendo are analyzed with regard to the possible use as teleoperation interface device. Three different robot arms were simulated for this thesis and can be teleoperated using the Wii remote as input device. The robot arms comprise the Workpartner arms (TKK), a <b>timber</b> <b>loader</b> crane (Kesla) and the Lynx 6 robot arm (Lynxmotion). Three modes of teleoperation are implemented to give the operator a higher degree of control over the arm. The algorithm and the teleoperation modes have been demonstrated with the Lynx 6 robot arm and the Wii remote as input device. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
