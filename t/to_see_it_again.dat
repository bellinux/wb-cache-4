We were interested in making the technology very visible, but also playing with translucency and transparency, soft boundaries. The irony of the digital age is that, as technology gets more invisible, people {{are more interested in}} being able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> as in Apple Computer's iMac, with its translucent blues and milky plastics that simultaneously tease and reveal.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Cyma Zarghami, she told [...] "their [...] immediate reaction was <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> both because they liked {{it and it was}} unlike anything they'd ever seen before." [...] Hillenburg said the character construction in the episode was loose. But the character development was already [...] "pretty strong." ...|$|E

500|$|Bova, like Campbell, was a technophile with a {{scientific}} background, and he declared {{early in his}} tenure that he wanted Analog to {{continue to focus on}} stories with {{a scientific}} foundation, though he also made it clear that change was inevitable. [...] Over his first few months some long-time readers sent in letters of complaint when they judged that Bova was not living up to Campbell's standards, particularly when sex scenes began to appear. [...] On one occasion—Jack Wodhams' story [...] "Foundling Fathers", and its accompanying illustration by Kelly Freas—it turned out that Campbell had bought the story in question. [...] As the 1970s went on, Bova continued to publish authors such as Anderson, Dickson, and Christopher Anvil, who had appeared regularly during Campbell's tenure, but he also attracted authors who {{had not been able to}} sell to Campbell, such as Gene Wolfe, Roger Zelazny, and Harlan Ellison. [...] Frederik Pohl, who later commented in his autobiography about his difficulties in selling to Campbell, appeared in the March 1972 issue with [...] "The Gold at the Starbow's End", which was nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and that summer Joe Haldeman's [...] "Hero" [...] appeared. [...] This was the first story in Haldeman's [...] "Forever War" [...] sequence; Campbell had rejected it, listing multiple reasons including the frequent use of profanity and the implausibility of men and women serving in combat together. [...] Bova asked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and ran it without asking for changes. [...] Other new writers included Spider Robinson, whose first sale was [...] "The Guy With the Eyes" [...] in the February 1973 issue; George R.R. Martin, with [...] "A Song for Lya", in June 1974; and Orson Scott Card, with [...] "Ender's Game", in the August 1977 issue.|$|E
2500|$|In 1919, {{the magician}} P. T. Selbit staged a séance {{at his own}} flat in Bloomsbury. Doyle {{attended}} the séance. Some later commentators have stated that he declared the clairvoyance manifestations to be genuine. However, the contemporary report by the Sunday Express quotes Doyle as saying: [...] "I should have <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> before passing a definite opinion on it," [...] and: [...] "I have my doubts about the whole thing". In 1920, Doyle debated the claims of Spiritualism with the notable sceptic Joseph McCabe at Queen's Hall in London. McCabe later published his evidence against the claims of Doyle and Spiritualism in a booklet entitled Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud? which claimed Doyle had been duped into believing Spiritualism by mediumship trickery.|$|E
2500|$|Mamma Mia! {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 54% of critics gave the film positive reviews {{based upon a}} sample of 175 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The Times gave it four stars out of five, as did Channel 4 (Britain) which said it had [...] "all the swing and sparkle of sequined bell-bottoms." [...] BBC Radio 5 Live's film critic Mark Kermode admitted to enjoying the film, despite describing the experience as 'the closest {{you get to see}} A-List actors doing drunken karaoke'. The Guardian was more negative, giving it one star, stating that the film gave the reviewer a [...] "need to vomit", while Bob Chipman of Escape to the Movies said it was [...] "so base, so shallow and so hinged on meaningless spectacle, it's amazing it wasn't made for men". The Daily Telegraph stated that it was enjoyable but poorly put together ("Finding the film a total shambles was sort of a shame, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'll go <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> anyway."), whereas Empire said it was [...] "cute, clean, camp fun, full of sunshine and toe tappers." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{investigator}} {{into the}} Air Ontario accident told the documentary that [...] "after {{all of this}} work , after all of the efforts, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> happen <b>again</b> was extremely frustrating." [...] The documentary focused largely on these allegations, while also reconstructing the Air Ontario flight and the USAir flight. However, {{it was reported that}} the FAA refuted Moshansky's allegations, and they claim that they never received his report.|$|R

50|$|As {{the engines}} were already sold {{prior to the}} {{purchase}} of the Tristar, it currently sits without engines on the apron outside the museum.

Clarence looked, {{and then he turned}} away toward the door to the stairway, as one who walks blindly, in a sorrow.|$|R
5000|$|In 1481 the Russians invaded Livonia, {{occupied}} and {{devastated the}} castle.

In the same year Moscovian troops of Grigoriy Temkin occupied the castle, but suffering defeat, he was forced to abandon his conquest.|$|R

50|$|The former {{popularity}} of the Barbary lion as a zoo animal provides the only hope <b>to</b> ever <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> in the wild. Many zoos provide mating programmes. After years of research into the science of the Barbary lion and stories of surviving examples, WildLink International, in collaboration with Oxford University, launched its ambitious International Barbary Lion Project. Oxford used DNA techniques to identify the DNA 'fingerprint' of the Barbary lion subspecies. Researchers took bone samples from remains of Barbary lions in museums across Europe. These samples were returned to Oxford University, where the science team extracted the DNA sequence to identify the Barbary as a separate subspecies.|$|R

5000|$|Maximilian Lobkowicz (1888 - 1967). Despite the government’s {{decision}} to redistribute inherited property and abolish {{the use of}} noble titles, Maximilian provided crucial support to the newly formed, democratic Czechoslovakia as a lawyer and diplomat, campaigning abroad for international recognition of the young republic. In the 1930s he mustered diplomatic support for opposition to the German annexation of the Sudetenland, and during World War II he served as ambassador to Great Britain for the Czechoslovakian government in exile. In 1945 {{he and his family}} regained the property that had been confiscated by the Nazis, only <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> seized <b>again</b> in 1948 by the Communist government. At the same time, Maximilian and his family were forced into exile.|$|R
