40|$|When an {{electron}} (or positronium atom) is injected into liquid helium with nearly zero energy, a bubble quickly forms around it. This phenomenon (which also occurs in liquid hydrogen, liquid neon and possibly in solid helium) lowers {{the mobility of}} the electron to a value similar to that for a positive ion. Estimate the radius of the bubble at zero pressure and temperature. If <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> <b>held</b> {{in a state of}} negative pressure, the bubble will expand beyond the radius at zero pressure. Estimate the negative pressure such that a bubble once formed will grow without limit...|$|E
40|$|It is unequivocal that a {{wide variety}} of {{incentives}} can motivate behavior. However, few studies have explicitly examined whether and how different incentives are integrated in terms of their motivational influence. The current study examines the combined effects of monetary and liquid incentives on cognitive processing, and whether appetitive and aversive incentives have distinct influences. We introduce a novel task paradigm, in which participants perform cued task-switching for monetary rewards that vary parametrically across trials, with liquid incentives serving as post-trial performance feedback. Critically, the symbolic meaning of <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>was</b> <b>held</b> constant (indicating successful reward attainment), while <b>liquid</b> valence <b>was</b> blocked. In the first experiment, monetary rewards combined additively with appetitive liquid feedback to improve subject task performance. Aversive liquid feedback counteracted monetary reward effects in low monetary reward trials, particularly in a subset of participants who tended to avoid responding under these conditions. Self-report motivation ratings predicted behavioral performance above and beyond experimental effects. A follow-up experiment replicated the predictive power of motivation ratings even when only appetitive <b>liquids</b> <b>were</b> used, suggesting that ratings reflect idiosyncratic subjective values of, rather than categorical differences between, <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> incentives. Together, <b>the</b> findings indicate an integrative relationship between primary and secondary incentives and potentially dissociable influences in modulating motivational value, while informing hypotheses regarding candidate neural mechanisms...|$|R

50|$|As for {{hydrophilic}} and hydrophobic valves, {{the generation}} of surface tension is almost the same. It is the sudden {{change of cross section}} of the channel that generates the surface tension. <b>The</b> <b>liquid</b> flow will <b>be</b> <b>held</b> in a hydrophilic channel when the cross section suddenly becomes large, while the flow will <b>be</b> <b>held</b> when the cross section of hydrophobic channel suddenly shrinks.|$|R
5000|$|Hot {{salt water}} mouth baths (or hot salt water mouth washes, {{sometimes}} abbreviated to [...] "HSWMW") are also routinely used after oral surgery, to keep food debris out of healing wounds {{and to prevent}} infection. Some oral surgeons consider salt water mouthwashes the mainstay of wound cleanliness after surgery. In dental extractions, hot salt water mouthbaths should start about 24 hours after a dental extraction. The term mouth bath implies that <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>is</b> passively <b>held</b> in <b>the</b> mouth rather than vigorously swilled around, which could dislodge a blood clot. Once the blood clot has stabilized, the mouth wash can be used more vigorously. These mouthwashes tend to be advised about 6 times per day, especially after meals to remove food from the socket.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of valves is {{the balance between}} centrifugal force and surface tension. When the centrifugal force is smaller than the surface tension, <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> flow will <b>be</b> <b>held</b> in the original chamber; when the centrifugal force overbalances the surface tension due to a higher rotating speed, <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> flow will break the valve and flow into the next chamber. This {{can be used to}} control the flow process simply by controlling the rotating speed of the disk.|$|R
50|$|The electrodipping {{force is}} a force {{proposed}} to explain the observed attraction that arises among small colloidal particles attached to an interface between immiscible <b>liquids.</b> <b>The</b> particles <b>are</b> <b>held</b> there by surface tension. Normally the surface tension does not in itself give rise to an attraction or repulsion among particles on a meniscus. A capillary interaction requires that the particles are pushed or {{pulled away from the}} meniscus, for instance because of their weight, if the particles are large and heavy enough.|$|R
40|$|The Gravity Probe-B (GP-B) {{experiment}} will be degraded if accelerations at a {{proof mass}} become larger than one ten billionth g. This makes necessary {{the management of}} the configuration and dynamical behavior of the large amount of liquid helium present in the GP-B spacecraft dewar. Three approaches to the solution of this problem are discussed. It is concluded that the most promising technique involves the use of baffles into which <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> helium can <b>be</b> forced during a relatively high spacecraft rotation period, and in which <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> helium will <b>be</b> <b>held</b> by capillary forces during the operational period when the rotation rate is much lower.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analytical}} study to determine the feasibility of a novel two-phase cold plate/hot plate (CPHP) are presented. A key feature of the CPHP {{is the use of}} capillary forces to separate <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> and vapor phases and distribute <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> over <b>the</b> evaporating/condensing surface. <b>The</b> <b>liquid</b> phase <b>is</b> <b>held</b> by capillary forces in a reservoir and is carried to the evaporating surface by a wick. The reservoir is replenished at intervals from a valved external liquid supply line. In the hot plate mode, <b>liquid</b> accumulates in <b>the</b> reservoir and is removed by an external condensate line. Performance requirements for the device were capability of handling a power density of 4 watts/sq cm, an outlet quality (percentage of vapor flow to total flow) greater than 90 percent, and operation in a 0 -g environment. An analytical model of CPHP operation was developed which concentrated on <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> and vapor flows. It <b>was</b> found that <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> carrying capillary grooves of rectangular cross-section gave significantly better predicted performance than V-shaped grooves. Using the analytical model, capillary groove width and length, vapor channel dimensions, and other parameters were selected to meet the performance requirements with a 100 -percent margin...|$|R
50|$|As {{the foam}} is formed, it changes in structure. As <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> foams {{up into the}} gas, the foam bubbles begin as packed uniform spheres. This phase is the wet phase. The farther up the column the foam travels, the air bubbles distort to form {{polyhedral}} shapes, the dry phase. <b>The</b> <b>liquid</b> that separates <b>the</b> flat faces between two polyhedral bubbles is called the lamellae; it <b>is</b> a continuous <b>liquid</b> phase. <b>The</b> areas where three lamellae meet are called plateau borders. When the bubbles in the foam are the same size the lamellae in the plateau borders meet at 120 degree angles. Since the lamella is slightly curved, the plateau region is at low pressure. <b>The</b> continuous <b>liquid</b> phase <b>is</b> <b>held</b> to <b>the</b> bubble surfaces by the surfactant molecules {{that make up the}} solution being foamed. This fixation is important because otherwise the foam becomes very unstable as <b>the</b> <b>liquid</b> drains into <b>the</b> plateau region making the lamellae thin. Once the lamellae become too thin they will rupture.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} countercurrent chromatography, such as dual flow CCC, feature a true countercurrent process {{where the two}} {{immiscible}} phases flow past each other and exit {{at opposite ends of}} the column. More often, however, one <b>liquid</b> acts as <b>the</b> stationary phase and is retained in the column while the mobile phase is pumped through it. <b>The</b> <b>liquid</b> stationary phase <b>is</b> <b>held</b> in place by gravity or by centrifugal force. An example of a gravity method is called droplet counter current chromatography (DCCC). There are two modes by which the stationary phase is retained by centrifugal force: hydrostatic and hydrodynamic. In the hydrostatic method, the column, a series of chambers connected by channels, is rotated about a central axis. Hydrostatic instruments are marketed under the name centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). Hydrodynamic instruments are often marketed as high-speed or high-performance countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC and HPCCC respectively) instruments which rely on the Archimedes' screw force in a helical coil to retain the stationary phase in the column.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} pricing of liquidity and illiquid assets. For this thesis, liquidity will generally {{refer to the}} ease with which an asset can be traded. The first chapter investigates the role of the investment horizon in the impact of illiquidity on stock prices. We obtain a clientele effect where short-term investors choose not to invest in <b>the</b> least <b>liquid</b> assets, as their expected returns are not sufficient to cover expected transaction costs. <b>The</b> least <b>liquid</b> assets <b>are</b> <b>held</b> by less liquidity-sensitive long-term investors. This feature allows us to better explain the cross-section of U. S. stock returns than a single-horizon model. The second chapter studies the pricing of house-specific risk for U. S. residential real estate. We show that house-specific risk is priced and we show that {{the extent to which it}} is priced increases with a proxy for the degree of underdiversification. The third chapter studies the impact of time-variation in liquidity on stock prices. It distinguishes between an overall deterioration in liquidity and a situation where only <b>the</b> least <b>liquid</b> assets become even less <b>liquid.</b> <b>The</b> results show that only the risk of an overall deterioration in liquidity is relevant for U. S. stock prices...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the saturated zone where fluid moves rapidly along fractures, the fractures (with apertures large relative {{to the size of}} matrix pores) will desaturate first during drainage process and the bulk of fluid flow would be through interconnected pores in the matrix. Within a partially drained fracture, the presence of a relatively continuous air phase will produce practically an infinite resistance to <b>liquid</b> flow in <b>the</b> direction parallel to the fracture. <b>The</b> residual <b>liquid</b> will <b>be</b> <b>held</b> by capillary force in regions around fracture contact areas where the apertures are small. Normal to the fracture surfaces, the drained portion of the fractures will reduce the effective area for liquid flow from one matrix block to another matrix block. A general statistical theory is constructed for flow along the fracture and for flow between the matrix blocks to the fractures under partially saturated conditions. Results are obtained from an aperture distribution model for fracture saturation, hydraulic conductivity, and effective matrix-fracture flow areas as functions of pressure. Drainage from a fractured tuff column is simulated. The parameters for the simulations are deduced from fracture surface characteristics, spacings and orientations based on core analyses, and from matrix characteristics curve based on laboratory measurements. From the cases simulated for the fractured, porous column with discrete vertical and horizontal fractures and porous matrix blocks explicitly taken into account, it is observed that the highly transient changes from fully saturated conditions to partially saturated conditions are extremely sensitive to the fracture properties. However, the quasi-steady changes of the fluid flow of a partially saturated, fractured, porous system could be approximately simulated without taking the fractures into account. 22 references, 16 figures...|$|R
