5|$|Olcott, {{who managed}} Oswald West's {{successful}} 1910 campaign to become Governor of Oregon, recommended that West hire Hobbs as his private stenographer. She was hired, and impressed West to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hired her as his private secretary two years later. At that time, at age 27, {{she was the}} highest-paid woman in public service in the United States, earning $3,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprises {{chief medical}} officer and {{a close friend of}} Kirk and Spock. Kelley was {{dissatisfied}} with an earlier version of the script to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> considered not taking part. Kelley noted his character spoke many of the film's lighter lines, and felt that this role was essential in bringing a lighter side to the onscreen drama.|$|E
50|$|Katsuie {{appears in}} Sengoku Basara 4 as a {{low-rank}} vanguard under the Oda force. In the past {{he tried to}} rebel but failed. He is despaired in everything to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> even losing emotions.|$|R
50|$|Letters to a Young Scientist is a 2013 book by E. O. Wilson. Some of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> makes {{includes}} <b>the</b> {{observation that}} one doesn't {{need to be}} brilliant at math to become a great scientist.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the hands}} that were played [...] By that heathen Chinee, [...] And <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> made, [...] Were quite frightful to see,-- [...] Till {{at last he}} put down a right bower, [...] Which the same Nye had dealt unto me.|$|R
5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|Australia played Pakistan at Karachi in {{the first}} Test between the two {{countries}} on a matting pitch, rather than the more familiar grass pitch. Miller top-scored {{in the first}} innings with 21, as Australia fell for 80. He took 2/40 and then scored 11 in the second innings as Australia fell to defeat. It was the last Test of his career, as his knee injury deteriorated to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not play in the three Tests against India, and retired upon his return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Despite their success, {{founding}} member Anthony Field almost left {{the group in}} 2004, shortly after his marriage {{and the birth of}} his first child, due to his serious medical issues, which were worsened by The Wiggles' demanding tour schedule. After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago, Field improved his health to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was able to continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements.|$|E
60|$|Shefford {{launched}} {{himself so}} swiftly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> scarcely talked coherently. But <b>he</b> made clear <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must save Fay, get {{her away from}} the village, let her lead him to Surprise Valley, rescue Lassiter and Jane Withersteen, and take them all out of the country.|$|R
50|$|Hunter (voiced by Billy West): Rick's ex-boyfriend. He is {{exclusively}} {{attracted to}} Asian guys, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> physically incapable of even seeing a non-Asian person {{if there is}} an Asian around. Ironically, he seems unable {{to tell the difference between}} an Asian and a Latino. He owns virtually all of West Lahunga Beach's Chinatown.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{argument}} is that Luke does not use the material within the same Marcan paragraphs as Matthew. Farrer <b>points</b> out <b>that</b> <b>he</b> takes them out of a Marcan context and reproduces them elsewhere. In chapters 10-18, Luke reassembles the teaching material {{in a way which}} makes <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wants to make, often by pairing sayings that have not been paired together before. This may have been to produce a Christian Deuteronomy, just as it was argued that Matthew's gospel was {{in the form of a}} Christian Pentateuch.|$|R
5|$|During the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was 28th {{nationally in}} scoring offense (number of points scored) and 55th in total offense. Most of the Hokies' success {{came on the}} ground: Tech was 16th nationally in rushing offense but 98th in passing offense. A large reason for Virginia Tech's {{offensive}} success was running back Ryan Williams, who broke Virginia Tech's single-season rushing record that year. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, he had 1,538 yards, only 110 short of the record. Tech running back Darren Evans, who tore his left anterior cruciate ligament before the season began, was held out of the Chick-fil-A Bowl, even though his recovery had progressed to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could have participated.|$|E
5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is unable to}} complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the wall. On the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in New York over 23 days in March 2014. Most of the film was shot in a townhouse on West 162nd Street in Manhattan. Some scenes were filmed in an apartment building in Yonkers and a senior's home in Hastings-on-Hudson. The film was shot by French cinematographer Denis Lenoir, whom Glatzer and Westmoreland had met at a film screening in 1999; they had {{wanted to work with}} him ever since. During filming, Glatzer and Westmoreland attempted to divide the directing duties equally between themselves, even though Glatzer's physical condition had deteriorated to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could only communicate by typing on an iPad with a single finger.|$|E
2500|$|The {{matter was}} taken to the Court of Appeal at the House of Lords where on 15 January 1887, under a bench {{consisting}} of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (commonly known as Law Lords) Esher MR, Bowen LJ and Fry LJ. the appeal was heard. The appeal involved several arguments, on how the umpire had arrived at his decision, <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had used and whether he (the umpire) had exceeded his authority. On 17 January, after deliberation, a two (Esher & Fry) to one (Bowen) verdict was issued, upholding the Queen's Bench and dismissing the appeal: ...|$|R

50|$|By {{wearing the}} Mantle of the Chieftain, <b>the</b> authors <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has been named}} Chieftain of the Que Shu {{and a number of}} other tribes like the Que Teh and Que Kiri, which must mean <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{successful}} in bringing peace.|$|R
5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to help Dean find a {{cure for}} the Mark of Cain, Castiel breaks Metatron out of Heaven and removes his Grace so that the Winchesters can {{interrogate}} him. Although he fails to provide any new information, Metatron is able to lead Castiel to the library where he hid the remaining fragments of Castiel's Grace. With his powers restored, Castiel helps Claire find her long-lost mother, but although Amelia sacrifices herself to save Claire, Claire accepts that the Winchesters and Castiel meant well, even speculating that she will become a Hunter herself. When Rowena – Crowley's long-lost mother – casts a spell to remove the Mark, she also casts a spell that causes Castiel to attack Crowley while she escapes, leaving Castiel driven by a greater rage to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> kills two angels until Rowena is forced to cure him.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} {{about the nature and}} identity of Spring-heeled Jack. This urban legend was very popular in its time, due to the tales of his bizarre appearance and ability to make extraordinary leaps, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became the topic of several works of fiction.|$|E
60|$|MY FRIENDS:--It will readily {{occur to}} you that I cannot, in half an hour, notice {{all the things that}} so able a man as Judge Douglas can say in an hour and a half; and I hope, therefore, if there be {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has said upon which you would like to hear something from me, but which I omit to comment upon, you will bear in mind that it would be expecting an impossibility for me to go over his whole ground. I can but take up some of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has dwelt upon, and employ my half-hour specially on them.|$|R

25|$|Narcisa de Jesús Martillo Morán {{was born}} on 29 October 1832 in the small village of San José in Nobol in Ecuador as the sixth of nine {{children}} born to Pedro Martillo and Josefina Morán who were landowners. Her father was a great worker to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> amassed considerable wealth; he had a devotion to Blessed Mariana de Jesús and Saint Jacinta of Poland.|$|E
25|$|Doctorow {{sees the}} story as a {{caricature}} of a bildungsroman — in which a character learns and grows – in that Buck becomes progressively less civilized. Gianquitto explains that Buck has evolved to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is ready to join a wolf pack, which has a social structure uniquely adapted to and successful in the harsh arctic environment, unlike humans, who are weak in the harsh environment.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its predecessor, {{this book}} {{has never been}} adapted to film. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) {{disappointed}} Dahl to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> refused to have a film version produced. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have announced {{that they have no}} intention of producing a sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), although elements from Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator are seen {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E
50|$|Both of the {{championship}} contenders, Stewart and Davey Hamilton, had problems; Stewart won the title owing to <b>the</b> <b>points</b> lead <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had coming in.

50|$|Ligier {{broke into}} Formula One as a privateer, {{entering}} his own Cooper-Maserati T81 in the 1966 Monaco Grand Prix.

50|$|Haberfeld fared less well, just as Minassian {{had before}} him. His season {{would see him}} fail to qualify five times and retire a further three times. On the two {{occasions}} he did finish, it was well out of <b>the</b> <b>points,</b> meaning <b>that</b> <b>he</b> finished <b>the</b> season without a classification in the championship.|$|R
25|$|When the villainous Kryptonian H'El {{manages to}} disrupt his DNA, Superman uses his Kryptonian armor to {{stabilize}} Superboy's condition. His tactile telekinesis is condensed, enhancing his physical abilities, but also cutting into his sensory abilities and limiting {{the range of}} his power to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has to be in}} direct contact with an object in order to mentally affect it. He has since seemingly recovered with his power returned to normal.|$|E
25|$|The good {{relations}} {{between father and}} son were interrupted, however, by the latter's marriage to Draga Mašin in July 1900. Milan opposed the match to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> resigned his post as commander-in-chief. Alexander subsequently banished Milan from Serbia. Milan left Serbia to Karlsbad, then to Timișoara and finally retired to Vienna. On 11 February 1901, Milan died unexpectedly. He was buried in Krušedol monastery, next to his grandaunt Princess Ljubica, Prince Miloš's wife.|$|E
25|$|By then, Sauron's {{power had}} {{recovered}} to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was able to}} extend his will over Middle-earth. The Eye of Sauron, as his attention and force of will was perceived, {{became a symbol of}} oppression and fear. Following his expulsion from Dol Guldur, he returned to Mordor in 2942, openly declared himself nine years later, and started raising Barad-dûr anew. In preparation for a final war against Men and Elves, he bred armies of monstrous orcs, known as Uruks.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic analyses and popular rhetoric surrounding the debt relief initiatives of Jubilee 2000 www. jubilee 2000 uk. org and the World Bankwww. worldbank. org. It is <b>pointed</b> out <b>that</b> simplistic calls {{to drop the}} debt may be counter-productive. There {{is no point in}} just demonizing debt. It has to be asked if debt cancellation is a particularly effective use of scarce aid resources. A serious look at historical evidence is required. In particular we consider the views of William Easterly on the adverse effects of continuing waves of debt relief on the governments of impoverished countries. We provide a brief empirical analysis in a panel data set using fixed effects estimation. Although our results are not consistent with Easterly's, many of <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and others have raised cannot simply be set aside...|$|R
50|$|A fable {{grew out}} of the trial, which had Tom Corwin coming to the county {{anonymously}} before the trial, and charming its occupants to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that,</b> when <b>he</b> represented Bebb, his good will with the residents assured an acquittal. A later examination of the trial record showed the story to be fanciful, with Corwin and Johnston winning acquittal through competent representation.|$|R
