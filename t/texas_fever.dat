2500|$|Upon his arrival, Crosby {{indicated}} {{his commitment}} to the territory by making over US$20,000 of investments within Montana. [...] Despite this level of dedication, the Republican governor still managed to antagonize the territory's Democratic majority through liberal use of his veto power. [...] The most important example of his veto use was through the blocking of a bill authorizing the establishment of a system of cattle inspections and a cattle commission. [...] Despite the veto, Crosby did take steps to halt cattle with <b>Texas</b> <b>fever</b> from being imported into the territory. Other activities pursued by the governor were a strong anti-crime policy, opposition to polygamy, and an effort to reduce lands held by Native Americans. [...] He also {{played an important role in}} blocking cattle interests from gaining control of Yellowstone.|$|E

In 1889, he along with the veterinarian F.L. Kilbourne discovered Babesia bigemina, the tick-borne protozoan parasite responsible for <b>Texas</b> <b>fever.</b> This marked the first time that an arthropod had been definitively linked with the transmission of an infectious disease and presaged the eventual discovery of insects as important vectors in a number of diseases (see yellow fever, malaria).|$|E

50|$|Many {{people who}} lived within and {{surrounding}} the cattle towns were opposed to the cattle drives. These critics were of two main groups, the farmers and the townspeople themselves. As agriculture spread from the cattle towns into outlying ranges the cattle trails were cut off, and the cowboys would have to steer their heard thought the fields and pastures of the farmers. The latter feared the trampling of their crops {{as well as an}} influx of <b>Texas</b> <b>fever.</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>fever</b> is a disease spread by ticks that live on the Texas Longhorn cattle. The Longhorns have a natural immunity to it, but it is nearly 100% fatal among other breeds of livestock. The townspeople themselves also took issue with the cattle drives. They opposed the growing number of saloons, gambling, and prostitution that catered to the cowboys that came into town with the cattle.|$|E
50|$|A tenant rancher, L.J. Rose, {{tells of}} how he leased 2,300 acres of land on the Guadalasca Ranch from William Broome {{for a period of}} five years in the late 1800s.

Other concerns raised included legislation to prevent <b>Texas</b> cattle <b>fever</b> from spreading to Arizona and creation of a permanent militia.

50|$|The Square Rock Dipping Vat is a {{historic}} former cattle dipping facility in Ouachita National Forest, northeast of Waldron, Arkansas. It is located south of Square Rock Creek, off a forest road that runs south from County Road 94.

50|$|In Miles City, on April 20, 1884, the Eastern Montana Stockgrowers Association met {{to discuss}} {{such issues as}} the {{overstocking}} of the range, <b>Texas</b> <b>fever,</b> and how {{to put a stop}} to the “rustling” of livestock on the open range. Granville Stuart in his book Forty Years on the Frontier claims that 429 stockmen were present, although this is most likely a very generous estimate, as most other meetings were attended by fewer than 100. This meeting is looked back on as a turning point in the organization of cattlemen in the Montana Territory.|$|E
50|$|The idea {{of driving}} Texas longhorn cattle from Texas to railheads in Kansas {{originated}} in the late 1850s but was cut short by the Civil War. In 1866, the first Texas cattle started arriving in Baxter Springs in southeastern Kansas {{by way of the}} Shawnee Trail. However, Texas longhorn cattle carried a tick that spread splenic fever, known locally as <b>Texas</b> <b>Fever,</b> among other breeds of cattle. Alarmed Kansas farmers persuaded the Kansas State Legislature to establish a quarantine line in central Kansas. The quarantine prohibited Texas longhorns from the heavily settled, eastern portion of the state.|$|E
50|$|Mundoolun's {{association}} with investigating the tick borne disease of cattle caused by blood parasites, known as tick fever or red water (babesiosis, anaplasmosis), began with William Collins, the second son of John and Anne. William {{and his older}} brother Robert had travelled through cattle districts in North America during the 1870s, and on returning to Australia the brothers contributed to the improvement of the Queensland pastoral industry. Tick fever was recognised as a serious threat to Queensland cattle during the 1890s, and in 1896 William and Dr J. Sidney Hunt were sent by the government to the United States to inquire into the American cattle tick problem (known there as <b>Texas</b> <b>fever</b> or Southern cattle fever).|$|E
50|$|In 1893, Americans Theobald Smith and Fred Kilborne {{identified}} the parasite {{as the cause}} of <b>Texas</b> cattle <b>fever,</b> the same disease described by Babeș. Smith and Kilborne also {{identified the}} tick as the agent of transmission, a discovery that first introduced the concept of arthropods functioning as disease vectors. Long believed to be a disease that only affected nonhuman mammals, the first case of babesiosis was seen in humans in 1957. The first case was observed in a splenectomized patient (as were all people diagnosed with the infection until 1969). The first case of babesiosis seen in a nonsplenectomized patient proved the protozoan parasite was a potential pathogen in anyone.|$|R
5000|$|Babesia bovis is a {{single-celled}} parasite {{of cattle}} which occasionally infects humans. It {{is a member}} of the phylum Apicomplexa, which also includes the malaria parasite.

It is transmitted by bites from infected larval ticks of the order Ixodida. [...] It was eradicated from the United States by 1943, but is still present in Mexico and much of the world's tropics.
