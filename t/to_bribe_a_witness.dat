5000|$|Clark's {{tenure as}} District Attorney has been marred by reports of {{cronyism}} and misconduct. In May 2016, newspaper accounts revealed Clark to have rehired {{a friend who}} had been forced to resign form the District Attorney's Office years prior after falsely impersonating a police officer, breaking a man's nose, and fleeing the scene of a crime in a fit of road rage. Reporting further revealed that Clark gave a prominent promotion and raise to the assistant district attorney responsible for the bungled prosecution of Kalief Browder. [...] A federal civil rights lawsuit alleged that Clark and high-ranking members of her newly-formed Public Integrity Bureau sought to harass and intimidate a police officer for issuing a traffic ticket to fellow Democratic party member Vanessa Gibson. [...] Another federal lawsuit claimed that Clark demanded the resignation of a disabled prosecutor after she requested handicap access to accommodate her wheelchair. [...] Court filings in the conviction integrity investigation surrounding the murder conviction of Calvin Buari revealed that investigators acting on behalf of the Bronx District Attorney's Office sought <b>to</b> <b>bribe</b> and threaten <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> who exculpated the wrongly accused and imprisoned defendant, ultimately silencing this witness. [...] The Jay-Z produced documentary TIME: The Kalief Browder Story ran on Spike TV in the spring of 2017, detailing the prominent role Clark played as the judge overseeing Kalief Browder's case, immediately prior to her assuming the Office of the District Attorney, keeping this indigent juvenile incarcerated for three years for allegedly stealing a backpack and in solitary confinement long after the Bronx District Attorney's Office lost their only witness and even after Kalief Browder was beaten by prison guards and attempted suicide.|$|R
