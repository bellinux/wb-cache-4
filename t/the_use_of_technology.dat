5|$|Telecommunication is the {{transmission}} of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, images and sounds or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology.</b> It is transmitted either electrically over physical media, such as cables, or via electromagnetic radiation. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing. Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange, the term, telecommunications, is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.|$|E
5|$|Picard {{is joined}} by some of his crew to help the Ba'ku escape from being {{abducted}} while Riker takes the Enterprise far enough from the interference zone to communicate the violation to Starfleet. The Son'a send robotic probes to locate and capture the fleeing Ba'ku. The Son'a leader, Ahdar Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), convinces Dougherty to allow two Son'a ships to attack the Enterprise. Riker defeats the attacking ships and the Enterprise escapes. Their plan exposed, Ru'afo insists upon harvesting the radiation source immediately. Picard, Anij, and several Ba'ku are transported as prisoners onto the Son'a ship. Picard reveals to Dougherty that the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race and involving the Federation in a blood feud. The Son'a are a splinter faction of Ba'ku who gave up their bucolic existence a century earlier to embrace <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology.</b> They attempted to seize power but failed, and the Ba'ku elders exiled them from the planet, denying them the rejuvenating effects of the rings. The Son'a developed an artificial and imperfect means to extend their lives {{at the cost of}} disfigurement. Ru'afo kills Admiral Dougherty when he backs out of the plan and Ru'afo proceeds with his plan.|$|E

30|$|Third, only {{a limited}} number of studies on school levels have been {{performed}} and are available. So and Swatman (2006) studied primary school teachers in Hong Kong and compared them with teachers in secondary schools. They found that teachers in primary schools were less familiar with <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> in teaching. Hsu (2010) investigated 3, 729 teachers from grades 1 through 9 in Taiwan in terms of six aspects, namely (1) information collection and preparation; (2) material producing and troubleshooting; (3) communication and sharing; (4) planning, teaching and evaluation; (5) professional development and self-study; and (6) ethics, health and safety issues, and found that elementary school teachers had a higher level <b>of</b> preference for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> in teaching compared to teachers in middle or high schools. Teachers at different levels have been found to have varying opinions on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> in teaching, and this may also be true for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> e-textbooks in <b>the</b> classroom. According to International Society for Technology in Education (2003), there was no significant differences were found in computer availability between differenct school types (elementary vs. secondary school).|$|R
5|$|The {{technology}} {{required for}} blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or {{may have been}} an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high. As the Varangian Rus' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route, {{it is possible that the}} technology reached Sweden by this means. High quality ores, water power for bellows for blast and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since blast furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the Haya people, it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently. The step from bloomery to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron and, cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast.|$|E
