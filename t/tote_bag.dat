Kawatani concurrently worked as the vocalist and songwriter for indigo la End, a band {{he had been a}} member of since 2009. Of the members, he chose Kyūjitsu Kachō, who was a former member of indigo la End, as well as Chan Mari and Hona Ikoka, from the bands Crimson and Microcosm respectively. The members had known each other since early 2010, from performing together at different events at the Shimokitazawa Era live house in Tokyo. They saw the project as more for fun, aside from their usual musical endeavours. The band name came from a custom <b>tote</b> <b>bag</b> that Chan Mari had brought with her to the recording studio, which had been created by a friend of hers who attended art school.|$|E
