The paper begins with {{the example of the}} tension control of the Electrolytic Tinning Line(ETL), and introduces the method of tension control that realized by the Siemens T 400 technology board and discusses the strategy of 1 # <b>tension</b> <b>roller</b> load-balanced control that carried out by Siemens 6 SE 70 Simovert Masterdrives. The practice shows that these methods have a simple and reliable programming, make debugging convenience, achieve satisfactory control effect and significantly improve product quality...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{electrostatic}} separators. These work in similar ways, but the forces applied to the particles are different and these forces are gravity and electrostatic attraction. The two types are electrodynamic separators (or high <b>tension</b> <b>rollers)</b> or electrostatic separators. In high <b>tension</b> <b>rollers,</b> particles are charged by a corona discharge. This charges the particles that subsequently travel on a drum. The conducting particles lose their charge to the drum and are removed from the drum with centripetal acceleration. Electrostatic plate separators work by passing a stream of particles past a charged anode. The conductors lose electrons {{to the plate and}} are pulled away from the other particles due to the induced attraction to the anode. These separators are used for particles between 75 and 250 micron and for efficient separation to occur, the particles need to be dry, have a close size distribution and uniform in shape. Of these considerations, {{one of the most important}} is the water content of the particles. This is important as a layer of moisture on the particles will render the non-conductors as conductors as the layer of the water is conductive.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} is to control a web transport system with winder and unwinder for elastic material. A physical mod-eling of this plant is made based on the general laws of physics. For this type of controlproblem, it is extremely important {{to prevent the occurrence}} of web break or fold by decoupling the web tension and the web velocity. Due to the wide-range variation of the radius and inertia of the rollers the system dynamics change considerably during the winding/unwinding process The system is composed of five paper <b>rollers</b> and a <b>tensioning</b> <b>roller.</b> A control structure is suggested for this system. This control is deduced from an Energetic Macroscopic Representation of the system.

40|$|Harvesting alfalfa to {{preserve}} maximal dry matter and forage quality begins with harvesting at the correct stage. Hay must then be dried rapidly to reduce respiration losses. Rapid initial drying occurs mainly by first putting cut alfalfa {{into a wide}} swath rather than a windrow. Conditioning is critical for hay making but may not be necessary for haylage. Conditioners must be adjusted both for <b>tension</b> and <b>roller</b> spacing to get optimal conditioning. 24 hours after cutting the swath can be raked into a windrow for final drying and harvesting. Tedding and windrow inverting may provide some additional benefit in some situations. Raking {{must be done to}} minimize ash increase of forage. Merging is more expensive but may produce higher quality forage...|$|R
50|$|Wolseley's postwar engines {{were all}} of the single overhead-{{camshaft}} type, the camshaft driven by a vertical shaft from the crankshaft. The eight-cylinder 21-60 held the vertical shaft in {{the centre of the}} engine, and both crankshaft and camshaft were divided at their midpoints. Their smallest engine of 847cc was designed and made for Morris's new Minor at Ward End with the camshaft drive's shaft the spindle of the dynamo driven by spiral bevel gears. But it was relatively expensive to build and inclined to oil leaks, so its design was modified to a conventional side-valve layout by Morris Engines, which was put into production just for Morris cars in 1932. Meanwhile, Wolseley expanded their original design from four to six cylinders. That six-cylinder single OHC engine announced in September 1930 powered the Wolseley Hornet and several famous MG models. This tiny 6-cylinder SOHC engine eventually was made in three different sizes and its camshaft drive continued to evolve from the dynamo's spindle to, in the end, an automatically <b>tensioned</b> single <b>roller</b> chain.|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{maturing}} {{welding technique}} using a rotating tool for simultaneous heating and stir deforming th~ material interface {{to form a}} solid bond. Significant tensile residual stresses (RS) and component distortion may be produced even with optimized FSW parameters. Recent stress engineering techniques such as global mechanical or <b>roller</b> <b>tensioning</b> may reduce tensile RS and distortion. This dissertation reports on the first systematic investigation into the efficiency of insitu global mechanical tensioning (IS GMT) as well as <b>roller</b> <b>tensioning</b> applied in-situ (ISRT) and post welding (PWRT) for mitigation of tensile RS and plate distortion in high strength aluminium alloy plates joined by FSW. The techniques were evaluated by measuring the distribution of RS across the weld-line by means of neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction as well as' the levels of plate distortion. In each case the weld microstructure and hardness distribution were characterised. The data were rationalised against the ISGMT load and <b>roller</b> <b>tensioning</b> down force respectively. The results have shown that ISGMT and PWRT significantly mitigate longitudinal tensile RS and component distortion. ISGMT was found to decrease the tensile RS by an amount approximately {{equal to that of}} the load applied. Consequently, a stress free weld is produced with an ISGMT load equal to the magnitude of the weld-line RS in the as-welded condition~ PWRT decreases the tensile RS as the rolling down force increases and significant compression may be introduced once a certain magnitude is exceeded. ISRT, at least for the range tested, was found to be less effective. The component distortion reduced along with RSÇ'ú mitigation. No effects on the microstructure or hardness distribution due to mechanical stress engineering were observed. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that in order to make accurate stress measurements by diffraction, the effect of precipitation on the stress free lattice spacing {{must be taken into account}} for age hardening alloys. In order to complete this study an automated robotic sample manipulation system was developed. Finally, the degree of stress relaxation occurring on cutting down large welds was evaluated by progressively shortening test welds and determining the RS for each length. The amount of stress relaxation for each weld follows the same behaviour and appears to depend on the width of the tensile weld zone only.

30|$|The {{reason behind}} such {{phenomenon}} {{may be explained}} hypothetically such as that with increasing height of whip <b>roller,</b> <b>tension</b> of warp yarns was increased as a result warp yarns become straighter and crimp(%) of grey and finished fabric decreased. But when depth of whip roller’s position was decreased at constant height as shown in Fig.  4 b, tension of warp yarns also decreased at long shed area thus warp crimp (%) increased. In finished state, value of crimp (%) was higher than grey state, because in finishing process more tension was applied as fabric had to undergo through more processes thus relaxation was more in finished fabric. The alteration in case of weft density is another cause of such result in warp crimp%.|$|R

40|$|The {{metal strip}} used in roll forming {{has often been}} preprocessed by (<b>tension</b> or <b>roller)</b> {{leveling}} or by skin-pass rolling, and as a consequence, may contain residual stresses. These stresses are not well observed by the tensile test, but could {{have a significant effect}} on the bending and springback behavior. With the advent of improved process design techniques for roll forming, including advanced finite element techniques, the need for precise material property data has become important. The major deformation mode of roll forming is that of bending combined with unloading and reverse bending, and hence property data derived from bend tests could be more relevant than that from tensile testing. This work presents a numerical study on the effect of skin passing on the material behavior of stainless steel strip in pure bending and tension. A two dimensional (2 -D) numerical model was developed using Abaqus Explicit to analyze the affect of skin passing on the residual stress profile across a section for various working conditions. The deformed meshes and their final stress fields were then imported as pre-defined fields into Abaqus Standard, and the post-skin passing material behavior in pure bending was determined. The results show that a residual stress profile is introduced into the steel strip during skin passing, and that its shape and stress level depend on the overall thickness reduction as well as the number of rolling passes used in the skin passing process. The material behavior in bending and the amount of springback changed significantly depending on the skin pass condition...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fifties}} was Moto Guzzi of the Italian Ministry of Defence's request to develop a special vehicle for the [...] "Alpini" [...] (mountain troops). Who transported at that time their {{material}} yet with donkeys [...] It was suggested General Garbari as project officer and formulated a number of requirements which the vehicle had to meet: it needed to move a load of 500 kg through all kinds of terrain, especially in mountainous areas and on very narrow paths. The development was first placed in the hands of Antonio Micucci and later worked on by Soldavini and Giulio Cesare Carcano [...] Carcano had just a new long mounted V-twin engine with forced air cooling developed, where the directors of Moto Guzzi bread saw. There was a 500 and a 650 cc version that was intended for the Fiat 500, but Fiat withdrew from the project. Carcano saw his chance to still find a use for his new engine. The [...] "Mulo Meccanico" [...] (Mechanical Donkey) was a very special machine with wheel drive and variable wheelbase and track width [...] The 754 cc engine produced just 20 hp, due to the low compression ratio that, taking into account fuel of low quality, was necessary. The couple, however, of 47 Nm was achieved at 2,400 rpm. There was only one 26mm Weber carburettor used and the machine had a waterproof coil - ignition [...] There was a chassis system which consisted of tubes and pressed steel box sections. The rear suspension consisted of two box girder arms that were cushioned by rubber suspension. At the front was a one-sided telescopic fork with coil springs [...] The control was done with a steering wheel through bevel gears. The driver sat on a motorcycle seat, but the operation was done through levers and pedals as in a car [...] The engine was sitting behind the driver. Behind it was a manual gearbox with six forward gears and one reverse. There was a central differential with a teruglooppal to prevent roll back. 20% of the drive went to the front wheel, 80% to the rear wheels. The rear-wheel drive was done with two drive shafts that went diagonally from the differential to the two wheels, the front-wheel drive through a propeller shaft leading from the differential between the cylinders through to the steering head went. Using three bevel gears, the drive was at the steering led to another drive shaft, which powered the front wheel. In one cabinet aluminum were located both the gearbox, the differential and the device to adjust the track width. That could happen driving: a distance of about 25 with the gauge could be changed from 1300 mm to 850 mm or vice versa, but in an emergency that could still happen. The drum brakes were behind hydraulic operated, the drum brake at the front {{with the aid of a}} Bowden cable [...] Behind the rear wheels were <b>tensioning</b> <b>rollers,</b> leaving a short caterpillar could be mounted. The front fender left enough space for a snow chain [...] However Autoveicolo da Montagna did not meet expectations. As long as there was straight drove the machine could take the most improbable slopes, but sideways was always the danger of falling over, because there were only three wheels. On the mountain trails were very short turns or rocks enough to stop the mechanical donkey while a real donkey did not experience any problems here. Therefore, the Autoveicolo da Montagna was already taken out of production in 1963.|$|R
40|$|Paper that is {{subjected}} to moisture undergoes dimensional changes. It expands during moistening and shrinks during drying. When the paper is under <b>tension</b> between <b>rollers,</b> the effects are complex since shrinkage and expansion are restricted in the width direction. Waves can then appear on the paper web. This {{can be a problem}} in heatset web offset printing. The problem is known as waviness or fluting. The printed papers exhibit a wavy shape, which is visually disturbing due to light reflections which create glossy streaks. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to develop a method suitable for studying the moisture- and tension-induced waviness. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory scale to study how such waves develop during moistening and drying. The experimental setup was based on a modified tensile tester. A CCD camera and image analysis based on the STFI-OptiTopo technique was used to characterise the waviness. Moistening and drying were achieved by changing the surrounding air humidity. The method was used to study the effect of moisture uptake by the paper, and to evaluate the effect of tension on the waviness. It was found that increasing moisture resulted in a higher waviness amplitude, but that the web tension controlled the wavelength of the waviness. A high tension gave rise to a shorter wavelength. The measured wavelength was compared with a previously suggested model and the predicted wavelength was about twice as high as the measured wavelength. When paper becomes damp it can develop waves which can be a problem with heatset web offset printing. Paper with waves may have glossy streaks after printing. Laboratory experiments studied the effect of moisture uptake by the paper. Readings were taken at a range of air humidities. The effect of tension on the waviness was also measured. The waviness was characterised using a charge coupled device (CCD) camera and the STFI-Packforsk OptiTopo technique to analyse the images. When the humidity was increased the amplitude of the waves increased. A high tension resulted in shorter wavelengths. Results from a previous model were used as a comparison...|$|R
40|$|The {{space station}} {{configuration}} currently studied utilizes structures which require struts to be hinged {{in the middle}} in the stowed mode and locked into place in the deployed mode. Since {{there are hundreds of}} hinges involved, it is necessary that they have simple, positive locking features with a minimum of joint looseness or slack. This invention comprises two similar housings hinged together with a spring loaded locking member which assists in making as well as breaking the lock. This invention comprises a bracket hinge and bracket members with a spring biased and movable locking member. The locking or latch member has ear parts received in locking openings where wedging surfaces on the ear parts cooperate with complimentary surfaces on the bracket members for bringing the bracket members into a tight end-to-end alignment when the bracket members are in an extended position. When the locking member is moved to an unlocking position, pivoting of the hinge about a pivot pin automatically places the locking member to retain the locking member in an unlocked position. In pivoting the hinge from an extended position to a folded position, longitudinal spring members are placed under <b>tension</b> over annular <b>rollers</b> so that the spring tension in a folded position assists in return of the hinge from a folded to an extended position. Novelty lies {{in the creation of a}} locking hinge which allows compact storage and easy assembly of structural members having a minimal number of parts...|$|R
