Collectively, tropical cyclones in Florida during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>period</b> resulted in about $4billion (2008USD) in damage. Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were {{directly responsible for}} about 3,550fatalities during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>period,</b> most of which from the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. The 1947 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, {{with a total of}} 6systems. The 1905, 1908, 1913, 1927, 1931, 1942, and 1943 seasons were the only years during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>period</b> in which a storm did not affect the Floridian coasts.|$|E
5|$|The list of Florida hurricanes from 1950 to 1974 {{encompasses}} 85 Atlantic tropical or subtropical cyclones {{that affected}} the U.S. state of Florida.

Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were {{directly responsible for}} 93fatalities during the period, as well as responsible for 23 indirect deaths. Several tropical cyclones produced over 20inches (500mm) of rainfall in the state, including Hurricane Easy which is the highest total during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>period.</b> The 1969 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, {{with a total of}} 8 systems.

The remnants of a hurricane in 1940 dropped heavy rainfall in the state, which caused over $150million in damage (2008USD) from flooding and landslides.
