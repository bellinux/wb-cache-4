40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in winter wheat grown under organic conditions in Denmark on fields with different weed pressure. The treatments were sowing strategy (normal sowing time, late sowing and false seedbed), row distance (12 cm and 24 cm row distance) and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> method (untreated, mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> (<b>weed</b> harrowing at 12 cm supplemented with row hoeing at 24 cm), and herbicide <b>weed</b> <b>control).</b> <b>Weed</b> biomass was largest at the normal sowing time and was reduced by mechanical or chemical <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Row distance alone did not generally influence weed biomass, but mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> reduced <b>weed</b> biomass at a row distance of 24 cm. Normal sowing time gave rise to about 10 % higher yield. The effect of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> on yield was dependent on the weed pressure. At low weed pressure, mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> caused a yield decrease of 11 % compared to untreated or herbicide. At intermediate weed pressure there were no differences, whereas at high weed pressure, mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> caused a 15 % and no <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> a 25 % yield decrease compared to herbicide treatment.

40|$|In {{order to}} find the {{critical}} period of <b>weed</b> <b>control,</b> {{the best time of}} <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> beginning (i. e. herbicide application time), and the length of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> period (i. e. herbicide persistency) in corn, field experiments were conducted in Bajgah and Kooshkak in Fars Province in 1995 using a randomized complete block design with 14 treatments and four replications. Treatments consisted of different times of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> beginnings (20, 30, 40, and 50 days after corn emergence), different duration of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> periods (10, 20, and 30 days), a weedy check, and a weed-free check during the period of corn growth.  In Kooshkak, a 10 -day duration of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> period had significantly lower corn yields than 20 and 30 -day periods.

40|$|Summary <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> {{may improve}} {{the growth of}} forest {{plantations}} by influencing soil water and nutrient availability, but our knowledge of leaf-level physiological responses to <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> at different within-canopy positions is limited for tropical and subtropical plantations. Foliar carbon (δ 13 C) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotope compositions, gas exchange, and nitro-gen (Nmass) and phosphorus (Pmass) concentrations at four can-opy positions were assessed in a young spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora subsp. Variegata (F. Muell.) A. R. Bean & M. W. Mc-Donald) plantation subjected to either <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> or no <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> treatment, to test if leaves at different positions within the tree canopy had the same physiological responses to the <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> treatment. <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> increased foliar δ 13 C but lowered δ 18 O in the upper-outer and upper-inner canopy, indi-cating that <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> resulted in a higher foliar photosyn-thetic capacity at upper-canopy positions, a conclusion con-firmed by gas exchange measurements. The increased photo-synthetic capacity resulting from <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> can be ex-plained {{by an increase in}} foliar Nmass. In the lower-outer canopy, <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> reduced foliar δ 13 C while lowering δ 18 O even more than in the upper-canopy, suggesting strong enhancement of the partial pressure of CO 2 in the leaf intercellular spaces and of foliar stomatal conductance in lower-canopy foliage. This conclusion was supported by gas exchange measurements. Fo-liar photosynthesis in the lower-inner canopy showed no sig-nificant response to <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> The finding that leaves at dif-ferent canopy positions differ in their physiological responses to <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> highlights the need to consider the canopy po-sition effect when examining competition for soil nutrient and water resources between weeds and trees...|$|R

Some agronomic practices, such as weed management, are fundamental to cultivation, {{as a means of}} obtaining a high crop yield.

Thus, this study aimed at determining the optimal phenological stage in early-maturing common bean cultivars to perform the <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> without providing reductions in yield and seed quality. The experimental design was randomized blocks with 20 treatments and four replications, in a 2 × 2 × 5 (cultivars × types of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> × periods of <b>weed</b> <b>control)</b> factorial scheme. The periods of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> for both cultivars (Carioca Precoce and IPR-Colibri) consisted of full cycle <b>weeded</b> (<b>control),</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> at the V 4 - 3 stage (first three nodes on the main stem with trifoliate leaves), at the R 5 stage (beginning of bloom) and at the R 8 stage (appearance of pods) and full cycle unweeded (no <b>weed</b> <b>control).</b> The types of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> used were chemical (fluazifop-p-butyl + fomesafen) and mechanical (hoe). The Carioca Precoce cultivar demonstrated higher agronomic performance and yield than the IPR-Colibri cultivar, although the IPR-Colibri seeds had a higher vigor.

40|$|Direct seeding of pea (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) crops is {{increasing}} in popularity in western Canada. <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> strategies {{for these two}} crops are limited in a conventional tillage system; in a direct-seeding system, <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> options become even fewer. The herbicide ethalfluralin is commonly used for <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in pea sown in a conventional tillage system, {{but it is not}} registered for use in direct-seeding systems. Surface application or shallow incorporation of ethalfluralin and triallate/trifluralin (10 : 4) could offer broad spectrum <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in direct seeded pea and lentil. The level of <b>weed</b> <b>control,</b> crop tolerance and the economic suitability of the use of the dinitroanilines in direct-seeded pea and lentil was assessed. Results of experiments conducted at two locations near Saskatoon in 1995 and 1996 indicate that surface applications of ethalfluralin and triallate/trifluralin (10 : 4) offer similar and acceptable grassy <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> However, ethalfluralin surface applied at rates less than 1. 4 kg ai ha- 1 did not provide acceptable control of wild oat when the wild oat population was high. Ethalfluralin applied in combination with a spring glyphosate bum-off treatment, followed by post-emergent metribuzin in lentil and MCPA-Na salt in pea, resulted in better broadleaf <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> than ethalfluralin applied in combination with fall-applied metribuzin.

40|$|It {{is argued}} {{in this paper}} that static {{approaches}} to weed management, where the benefits and costs are only considered within a single season, are inappropriate for assessing the economic benefits of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> technologies. There are carryover effects from weed management as <b>weeds</b> that escape <b>control</b> in one season may reproduce and replenish weed populations in following seasons. Consequently, {{it is appropriate to}} view <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> {{in the context of a}} resource management problem where the goal is to determine the optimal inter-temporal level of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> that maximises economic benefits over some pre-determined period of time. A dynamic optimisation model for <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> is presented. Using the tools of comparative static analysis and Pontryagin's maximum principle, the conditions for optimal input use (ie <b>weed</b> <b>control)</b> are compared for static and dynamic situations. It is shown that a higher level of input use for a given weed population is optimal using a dynamic framework than would be derived under a static framework. The analysis is further extended by the incorporation of uncertainty and shows that the optimal level of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> is also affected by uncertainty in herbicide efficacy and the survival of weed seeds produced.

40|$|GESTINF (Berti and Zanin, 1997) is a {{decision}} tool for post-emergence <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> based on the equivalent density approach (Berti and Zanin, 1994). Based on the observation of weed densities just before treatment, the program estimates the economic return from the treatment, thus indicating whether to treat or not and, if a treatment is needed, the most economic <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> solution. Each treatment is also characterized by an environmental pollution index. GESTINF has been tested on wheat and soybean crops. Trials were done {{on a farm in}} north-eastern Italy, considering a total cropping area of about 60 ha of wheat and 40 ha of soybean. For both crops in those areas, <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> followed the suggestions of GESTINF, while the remaining cropping areas were treated according to the standard farm <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> practices. To compare the two <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> systems, the extra time required for scouting and treatments, as well as <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> efficacy and average crop yield were measured.

40|$|Most {{physical}} and cultural <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> methods for arable crops {{do not provide}} complete <b>weed</b> <b>control.</b> Some <b>weeds</b> will escape the treatments and the numbers depend strongly on the successfulness of conducting the treatments. Moreover, current mechanical <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> methods, that work the intra-row area of the crop, generally operate with low selectivity whether it is cereals grown at narrow row spacing or typical row crops (e. g. maize, sugar beets, and many vegetables) at wider row spacing. Low selectivity means that a high <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> level might be associated with severe crop damages, particularly if large weeds are to be controlled satisfactorily. Thus, seeking for complete <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> can be very risky or more likely impossible.

The method used most {{commonly}} so far entails harrowing the whole field {{before and after}} emergence followed by hoeing in combination with ridging. In practice this method does not always give a sufficient <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in the row. Therefore the effectiveness of several newer methods of <b>weed</b> <b>controlling</b> in the row were investigated in 2002 and 2003 on Aver Heino experimental farm of Wageningen UR...|$|R
40|$|One {{disadvantage}} of conservation tillage is increase in weed pressure (Hossain et al, 2014). <b>Weed</b> <b>control</b> in conservation tillage {{is dependent on}} the use of herbicides, but other cultural options may help in reducing weed infestations. There is limited knowledge about effective <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> under conservation tillage in intensive rice based cropping systems in Bangladesh. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of herbicides and hand weeding with or without residues on <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in ric...|$|R

But this year, it 2 ̆ 7 s dry {{over much of the}} state, and predictions of a season-long drought have many producers concerned about <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> and cultivation. Regardless of moisture levels, most soil conservation plans seek to minimize cultivation and soil disturbance. But no producer should be expected to endure serious yield and income losses due to weed infestations. Cultivation results {{in a wide range of}} <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> effectiveness. Although a single cultivation cannot provide adequate <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> by itself, the use of row cultivation can reduce <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> costs and shifts in weed populations when used to supplement herbicides...|$|R
