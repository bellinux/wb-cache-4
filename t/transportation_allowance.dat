40|$|Abstract Background Individuals {{diagnosed}} with HIV {{in developing countries}} are not always successfully linked to onward treatment services, resulting in missed opportunities for timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, or prophylaxis for opportunistic infections. In collaboration with local stakeholders, we designed and assessed a referral system to link persons diagnosed at a voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) clinic in a rural district in northern Tanzania with a government-run HIV treatment clinic in a nearby city. Methods Two-part referral forms, with unique matching numbers on each side were implemented to facilitate access to the HIV clinic, and were subsequently reconciled to monitor the proportion of diagnosed clients who registered for these services, stratified by sex and referral period. Delays between referral and registration at the HIV clinic were calculated, and lists of non-attendees were generated to facilitate tracing among those who had given prior consent for follow up. <b>Transportation</b> <b>allowances</b> and a "community escort" from a local home-based care organization were introduced for patients attending the HIV clinic, with supportive counselling services provided by the VCT counsellors and home-based care volunteers. Focus group discussions and in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} health care workers and patients to assess the acceptability of the referral procedures. Results Referral uptake at the HIV clinic averaged 72 % among men and 66 % among women during {{the first three years of}} the national antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme, and gradually increased following the introduction of the <b>transportation</b> <b>allowances</b> and community escorts, but declined following a national VCT campaign. Most patients reported that the referral system facilitated their arrival at the HIV clinic, but expressed a desire for HIV treatment services to be in closer proximity to their homes. The referral forms proved to be an efficient and accepted method for assessing the effectiveness of the VCT clinic as an entry point for ART. Conclusion The referral system reduced delays in seeking care, and enabled the monitoring of access to HIV treatment among diagnosed persons. Similar systems to monitor referral uptake and linkages between HIV services could be readily implemented in other settings. </p...|$|R

In June 1995, an unexpected decrease in COLA index on the Kanto Plain of Japan, {{to include the}} Yokosuka area, caused concern amongst service members stationed in this area. The purchasing power of the dollar was in decline {{when compared to the}} yen and all other economic indicators {{at the time of the}} COLA decrease suggested that the COLA index should have increased or at least remained constant. What explains the apparent inconsistency between the declining value of the dollar relative to the yen and the concurrent decrease in COLA provided to service members? This thesis conducted a critical analysis of the procedures and methods used by the Per Diem, Travel and <b>Transportation</b> <b>Allowance</b> Commiflee (PDTATAC) to calculate the cost of living allowance (COLA) index and determine the cause and effect of the June 1995 decrease in COLA index. This thesis addressed the policies of the COLA system, utilizing both historical data and a stylized model, to determine if they are equitable from an economic standpoint. The analysis revealed that the Living Pattern Survey (LPS) was a viable tool to obtain information on where service members made purchases, if exchange rates were stable. If exchange rates were increasing, the LPS prevented overpayment of service members. If exchange rates were declining, the LPS reduced the 'purchasing power' of service members[URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Industrial cluster {{literature}} has traditionally focused on work-place upgrading, clusters' ability to promote firm productivity, economic growth, and benefits that firm owners can or will give to workers. However, even in growing, productive clusters, such a work-place focus leaves out {{questions about how}} to situate {{the contribution of the}} firm and cluster in improving living standards in the wider socio-economic and spatial context of the region. By providing a systematic examination of the relationship between industrial clusters and poverty analyzed within a multidimensional frame, this dissertation attempts to close this bridge. It asks under what conditions firms in productive clusters pass on benefits to workers in ways that improve their living standards, even when they are not required by law to do so. Three hypotheses are put forward. First, firms in their own interest boost worker productivity by providing certain kinds of work-place benefits such as overall capability, proxied by various types of internal technological knowledge and skills. Second, firms choose not to give other place-based and work-based benefits like health or housing because social policies do not demand it and it has no direct benefit to the firm. Third, firms pass on these benefits because it costs little, and tend to deepen employee loyalty. The study analyses the case of the Otigba Information and Communications Technology cluster in Lagos, Nigeria and uses survey questionnaires, interviews, and archival research. Results confirm that clustering promotes not just firm-level productivity as literature on agglomeration economy highlights, but also raises workers' living standards compared to non-clustered firms in the same sector. Older employees, and those with prior experience in other firms report improvements in their living standards since working in their firms. Furthermore, firms in the cluster give a diverse number of non-income benefits such as housing, health insurance, feeding and <b>transportation</b> <b>allowance,</b> training, child care, funding for further education, pension and company products, based on the length of service in the firm, age of employee, and size of the firm. Additionally, while formal state-supported social protection institutions are largely absent, monetary and non-monetary benefits such as employment, provision of skills through apprenticeships, housing, transportation, and feeding allowance are channeled to employees through firms and informal institutions based on social and kinship ties. A high level of horizontal and collective cooperation based on professional lines has also emerged within the cluster in the absence of formal state institutions. The dissertation makes a theoretical contribution by bridging studies on industrial clusters with those on social protection policy instruments. The study gives greater evidence to the diversity of social protection available, as well as the opportunity for economic development planners to explore ways in which firm-driven social protection can be integrated into social policy...|$|E

The case was assigned to Judge Richard G. Stearns.

30|$|Our employee-level data provide {{not only}} total yearly wage {{but also its}} {{different}} wage components: basic wage, bonus, supplements, and overtime pay. Bonuses can differ between individuals and {{are based on the}} productivity of workers. Supplements are given to all workers with certain job characteristic, such as those who work night hours or who have more years of tenure in the firm. Information on pay is the yearly total. We divide this yearly total by 12 to construct a monthly pay variable. In comparing wages to the legal minimum wage it is important to use the correct measure of wages. Legally, the wage compared to the minimum wage should include the basic wage plus bonus plus some, but not all, supplements. Overtime pay, the employer contribution to social insurance, and some legally-mandated supplements should be excluded. Other wage supplements that should be excluded when comparing wages to the minimum wage include those for working the night shift and working under dangerous or uncomfortable working conditions. Wage supplements that should be included when comparing wages to the minimum wage are those that are not legally mandated, and include those for medical and health benefits, for tenure, meal <b>allowances,</b> <b>transportation</b> supplements, supplements for books and newspapers, and cost of living adjustments. However, our data only report total supplements paid to workers. That is, we cannot distinguish between supplements that are legally required {{to be included in the}} minimum wage and those legally excluded. Because we cannot distinguish which part of reported supplements should or should not be included when comparing to the minimum wage, when we calculate the proportion of full-time workers earning less than the monthly minimum wage, we present two estimates: the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus (an upper bound) and the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus plus supplements (a lower bound).|$|R
40|$|The theoretic part of {{the thesis}} focuses on social benefits, {{received}} by people with a severe motor disability, which are already impacted by new legal regulations. These regulations have been in effect since 1. 2. 2012. As {{a result of the}} social reform carried out in 2012 the number of allowances has decreased. According to Act No. 329 / 2011 there are two new allowances, mobility and special aid allowances. ¨ The research {{part of the}} thesis strives, through a qualitative strategic research, to reflect on the situation of people with a severe motor disability. The main objective of the thesis was to identify how the social and economic situation had changed for people with a severe motor disability in connection with reforms in the benefit system valid since January 2012. A partial task was to find out how the administration workload has changed for the applicant and recipient of social benefits. The data was collected through a half-standardised interview. The questions were divided into two thematic sections according to defined thesis objectives. The first set of questions focuses on the social and economic situation, specifically the change in a social and economic situation in connection with the newly set up social benefits (in the area of mobility and aids for people with a severe disability), financial involvement in paying for the aid and the change of the level of dependability (and subsequently the level of the allowance for care) in connection with newly created needs. The basic group consists of people with a severe motor disability who receive social benefits for disabled people in the Czech Republic. A selected group contained 8 people in total with a severe motor disability who receive allowances as part of the social benefits system. In case of respondents who originally had been receiving the <b>allowance</b> for individual <b>transportation,</b> the amount was decreased and they now receive it as a mobility allowance. In case of the decrease of the amount for transportation, the respondents changed their own usual ways of transportation or found other sources of funds. However, the social and economic situation of the respondents, who before the change in legislation were not receiving any mobility <b>allowance</b> (<b>transportation)</b> and at the moment they receive the mobility allowance, has improved in this area. The number of respondents in both groups is the same so we can say that the changes in <b>allowances</b> regarding <b>transportation</b> (mobility) have not brought any significant change in a social and economic situation of people. The most common view in terms of the question regarding the financial participation in special aids was neutral. Most respondents stated that the level of dependability on care and subsequently the allowance had remained the same. From {{the point of view of}} the majority of respondents the administration workload has not changed as a result of the change in legislation in the area of benefits for people with a severe motor disability. The respondents have a negative view regarding the character (depth) of investigation of the social and financial situation and negatively perceive the approach of an officer. In other areas their views are neutral or they have not noticed any change after the change in legislation. To conclude, it is possible to state that from the respondents? point of view, the social reform has not been perceived as beneficial...|$|R
