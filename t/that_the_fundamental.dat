Hodges, , holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> {{right to marry}} is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Fourteen counties in three Southern states continued to deny marriage licenses for same-sex marriage. The Alabama Supreme Court allowed the probate judges of ten counties in Alabama to deny such marriage licenses, the clerk of one Texas county chose to resign rather than issue such licenses, and the clerks of two counties in Kentucky were not issuing licenses due to paperwork delays. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ordered all Kentucky county clerks to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses immediately.|$|E

5|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Rights are not {{absolute}} and {{are subject to}} reasonable restrictions as necessary {{for the protection of}} public interest. In the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973, the Supreme Court, overruling a previous decision of 1967, held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights could be amended, subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights can be enhanced, removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of Parliament. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any of the Fundamental Rights, excluding Articles 20 and 21, by order of the President. The President may, by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well, thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights, except Articles 20 and 21, during the period of the emergency. Parliament may also restrict the application of the Fundamental Rights to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police, in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline, by a law made under Article 33.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the value-relevance of nine fundamental signals identified by equity analysts as instrumental to the equity valuation {{process in the}} oil and gas industry. Drawing from a fundamental analysis framework, this paper predicts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> are valued by the market. In addition, this study predicts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> are incrementally value-relevant with respect to accounting earnings and book value of equity. This study employs the valuation model developed by Ohlson (1990, 1995) as well as a traditional cumulative stock return model to test these predictions. ^ Most fundamental analysis studies have employed cross-sectional approaches, examining large samples of firms for indicators of future earnings and resulting firm value. However, numerous researchers have requested that industry-specific studies be performed (i. e., Bernard and Stober 1989; Lev and Thiagarajan 1993; and others). The underlying motivation for the current study stems from the ramifications of unique accounting procedures available to firms in {{the oil and gas}} industry. Firms within this industry have two distinct accounting methods available to them. The choice of accounting methods is considered the cause of major discrepancies between the balance sheets and income statements of oil and gas firms. ^ This study contributes to <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> analysis literature by identifying four categories of fundamentals specifically designed by analysts to overcome the comparability problems inherent in the equity valuation process of oil and gas firms. These fundamentals are then linked to firm value. The findings demonstrate a significant relationship between a number of <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> with both <b>the</b> market value of equity and cumulative stock return. In addition, results suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> provide incremental information beyond earnings, change in earnings, and book value of equity when explaining equity values and stock returns. This information can be regarded as a first step in the quest to identify a fundamental valuation model which accurately predicts stock price, cumulative return, and/or earnings growth. Thus, this research is useful to analysts and investors within the oil and gas sector as well as to academic researchers. ...|$|R
