5|$|The Daily Show is {{aired on}} Australian Pay TV channel, The Comedy Channel, weeknights at 6:30pm. Free-to-air digital channel ABC2 began {{broadcasting}} the show without commercial breaks in March 2010, but discontinued in January 2011 when The Comedy Channel obtained exclusive rights; episodes were also {{available on the}} network's online service ABC iView shortly after airing. The Comedy Channel (as well as ABC2 during 2010) used to air the show together with The Colbert Report, and both air the Global Edition on Mondays and the regular edition <b>Tuesday</b> <b>through</b> Friday. The Global Edition was previously shown weekend late nights on SBS before moving to Network TEN.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom and Ireland, {{the digital}} {{television}} channel More4 used to broadcast episodes of The Daily Show <b>Tuesday</b> <b>through</b> Friday evenings with the Global Edition, which is uncensored, airs on Mondays; regular episodes air the evening following their U.S. airing. More4 {{was the first}} international broadcaster to syndicate entire Daily Show episodes, though they made edits to the program due to content, language, length or commercial references. The program was also available to watch via the internet video on demand service 4oD. However, the 'toss' to The Colbert Report was usually included {{even though it was}} aired on FX, another channel. In addition, the placement of commercial breaks followed the UK format, with one break midway through the show rather than several short breaks at various points. When The Daily Show was on hiatus, either re-runs or alternative content were aired. Since January 2011, only the Global Edition is broadcast.|$|E

On September 1 of that year, USA Today launched a fourth printsite for its international edition in London to publish and distribute that version of the paper to the United Kingdom and the British Isles.

25|$|In Australia, Nine Network {{broadcasts}} Good Morning America on its {{stations in}} metropolitan areas, and regional affiliates SC9 and NBN, on a one-day delay (by way of Australia and the United States being on different {{ends of the}} International Date Line) each <b>Tuesday</b> <b>through</b> Friday from 3.30 to 5:00, Saturdays from 4.30 to 6:00 and Monday mornings from 4:00 to 5:00a.m. (Nine does not air the Saturday edition of the program). The Nine broadcasts features a map providing forecasts for Australia in place of national U.S. weather map (which itself is also, in a separate feature within the main weather segment, used as a cutaway to weather updates provided by local ABC affiliates). Although it airs {{at the same time}} as Seven Network and Network Ten's broadcasts of NBC's Today and CBS This Morning, Good Morning Americas broadcasts by Nine is unchallenged ratings-wise in some regions where other affiliates preempt their networks' U.S. breakfast programs with paid and religious programming.|$|E
25|$|Kwajalein atoll, {{like the}} rest of the Marshall Islands, passed from Spanish to German to Japanese control during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. During that period it was west of the IDL. Although Kwajalein {{formally}} became part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands with the rest of the Marshalls after World War II, the United States established a military installation there. Because of that, Kwajalein used the Hawaiian date, so was effectively east of the International Date Line (un{{like the rest}} of the Marshalls). Kwajalein returned to the west side of the IDL by removing Saturday, 21 August 1993 from its calendar to match the dates used by the rest of the Marshall Islands, at the request of its government. Along with the shift, Kwajalein's work week was changed to <b>Tuesday</b> <b>through</b> Saturday to match the Hawaiian work week of Monday through Friday on the other side of the IDL.|$|E
25|$|When Mrs. Brehm died in 1962, the Old Mill was willed to the City of San Marino. The {{city has}} {{preserved}} {{the building and}} opened {{it to the public}} as a museum and art gallery (California Art Club Gallery), operated first by the California Historical Society and later by the Old Mill Foundation. The museum is open <b>Tuesday</b> <b>through</b> Sunday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. A model showing how the mill operated is located {{on the ground floor of}} the museum. While nothing remains of the waterwheel, two of the millstones (pictured above) are displayed in the garden area. The millstones were found more than a century after the mill closed on the grounds of the Huntington Library by General George S. Patton, who grew up in the area and recalled seeing them used as blocks for mounting horses. There is also a 16th-century volcanic rock fountain in the patio to the east of the mill. The fountain was acquired in Mexico by Mrs. Brehm's daughter, Mrs. Albert Doerr.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the station}} has either pre-empted or aired out of pattern certain ABC network {{programs}} {{to make room}} for other local or syndicated programs or because of internal concerns over a program's content. Beginning in 1970, it was {{one of a handful of}} ABC stations that did not carry American Bandstand, opting to air public service programming instead. It also pre-empted Good Morning America for the first five months of its run from November 1975 to March 1976, in favor of the existing local morning program The AM Show (GMAs short-lived predecessor AM America was also not cleared throughout its run from January to November 1975). Because of its hour-long midday newscast – which airs at 12:00p.m.—WFAA has aired programming scheduled during that hour nationally on a day-behind basis at 11:00a.m.: the soap opera All My Children aired in that slot until September 27, 2011, when it was replaced by current 11:00a.m. slotholder The Chew. From the mid-1970s until that soap concluded in December 1984, WFAA aired The Edge of Night (which the network recommended be aired at 3:00p.m.) on a day-behind basis prior to ABC's morning sitcom rerun block, in order to air feature films after General Hospital. Following the midday newscast's expansion into an hour-long broadcast in September 1992, WFAA aired Loving – which many ABC stations in the Central Time Zone normally aired at 12:30p.m.—on a day-behind basis until the soap opera (which by that time, was reformatted as The City) was cancelled in 1996; for similar reasons, it also carried Port Charles on <b>Tuesday</b> <b>through</b> Saturday early-mornings throughout that soap's run from 1997 to 2004.|$|E
