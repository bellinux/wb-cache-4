40|$|Osteosclerosis of the {{terminal}} finger phalanges was assessed {{by means of a}} grading score in two age-matched groups of 96 females, each suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthrosis (OA), respectively, and in a sample of 894 males and females, above the age of 44 years, from Dutch small town populations. Cortical thickness of the <b>therminal</b> phalanges decreases markedly with age. Whereas in the age group 45 - 54 years, terminal phalangeal osteosclerosis is more pronounced in females, at higher ages the difference between the sexes disappears. The diameter of {{the terminal}} cortex increases gradually from the second to the fifth finger. No {{differences were found between the}} RA and the OA groups, nor were these groups different from the population survey except for a lower incidence of terminal phalangeal osteosclerosis in female osteoarthrotics between 45 and 55 years of age, compared to females of the same age group from the population sample...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} experimented {{to detect the}} planktons from the drowned dead bodies under the special conditions. Rabbits were thrown into the ditch water after they were injured the carotid artery, during the {{terminal}} breathing by strangulation and concussion of the brain. It was tried to detect the planktons after the incinaration of organs and bones. Results are following; 1) Planktons could not be detected from organs and bones of rabbits that were put the ditch water into stomach with catheterization. 2) Planktons could be detected from the organs and bones of rabbits that were drowned to death after injured to the carotid artery, but longer the time after injured, lesser the plankton can be detected. 3) Excepting lung, there were no planktons in the organs and bones of the rabbits that were thrown into the river after death by bleeding. 4) From the organs and bones of the rabbits that were thrown into the river under standstill of <b>therminal</b> breathing by strangulation, several plankton could be detected though in small number. 5) Planktons could be detected from organs and bones of the rabbits that were drowned {{to death in the}} river under concussion of the brain...|$|E
40|$|A 3 -D {{finite element}} model (FEM) was {{developed}} to calculate the lemperature of an asphtalt rubber pavement localed in the Northeast of Portugal. The goal of the case study {{presented in this paper}} is to show the good accuracy temperature prediction tha can be obtained with this model when compared with the field pavement thermal condition obtained during a year. lnput data to the model are the hourly values for solar radiation and temperature and the mean daily value of wind speed obtained from a meteorological station. The <b>therminal</b> response of a multilayered pavement structure is modelled using a FEM transient thermal analysis and each analysis was initiated with the full deph constant initial temperature abtained from field measurements. For each analysed day, the pavement temperature was measured at a new pavement section, located in IP 4 main road, near Bragança, in the north of Portugal. At this location, seven thermocouples were installed in the asphalt rubber and conventional mix layer, at seven different depths. These paviment data was used to validate this simulation model, by comparing model calculated data with mesured pavement temperatures. As conclusion, the 3 -D finite-element analysis proved to be an interesting tool to simulate the transient behavior of the asphalt pavements. The presented simulation model can predict the pavement temperature at diferrent levels of bitumious layers with good accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Diaprepes abbreviatus is {{an exotic}} root weevil {{occurring}} in southern US. It {{is a highly}} polyphagous species which can complete its entire life cycle on citrus and several woody ornamental plants. The lack of native egg parasitoids for this wwvil in citrus orchards has triggered efforts to evaluate condidate egg parasitoids from the Caribbean Region into Florida. The egg parasitoids Fidiobia dominica and Haeckeliania sperata are two exotic natural enemies of D. abbreviatus recently introduced in the US in a classical biological control program. The <b>therminal</b> requierements of both parasitoids were studied in the laboratory. The upper development threhold (UDT) of F. dominica was 30. 0 ºC, its maximal development rate (MDR) occurred at 27. 6 ºC, its lower development threshold (LDT) was 9. 6 ºC and its thermal constant (K) for development from egg to adult was 293. 1 DD. For H. sperata, UDT was 35. 0 ºC, MDR occurred at 31. 0 ºC, LDT was arround 15 ºC and K was 188. 1 DD. Based on these results, both species {{would be able to}} complete 17 to 18 generations annually in southern Florida. However, host availability during critical periods could severely impair the ability og these egg parasitoids to establish and successfully control D. abbreviatus in areas where winter temperatures fluctuate around 12 ºC, the LDT for this pes...|$|E
40|$|Descreve-se microanotômico e histologicamente o ovário de Triatoma infestans sob o ponto de vista de sua função. O ovário é do tipo meroístico-telotrófico. a túnica própria é uma membrana dupla, das quais a lamela interna isola o germário do filamento terminal. O estrato germinativo é limitado a uma zona estreita atrás do volumoso grupo de células nutridoras. Os oócitos, ainda dentro do estrato germinativo, percorrem os estados da prófase até a sinapses, cujos filamentos cromáticos se desintegram. Em todas as zonas do germário, todos os tipos de células são bem individualizadas, não se observa um índice de formação de sincício. Inicialmente, o epitélio folicular é composto de várias camadas de células mononucleadas. Com o crescimento do oócito o epitélio torna-se simples com células binucleadas em conseqüência de amitoses. O pedúnculo ovariolar possui uma glândula circular. Microanotomy and {{histology}} of the ovary of Triatoma infestans {{are described}} under the view point of its funcion. The ovary {{is of the}} meroistic-telotrophic type. The Tunica propria is a dobble membrane, the internal one divides the germarium from the <b>therminal</b> filament. The stratum germinativum {{is limited to a}} strait zone behind the volumous group of food cells. The oocytes, within the stratum germinativum, show the prophase figures up till the synapsis, when the cromatic filaments soon desintegrate. In all zones of the terminal chamber all types of cells are well individualized, {{there is no sign of}} syncytium to be found. In the beginning of formation the follicle epithelium is formed by some layers of cells with only one nucleus. During the growth of the oocyte, the epithelium shows only one layer of cells with two nuclei as consequence of an amitosis. The pedicel of the ovariolum has a circular gland...|$|E
