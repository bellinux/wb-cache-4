5|$|The {{section of}} the present route between New Castle and Wilmington was {{constructed}} as the New Castle and Wilmington Turnpike, a private turnpike, in 1813. What would become DE 9 originally existed as a county road by 1920. Four years later, the road between Leipsic and Smyrna was upgraded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> highway. In addition, the current alignment of DE9 around Taylors Bridge and between Delaware City and Wilmington was paved. In 1931, what would become DE9 was upgraded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> highway between Bay Road and Little Creek and between Port Penn and Delaware City. A year later, the road became a state highway between Delaware City and Wilmington. By this time, what would become DE 9 between Little Creek and Leipsic was upgraded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> highway.|$|E
5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department signposted {{the highway}} {{system in the}} state for the first time. At that time, M-57 {{designation}} was originally used in Charlevoix County from Boyne Falls at M-13 (now US131) through Boyne City and back to then M-13. That highway's number was changed to M-75 in 1926. By the next year, the number was then assigned <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> trunkline that connected between Quinnesec and the Wisconsin state line in the Upper Peninsula. This second iteration was short-lived as it was replaced by an extension of US141 into Michigan.|$|E

On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY441 from the Monroe County line to NY350 was transferred from Wayne County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.

The appointments of two Democratic state representatives– John Tilley as Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and Tanya Pullin <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> judgeship– reduced the party's majority in the House and set up special elections that gave Republicans {{a chance to win}} their seats from Democrats. Bevin set the dates of the special elections to fill the seats of Tilley and Pullin, as well as those formerly held by newly elected Auditor Mike Harmon and newly elected Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, for March 8, 2016. Democratic representatives Denver Butler and Jim Gooch also switched their party affiliation to Republican in December, reducing the Democratic majority to 50–46 for the beginning of the first General Assembly of Bevin's governorship, and giving Republicans a chance to evenly split the chamber's 100 seats by sweeping the special elections.
