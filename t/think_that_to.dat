David thinks he wears the trousers and she is prepared to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> an extent. So she manages to massage his ego and then does her own thing anyway." [...] Karen becomes an alcoholic in Series 4 and seeks therapy to control her urges. After trying to put David's affair with Jessica behind them, Karen starts an affair with publisher Mark. She breaks up with him via email while in Australia but he flies down and reveals their relationship to David. She briefly gets back together with Mark during her divorce from David in Series 5 but ends the relationship again when he wants {{nothing to do with}} her children. After Rachel's death, Karen sees a grief counsellor. Norris and Bullen changed Karen's personality significantly between the pilot and the series; Norris altered the character's accent to be less [...] "posh" [...] and Bullen wrote her to be more sympathetic. Bullen found it difficult to write situations for Karen that took place outside the character's house. Eventually, he wrote a storyline for her in Series 2 where she rebels against her upper-middle-class lifestyle by smoking cannabis at a dinner party. Norris was disappointed that the plot of Karen and David's divorce could not be developed further in Series 5, as the majority of screen time was given to Adam and Rachel.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "soft" [...] {{utilitarian}} {{position on}} animal rights {{is a moral}} intuition of many, probably most, Americans. We realize that animals feel pain, and we <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> inflict pain without a reason is bad. Nothing of practical value is added by dressing up this intuition {{in the language of}} philosophy; much is lost when the intuition is made a stage in a logical argument. When kindness toward animals is levered into a duty of weighting the pains of animals and of people equally, bizarre vistas of social engineering are opened up.|$|E

5000|$|Whosoever <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> {{engage in}} a disputation for refuting such a theory is a {{religious}} duty harms religion and weakens it. For these matters rest on demonstrations, geometrical and arithmetical, that leave no room for doubt.|$|R

2500|$|Summers had {{previously}} {{argued that a}} proposed boycott was antisemitic [...] "in effect, if not intent". This position was criticized by Judith Butler, in an article titled [...] "No, it's not anti-semitic". Butler argues the distinction of effective antisemitism, and intentional antisemitism is at best controversial. [...] "If we <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> criticise Israeli violence, or to call for economic pressure {{to be put on}} the Israeli state to change its policies, is to be ‘effectively anti-semitic’, we will fail to voice our opposition for fear of being named as part of an anti-semitic enterprise. No label could be worse for a Jew, who knows that, ethically and politically, the position with which it would be unbearable to identify is that of the anti-semite." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{performance}} venues {{had their}} LARES system installed with no fanfare. The Brooklyn Academy of Music acquired their Howard Gilman Opera House {{system in the}} summer of 1997 but made no public announcement. Authorization for the purchase came from then-president Harvey Lichtenstein, who told a reporter in 1999 [...] "Our feeling is that people have a prejudice against this kind of thing; they <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> use such a system is kind of faking it. We really don't think that's true." [...] Mark London, director of capital projects was reported as saying [...] "The system has added an amazing amount of warmth to the orchestra and significantly altered the acoustics of the hall." [...] London stated that LARES was not turned on for opera, only for orchestra and theater performances.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, Putin said: [...] "It is my deep {{conviction}} that {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union was a national tragedy on a massive scale. I think the ordinary citizens of the former Soviet Union and the citizens in the post-Soviet space, the CIS countries, have gained nothing from it. On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today we should look at the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: we should look forward." [...] In December 2007, he said in the interview to the Time magazine: [...] "Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best sense of that word. Incidentally, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> a certain extent, to a significant extent, this is also attributable to the American people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What is good fortune, Macumazahn?" [...] Umbelazi replied as {{he grasped}} my hand. [...] "Sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> live and prosper is good fortune, and {{sometimes}} I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> die and sleep is good fortune, for in sleep there is neither hunger nor thirst of body or of spirit. In sleep there come no cares; in sleep ambitions are at rest; nor do those who look no more upon the sun smart beneath the treacheries of false women or false friends. Should the battle turn against me, Macumazahn, {{at least that}} good fortune will be mine, for never will I live to be crushed beneath Cetewayo's heel." ...|$|E
