5|$|One type of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E

This practice involves overlaying text {{with an image}} containing the same text written in the desired font. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> aesthetic purposes, but prevents text selection, increases bandwidth use, is bad for search engine optimization, and makes the text inaccessible for users with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{compressing}} gas into a diving cylinder removes {{moisture from the}} gas. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> corrosion prevention in the cylinder but means that the diver inhales very dry gas. The dry gas extracts moisture from the diver's lungs while underwater contributing to dehydration, which is also {{thought to be a}} predisposing risk factor of decompression sickness. It is also uncomfortable, causing a dry mouth and throat and making the diver thirsty. This problem is reduced in rebreathers because the soda lime reaction, which removes carbon dioxide, also puts moisture back into the breathing gas. In hot climates, open circuit diving can accelerate heat exhaustion because of dehydration. Another concern with regard to moisture content is the tendency of moisture to condense as the gas is decompressed while passing through the regulator; this coupled with the extreme reduction in temperature, also due to the decompression can cause the moisture to solidify as ice. This icing up in a regulator can cause moving parts to seize and the regulator to fail or free flow.|$|E

2500|$|For {{several months}} prior to her death, {{she was unable to}} take an active part in convent life. She {{eventually}} died of her long-term illness at the age of 35 on 16 April 1879 (Easter Wednesday), while praying the holy rosary. On her deathbed, as she suffered from severe pain and in keeping with the Virgin Mary's admonition of [...] "Penance, Penance, Penance," [...] Bernadette proclaimed that [...] "all <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Heaven!" [...] Her final words were, [...] "Blessed Mary, Mother of God, pray for me! A poor sinner, a poor sinner". Bernadette's body was laid to rest in the Saint Gildard Convent.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{the strings}} were {{wrapped around the}} goose feet, {{but there has been}} a device that has been invented, which is a block of wood {{attached}} to the goose feet, with pins similar to those used to tune the guzheng protruding out at the sides, so one can string and tune the qin using a tuning wrench. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> those who lack the physical strength to pull and add tension to the strings when wrapping the ends to the goose feet. However, the tuning device looks rather unsightly and thus many qin players prefer the traditional manner of tuning; many also feel that the strings should be firmly wrapped to the goose feet in order that the sound may be [...] "grounded" [...] into the qin and some feel that the device which covers the phoenix pond sound hole has a negative effect on the sound volume and quality.|$|E
2500|$|... and Kenney's 1992 book {{refers to}} the VS line as [...] "minicomputers" [...] throughout. Although some argue that the {{high-end}} VSes and their successors should qualify as mainframes, Wang avoided this term. In his autobiography, An Wang, rather than calling the VS 300 a mainframe, said that it [...] "verges on mainframe performance". He went on to draw distinction between the [...] "mainframes" [...] {{at the high end}} of IBM's line ("just as Detroit would rather sell large cars ... so IBM would rather sell mainframes")—in which IBM had a virtual monopoly—with the [...] "mid-sized systems" [...] in which IBM had not achieved dominance: [...] "The minicomputer market is still healthy. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the customer and good for minicomputer makers." [...] Wang Laboratories positioned the VS line as minicomputers, and reflected this in its marketing collateral and press releases. Later models, the small VS5000 series, launched in approximately 1988, were user-installable, the smallest being physically similar in size to PCs of the era. The largest supported an increasingly substantial number of users.|$|E

Sánchez also struck out 177 batters in 163.1 innings for a 9.75 average per nine innings. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> fourth in the National League, behind only Tim Lincecum, Yovani Gallardo, and Javier Vázquez.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the duty}} on news {{was the most}} invidious “tax on knowledge”, the heavy duty on paper had a malign effect on {{newspaper}} economics. The Fourdrinier process produced paper on a continuous reel.

6000|$|No, my dear young friends, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> a man. It is {{necessary}} for a man, {{if he is to}} be a man and a child of God, and not a mere animal, to have to work hard whether he likes or not. It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth, as Jeremiah told the Jews, when, because they would not bear God's light yoke in their youth, but ran riot into luxury and wantonness, and superstition and idolatry which come thereof, they had to bear the heavy yoke of the Babylonish captivity in their old age. [...] It is good for a man to be checked, crossed, disappointed, made to feel his own ignorance, weakness, folly; made to feel his need of God; to feel that, in spite of all his cunning and self-confidence, he is no better off in this world than a lost child in a dark forest, unless he has a Father in Heaven, who loves him with an eternal love, and a Holy Spirit in Heaven, who will give him a right judgment in all things; who will put into his mind good desires, and enable him to bring those desires to good effect; and a Saviour in Heaven who can be touched with the feeling of his infirmities, because He too was made perfect by sufferings; He too was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it was all}} immensely interesting--the {{absolutely}} fresh, wholesome, sweet {{life that}} paid due reverence to the things of the next world, but took good care to get enough tennis in {{the cool of the}} evening; that concerned itself as honestly and thoroughly with the daily round, the trivial task (and that same task is anything but trivial when you are [...] "helped" [...] by an American [...] "help") as with the salvation of the soul. I had the honour of meeting in the flesh, even as Miss Louisa Alcott drew them, Meg and Joe and Beth and Amy, whom you ought to know. There was no affectation of concealment in their lives who had nothing to conceal. There were many [...] "little women" [...] in that place, because, even {{as is the case in}} England, the boys had gone out to seek their fortunes. Some were working in the thundering, clanging cities, others had removed to the infinite West, and others had disappeared in the languid, lazy South; and the maidens waited their return, which is the custom of maidens all over the world. Then the boys would come back in the soft sunlight, attired in careful raiment, their tongues cleansed of evil words and discourtesy. They had just come to call--bless their carefully groomed heads so they had,--and the maidens in white dresses glimmered like ghosts on the stoop and received them according to their merits. Mamma had nothing to do with this, nor papa either, for he was down-town trying to drive reason into the head of a land surveyor; and all along the shaded, lazy, intimate street you heard the garden-gates click and clash, as the mood of the man varied, and bursts of pleasant laughter where three or four--be sure the white muslins were among them,--discussed a picnic past or a buggy-drive to come. Then the couples went their ways and talked together till the young men had to go at last on account of the trains, and all trooped joyously down to the station and thought no harm of it. And, indeed, why should they? From her fifteenth year the American maiden moves among [...] "the boys" [...] as a sister among brothers. They are her servants to take her out riding,--which is driving,--to give her flowers and candy. The last two items are expensive, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the young man, as teaching him to value friendship that costs a little in cash and may necessitate economy on the cigar side. As to the maiden, she is taught to respect herself, that her fate is in her own hands, and that she is the more stringently bound by the very measure of the liberty so freely accorded to her. Wherefore, in her own language, [...] "she has a lovely time" [...] with about two or three hundred boys who have sisters of their own, and a very accurate perception that if they were unworthy of their trust a syndicate of other boys would probably pass them into a world where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage. And so time goes till the maiden knows the other side of the house,--knows that a man is not a demi-god nor a mysteriously veiled monster, but an average, egotistical, vain, gluttonous, but on the whole companionable, sort of person, to be soothed, fed, and managed--knowledge that does not come to her sister in England till after a few years of matrimony. And then she makes her choice. The Golden Light touches eyes that are full of comprehension; but the light is golden none the less, for she makes just the same sweet, irrational choices that an English girl does. With this advantage: she knows a little more, has experience in entertaining, insight into the businesses, employ, and hobbies of men, gathered from countless talks with the boys, and talks with the other girls who find time at those mysterious conclaves to discuss what Tom, Ted, Stuke, or Jack have been doing. Thus it happens that she is a companion, in the fullest sense of the word, of the man she weds, zealous for the interest of the firm, to be consulted in time of stress and to be called upon for help and sympathy in time of danger. Pleasant it is that one heart should beat for you; but it is better when the head above that heart has been thinking hard on your behalf, and when the lips, that are also very pleasant to kiss, give wise counsel.|$|E
