5|$|In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had {{recently}} been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed {{by the actions of}} the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he {{sent a letter to the}} colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Argyle {{lost the}} first leg of their semi-final tie 10 at Layer Road after a goal from Mark Kinsella, but <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> in the second leg at Home Park. Goals from Michael Evans, Chris Leadbitter and Paul Williams were enough to secure a 31 win and a 32 victory on aggregate. The results set up a first visit to Wembley Stadium for the {{supporters}} of both clubs.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E

5|$|Alexios, {{desperate for}} money, ordered the {{confiscation}} {{of all the}} church's treasure. With this money, Alexios mustered an army near Thessalonica and went to fight Bohemond. However, Bohemond defeated Alexios in two battles: one near Arta and the other near Ioannina. This left Bohemond in control of Macedonia and nearly all of Thessaly. Bohemond advanced with his army against the city of Larissa. Meanwhile, Alexios had mustered a new army and with 7,000 Seljuk Turks sent by the Sultan, he advanced on the Normans at Larissa and defeated them. The demoralised and unpaid Norman army returned to the coast and sailed back to Italy. Meanwhile, Alexios granted the Venetians a commercial colony in Constantinople, as well as exemption from trading duties {{in return for their}} renewed aid. <b>They</b> <b>responded</b> by recapturing Dyrrhachium and Corfu and returning them to the Byzantine Empire. These victories returned the Empire to its previous status quo and {{marked the beginning of the}} Komnenian restoration.|$|E
5|$|Following the American attack, Komori {{pulled his}} {{remaining}} {{force back to}} defend the airstrip. As {{this was not an}} Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. As a result of the supply shortages, many of the Japanese soldiers fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S.Navy PT boats and the force lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on 8February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to supply shortages. <b>They</b> <b>responded</b> by ordering Komori to hold his positions, though his force was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's {{attempts}} {{caused a}} significant stir {{among the many}} Quakers who had settled {{in the eastern part}} of the territory; <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> by forming an anti-slavery party. In the 1805 election, Davis Floyd of Clark County was the only anti-slavery representative elected to the council. Harrison's measures to legalize slavery were blocked by the representatives from St. Clair County, who refused to authorize slavery unless Harrison supported their request for a separate territory, which Harrison opposed. In 1809, the St. Clair County settlers petitioned Congress for the formation of a separate territory. Despite Harrison's disapproval, the Illinois Territory was created. The same year, Congress granted the Indiana Territory the right to elect a House of Representatives. Harrison found himself at odds with the legislature when the anti-slavery party came to power in that year's election. They promptly rebuffed many of his plans for slavery and repealed the indenturing laws he had enacted in 1803.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo's {{attorney}} (and future board member) Howard Lincoln was {{at first}} inclined to settle for $5–7 million. Eventually, however, he decided to fight, reassuring {{the head of the}} company's U.S. division, Minoru Arakawa, that this was a sign that Nintendo had made it big. On May 6, Arakawa and Lincoln met with Coleco and Universal in Los Angeles. Hadl reiterated his stance that Donkey Kong infringed Universal's rights to King Kong. Lincoln countered that Nintendo had discovered many unlicensed uses of King Kongs name and characters and that Universal's trademark on these was less than 10 years old. In private, Greenberg tried to persuade Nintendo to sign a licensing agreement; he had not told them that he had already done so. By the end of the meeting, Hadl agreed to send a chain of title to Nintendo regarding Universal's ownership of the King Kong name. When this failed to materialize in the next few weeks, Lincoln prodded Universal again. <b>They</b> <b>responded</b> with more demands for royalties.|$|E
5|$|In {{part because}} of {{pressure}} from Buddhist protests, Khánh removed the Catholics Phát and Đức from the posts of Interior Minister and IV Corps commander, respectively. <b>They</b> <b>responded</b> with a coup supported by the Catholic-aligned Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng, as well as General Trần Thiện Khiêm, a Catholic who had helped Khánh to power. Having captured the radio station, Phát then made a broadcast promising to revive Diệm's policies. Khánh managed to evade capture and, during {{the first stage of}} the coup, there was little activity as most senior officers failed to support either side. Throughout the day, Khánh gradually rallied more allies and the U.S. remained supportive of his rule and pressured the rebels to give up. With the backing of Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, commander of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, and General Nguyễn Chánh Thi, Khánh was able to force Phát and Đức to capitulate the next morning, September 14. Đức, Kỳ and Thi then appeared at a media conference where they denied that any coup had taken place and put on a choreographed display of unity, claiming that nobody would be prosecuted over the events.|$|E

25|$|As {{the real}} cause of dancing mania was unknown, {{many of the}} {{treatments}} for it were simply hopeful guesses, although some did seem effective. The 1374 outbreak occurred only decades after the Black Death, and was treated in a similar fashion: dancers were isolated, and some were exorcised. People believed that the dancing was a curse brought about by StVitus; <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> by praying and making pilgrimages to places dedicated to Vitus.|$|E

25|$|The looming crisis {{became a}} major {{political}} issue in the state's 1833 election campaign.

25|$|Two renowned {{philosophers}} {{who lived}} during this time, Ramanujacharya and Madhvacharya, influenced {{the culture of}} the region. The conversion of the Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana in the early 12th century from Jainism to Vaishnavism was to later prove a setback to Jain literature. In the decades to follow, Jain writers faced competition from the Veerashaivas, to which <b>they</b> <b>responded</b> with rebuttals, and from the 15th century, from the writers of the Vaishnava cadre. These events changed the literary landscape of the Kannada-speaking region forever.|$|E

40|$|Most {{individuals}} self-enhance in {{that they}} think they are superior to others. These self-superiority beliefs may manifest themselves in self-descriptions. The studies reported in this seminar examined how observers respond to other individuals’ self-superiority claims and why <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> the way <b>they</b> do. They showed that people dislike self-superiority claims whereas <b>they</b> <b>respond</b> positively to non-comparative positive self-descriptions, other-superiority claims and temporal intra-individual comparisons. Various potential explanations are addressed along with theoretical, practical and methodological implications for person perception, impression management, and interpersonal consequences of self-superiority beliefs. status: publishe...|$|R
