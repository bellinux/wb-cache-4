5000|$|Chrismukkah is a pop-culture {{portmanteau}} neologism {{referring to}} the merging of the holidays of Christianity's Christmas and Judaism's Hanukkah. The term was popularized beginning in December 2003 by the TV drama The O.C., wherein character Seth Cohen creates the holiday to signify his upbringing in an interfaith household with a Jewish father and Protestant mother (although the holiday can also be adopted by all-Jewish households who celebrate Christmas as a secular holiday). Chrismukkah is also celebrated as an ironic, alternative holiday, much like the Seinfeld-derived [...] "Festivus". USA Today has described it as [...] "the newest faux holiday that companies are using <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>buck</b> this season". In 2016, the sunset of December 24 to the sunset of December 25 will coincide with 25 Kislev, {{the first day of}} Hanukkah. Hence, Christmas and the beginning of Hanukkah will be celebrated on the same day, making this rare occasion a Chrismukkah. Such an occasion will not happen again until 2073.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1920s {{there were}} several balls in the Bastille area, mainly in the Rue de Lappe, where workers, drunken sailors, and colonial {{soldiers}} gathered to dance.

Count Basie adored Teddy, and Teddy was responsible for Basie's best stuff. … Teddy was a freelancer and a wheeler-dealer who suffered no fools and took no prisoners. He could be rude and crude. He smoked enough reefer to launch a rocket. Some considered him a liar and schemer and self-serving schmuck. I liked him. I liked the music he made. I liked the fact that he delivered. Were it not for guys like him, the world of recorded jazz would be considerably poorer." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yet analysts (and Wegner himself) {{have pointed}} out that, for the artist, color is often a path to other topics. His color-based “D65” series, begun in 2014, takes its title from “the {{standard}} scientific shorthand for the color of daylight, roughly 6500 degrees Kelvin” and is “inspired by sunlight in California,” according to Wegner. More than a decade earlier, Meltzer linked his use of color with market mechanisms. She wrote of the paint chip works that “there is always the problem of capital and its ideological effects. After all the paint chip is an advertising tool—a ploy <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>buck</b> on a dream. Wegner’s work makes these systems palpable, not through barefaced institutional critique, but by quietly elbowing some room into their rigid structures or—as {{he says in his}} book The Other Today Is the One You Want (2002)—by ‘opening up the space between the lines’ and ‘pushing back the horizon.’” ...|$|E
