3000|$|The sign of {{the second}} <b>term</b> <b>on</b> the RHS of the {{equation}} above is negative from our assumption of π_AH_ 0 > 0 [...].

In other words, in the absence of risk, the first <b>term</b> <b>on</b> the RHS will be zero but the second <b>term</b> <b>on</b> RHS will be positive. Thus, there will be a positive correlation between health and educational investment. When there is risk, the first <b>term</b> <b>on</b> the RHS will be positive and the correlation between education and health endowment will be exacerbated. This is proven below.|$|R
