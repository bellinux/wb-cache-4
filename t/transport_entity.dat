40|$|The {{mobility}} of helium bubbles in iron and niobium have been measured by two different techniques. The {{mobility of}} helium bubbles in iron was investigated by applying a temperature gradient driving {{force to the}} bubbles and measurements of the migration distance were made using optical microscopy and the bubble size was estimated using the scanning electron microscope. The mobility of bubbles in niobium was investigated by measuring {{the rate at which}} the average bubble size increased with time and temperature as a result of random migration and coalescence, the measurements being taken from transmission electron micrographs. The temperature gradient migration measurements for iron revealed that the bubbles travel up the temperature gradient, thus indicating a positive effective heat of transport. The rate of migration was compatible with a surface diffusion mechanism with a heat of transport approximately equal to the activation energy for surface self-diffusion. It is suggested that the surface <b>transport</b> <b>entity</b> is the adatom. The calculated migration rates for bubbles moving by volume diffusion or vapour transport mechanisms are considerably lower than those measured in this investigation. The migration and coalescence results for niobium gave a log (bubble radius) versus log (time) plot with a slope of 1 / 5 which indicates that the bubbles move by a surface diffusion mechanism. The high values obtained for the activation energy for surface self-diffusion and the pre-exponential constant suggest that the surface <b>transport</b> <b>entity</b> is also the adatom. It has been found that the distribution of bubble sizes does not follow the simple skew distribution that would be expected from random migration and coalescence and it is suggested that interaction of bubble stress fields may be responsible...|$|E

In the 7 DS (Seven Degrees of Separation) project, we have been investigating how to emulate two core Internet services, namely web access for information retrieval and email for delivering messages from mobile nodes to the Internet. We have implemented and evaluated a 7 DS prototype system that leverages search, feedback and propagation limits to build a scalable system that can deliver data to and from mobile nodes. 7 DS makes data exchange in disconnected networks possible by providing an application-level set of protocol services that will enable exchange of information between peer devices. It enables dynamic information exchange by using a proxy server, a multicast query system, a search engine, and a <b>transport</b> <b>entity.</b> With these entities, 7 DS can perform efficient and transparent data exchange among peers {{in the absence of}} a network connection.

40|$|There is a {{trend towards}} {{networked}} and distributed systems, complicating the design process of self-adaptive software. Logistics networks {{can be seen as}} a distributed system that have to adapt to requirements of companies and customers in a flexible and fast manner.

40|$|Currently {{transport}} layer interoperability techniques {{are based on}} protocol converters and transport service bridges. Protocol converters translate the Transport Protocol Data Units (TPDUs) between the two transport entities. In doing so they preserve the end-to-end meaning of the transport service. The major drawback is that a unique protocol converter needs to be designed for each transport architecture for which interoperability is desired. Transport service bridges provide interoperability by copying the Transport Service Data Units (TSDUs) of one architecture to another. They are simple to implement, and are an attractive migration strategy to using applications from other architectures. The disadvantage is loss of the end-to-end meaning of the transport service. Each end <b>transport</b> <b>entity</b> has a separate connection with the service bridge. As a result, critical transport mechanisms such as flow control, error control, and credit allocation have a per segment rather than an end-to-end significance;This dissertation describes an approach to provide interoperability between heterogeneous transports based on translating the TPDUs of individual transport protocols into a common intermediate format and transferring them between gateways using a connection less transport service (CLTS). The intermediate format is identified as that belonging to a Virtual Transport Layer (VTL), and the messages are accordingly called Virtual Transport Data Units (VTPDUs). Components in the gateways called Transport Convergence Functions (TCFs) translate to and from VTPDUs to the local TPDUs. The conversion rules for TCFs are specified such that {{the design of the}} TCF depends only {{on the nature of the}} local transport Architecture; No assumption is made about the nature of the peer (same or different) <b>transport</b> <b>entity.</b> Thus an end system sees its peer due to a compounding of the VTL and the actual end transport entity;The Virtual Transport Layer approach provides an open ended solution to the problem of interoperability at the {{transport layer}}. Interoperability can be offered to any transport architecture by designing a TCF component in a single gateway according to a set of predefined rules. Since there is no connection between the gateways and the end systems, the end-to-end significance of the transport service is preserved. An attempt has thus been made to overcome the limitations of both protocol converters and service bridges;Proof of concept is offered by demonstrating interoperability, using the VTL, between DoD TCP and ISO TP 4. TCFs for TCP gateways and TP 4 gateways are formally specified using the ESTELL FDT. A set of rules are specified to aid in the definition of TCFs from other transport architectures.

The minibus taxi industry in South Africa is currently carrying 65 % of the country's public transport passengers. It can therefore {{be described as the}} current perfect public transport solution for South African circumstances. Not taking away any positive influences that the recent initiatives like the Bus Rapid Transit, Gautrain, etc. will have on South Africa's public transport, it should be stressed that the minibus taxi industry will have a big role to play in the future of a sustainable system in South Africa. Their role will mainly be to provide feeder services to larger carriers of people. Without a sustainable public transport system it will not be possible to provide for the future transport needs {{of the people of the}} world. The minibus taxi industry evolved out of a necessity for moving masses of people in the lower income group. The entrepreneurs who started the minibus taxi industry are all individual businessmen who made the most of the opportunity at the time. It is essential that when approaching the minibus taxi industry with new ideas it must be kept in mind that you are dealing with small business owners and not a public <b>transport</b> <b>entity.</b> With these principles in mind the author is conducting research on the effect of the implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in the minibus taxi industry.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Wireless {{networks}} (including wireless mesh networks) {{provide opportunities}} for using multiple paths. Multihoming of hosts, possibly using different technologies and providers, also makes it attractive for end-to-end transport connections to exploit multiple paths. In this paper, we propose a multi-path transport protocol, based on a carefully crafted set of enhancements to TCP, that effectively utilizes the available bandwidth and diversity provided by heterogeneous, lossy wireless paths. Our Multi-Path LOss-Tolerant (MPLOT) transport protocol {{can be used to}} obtain significant goodput gains in wireless networks, subject to bursty, correlated losses with average loss-rates as high as 50 %. MPLOT is built around the principle of separability of reliability and congestion control functions in an end-to-end transport protocol. Congestion control is performed separately on individual paths and the reliability mechanism works over the aggregate set of paths available for an end-to-end session. MPLOT distinguishes between congestion and link losses through Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), and uses Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding to recover from data losses. MPLOT uses a dynamic packet mapping based on the current path characteristics to choose a path for a packet. Use of erasure codes and block level recovery ensures that in MPLOT, the receiving <b>transport</b> <b>entity</b> can recover all data as long as a necessary number of packets in the block are received, irrespective of which packets are lost. We present a theoretical analysis of the different design choices of MPLOT, and show that MPLOT chooses its policies and parameters such that a desirable tradeoff between goodput with data recovery delay is attained. We evaluate MPLOT, through simulations, under a variety of test scenarios and demonstrate that it effectively exploits path diversity in addition to efficiently aggregating path bandwidths, while remaining fair to a conventional TCP flow on each path.

Here the issues surrounding the policy and practice of airport and regional land use planning are explored, analysed and detailed. This research, for the first time, assembles a distinct progression of the wider social, economic, technological and environmental roles of the airport within the Australian airport literature from 1914 â€“ 2011. It recognises that while the list of airport and regional impacts has grown through time, treatment within practice and the literature has largely remained highly specialised and contained within disciplinary paradigms. The first publication of the thesis (Chapter 2) acknowledges that the changing role of airports demands the establishment of new models of airport planning and development. It argues that practice and research requires {{a better understanding of the}} reciprocal impacts of airports and their urban catchments. The second publication (Chapter 3) highlights that there is ad hoc examination and media attention of high profile airport and regional conflict, but little empirical analysis or understanding of the extent to which all privatised Australian airports are intending to develop. The conceptual and methodological significance of this research is the development of a national land use classification system for on-airport development. This paper establishes the extent of on-airport development in Australia, providing insight into the changing land use and economic roles of privatised airports. The third publication (Chapter 4) details new and significant interdependencies for airport and regional development in consideration of the progression of airports as activity centres. Here the model of an â€˜airport metropolisâ€™ is offered as an organising device and theoretical contribution for comprehending the complexity and planning of airport and regional development. It delivers a conceptual framework for both research and policy, which acknowledges the reciprocal impacts of economic development, land use, infrastructure and governance â€˜interfacesâ€™. In a timely and significant concurrence with this research the Australian Government announced and delivered a National Aviation Policy Review (2008 â€“ 2009). As such the fourth publication (Chapter 5) focuses on the airport and urban planning aspects of the review. This paper also highlights the overall policy intention of facilitating broader airport and regional collaborative processes. This communicative turn in airport policy is significant in light of the communicative theoretical framework of the thesis. The fifth paper of the thesis (Chapter 6) examines three Australian case studies (Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra) to detail the context of airport and regional land use planning and to apply the airport metropolis model as a framework for research. Through the use of Land Use Forums, over 120 airport and regional stakeholders are brought together to detail their perspectives and interactions with airport and regional land use planning. An inductive thematic analysis of the results identifies three significant themes which contribute to the fragmentation of airport and regional and land use planning: 1) inadequate coordination and disjointed decision-making; 2) current legislative and policy frameworks; and 3) competing stakeholder priorities and interests. Building on this new knowledge, Chapter 7 details the perceptions of airport and local, state and territory government stakeholders to land use relationships, processes and outcomes. A series of semi-structured interviews are undertaken in each of the case studies to inform this research. The potential implications for ongoing communicative practice are discussed in conclusion. The following thesis represents an incremental and cumulative research process which delivers new knowledge for the practical understanding and research interpretation of airport and regional land use planning practice and policy. It has developed and applied a robust conceptual framework which delivers significant direction for all stakeholders to better comprehend the relevance of airports in the urban character and design of our cities...|$|E

Despite the limitations, the present approach successfully describes the nearly T-linear dependence above T c, a broad peak around 70 K, and further deviation from T-linear dependence above 200 K of thermoelectric power in Rb 3 C 60.

Here we characterized ATP binding and hydrolysis properties of ABCB 10 by using the 8 -azido-ATP photolabeling technique. This technique can identify potential ABCB 10 regulators, transported substrates and amino-acidic residues required for ATP binding and hydrolysis. We confirmed that Gly 497 and Lys 498 in the Walker A motif, Glu 624 in the Walker B motif and Gly 602 in the C-Loop motif of ABCB 10 are required for proper ATP binding and hydrolysis activity, as their mutation changed ABCB 10 8 -Azido-ATP photo-labeling. In addition, we show that the potential ABCB 10 <b>transported</b> <b>entity</b> and heme precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid (dALA) does not alter 8 -azido-ATP photo-labeling. In contrast, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) stimulates ATP hydrolysis without affecting ATP binding, whereas reduced glutathione (GSH) inhibits ATP binding and hydrolysis. Indeed, we detectABCB 10 glutathionylation in Cys 547 and show that it is one of the exposed cysteine residues within ABCB 10 structure. In all, we characterize essential residues for ABCB 10 ATPase activity and we provide evidence that supports the exclusion of dALA as a potential substrate directly transported by ABCB 10. Last, we show the first molecular mechanism by which mitochondrial oxidative status, through GSH/GSSG, can regulate ABCB 10...|$|R
