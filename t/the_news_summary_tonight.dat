50|$|BBC Scotland {{started using}} their own {{continuity}} announcers for all evening and weekend afternoon junctions around 1977; before this period, announcers only covered opt-outs, {{which resulted in the}} London announcer being heard most of the time. From 1979, their duties were expanded to cover <b>the</b> lunchtime <b>news</b> bulletin at 12:40, just before the network Midday News at 12:45. There was one announcer who was never seen: Robert Logan, who was also a Conservative councillor. Consequently, he never read <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries,</b> nor did he ever give his name at closedown. From 1985, the announcing team started doing a <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> just before children's programmes at around 15:53, and within a few weeks, additional <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> at 21:25 were introduced. From 31 October 1988, newsroom staff started to read <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> instead of <b>the</b> announcers.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Prime Time programme, Midweek focused on more human interest stories rather than hard current affairs stories. It featured studio debate, reports, pre-recorded video links and interviews. The first series of Midweek was broadcast on Wednesday nights at 21:00. All subsequent series have been broadcast on Wednesday nights at 22:00 The programme {{is followed by a}} <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> and <b>Tonight</b> with Vincent Browne.|$|R

50|$|On October 2 {{the series}} moved to Thursdays, and on January 8 {{the show was}} reduced to 55 minutes for the network to present a five-minute <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> at 9:25 PM. Quiz moved to Mondays on February 2 and was now preceded by a civilian-defense program (later an American Red Cross program), which along with <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> {{required}} <b>the</b> show itself to decrease to 50 minutes. The Red Cross program ended on March 30, allowing Quiz to re-expand to 55 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{show would}} {{open with a}} 10-minute CBC News summary, usually read by Sheldon Turcott in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> studio, and then move to another studio — the same studio, in fact, that was used for The Journal — for the main segment of the program. Following the launch of CBC Newsworld in 1989, <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> became a {{simulcast}} of that network's hourly news update that was live for each time zone.|$|R

In order to save this problem, we propose a method which collects original news text from on-line information and extracts summary sentences from them automatically. On this basis, we adopt WML(Wireless Markup Language) to build a news website for mobile devices browsing through <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary.</b> <b>The</b> system is mainly made up by Automatic News Collection and Auto Text Summarization.

40|$|Wikipedia’s Current Events Portal (WCEP) is {{a special}} part of Wikipedia that focuses on daily <b>summaries</b> of <b>news</b> events. <b>The</b> WikiTimes project {{provides}} structured access to WCEP by extracting and in-dexing all its daily news events. In this paper we study this part of Wikipedia and {{take a closer look}} into its content and the community behind it. First, we provide descriptive analysis of <b>the</b> collected <b>news</b> events. Second, we compare between <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> created by <b>the</b> WCEP crowd and the ones created by professional journalists on the same topics. Finally, we analyze the revision logs of <b>news</b> events over <b>the</b> past 7 years in order to characterize the WCEP crowd and their activities. The results show that WCEP has reached a stable state in terms of the volume of contributions as well as the size of its crowd, which makes it an important source of <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> for <b>the</b> public and the research community...|$|R
30|$|News are {{specific}} programs {{that can be}} segmented in different news topics. We thank the authors of (Ide et al. 2004) for providing us data in which news topics are derived from textual information (captions) synchronized with <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> In <b>summary,</b> a topic boundary corresponds to a point between sentences where the keyword distribution is distinct between preceding and following windows of sentences.|$|R

30|$|The {{thematic}} {{elements are}} underlined and New information {{is presented in}} boldface in all the examples here. The Syria Times report focuses on ‘Syria’ and its ‘cooperation’ by placing them initially {{at the global level}} of discourse, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary.</b> At <b>the</b> local level, the placement of ‘cooperation’ {{at the beginning of the}} clause is intended to convince the readers that Syria’s good intentions and efforts are predicted, or known, information, even though there has been no mention of its cooperation in previous reports. New information, or the information focus, in the headline is conveyed by the Rheme, ‘appreciated’, which positively modifies the Theme, ‘Syria’s cooperation’. Right from the beginning, the readers of this report are encouraged to infer the innocence of Syria and interpret any references made by other news media to its involvement in Hariri’s murder as unfounded allegations. The interplay between the systems of THEME and INFORMATION, thematization and modification helps to project a positive representation of Syria in example 1.|$|R
5000|$|From its debut, The Daily Buzz {{employed}} a personality-driven on-air approach, {{one that was}} looser, faster in pace, and sometimes edgy in comparison to tradition-bound network breakfast television shows broadcast by ABC (Good Morning America), CBS (The Early Show), and NBC (Today): Slang terms, pop music, and host commentaries would be interjected in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summaries.</b> Pop culture segments were liberally employed (see below). The hosts' employed not-as-formal forms of dress and demeanor (dancing in lead-outs to commercial breaks were not uncommon). And above all, the liveliness trumped the serious. The lively tone was intentional, as {{it was meant to}} attract an audience that was younger in age and were more likely to get their news from sources other than traditional local and network TV newscasts. As Andrea Jackson described it to the Orlando Sentinel in 2005, [...] "We always talk about The Daily Buzz as morning radio on television or late-night television in the morning. It's infotainment." ...|$|R

30|$|However, this {{segmentation}} {{implies that}} topics are not consecutively segmented, and gaps may occur between two consecutive topic detections. So topic detections cover on average 72.6 % {{of the shows}} (σ= 0.10), because <b>the</b> beginning (head <b>news</b> <b>summary)</b> and end of <b>the</b> <b>news</b> (weather reports) are ignored by the topic segmentation (Fig. 1 (c)). In addition gaps between news segments average 5.1 s (σ= 2.4) and can stretch up to 20, 7 s (see Fig. 1 (d)), in which faces may still be detected.|$|R

5000|$|Educational {{content for}} the show was first {{provided}} by the child-oriented Weekly Reader publication which has since ceased publication. From its launch until the 2009-10 season, the series began each telecast with a <b>summary</b> of <b>the</b> week's <b>news</b> stories with footage supplied by Fox News via its Fox News Channel in the Classroom initiative; this was eliminated in the commercial broadcast but continues {{to be included in}} the educational production as a Current Events segment. The commercial program dropped the newscast in favor of airing special-interest stories on issues important to today's children, and features of children and teenagers helping out special causes, which was already featured following <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> prior to that point. The series is formatted similarly to a newsmagazine and features special-interest, sports and entertainment stories; before certain news segments and before most commercial breaks, the series features specialized short pieces about environmental issues and offbeat stories. Sports segments are also provided during the show also in the form of special-interest pieces, and NBC Sports produces a segment that airs in the months leading up to the Olympics called [...] "Olympic Insight" [...] that began in 2008 prior to the Summer Olympics, featuring interviews and footage of American athletes competing in the Olympics.|$|R
40|$|Uppsatsens syfte är att se vilka urval, lokala och {{regional}}a nyhetsprogram gör innehållsmässigt och geografiskt. De analysenheter vi valt är TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping och SVT Smålandsnytt. Vi jämförde även de två programmens inslag beträffande typ och längd. Vi studerade under tre veckors tid nyhetssammanfattningen 21. 55 från TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping och nyhetssammanfattningen 22. 15 från SVT SmålandsNytt. Anledningen till att vi valde nyhetssammanfattningar var för att vi vill se vad som kanalerna ansåg vara de viktigaste händelserna under dagen, det som var värt att sammanfatta. Den valda metoden är kvantitativ innehållsanalys. Valet gjordes för att vi ville undersöka statistiskt mätbara variabler, som tid, olika ämnen i inslagen och antal inslag per kommun. Detta är statistisk data och lämpar sig bäst då att räkna kvantitativt. Analysen har gjorts med hjälp av en kodbok och kodblanketter. Resultaten visade att i TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping fanns det en stark centralisering till sändningsorten, Jönköping. I SmålandsNytt däremot fanns inte lika stark koncentration till Växjö, som är SmålandNytts sändningsort, utan även här dominerade Jönköping. Detta anser vi beror på det uppmärksammade studentmordet som rapporterats mycket om i programmen. De inslagslängder som var vanligast i båda nyhetsprogrammen var 16 - 30 sekunder. Det ämne som uppmärksammandes mest var brott/olyckor. Våra resultat visade inte på några stora skillnader mellan nyhetsprogrammen. Our aim {{with the}} essay {{is to see}} how local and regional two news programmes are and which <b>news</b> they prioritize. <b>The</b> chosen programmes are TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping and SVT Smålandsnytt. We will look into the differences between those two, {{when it comes to}} the type of elements, but also the difference in how long the elements are (in terms of time). The material we chose where <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> 09. 55 pm from TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping and <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> 10. 15 pm from SVT SmålandsNytt, for three weeks. The reason why we chose <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> is because we want to see what the channels consider are the most important events during <b>the</b> day, witch <b>news</b> where worth summarize. The selected method is quantitative content analysis. We chose that because we wanted to examine statistically measurable variables, as time, different matters in the elements and numbers elements by the municipality. Since it is statistical fact it suits best to count quantitatively. The analysis has been done with the aid of a code book and code forms. The results showed that TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping had centralization to consignments place, Jönköping. But when it comes to SmålandsNytt, they did not have any centralization to the consignments place, instead Jönköping dominated here also. We consider that this can to do the with murder of a student that has been reported a lot about in the programmes. When it came to the time length of the elements that dominated in both of <b>the</b> <b>news</b> programmes where 16 - 30 seconds and the most common matters where criminal/accidents. According to Hadenius and Weibull are criminal/accidents one of the most primary readings at the newspaper readers. Our results did not show on some big differences in our two news programmes, SmålandsNytt and TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping...|$|R

5000|$|Originally BBC <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> were {{broadcast}} {{during the}} day and were launched as part of the BBC's new daytime TV service. The first broadcasts took place on 8 December 1986. Lasting for three minutes, the hourly or near-hourly bulletins formed the backbone of this service. Morning summaries were broadcast on BBC1 and early afternoon summaries were transmitted on BBC2. Each bulletin was followed by a weather forecast. <b>The</b> final afternoon <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> of <b>the</b> day was followed by a regional news bulletin. In October 1990, regional hourly news bulletins were introduced and were broadcast immediately after the BBC1 morning summaries. By the end of the 1990s the summaries were broadcast less frequently and they were phased out altogether during the 2000s.|$|R
50|$|Each edition {{begins with}} a short summary of {{national}} and international news headlines, sports and a national weather forecast - which unlike most morning news programs, does not cue to affiliates to run a local weather insert (some local stations will still override the national forecast with a local forecast from their own weather department). It then follows a story totem pole {{in the center of}} the CBS soundstage, with previews of featured stories set to air during the broadcast (the first four of which feature clips from the story packages with preview narration by the respective correspondent) being shown prior to <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>summary.</b> Each story covered in a given episode has a glass plate with its headline on this pole (digitally inserted on the pole as a prepared graphic since the late 2000s), which the camera follows after Pauley's introductions. Music in the show is usually limited to the opening and closing title theme. Pauley introduces each story with a short monologue, then sends the show out to the taped segment. The show usually ends with a preview of the guests and topics to air on that week's Face the Nation (which follows the program on most CBS stations), followed by a preview of next week's Sunday Morning broadcast. After the commercial break, there is a 60-second tranquil nature scene.|$|R

After her death was announced on November 14, 2016, that evening's edition of the NewsHour was turned into a tribute to Ifill and her influence on journalism, featuring tributes from Woodruff, Sreenivasan, former colleagues and program contributors (news content was relegated to <b>the</b> standard <b>news</b> <b>summary,</b> which aired during the second half-hour).
