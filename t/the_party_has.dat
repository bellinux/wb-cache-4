50|$|In August 2011, {{there were}} claims {{made by the}} Speaker of the Bihar Legislative Assembly that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> merged with JD(U) as 2 of the 3 MLAs of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> joined JD(U). However <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> denied any such move.|$|R

5|$|Congress of the People (COPE), {{is led by}} Mosiuoa Lekota, {{although}} the leadership is disputed by Mbhazima Shilowa who continues to battle for recognition in the High Court. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been riven by infighting, causing it to lose much of its support and resulting {{in the formation of}} a splinter group, the United Congress. COPE won three seats in the National Assembly in the 2014 elections.|$|E
5|$|Damage from {{enemies to}} the player's {{characters}} affect an endurance and health pool. While endurance regenerates after combat, health {{can only be}} restored by resting. The party can either set up camp, or rest in an inn. If a character in <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> their endurance drained, they are knocked out {{until the end of}} combat. If a companion has their health reduced to zero they die permanently.|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe is a minor, Eurosceptic {{political}} {{party in the}} United Kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been registered since June 2012 but remained inactive until it was officially launched in October 2013 by current party leader Mike Nattrass, a disaffected member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

5|$|My {{course has}} come to an end. I have fought your battles, and you have given me that loyalty that led us to victory more often than <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> ever had since the days of Sir John A. Macdonald.

5|$|Since then, under Strache's leadership, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> again {{attracted}} {{an increase}} in its popular support. In the 2013 legislative election the FPÖ won 20.5% of the vote and, more recently, it came ahead either of the SPÖ or the ÖVP in some state elections, entered in a SPÖ-led government in Burgenland and gained more than 30% {{of the vote in}} Vienna. Finally, in the 2016 presidential election, FPÖ member Norbert Hofer won the first round, receiving 35.1%, but was defeated by The Greens' candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, 53.8% against 46.2%, in the final run-off (an earlier run-off was invalidated).|$|E
5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> {{not been}} {{represented}} in the Valencian autonomous parliament since 1999.

5|$|The party reaches Cloudsgate Citadel {{and meets}} Dhuran(デュラン), {{who claims to}} have taken over the castle. He summons Terry to fight the party and then fights the party himself. Dhuran then reveals that all the enemies <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> faced were just pawns of Mortamor, the Archfiend. Milly reveals that Terry is her brother and Terry decides to join the party and fight against Mortamor.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of individual freedom in society was already {{one of the}} central points in the FPÖ (and VdU's) programme during the 1950s. The party did not regard its liberalism and its pan-German, nationalist positions as contradictory. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the party developed economically, supporting tax reduction, less state intervention and more privatisation. Starting in the late 2000s, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> taken a more populist tack, combining this position with support for the welfare state. It criticised unemployment and alleged welfare-state abuse by immigrants which, it said, threatened the welfare state and pensioners' benefits.|$|E
5|$|During Jean-Marie Le Pen's presidency, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> {{also been}} active in {{establishing}} extra-parliamentary confederations. During the FN's 1997 national congress, the FN established the loose Euronat group, which consisted {{of a variety of}} European right-wing parties. Having failed to cooperate in the European Parliament, Le Pen sought in the mid-1990s to initiate contacts with other far-right parties, including from non-EU countries. The FN drew most support in Central and Eastern Europe, and Le Pen visited the Turkish Welfare Party. The significant Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) refused to join the efforts, as Jörg Haider sought to distance himself from Le Pen, and later attempted to build a separate group. In 2009, the FN joined the Alliance of European National Movements; it left the alliance since. Along with some other European parties, the FN in 2010 visited Japan's Issuikai ("right-wing") movement and the Yasukuni Shrine.|$|E

5|$|The Centre Party {{has been}} the {{traditional}} party of rural voters, but according to polls, it had been losing support to the True Finns in its traditional stronghold regions. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> traditionally had both a liberal and a conservative wing, however, with the leadership reshuffling in 2010, the central posts are now held by the liberal wing. The Centre Party has held the portfolio {{of the prime minister}} since 2003. According to opinion polls, Kiviniemi's personal support was higher than that of the party. She had also been campaigning as a staunch defender of Finland's participation in guarantees to the crisis-ridden EU countries.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> {{access to}} mecha, {{which can be}} {{equipped}} by surrendering a turn. Mecha have their own set of moves and boast more powerful attacks than the main party, but also carry over damage between battles. Following the victory, the party is awarded with in-game currency {{which can be used}} to purchase items and accessories at shops. The party is also awarded experience points which raise a character's experience level, along with a variety of skill points. These are divided into EP to fuel Ether abilities, along with Skill Points (SP) and Tech Points (TP). SP are assigned to activate passive effects drawn from different accessories, while Tech Points raise the effectiveness and power of Tech attacks unlocked as the character's experience level rises.|$|E
5|$|Things {{escalate}} {{quickly and}} the police arrive, responding to a noise complaint. The partygoers remain silent, convincing the officers that <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> already ended. The police leave and the party resumes. T-Rick's gnome is smashed, revealing that it contains {{a large amount of}} ecstasy tablets, which are quickly consumed by the partygoers. Thomas kisses Kirby and reveals that he loves her. Alexis meanwhile flirts with Thomas throughout the night and eventually seduces him. Kirby walks in on the pair as they are about to have sex and leaves the party upset. The noise and chaos of the party, which has now spilled into the surrounding neighborhood, receives televised news coverage with helicopters flying over the house. A dwarf guest drives Thomas' dad's Mercedes into the pool after being put into an oven by other partygoers.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Strache, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> cooperated mainly with the Northern League, Vlaams Belang (successor to the Vlaams Blok, which it has traditionally maintained good ties with), and the Pro Germany Citizens' Movement in Germany. The FPÖ also has contacts with the Danish People's Party, the Slovak National Party, the Sweden Democrats, the Lithuanian Order and Justice, IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany and the German Freedom party. In 2007, the party's then-only MEP {{was a member of}} the short-lived Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty grouping in the European Parliament. Outside the EU, it has contacts with Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Progressive Party (formerly of the Serbian Radical Party), the Swiss People's Party, the Israeli Likud, the U.S. Republican Party and the United Russia party.|$|E
5|$|Whether a {{timeframe}} {{should be}} imposed for the calling of by-elections has {{been subject to}} much debate. Several arguments have been advanced by the Government. First, when a voter casts a vote for a candidate, he is also voting for the political party that the candidate is a member of. Thus, once <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> received the voter's mandate, a vacant seat will not affect this mandate. Requiring the other members in a GRC to vacate their seats so that a by-election can be called {{would be unfair to}} them. Secondly, the Government believes that a GRC can function if it is lacking a member, as MPs from other constituencies can help {{to address the needs of}} residents in that GRC.|$|E
5|$|While the FPÖ is {{currently}} {{not a member}} of any European or international organisations, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>has</b> ties with several European political parties and groupings. From 1978 to 1993, under the party's liberal leadership, the party {{was a member of the}} Liberal International. In the early years of Haider's leadership, meetings were held with figures such as Jean-Marie Le Pen of the French National Front and Franz Schönhuber of the German Republicans. In the late 1990s he however chose to distance himself from Le Pen, and refused to join Le Pen's EuroNat project. Following the FPÖ's entrance in government in 2000, Haider sought to establish his own alliance of right-wing parties. For his project, Haider tried to establish stable cooperations with the Vlaams Blok party in Belgium and the Northern League party in Italy, as well as some other parties and party groupings. In the end, the efforts to establish a new alliance of parties were not successful.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> a full {{state of}} 107 candidates.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> {{observer}} {{status in the}} Socialist International.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> {{eventually}} {{went into}} a steady decline. Only in Oppland did <b>the</b> <b>party</b> retain some influence. In the 1918 election, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> was reduced to one representative. At the election in 1936, it fell out of parliament altogether. After the Second World War <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>had</b> effectively merged into <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Party,</b> although formally <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>had</b> joint lists in Oppland until 1957. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> was formally dissolved in 1965.|$|R
