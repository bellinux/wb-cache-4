5|$|In the 21st century, <b>these</b> <b>trends</b> have continued, {{and several}} new {{approaches}} {{have come into}} prominence, including multielectrode recording, which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded {{all at the same}} time; genetic engineering, which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally; genomics, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.|$|E
5|$|Atomic radii vary in a {{predictable}} and explainable manner across the periodic table.

The radius increases sharply between the noble gas {{at the end of}} each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. <b>These</b> <b>trends</b> of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.|$|E
40|$|We are {{currently}} witnessing an information explosion with aid of many micro-blogging toolkits like the Twitter. Although Twitter provides {{a list of}} most popular topics people tweet about known as Trending Topics in real time, it is often hard to understand what <b>these</b> <b>trending</b> topics are about where most of <b>these</b> <b>trending</b> topics are {{far away from the}} personal preferences of the twitter user. In this article, we pay attention to the issue of personalizing the search for trending topics via enabling the twitter user to provide RSS feeds that include the personal preferences along with a twitter client that can filter personalized tweets and trending topics according to a sound algorithm for capturing the trending information. The algorithms used are the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) along with the Levenshtein Distance. Our experimentations show that the developed prototype for personalized trending topics (T 3 C) finds more interesting trending topics that match the Twitter user list of preferences than traditional techniques without RSS personalization...|$|R

5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends {{will put}} pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of <b>these</b> <b>trends,</b> the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to <b>these</b> <b>trends,</b> however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of <b>these</b> <b>trends</b> have been observed in evolution.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} formal {{employment trends}} in the South African economy since 1970, through using both survey and time-series data. In addition, the study tries to understand the forces that have shaped <b>these</b> employment <b>trends.</b> The descriptive statistics reveal that the primary sectors have shed close to 1. 5 million jobs in the period 1970 - 95. The marginal net employment growth that occurred was to be found primarily in the service sectors. Noticeably, net employment creation in manufacturing was 400 000 jobs over this period. <b>These</b> sectoral <b>trends</b> are matched by occupational trends, which show a significant rise in the demand for highly skilled workers {{at the expense of}} unskilled workers. The racial dimension to this is that non-African workers have gained from <b>these</b> labour demand <b>trends,</b> while African workers have lost out significantly. Utilising an established methodology, the second component of the paper is to try and assess what factors have caused <b>these</b> employment <b>trends</b> which have disproportionately favoured skilled workers.

5|$|After Stephen's death, Henry II succeeded to {{the throne}} of England. Henry vigorously re-established royal {{authority}} {{in the aftermath of}} the civil war, dismantling castles and increasing revenues, although several of <b>these</b> <b>trends</b> had begun under Stephen. The destruction of castles under Henry was not as dramatic as once thought, and although he restored royal revenues, the economy of England remained broadly unchanged under both rulers. Stephen's remaining son William I of Blois was confirmed as the Earl of Surrey by Henry, and prospered under the new regime, with the occasional point of tension with Henry. Stephen's daughter Marie I of Boulogne also survived her father; she had been placed in a convent by Stephen, but after his death she left and married. Stephen's middle son, Baldwin, and second daughter, Matilda, had died before 1147 and were buried at Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate. Stephen probably had three illegitimate sons, Gervase, Ralph and Americ, by his mistress Damette; Gervase became Abbot of Westminster in 1138, but after his father's death Gervase was removed by Henry in 1157 and died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act {{facilitated}} {{a political}} realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate Southern politics. After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began {{to vote for}} liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse. These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically polarize, with the Democratic Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative. The trends also created competition between the two parties, which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, <b>these</b> <b>trends</b> culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.|$|E

5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray is not aggressive, but its sting is {{sheathed in}} toxic mucus and {{is capable of}} piercing bone. Across its range, this species is caught incidentally by artisanal fishers using longlines, {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnets and fish traps. It is reputedly difficult and time-consuming to catch; a hooked ray may bury itself under large quantities of mud, becoming almost impossible to lift, or drag boats over substantial distances or underwater. The meat and the cartilage are used; large specimens are cut into kilogram pieces for sale. Adults that are not used for food are often killed or maimed by fishers nonetheless. In the Mae Klong and Bang Pakong Rivers, the giant freshwater stingray is also increasingly targeted by sport fishers and for display in public aquariums. <b>These</b> <b>trends</b> pose conservation concerns; the former because catch and release is not universally practised and the post-release survival rate is unknown, the latter because this species does not survive well in captivity.|$|E
