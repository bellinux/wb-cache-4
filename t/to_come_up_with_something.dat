25|$|Skillet {{formed in}} 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee {{progressive}} rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor {{encouraged them to}} form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains {{that it was a}} joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.|$|E

From the 1920s, the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood movies, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee.

Additionally, the chorus line [...] "You spin my head right round, right round / When you go down, when you go down, down" [...] {{can be interpreted as}} a reference to fellatio. Bruno Mars, co-writer of the song confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that the song's chorus was referring to oral sex. Philip Lawrence, also co-writer, confessed the song was [...] "almost something we had accidentally written in the car one night just hanging out." [...] It was him, Bruno Mars, and Aaron Bay-Schuck.

[...] He also said that the group's goal was for the show to not be too choreographed. Williams said the goal is to establish a physical proximity: [...] "The band is just sitting in the palm of the audience's hand." [...] At the conclusion of the tour, the intent was to leave the three structures {{in different parts of the}} globe and turn them into permanent concert venues.
