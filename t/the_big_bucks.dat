60|$|That was {{far back}} on the ridges, where most of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>bucks</b> loaf and hide, each one by himself, during the summer. Down at the lake, however, there were two or three that for some reason {{occasionally}} showed themselves with the other deer, but were so shy and wild that hunting them without a gun was almost impossible. It {{was one of these}} big fellows that now stood half hid in the underbrush within twenty yards of me, watching the deer's game impatiently.|$|E

60|$|In {{the midst}} of the play, and after I had watched it for a full half-hour, there was a swift rustle in the woods on my right, and I caught my breath sharply at sight of a {{magnificent}} buck standing half hid in the underbrush. There were two or three big bucks with splendid antlers that lived lazily on the slopes above this part of the lake, and that I had been watching and following for several weeks. Unlike the does and fawns and young bucks, they were wild as hawks and selfish as cats. They rarely showed themselves in the open, and if surprised there with other deer they bounded away at the first sight or sniff of danger. Does and little fawns, when they saw you, would instantly stamp and whistle to warn the other deer before they had taken the first step to save themselves or investigate the danger; but <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>bucks</b> would bound or glide away, according to the method of your approach, and in saving their own skins, as they thought, would have absolutely no concern {{for the safety of the}} herd feeding near by.--And that is one reason why, in a natural state, deer rarely allow the bucks and bulls to lead them.|$|E

60|$|October, {{the superb}} month for one who loves the forest, found me {{again in the}} same woods, this time not to watch and, learn, but to follow <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>buck</b> to his death. Old Wally was ahead of me; but the falling leaves had done their work well. The deer had left the pond at his approach. Here and there on the ridges I found their tracks, and saw them at a distance, shy, wild, alert, ready {{to take care of}} {{themselves}} in any emergency. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>buck</b> led them everywhere.

The Little Bucks Strategy-The well-made modestly budgeted movie can turn a quick profit in tough times.
