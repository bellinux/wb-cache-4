5|$|The {{most heavily}} trafficked station is Jernbanetorget, which is {{adjacent}} to Oslo Central Station, closely followed by Majorstuen, the main transfer station between lines west of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> and to several {{lines of the}} Oslo Tramway, and Nationaltheatret, {{which is in the}} heart of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> and provides direct transfer to trains on the Drammen Line. All three stations are in the Common Tunnel. The least-used station is Lillevann, which serves the recreational area of Nordmarka.

5|$|The third planned {{expansion}} {{runs from}} <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> southwards, {{east of the}} Center–Nesttun Line, serving Haukeland University Hospital. It then heads west, intersecting with the first line at Kronstad, runs through a tunnel before serving the areas of Fyllingsdalen. The line can use parts of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's right of way from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> to Kronstad, and would feature a station under the hospital, which is Western Norway's largest work place. It is not planned an extension to Loddefjord and Storavatnet from Fyllingsdalen at this time because the time of travel will be {{much higher than the}} direct bus line using the highway to <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered {{too far away from}} <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E

5|$|From June 1967, Line 9, {{that ran}} along the Lilleaker Line via the Skøyen Line to <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> and onwards along the Østensjø Line, was {{truncated}} to Jernbanetorget, as the Østensjø was converted to a metro line. Calculations showed that if the Lilleaker Line or the Skøyen Line and the Ekeberg Line were connected, between them one tram less would be needed, and the Ekeberg Line would have a service through <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center.</b> After trial runs, the new service to Skøyen was taken into use on 4 May 1969.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of the neighborhoods varies significantly {{from one to another}} and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods away from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are {{the focal point of the}} neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen to <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements {{between the city}} and the company, in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> to connect to the suburban tramways east of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center.</b> Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, plans {{had existed}} for an {{extensive}} rapid transit system, with an underground section in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center.</b> Inspired by the successful Oslo Metro that had opened in 1966, similar plans were developed. The proposed network {{was close to}} the current long-term plans for the light rail system, and consisted of three branches from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> to Flaktveit, Olsvik and the airport. Four-car trains would operate at ten-minute headways. The suggestion was discussed by the city council in 1973, but no decision was taken. As an alternative, expansion of the railway from Bergen to Eidsvåg, Åsane and Nesttun was proposed. Fast commuter trains could then be supplemented with buses.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the {{municipal}} bus company Bergen Sporvei made {{a proposal to}} establish {{what they called the}} Lightning Tram, from Varden in Fyllingsdalen via a tunnel to Møhlenpris and <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> then make a 120° turn and return along the route of the Bergen trolleybus to Birkelundstoppen. The same year, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature proposed a more extensive system, the Environmental Tram, which more closely resembles the current proposals. From <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> it would run northwards via Åsane to Flaktveit and southwards via Rådal to the airport (not via Nesttun). The southern section would have branches from Hop to Nesttun and Midttun, and from Minde westwards to Fyllingsdalen and Loddefjord. Later, Bergen Sporvei's successor, Gaia Trafikk, proposed building a bus rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 215 (I-215), {{also known}} locally as the belt route or two-fifteen, is an {{auxiliary}} interstate in the U.S. state of Utah that forms a 270-degree loop around Salt Lake City {{and many of its}} suburbs. The route begins at the mouth of Parley's Canyon at a junction with I-80 east of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> and heads south through the edge of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area's eastern suburbs of Millcreek, Holladay, and Cottonwood Heights. It continues west through Murray before turning north again, passing through the city's first-ring western suburbs of Taylorsville and West Valley City. It then enters North Salt Lake and Davis County for a short distance before reaching I-15 northwest of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ruter bus 31 is a {{high-frequency}} service {{which runs}} from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> of Oslo via Lysaker Station to Fornebu. During regular schedule it stops {{just outside the}} stadium; however, on matchdays it stops further away because of traffic. Lysaker Station is served by both the Oslo Commuter Rail and selected intercity and regional trains. Dedicated football buses are operated by Ruter to Stabæk home games. There are 1,500 parking spaces immediately near the venue, although additional parking is available at IT Fornebu and at Lysaker, which are a seven- and fifteen-minute walk away, respectively. The Fornebu Line is under planning, and would be built either as a light rail or a rapid transit, which would allow rail transport from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> of Oslo and Lysaker to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{city itself}} is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, {{the city is}} said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but {{typically}} include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center,</b> with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result {{of two of the}} many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center.</b> The topography of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) {{at the mouth of the}} city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the line, {{originally}} a light rail, was from Majorstuen to Smestad, and opened in 1912. It was built as a cooperation between the Municipality of Aker and the company Holmenkolbanen, and connected to the Holmenkoll Line's terminus. In 1928, the line received a connection to <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center</b> when the {{first part of}} the Common Tunnel was completed. In 1935, the first extension of the Røa Line proper was made, when the line was extended to Røa. In 1942, the Kolsås Line became a branch. Additional extensions to the Røa Line were made in 1948 to Grini, in 1951 to Lijordet and in 1972 to Østerås. By then, the line had become an integrated part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier. The line was upgraded to rapid transit in 1995, became part of the metro and started running through <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
