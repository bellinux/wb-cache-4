40|$|As an {{important}} information for traffic condition evaluation, trip planning, transportation management, etc., average <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> for a road means the average <b>speed</b> of vehicles <b>travelling</b> through this {{road in a}} given time duration. Traditional ways for collecting travel-speed oriented traffic data always depend on dedicated sensors and supporting infrastructures, and are therefore financial costly. Differently, vehicular crowdsensing as an infrastructure-free way, {{can be used to}} collect data including real-time locations and velocities of vehicles for road <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> estimation, which is a quite low-cost way. However, vehicular crowdsensing data is always coarse-grained. This coarseness can lead to the incompleteness of <b>travel</b> <b>speeds.</b> Aiming to handle this problem as well as estimate <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> accurately, in this paper, we propose an approach named STC that exploits the spatial-temporal correlation among <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> for roads by introducing the time-lagged cross correlation function. The time lagging factor describes the time consumption of traffic feature diffusion along roads. To properly calculate cross correlation, we novelly make the determination of the time lagging factor self-adaptive by recording the locations of vehicles at different roads. Then, utilizing the local stationarity of cross correlation, we further reduce the problem of single-road <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> vacancy completion to a minimization problem. Finally, we fill all the vacancies of <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> for roads in a recursive way using the geometric structure of road net. Elaborate experiments based on real taxi trace data show that STC can settle the incompleteness problem of vehicle crowdsensing data based <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> estimation and ensure the accuracy of estimated <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> better, in comparison with representative existing methods such as KNN, Kriging and ARIMA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop techniques for <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> estimation of main roads using GPS and Mobile (mobile phone) data collected from probe vehicles. To this end, a methodology for <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> estimation need to be developed first and the reliability of the estimated <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> in terms of accuracy need to be evaluated. The coordinate of a mobile location means the location of the base station and not that of the actual probe vehicle. Therefore, erroneous coordinates of the mobile location may result in inaccuracies in the estimation of <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> based on LBS. The factors determining the reliability of <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> using LBS are the number of base station, the distance between nearby base stations, the coverage of base station, and the data collection time interval. To estimate a stable <b>travel</b> <b>speed,</b> the base station network should be dense, that is, the base stations should be close together and its coverage should be dense.

40|$|AbstractIn urban areas, {{logistic}} transportation operations often {{run into}} problems because <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> change, {{depending on the}} current traffic situation. If not accounted for, time-dependent and stochastic <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> frequently lead to missed time windows and thus poorer service.

Therefore, time-dependent and stochastic influences on <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> are relevant for finding feasible and reliable solutions. This study considers the effect of exploiting statistical information available about historical accidents, using stochastic solution approaches for the dynamic dial-a-ride problem (dynamic DARP). The authors propose two pairs of metaheuristic solution approaches, each consisting of a deterministic method (average time-dependent <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> for planning) and its corresponding stochastic version (exploiting stochastic information while planning). The results, using test instances with up to 762 requests based on a real-world road network, show that in certain conditions, exploiting stochastic information about <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> leads to significant improvements over deterministic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Among {{the main}} factors {{affecting}} road crash injuries, speed is {{considered as a}} leading cause and contributing factor. There are numerous studies linking <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> and road crashes. Hence, {{an essential part of}} road safety plans and interventions is devoted to speed management. However, to manage <b>speed,</b> actual <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> have to be systematically and consistently monitored and analyzed. In this study, a system for the collection and analysis of free-flow <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> on the road network is presented, enabling speed monitoring at the nationwide level. The paper focuses on the collection and analysis of <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> on different road sections. Using the information gathered through advanced technologies combined with geographical information systems, a comprehensive speed database in space and time is provided allowing visual presentation and comparison of the results.

50|$|A {{particular}} {{issue is that}} most ISA systems use a speed database based purely on information regarding the posted maximum speed limit for a roadway or roadway segment. Obviously, many roads have features such as curves and gradients where the appropriate speed for a road segment with these features {{is less than the}} posted maximum speed limit. Increasingly, road authorities indicate the appropriate speed for such segments through the use of advisory speed signage to alert drivers on approach that there are features which require a reduction in <b>travelling</b> <b>speed.</b> It is recognised that the speed limit databases used in ISA systems should ideally take account of posted advisory speeds as well as posted maximum speed limits. The New South Wales ISA trial, underway in the Illwarra region south of Sydney currently, is the only trial that is using posted advisory speeds as well as posted maximum speed limits.|$|E
