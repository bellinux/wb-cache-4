5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{recreational}} riding experienced a revival, and {{the consumption of}} horse meat continued to decrease. On March 11, 1994, the Trait du Nord was officially declared to be a workhorse again, and in 1996 another decree prohibited docking of tails in horses. Members of the breed are occasionally exported from France, with some going to Italy, Belgium and Germany, mainly for work in logging and pulling brewery wagons. A few are sent to Sicily and Guadeloupe, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> rare.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
5|$|The {{letter to}} Æthelburg {{makes it clear}} that she was already married at the time the news of Eadbald's {{conversion}} reached Rome. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald's acceptance of Christianity, and it has been suggested in Bede's defence that Æthelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome, and that the letter was written while she was in Kent. However, it would appear from Boniface's letter that Boniface thought of Æthelburg as being at her husband's side. It also appears that the letter to Justus was written after the letters to Edwin and Æthelburg, rather than before, as Bede has it; Boniface's letter to Edwin and Æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers, but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a {{new point}} of view to Clara. 'It is his own fault,' she said.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{sufficient}} answer, for any {{interference with}} parochial visiting in the Bellevue district was forbidden.|$|R
60|$|The butler stared. As {{a form of}} condescension {{among the}} upper classes <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> new to him.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{common in}} Spanish, where {{the use of}} {{bracketing}} question marks explicitly indicates the scope of interrogation.|$|E
25|$|In some patients, the kneecap is unrevertable post-surgery and dislocates to {{the outer}} side of the knee. This is painful and usually needs to be treated by surgery to realign the kneecap. However <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> rare.|$|E
25|$|James Bee, a New Zealander, {{continued}} {{the growth and}} expansion of the college. When he retired in 1934 there were 450 enrolled students. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> remarkable considering that the 1930s Great Depression was not yet over.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a god-send for Barry, who {{was only}} anxious to be off; but Anty begged for a respite.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> to {{the taste}} of the wretched little creatures, who fell back in a semi-circle and waited for more.|$|R
50|$|A second {{connection}} {{was built to}} the west of the first one, and was opened on 17 December 1899. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> steep.|$|R
25|$|Without teeth {{the ridge}} tends to resorb and {{provides}} the denture less and less stability over time. It is routine {{to be able to}} bite into an apple or corn-on-the-cob with a lower denture anchored by implants. Without implants, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> difficult or even impossible.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{comes through}} {{municipal}} recycling of wastewater into crop fields. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> common in emerging industrial economies and poses serious risks for local crop sales and exports of contaminated vegetables. A 1986 outbreak of ascariasis in Italy was traced to irresponsible wastewater recycling used to grow Balkan vegetable exports.|$|E
25|$|Insufficient vitamin B12 {{can lead}} to {{excessive}} dryness, darkened nails, and rounded or curved nail ends. Insufficient intake of both vitamin A and B results in fragile nails with horizontal and vertical ridges. Some over-the-counter vitamin supplements such as certain multivitamins and biotin may help in growth of strong nails, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> subjective.|$|E

25|$|The stone circle {{consists}} of thirteen stones {{and has a}} diameter of 11.4 metres. The stone circle is not a perfect circle, but is a ring with a flattened east side (13.4 metres north-south by 12 metres east-west). The stones have an average height of three metres. The ring covers an area of 124 square metres. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> small compared to similar circles, including the nearby Callanish II which is 2.5 times as large.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of time the vicar {{acquired}} not only the position and authority of a vicar-general, but also that of a real ordinary, including all the authority of the latter office. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> evident from his acquired right of subdelegation whereby he was allowed to name a vicegerent, his representative not alone in pontifical ceremonies (as many maintain), but also in jurisdiction. For the rest, being already delegatus a principe he can canonically subdelegate.|$|E
25|$|DTTV is {{received}} either via a digital set-top box (STB), TV gateway or integrated tuner included with television sets, that decodes the signal received via a standard television antenna. Some set-top-boxes and TV gateways include {{digital video recorder}} (DVR) functionality. However, due to frequency planning issues, an aerial capable of receiving a different channel group (usually a wideband) may be required if the DTTV multiplexes lie outside the reception capabilities of the originally installed aerial. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> common in the UK; see external links.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 Latasi was {{appointed}} acting Governor-General between {{the terms of}} Sir Filoimea Telito and Sir Iakoba Italeli. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> remarkable considering Latasi's republican tendencies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ildhus or fire-house was the kitchen, {{often used}} besides as a sleeping-room when the farms <b>were</b> very small. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{abolished}} after the year 1000." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{series has}} not been rerun and is most likely wiped due to network {{policies}} at the time. For NBC in particular, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> common through 1980.|$|R
25|$|The Whitehead {{group of}} a free abelian group is trivial, a 1964 result of Bass, Heller and Swan. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> hard to prove, but is {{important}} as it {{is used in the}} proof that an s-cobordism of dimension at least 6 whose ends are tori is a product. It is also the key algebraic result used in the surgery theory classification of piecewise linear manifolds of dimension at least 5 which are homotopy equivalent to a torus; this is the essential ingredient of the 1969 Kirby–Siebenmann structure theory of topological manifolds of dimension at least 5.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} natural {{geologic}} barriers to isolate radioactive waste {{is demonstrated by}} the natural nuclear fission reactors at Oklo, Africa. During their long reaction period about 5.4 tonnes of fission products as well as 1.5 tonnes of plutonium together with other transuranic elements were generated in the uranium ore body. This plutonium and the other transuranics remained immobile until the present day, a span of almost 2 billion years. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> remarkable {{in view of the}} fact that ground water had ready access to the deposits and they were not in a chemically inert form, such as glass.|$|E
25|$|In {{his message}} to the {{faithful}} of the Diocese for that occasion, Patriarch Alexei of Moscow and All Russia stressed that the Cathedral {{is home to a}} 'multitudinous and multilingual flock', and that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> proper for the Church, being 'a single body made up of many and dissimilar members, filled with one Spirit'. Alexei exhorted the members of the Diocese to 'bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ' (Gal. 6:2). He hoped that the celebrations would contribute to the 'healing' of the 'wounds' inflicted upon the Diocese in recent times.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, “escape jumps” propel the ant {{vertically}} and are {{proved to be}} intentional because of the behaviors that precede the jump. Patek et al. observed that before an “escape jump,” the ant will orient its antennae and head perpendicularly to the intruder. Additionally it will sway its entire body and then lift one leg vertically. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> an elaborate routine to prepare to propel itself 7cm off of the ground. The reason behind this maneuver {{is to be able}} to grab onto vegetation usually located around their nests in order to provide a form of escape.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} value of tea {{in many parts of}} Asia, tea bricks were used as a form of {{currency}} throughout China, Tibet, Mongolia, and Central Asia. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> similar to the use of salt bricks as currency in parts of Africa. Tea bricks were in fact the preferred form of currency over metallic coins for the nomads of Mongolia and Siberia. The tea could not only be used as money and eaten as food in times of hunger but also brewed as allegedly beneficial medicine for treating coughs and colds. Until World War II, tea bricks were still used as a form of edible currency in Siberia.|$|E
25|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{became the}} first film to exhibit Leone's famously {{distinctive}} style of visual direction. This was influenced by both John Ford's cinematic landscaping and the Japanese method of direction perfected by Akira Kurosawa. Leone wanted an operatic feel to his western, {{and so there are}} many examples of extreme close-ups on the faces of different characters, functioning like arias in a traditional opera. The rhythm, emotion, and communication within scenes can be attributed to Leone’s meticulous framing of his close-ups. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> different from Hollywood's use of close-ups that used them as reaction shots, usually to a line of dialogue that had just been spoken. Leone's close-ups are more akin to portraits, often lit with Renaissance-type lighting effects, and are considered by some as pieces of design in their own right.|$|E
6000|$|She {{raised her}} {{delicate}} eyebrows till {{they looked like}} notes of interrogation, and blushed a little. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a new style for Sir Eustace. Was he in earnest? she wondered. Impossible! ...|$|R
60|$|So far, no doubt, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> in Mrs. Finch's character. I {{could see}} that--but {{my mind was}} too much pre-occupied to draw the {{inference}} that followed. Oscar's next words enlightened me.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a {{new idea}} to Mrs. Dashwood; {{she had never been}} used to find wit in the {{inattention}} of any one, and could not help looking with surprise at them both.|$|R
