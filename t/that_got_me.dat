Anand revealed that this changed his viewpoint, saying: [...] "It was a scene <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> completely excited and we started writing immediately.

500|$|Rumors had {{surfaced}} {{during the}} 1996 season that manager Terry Collins {{did not get}} along well with Bagwell and Biggio, largely contributing to his dismissal. [...] The Astros hired team color commentator Larry Dierker after the season to replace him.

[...] The Astros won division titles in four of five seasons with Dierker as manager; however, in each instance, they did not advance past {{the first round of the}} playoffs, and 2001 was Dierker's last season as the club's manager.|$|E
500|$|When {{casting the}} two leading {{actors in the}} film, Bertino sought Liv Tyler {{for the role of}} Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, {{accepted}} the part after being impressed by the script: [...] "I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate—with questions lingering. I knew {{it would be interesting to}} act that." [...] Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that [...] "the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. <b>That</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> interested from the first pages".|$|E

Morrison's family roots descend from the Ulster Scots population that settled in Belfast. From 1950 to 1956, Morrison, who began to be known as [...] "Van" [...] during this time, attended Elmgrove Primary School. His father had what was at the time one of the largest record collections in Ulster (acquired during his time in Detroit, Michigan, in the early 1950s) and the young Morrison grew up listening to artists such as Jelly Roll Morton, Ray Charles, Lead Belly, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, and Solomon Burke; of whom he later said, [...] "If it weren't for guys like Ray and Solomon, I wouldn't be where I am today.

Hunter Davies, who was at Jim's house at the time doing an interview for his Beatles' biography, remembered Jim listening to an acetate disc of [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four". Davies wrote that Paul recorded the song specifically for his father, as Jim was then 64 years old and had married Angela two years previously. Paul wrote [...] "Let It Be", because of a dream he had in 1968. He said that he had dreamt of his mother, and the [...] "Mother Mary" [...] lyric was about her. He later said, [...] "It was great to visit with her again. I felt very blessed to have that dream. So <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> writing 'Let It Be'." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 31, 2007, Biden {{took his}} first steps into the presidential campaign, but his {{comments}} about other candidates overshadowed his entrance. Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama; Biden {{was quoted in the}} New York Observer as saying: [...] "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] The audio of the interview, posted on the Observers website, reportedly includes a significant pause after [...] "African-American" [...] which would drastically change the meaning of the statement. Biden sought to clear up the controversy by apologizing to Obama on the same day and repeated his regret on The Daily Show that same evening: [...] "Look, the other part of this thing <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> in trouble is using the word clean. I should have said fresh." [...] Some media observers labeled Biden's announcement a [...] "launch pad disaster." [...] Jesse Jackson telephoned Biden and reported afterward [...] "Senator Biden...assured me that he regrets that his remarks were misinterpreted. He was serious and contrite. To me, this was a gaffe, not a statement about his philosophy or ideology." ...|$|E

500|$|On December 12, 2006, the Texas Rangers signed Lofton to {{a one-year}} contract. By signing with the Rangers, Lofton tied Todd Zeile for most teams played {{for by a}} {{position}} player. In 84 games with the Rangers, he hit [...]303 with 16 doubles. On July 27, 2007, Lofton was traded by the Rangers to the Indians in exchange for minor league catcher Max Ramírez. [...] "That's my biggest thing right now. I'm {{trying to get a}} World Series ring", Lofton said on joining the Indians {{for the third time in}} his career. The Jacobs Field crowd greeted Lofton with a standing ovation during his first at bat for this tour of duty with the Indians. Lofton noted, [...] "I missed being in Cleveland... I enjoy Cleveland. It's the city <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>me</b> going." [...] In Game One of the 2007 ALDS against the Yankees, he went 3-for-4 with four RBIs and one stolen base, which tied him with Rickey Henderson for the MLB's all-time postseason stolen bases record (33). In Game Two, he went 2-for-3 with two walks and scored the winning run in the 11th inning. Then, in Game Three of the 2007 ALCS, the 40-year-old Lofton hit a two-run home run against the Boston Red Sox' Daisuke Matsuzaka, becoming the seventh-oldest player to hit a post-season home run. Lofton earned his 34th career postseason stolen base in Game Four of the 2007 ALCS, setting a new MLB record for playoff steals. The Indians, who at one point had a 31 game lead over the Red Sox, eventually lost the series. Lofton became a free agent at the end of the season but did not sign a contract with a major league team. He expressed interest in playing before the 2009 season. From 2002 to 2007, Lofton played for eight teams and made it to the postseason with four of them. Joe Torre said, after Lofton had been to the playoffs in 11 of the past 13 seasons and played for 11 clubs in his career, [...] "He bounced around a lot of clubs for a reason: They felt he could help them. He did a hell of a job." [...] As Rollie Fingers wrote, [...] "On one hand, Lofton could be seen as a catalyst who magically sparked his teams into playoff contention, but others could say that it was simply a case of top playoff contenders repeatedly seeing him as the final piece of their puzzle." ...|$|E
