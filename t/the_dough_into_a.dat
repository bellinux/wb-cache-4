50|$|Salt {{and peanut}} oil {{are added to}} make a dough, which can be flavored with {{seasonings}} such as chili, cumin, garlic, or black pepper. Sometimes, baking soda or slaked lime is also added. <b>The</b> <b>dough</b> is shaped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> thin, round flatbread and then dried (traditionally in the sun), and can be cooked by deep frying, roasting over an open flame, toasting, or microwaving, depending on the desired texture.|$|R
5000|$|Oliebollen are {{a variety}} of {{dumpling}} made by using an ice cream scoop or two spoons to scoop a certain amount of dough and dropping <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> deep fryer filled with hot oil.

50|$|The only {{ingredient}} needed {{when making}} àmàlà is {{boiling water and}} one of the types of flour. Once the water has come to a boil, the heat is reduced. The flour is added and stirred until all the water is absorbed. More hot water is added, then the dough is left to simmer for approximately five minutes. Then the dough is kneaded until it has the desired texture. Kneading <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> smooth paste is {{the most difficult part of}} making àmàlà.|$|E
50|$|As a rule, calzones {{are usually}} stuffed with cheeses such as ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, {{provolone}} or a different local cheese. <b>The</b> <b>dough</b> is folded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> half-moon shape, then either sealed with an egg mixture or shaped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sphere. It is then either baked or fried. After being cooked, calzones might be served with marinara sauce, or alternatively {{topped with a}} combination of garlic, olive oil, and parsley: this depends on the region.|$|R
6000|$|From {{the proper}} functionary the flour was obtained, and the raisins; the beef-fat, or [...] "slush," [...] from Old Coffee; and the {{requisite}} {{supply of water}} from the scuttle-butt.

50|$|A sopaipilla is {{traditionally}} made from leavened wheat dough (or {{a mixture of}} wheat flour and masa harina) to which some shortening or butter is added. After being allowed to rise, <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> is rolled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sheet that is then cut into circular, square or triangular shapes. The shapes are 8-10 cm in size for the longest dimension (if intended for a dessert) or 15-20 cm (if intended to be stuffed for a main course). The shapes are then deep-fried in oil, sometimes after allowing them to rise further before frying: the frying causes the shapes to puff up, ideally forming a hollow pocket in the center.|$|R
50|$|Retarding {{may occur}} {{at any time}} during {{fermentation}} and is accomplished by placing <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> dough retarder, refrigerator, or other cold environment to slow the activity of the yeast. The retarding stage is often used in sourdough bread recipes to allow the bread to develop its characteristic flavor. A cold fermentation stage is sometimes used to develop flavor in other artisan breads, with a part of the dough ("pre-ferment") before the final mixing, with the entire dough during bulk fermentation, or in the final fermentation stages after shaping.|$|E
50|$|Dasik {{is shaped}} {{with a wooden}} or {{porcelain}} press that forms a patterned confectionery. The press is engraved with a design that forms an embossed pattern on the dasik piece.

50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat {{the oil in a}} deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E
50|$|Amritsari Papar or papad is a thin, crisp, {{disc-shaped}} food {{made from}} seasoned dough, usually of peeled black gram flour (urad flour). <b>The</b> <b>Dough</b> is rolled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> disc shape, and sun-dried to prepare raw papar. Flours {{from other sources}} such as lentils, chickpeas, rice, tapioca or potato, can be used, but typical Amritsari papar are made from urad dal, black pepper, and sometimes pomegranate.Papar are typically served as an accompaniment to a meal after roasting in then oven or on a coal fire, in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka; or as an appetizer or snack, with toppings such as chopped onions, carrots, chutney or other dips and condiments in parts of India. Papar is a low calorie value food but has a high sodium content.|$|R

40|$|Bread {{is the one}} of {{the oldest}} {{processed}} foods and a major wheat based product. The basic process involves mixing of ingredients until the flour is converted into dough, followed by baking <b>the</b> <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> loaf. A very important step in breadmaking is to know how to make good quality dough. However, the increasing knowledge of people being diagnosed with celiac disease (gluten intolerance) has encouraged scientists to develop healthier and better quality gluten-free products that would greatly {{improve the quality of life}} of celiac patients. The main objective of this study was to create a dough system composed of mainly maize proteins that would be able to reproduce same rheological properties as wheat gluten in breadmaking. The dough composites were made of Zein + co-protein + starch and were mixed at 25 °C and 35 °C. Three types of starches (corn, wheat, and rice) were used to better understand the interaction between starch and the proteins. Also, four different co-proteins (casein, sodium caseinate, gliadin and glutenin) were added to the system to determine the effect in zein functionality and its contribution to the viscoelastic dough system. Each sample was subjected to frequency test in a DHR- 3 Rheometer and to lubricated squeezing flow test in order to determine the rheological properties of each dough sample such as phase angle (delta), complex modulus (G*), and extensional viscosity (μ b). Moreover the glass transition temperatures of the different protein + starch samples were analyzed using the oscillatory squeezing flow technique. In small and large deformation tests, rice starch doughs showed similar or slightly improved rheological properties when compared to gluten. Rice starch doughs also showed a lower glass transition temperature than gluten doughs when mixed at both temperatures when tested under OSF method. Overall, not only protein plays an important role when making bread dough. Similar wheat flour dough properties can be obtained with corn and rice starch when mixed with zein and other co-proteins at 35 °C. The glass transition temperature plays an important role in determining zein 2 ̆ 7 s behavior in a dough system. Addition of co-protein showed to have an effect in dough formation when zein becomes more mobile at 35 °C. ...|$|E
