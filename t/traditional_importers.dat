50|$|In {{an effort}} to help address this situation, initially, the Bank was called upon to {{administer}} a dual exchange rate regime and an exchange control system to severely curtail foreign exchange outflows - the system known as the EC zero system. This was essentially a form of strict foreign exchange budgeting to permit <b>traditional</b> <b>importers</b> and other users to receive an allocation of foreign currency on a quarterly basis for the year ahead.|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA), and Australia {{have adopted}} {{specific}} measures {{to avoid the}} placing of illegal timber on their markets. These measures might encourage the diversion of timber products from traditional large importers to destinations with a less stringent regulatory framework. During 2001 – 2013, the international trade in tropical primary timber products (logs; sawnwood; veneers and plywood) decreased by 13 % in volume and increased by almost 5 % in value. Imports by Australia, the EU, and the USA halved, while those by emerging economies such as China and India initially remained stable and later increased. Tropical timber products—mostly logs and sawnwood—might have been diverted towards emerging economies over the period considered. This general trend is confirmed when analyzing imports from countries that are implementing voluntary partnership agreements (VPA) within the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. Several factors might influence these market dynamics, including changes induced by the 2008 financial crisis and the increasing domestic demand for timber products by emerging nations. The effects of legality measures on market trends are still unclear. Nonetheless, they might have encouraged uncertainty with regards to <b>traditional</b> <b>importers</b> and favored emerging ones...|$|E
50|$|Panama {{has been}} a <b>traditional</b> <b>importer</b> of lentils, dry beans and kidney beans. There is some {{domestic}} kidney bean production that supplies much of the market when international prices climb and compete for the market {{the rest of the}} time. There is no lentil production in Panama and no demand for black beans.|$|R
40|$|Global {{rapeseed}} {{production has}} undergone sustained {{growth over the}} past 20 years. Having surpassed cottonseed production in the early 2000 ’s, {{it is now the}} second most produced oilseed behind soybeans. The major producers are China, India, Canada and European Union (27). During this same period, rapeseed crushing has risen strongly, Europe being the major player in this expansion (development of biodiesel) followed to a lesser extent by Canada and China. World exports of rapeseeds are dominated by Canada, by far the largest exporter. Japan is a <b>traditional</b> <b>importer,</b> while China and the EU (27) are less regular buyers. Although less spectacular than palm oil growth, rapeseed oil growth is also remarkable. Its consumption occurs mainly in the crushing countries, the EU being the principal consumer. Rapeseed meal is the second major oilseed meal produced worldwide (after soybean meal). It has been following broadly the same trends as seeds and oils, this evolution was marked a short period of stagnation in the early 2000 ’s. Consumption of rapeseed meal has grown strongly in the EU (which is deficient in protein feed), in China (due to its extraordinary economic development), and in the USA (due to milk producers’ demand for feed). The main exporters of rapeseed meals are Canada and India. Oilseed prices spiked in 2008 and since 2010 are remaining at historically high levels: whilst prices fell sharply following the 2013 harvest, they remain well above the lows of 2009. Rape seed meal, however, will remain a secondary meal with known drawbacks; there is little prospect of its price going higher than 65 – 70 % of that of soybean meal...|$|R
40|$|Japan is a <b>traditional</b> net <b>importer</b> of food {{products}} {{in general and}} meat products in particular. Japanese meat imports come from a few countries thus making Japan potentially very sensitive to the swings in {{one or a few}} bilateral exchange rates. One of the key contributions of this article is the use of commodity (meats in this case) imports weighted exchange rates in the analysis. The standard practice in previous international agricultural trade studies related to either exchange rate pass-through or pricing to market was to use the aggregate trade weighted exchange rates usually provided by the Central Bank authorities or sources. Beef and poultry import prices indicate partial exchange rate pass-through while import prices of pork indicate zero exchange rate pass-through, primarily due to gate price policy system applied to pork imports. In terms of competitiveness, these results suggest relatively more competitive markets among poultry importing firms, somewhat competitive markets among beef importing firms, while competitiveness of pork importing firms could not be assessed due to existing import policies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{exchange}} rate pass-through on import prices {{is a question}} of significant interest to many nations and especially those with permanent trade deficit. Japan is <b>traditional</b> net <b>importer</b> of food products in general and meat products including beef, pork, and poultry in particular. Most of the Japanese meat imports come from a few countries thus making Japan potentially very sensitive to the swings in one or a few bilateral exchange rates. This was the motivation to estimate the exchange rate pass-through effect on meat import prices in Japan. Interestingly, results for different meats differ substantially. For instance, poultry import prices indicate almost complete exchange rate pass-through, while beef import prices indicate partial (relatively high) exchange rate pass-through. Import prices of pork, on the other hand, indicate zero exchange rate pass-through. In terms of competitiveness, these results suggest almost perfectly competitive markets among poultry importing firms, somewhat competitive markets among beef importing firms, and a high degree of market power among the pork importing firms. One of the key contributions of this paper is the use of the meats imports weighted exchange rates in the analysis. The standard practice in previous agricultural trade studies related to either exchange rate pass-through or pricing to market was to use the aggregate trade weighted exchange rates usually provided by the Central Bank authorities or sources. Our approach is novel and is due to recommendations from Goldberg (2004) and Pollard and Coughlin (2006). International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to examine how retailers play a powerful {{role in shaping the}} governance in cut flower trade in France. Global Value Chain analysis has been used to explain why a distribution system originally based on spot markets has been replaced by tightly integrated supply chains. It allowed an exploration of the consequences of these changes on the structure of the value chain and the inclusion and exclusion of different agents in the chain. Fieldwork were carried out between 2007 and 2008 in France and in Holland with 22 chain participants including supermarkets, franchise florists, <b>traditional</b> florists, <b>importers,</b> wholesalers, institutions and freelance consultants. Traditional florists have always been the main retail channel for cut flowers in France. However, since 1990 `s share of traditional florists has been reduced sharply by entry of new channels and therefore this market became much more consolidated. In the 1990 `s supermarkets began to sale cut flower and rapidly they was accounted 15 % of the market. More recently, the consolidation of market have been reinforced by the emerging of franchises florist chains. French franchises and supermarkets have been bought directly in developing countries such as Kenya, Uganda and Colombia. Each retailer has developed its own value chain control system. The retailer-importer relationship has been moved towards the relational pattern, whereas the importer-producer relationship displayed the characteristics of a captive linkage. These importers acquired new functions, moving beyond a `trading' role toward a more active position in the management of the value chain. They have assumed responsibility for developing new sources of supply, supporting developing-country producers and monitoring their performance. The product and process parameters changed also the roles of producers, forcing them to acquire new technical knowledge of production as well as on close ties with researchers, breeding companies, and importers. Demands for capital and technical capacity had led to the exclusion of many small producers that were unable to meet requirements. This exclusion was initially evident in the France, but then it also has reached all the major African cut flower exporting countries such as Kenya and Uganda. Production has moved away from small growers to large farms, many of which are owned by the Dutch importers. The small producers that have remained in the value chain have been organized into grower organizations {{with a high degree of}} control by the importers...|$|R
