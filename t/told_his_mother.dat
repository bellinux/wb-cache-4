5|$|Nash {{was born}} in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a Welsh mother, Jean, and English father, John, on February 7, 1974. His family moved to Regina, Saskatchewan when he was 18 months old, before {{settling}} in Victoria, British Columbia. He therefore holds British as well as Canadian citizenship. Before the family settled in Canada, his father played professional soccer {{in various parts of}} the world. Nash often played soccer and ice hockey with his younger brother Martin, and did not start playing basketball until he was 12 or 13 years old. In grade eight, however, he <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> that one day he would play in the NBA and would become a star. He was neighbour to future NHL stars Russ and Geoff Courtnall, who used to babysit him and played soccer coached by Nash's father.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) program, Insane Clown Posse began its rescheduled {{nationwide}} tour with House of Krazees and Myzery. Their first concert, held in Orlando, Florida, was hand-picked by Insane Clown Posse and free to the public. Halfway through the tour, Brian Jones of House of Krazees had a falling out with his band members. Jones left the group, forcing House of Krazees to quit the tour. The success of the tour enabled Bruce and Utsler to purchase new houses both {{for each other and}} for their families. Bruce even <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> to quit her job because he would pay her expenses.|$|E
5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber. However, during sex with Vyasa, Ambika noticed his dark {{appearance}} and closed her eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result the child would be wan, Vyasa <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son {{would be the most}} intelligent man, and she would no longer be a slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.|$|E

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she looks down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E

The decision leaves only one missing person whose possible death at the World Trade Center is unresolved. Fernando Molinar, a Mexican immigrant, {{has not been seen}} or heard from since September 8, 2001, when he <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> on the telephone that he was starting a new job at a pizzeria near the building. A similar petition to Surrogate's Court on his behalf also was rejected.|$|E

25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E
500|$|Njal's Saga {{provides}} {{a little more}} detail, alleging that Gormflaith ingen Murchada prompted her son Sigtrygg into getting Sigurd to fight against her former husband, Brian Ború: [...] "She sent him to Earl Sigurd to beg for help... Then King Sigtrygg fared south to Ireland, and <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> that the Earl had undertaken to come." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Pink Moons release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant from {{those close to}} him. He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary.

50|$|William Franklin {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then a colony in British America. He was the illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin, a leading figure in the city. <b>His</b> <b>mother's</b> {{identity}} is unknown. Confusion exists about William's birth and parentage because Benjamin was secretive about his son's origins. In 1750, Ben <b>told</b> <b>his</b> own <b>mother</b> that William was nineteen years old, but {{this may have been}} an attempt to make the youth appear legitimate.|$|R
500|$|Plump as a child, Warner was {{sometimes}} known as [...] "Butter". He began playing baseball {{at an early}} age, and was a skilled pitcher. Nobody in town owned a football; his only exposure to the new sport {{at a young age}} was with an inflated cow's bladder, and as few knew the rules, the game more resembled soccer. Warner's East Main Street house attracted a number of friends; when a neighbor <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> that the boys' play would damage her lawn, she replied: [...] "I'm raising boys, not grass".|$|E

[...] Pope Benedict XVI stated that this dictum of Jesus brought the fourth commandment to a new and higher level. By doing God's will, any person can become part of the universal family of Jesus. Thus, the fourth commandment's responsibilities extend to the greater society and requires respect for [...] "legitimate social authorities". The Catechism specifies [...] "duties of citizens and nations", which Kreeft summarizes as: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{surviving}} libretto is not {{the version}} heard by audiences at the Gaiety Theatre. There are numerous discrepancies between the original libretto and what was described as happening on stage, and reviewers repeatedly quoted dialogue that has no equivalent in the published libretto. At least one song is missing, and an entire character, Venus, is mentioned in at least five reviews as stout, elderly, and heavily made-up, but {{does not appear in}} either the programme or the libretto. Stage directions in the original are slip-shod: characters reappear without an entrance being noted, or enter twice in quick succession, without having exited. [...] In addition, Sullivan <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> that at least one song was cut after opening night, and there must certainly have been other cuts, given the undue length of the first performance. But the text of the libretto, as published, remained [...] "virtually unchanged" [...] between December 1871 and March 1872.|$|E
50|$|Rudy Robles (Marin) is <b>told</b> by <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> {{to pick up}} {{his cousin}} Javier (Paul Rodriguez) at a factory before she leaves for Fresno. Robles arrives shortly before {{immigration}} officials raid the factory looking for illegal immigrants. Because he is carrying no identification, and <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> and sister are not available to verify he is a US citizen, Robles is deported with the illegals to Mexico.|$|R

500|$|John Diefenbaker {{had been}} {{interested}} in politics from an early age, and <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> {{at the age of}} eight or nine that he would some day be Prime Minister. She told him that it was an impossible ambition, especially for a boy living on the prairies. She would live to be proved wrong. John's first contact with politics came in 1910, when he sold a newspaper to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in Saskatoon to lay the cornerstone for the University's first building. The present and future Prime Ministers conversed, and when giving his speech that afternoon, Sir Wilfrid commented on the newsboy who had ended their conversation by saying, [...] "I can't waste any more time on you, Prime Minister. I must get about my work." [...] The authenticity of the meeting was questioned in the 21st century, with an author suggesting that it was invented by Diefenbaker during an election campaign.|$|E
500|$|In June 1911 Heseltine {{learned that}} Thomas Beecham was {{to conduct an}} all-Delius concert at London's Queen's Hall on the 16th of that month, at which the {{composer}} would be present, and his Songs of Sunset would be given its first performance. Colin Taylor, a sympathetic Eton piano tutor, secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event. Prior to this, his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home; as a consequence, during the concert intermission Heseltine {{was introduced to the}} composer. The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter: [...] "I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to me to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music". He <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> that [...] "Friday evening was the most perfectly happy evening I have ever spent, and I shall never forget it". Delius became the first strong formative influence of Heseltine's compositional career, and although the initial adulation was later modified, a friendship began that would largely endure for the remainder of Heseltine's life.|$|E
500|$|After {{moving to}} 17 Queenscourt Road in 1948—where the Bests lived for nine years—Rory saw a large Victorian house {{for sale at}} 8 Hayman's Green in 1954, and <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> about it. The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her {{jewellery}} and placed a bet on a horse that was ridden by Lester Piggott in the 1954 Epsom Derby, called [...] "Never Say Die", which won at 33–1, and used her winnings to buy the house in 1957. Note: to place the bet, Mona {{would have had to}} travel more than 220 miles from Liverpool to Epsom (as bets were only allowed at race tracks at the time) or place the bet with an illegal bookmaker in Liverpool. Eight Hayman's Green had previously been owned by the West Derby Conservative Club, and was unlike many other family houses in Liverpool, as the house (built around 1860) was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an acre of land. All the rooms were painted dark green or brown, and the garden was totally overgrown. Mona decorated the living room in an Oriental style, which reflected her own upbringing in India. She had previously tried to interest her husband in other houses, including a Formby lighthouse, a windmill in St. Helens and a circular house in Southport, which John disliked and rejected.|$|E
50|$|Jimmy was {{separated}} from <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> {{at a very young}} age, and she spent her entire life looking for him.

In these battles, Horus came to be associated with Lower Egypt, and became its patron.|$|R
500|$|Zacharias {{was born}} in Madras, India. He is descended from {{a woman of the}} Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste. His mother was from Madras (now Chennai) while his father was from Kerala. He grew up in Delhi. According to Zacharias, before her marriage, Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin {{ancestor}} about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community. Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household, and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> to read to him from John 14. [...] Zacharias says that it was [...] that touched him and meant to him as the defining paradigm: [...] "Because I live, you also will live." [...] He said that he thought, [...] "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." [...] and that he committed his life to Christ praying, [...] "Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get me out of this hospital bed well, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth." [...] In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University College & Seminary) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990 Mr. Zacharias did a 2-3 month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in the town of Cambridge. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees.|$|E

It's the long-awaited reunion of Jack's biological parents. A couple of years ago, Jack discovered his real father, but just to avoid an argument, he hasn't <b>told</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> that he knows her shameful sex secret." [...] The character Professor Milton Greene, Jack Donaghy's biological father, was played by guest actor Alan Alda, {{best known for his}} role as Hawkeye Pierce from the television series M*A*S*H. Alda and Alec Baldwin have worked together, having appeared in the 2004 biographical drama film The Aviator. This was Alda's third appearance on the show. After the airing of the season three finale episode [...] "Kidney Now!', in which Jack organizes a benefit concert to get Milton a kidney, it was unknown whether or not the benefit concert for Milton was a success, however, in the season four episode [...] "Into the Crevasse", Milton is shown to have written his book From Peanut to President, a biography of United States President Jimmy Carter. In this episode it is revealed that Jack sent Milton a kidney from British singer-songwriter Elvis Costello who participated in the benefit concert in [...] "Kidney Now!". In October 2010, it was confirmed that Alda would return as his 30 Rock character on the fifth season. In an interview with TV Guide, Alda said that he first met Elaine Stritch twenty years ago [...] "but never worked with her before. I always knew the reunion would be interesting. We kid with each other a lot, and our characters have a common enemy in their son." [...] This was Elaine Stritch's seventh appearance as Colleen Donaghy, Jack's mother, on the series.
