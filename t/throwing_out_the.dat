5|$|He never {{attended}} {{school and was}} illiterate for some years of his early life. He learned {{to read and write}} reportedly out of curiosity after reading and hearing comic books and stories of Kalimán and Porfirio Cadena, El Ojo del Vidrio on the local radio station. In his autobiography, Moreno González said that as a child he believed he had the superhuman ability of speaking telepathically with animals like Kalimán did in the comics. He said {{he wanted to be a}} hero like the comic characters. As a child, he was accustomed to seeing gunmen near his home, and played las guerritas ("war games") for fun. While playing the game, he often pretended to be dead, only to say later on that he had been wounded in the game but that he had managed to survive. At the age of twelve, he moved to Apatzingán and made a living by selling matches, peeling onions, working at a melon field, and <b>throwing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> trash from several booths at a marketplace. As a teenager in the late 1980s, Moreno González migrated illegally to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually began selling marijuana. After some years, he moved to Texas and in 1994 was arrested for drug trafficking charges in McAllen. Nearly a decade later in 2003, the U.S. government charged him with conspiracy to distribute five tons of narcotics and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno González then fled back to Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of <b>throwing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E

500|$|As in 1947 and 1949, Clark {{focused his}} {{campaign}} on {{the corruption of the}} Republican organization, calling it [...] "the most corrupt political machine in the United States". Poling admitted that corruption existed, but pledged to root it out himself if elected.

2500|$|Calf {{injuries}} force Gwynn to miss 44 {{games in}} the first half of 1999. At the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park in Boston, he escorted Williams to the mound, and steadied his friend in <b>throwing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> ceremonial first pitch. It was Gwynn's most memorable All-Star moment in his career. As he approached 3,000 career hits in July, two unidentified Padres said there was too much focus on reaching the milestone. Additionally, Jim Leyritz, after being traded from the Padres to the Yankees, said Gwynn lacked the [...] "intangibles" [...] of a team player. In the next game in San Diego, Padres fans gave Gwynn a standing ovation after he was removed for a pinch runner following his 2,994 hit. Gwynn approached 3,000 hits on the road, first playing in a series against the Cardinals. On August 4, Gwynn collected three hits, including a grand slam, to reach 2,998 hits, receiving a standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd after each hit. The following day, Gwynn collected hit number 2,999 in the same game that the Cardinals' Mark McGwire hit his 500th home run. Gwynn got his 3,000th hit on August 6 with a single in the first inning off Montreal Expos pitcher Dan Smith. He had four hits in the game. His 2,000th hit was also on [...] August 6, which is also the birthday of Gwynn's mother. The milestone was delayed by a left calf injury that season which sent Gwynn to the DL twice, forcing him to miss 44 games. He reached 3,000 in 2,284 games, the third-fewest games among the 22 players to reach the mark behind Cobb (2,135) and Nap Lajoie (2,224). No player born after 1900 got there in fewer games or at-bats (8,874) than Gwynn.|$|E
2500|$|In 1787, King {{was sent}} to the Constitutional Convention held at Philadelphia. King held a {{significant}} position at the convention. Despite his youthful stature, “he numbered among the most capable orators”. Along with James Madison, “he became a leading figure in the nationalist causus”. Furthermore, he attended every session. King’s “views underwent a startling transformation during the debates” originally changing a mindset supporting Articles of Confederation and utterly <b>throwing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> idea that it could be sustained. King’s major involvements included serving on the Committee on Postponed Matters and the Committee of Style and Arrangement. [...] Although he came to the convention unconvinced that major changes should be made in the Articles of Confederation, his views underwent a startling transformation during the debates. He worked with Chairman William Samuel Johnson, James Madison, Gouverneur Morris, and Alexander Hamilton on the Committee of Style and Arrangement to prepare a final draft of the United States Constitution. [...] King {{is one of the more}} prominent delegates namely because of playing “a major role in the laborious crafting of the fundamental governing character. The constitution was signed on September 17, only [...] needing to be ratified by each of the subsequent states. After signing the Constitution, he returned home and went to work to get the Constitution ratified and unsuccessfully position himself to be named to the U.S. Senate. The ratification passed by the narrow margin of 187–168 votes. With the ratification passed, Massachusetts “became the sixth state to ratify [...] constitution in early February 1788. Rufus is indirectly responsible for the passing of this ratification seeing that his “learned, informative, and persuasive speeches” were able to convince a “popular, vain merchant and prince-turned-politicians to abandon his anti-federalism and approve the new organic law”.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second part}} of the Kulasekhara empire in the 10th and 11th centuries was characterised by a series of great {{conflicts}} with the Cholas in {{what became known as the}} [...] "Hundred Years War". It is believed that Raja Raja Chola (985–1016 CE)) wanted to reunite Chera territory with the rest of Tamizhakam. In , he mounted a probing attack which reached Kandalur Salai before returning back. In 999, he was able to inflict a major defeat on the Cheras, defeating Chera strongholds in Kandalur and Vizhinjam. By the end of his reign, much of South Travancore came under Chola control. The wars continued into the reign of Rajendra Chola (1012–1044 CE) who also won battles at Kandalur and Vizhinjam in 1019 which had been taken back by the Cheras in the interim. The capital of the Kulasekharas, Mahodayapuram was sacked in a decisive battle when the Chola armies attacked via the Palakkad gap and this battle led to the deaths of several important chieftains and generals. However, the Cheras once again regrouped and by 1070 CE, Chera territories were back under their control. Kulottunga Chola I (1070–1122) CE had to fight once again to gain Kandalur and Vizhinjam and is known to have proceeded further north and destroyed Kollam in 1096 CE. This defeat led to a major reorganisation and mobilisation of the Chera forces under the rule of Rama Varma Kulasekhara who rallied them under his banner with the primary objective of <b>throwing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Chola imperialists. A large body of fighters called the Chavers was raised who were styled as suicide squads. In , the Chavers played a decisive part in the defeat of Kulottunga Chola I, inflicting heavy casualties on the Cholas and forcing them to retreat to Kottar. The Cholas were never able to conquer the Chera regions again and withdrew from the region.|$|E
