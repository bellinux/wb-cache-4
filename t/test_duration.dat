40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to quantify the clogging processes of Permeable Interlocking Concrete Pavers (PICPs) using accelerated testing methods. However, {{the results have been}} variable. This study investigated the effects that three different sediment types (natural and silica), and different simulated rainfall intensities, and <b>testing</b> <b>durations</b> had on the observed clogging processes (and measured surface infiltration rates) of laboratory-based, accelerated PICP testing studies. Results showed that accelerated simulated laboratory testing results are highly dependent on the type, and size of sediment used in the experiments. For example, when using real stormwater sediment up to 1. 18 mm in size, the results showed that neither <b>testing</b> <b>duration,</b> nor stormwater application rate had any significant effect on PICP clogging. However, the study clearly showed that shorter <b>testing</b> <b>durations</b> generally increased clogging and reduced the surface infiltration rates of the models when artificial silica sediment was used. Longer <b>testing</b> <b>durations</b> also generally increased clogging of the models when using fine sediment (< 300 μm).

The 96 -hour EC 50 values of total chlorophyll content of I. aquatica, P. stratiotes and H. dubia were 0. 996, 0. 785 and 0. 334 g/l, respectively.
