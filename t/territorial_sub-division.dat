30|$|Up to what point, then, can democracies, at {{any level}} of <b>territorial</b> <b>sub-division,</b> accept the {{temporary}} or lasting suppression of some kinds of freedom, just to raise their level of internal security in metropolitan governance? Can it {{be said that the}} security policy tends to determine both the politics of democratic quality and its polity, namely the territorial criteria that legitimise participation? Can we conjecture that the need for responsiveness and accountability, when there is a primary necessity like security at stake, tends to relegate other dimensions of democratic quality, such as the freedom and equality of popular participation, to second place and thus to redefine the ties between democracy, participation and territory? Looking at it through the lens of urban security policies, it does not seem risky to state that the spatial prism of democracy, first evoked due to the multiple facets into which it manages to break down the concept of participation, tends on the other hand to drastically reduce, thus understood, its refractive capacity.|$|E
