5|$|During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense {{requested}} {{the retirement of}} the name Kenneth, citing that <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> become memorable due to threat or damage. However, the World Meteorological Organization did not approve the request, and the name was reused for the 2011 season.|$|E
5|$|Schenectady, Schoharie, Montgomery, Washington, Essex, Warren and Clinton {{counties}} in New York state, which {{were affected by}} extensive snowfall from <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> <b>had</b> {{declared a state of}} emergency while several other counties and towns declared snow emergencies.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone over water, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> relatively little impact over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells {{produced by the}} storm. However, the losses were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the storm.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> begun to abate over Hainan, {{it was already}} nearly dissipated, {{and as a result}} {{produced}} few, if any, noticeable effects in mainland China. Across the Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam had experienced deadly flooding in the week before Nepartak's approach, and the typhoon initially raised concerns about worsening the situation. Officials made preparations to minimize potentially exacerbating factors, and the cyclone remained far enough east to avoid seriously impacting the country.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the unpredictability}} of the storm, a {{hurricane}} warning was issued from Freeport, Texas to Intracoastal City, Louisiana at 1600UTC, only eight hours prior to landfall. Simultaneously, two separate tropical storm warnings were posted, from Matagorda to Freeport and Intracoastal City to Morgan City. Although <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> already made landfall, a tropical storm warning was issued from Freeport to Intracoastal City at 0400UTC on October16. By six hours later, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued.|$|E

5|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> {{weakened}} drastically by this time, Tess killed 37people in Vietnam, destroyed {{thousands of}} homes, and inflicted $11million in damage. Following Tess, Philippine President Corazon Aquino visited {{the provinces of}} Pangasinan and Pampanga, both situated {{to the north of}} Manila to tour damaged areas, distribute relief, aid and inaugurate an infrastructure project. A mere few days after Tess, Typhoon Skip became the third cyclone to hit the archipelago in two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Further {{strengthening}} {{was expected}} by forecasters, {{but did not}} come. The storm's motion slowed, and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast. The storm made landfall around 11:00UTC on July20 near San Fernando in Tamaulipas. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> sustained winds of 125mph (200km/h), Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After heading inland over northeast Mexico, it dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental on July21.|$|E
5|$|Initially exhibiting {{characteristics}} of a monsoonal low, a mid-level ridge {{to the south of}} Graham caused strong westerly winds that moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough eroded the ridge, allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south. According to the JTWC, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> intensified late on 28 February, though {{at the same time the}} BoM noted the slight weakening of the storm. Graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast.|$|E

5|$|It {{proceeded}} to drop {{large amounts of}} hail on the northern beach suburbs of Mona Vale and Palm Beach around 8:50pm, and {{the centre of the}} storm again crossed the coast and back out to sea just after 9:00pm. The storm maintained its intensity, however, and continued to move in a northwesterly direction across Broken Bay. The western edge of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> a minor impact on southern suburbs of the Central Coast between 9:15pm and 9:30pm.|$|E
5|$|On Monday morning, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> moved {{northeast}} of London, Ontario, dragging lake effect blizzards in its wake. An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling {{the streets with}} snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take shelter and wait for things to clear.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{initially}} forecast Rick {{to make landfall}} {{in southern}} Baja California as a high-end Category2 hurricane, prompting hurricane watches. Officials ordered several hundred residents to evacuate from low-lying areas, although tropical storm warnings replaced the hurricane watches after <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> weakened. Overall, the damage from Rick was significantly less than initially anticipated. In Mexico, three people {{were killed by the}} storm, one in Oaxaca and two in Baja California Sur.|$|E

5|$|The storm made {{landfall}} at Western Australia's Eighty Mile Beach at 1400 UTC on 28 February, {{and began}} to weaken. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> dissipated on 1 March; the BoM issued their last advisory on the cyclone at 0400 UTC that day, while similarly, the JTWC issued their last advisory just two hours later. The storm's remnants died out in the country's desert.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of weather}} charts {{in a modern}} sense began in the middle portion of the 19th century in order to devise a theory on storm systems. During the Crimean War a storm devastated the French fleet at Balaklava, and the French {{scientist}} Urbain Le Verrier was {{able to show that}} if a chronological map of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> been issued, the path it would take could have been predicted and avoided by the fleet.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression was first observed 300mi (485km) southeast of Socorro Island on September29. The depression rapidly intensified, {{and was a}} Category1 hurricane only twelve hours after being first observed. Peaking as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane, Hurricane Six tied Hurricane Four as the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. After reaching its peak intensity, Hurricane Six rapidly weakened, and passed 70mi (125km) southeast of Socorro Island with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Further weakening occurred, and <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> dissipated on September 30.|$|E

5|$|After {{affecting}} Yap, Mitag {{turned to}} the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough. It passed {{to the north of}} Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) on March5. The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> dissipated well to the east of the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|As Isaac tracked northwestward, it re-strengthened {{into a major}} {{hurricane}} on September28. Later that day, Isaac peaked as a moderate-Category4 hurricane. However, Isaac {{began to}} track northward over an area of colder sea surface temperatures (SSTs), which gradually weakened the storm {{over the next three}} days. Eventually, the storm curved northeastward, and weakened to a tropical storm early on October1. Later that day, Isaac transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. While extratropical, it brushed the British Isles, producing below gale-force winds. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> no interaction with land while tropical; however, one fatality occurred on Long Island when large swells generated by Isaac overturned a boat. In addition, rough seas also affected the coastlines of Bermuda and The Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of June22, {{satellite}} imagery indicated {{the formation of an}} eyewall; by this time Andres was near hurricane-status. Early the next day, the center of circulation became embedded within a central dense overcast and Andres intensified into a hurricane, the first of the season, around 0600UTC. At this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mbar (hPa; 29.06inHg); the storm was located roughly 80mi (130km) southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas upon attaining this intensity. Twelve hours after becoming a hurricane, most of the deep convection associated with <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>had</b> weakened; however, Hurricane Hunters still recorded 75mph (120km/h) winds despite the ragged appearance of Andres.|$|E
