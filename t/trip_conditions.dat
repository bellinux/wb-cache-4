40|$|This study {{assessed}} the desirability for High-Occupancy/Toll (HOT) lanes in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) through stated preference and revealed traffic volume data gathering and analysis techniques. 4, 000 surveys, distributed in five sample areas, asked respondents {{how much they}} would be willing to pay to escape congestion in eight unique <b>trip</b> <b>conditions.</b> Stated preference results found considerable public support for HOT-lanes in the GTA. In six out of eight <b>trip</b> <b>conditions,</b> a majority of respondents preferred to pay to travel in express lanes rather than endure congestion. Respondent willingness to pay (WTP) mean values varied considerably by trip condition. Willingness to pay to escape congestion was influenced by trip characteristics and driver factors. Trip urgency, traffic speed, and freeway trip distance were found to be statistically significant trip characteristic indicators of WTP. Previous exposure to electronic tolling and annual household income were found to be significant driver factor indicators of WTP in most <b>trip</b> <b>conditions.</b> Respondent gender and freeway travel frequency were found to be statistically significant driver factor indicators of WTP in some <b>trip</b> <b>conditions.</b> The presence of Hwy 407 -ETR, an electronically tolled by-pass to Hwy 401, allowed for an examination of the effects of Hwy 401 volume and trip urgency on driver choice to use the tolled alternative. Results indicated that trip urgency and Hwy 401 volume were correlated with Hwy 407 throughput share. During periods of high trip urgency and high Hwy 401 volume, a substantial proportion of Hwy 401 / 407 corridor drivers chose to pay approximately $ 0. 20 /km to escape congestion...|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of travel demand {{to changes in}} the generalized cost of travel can be tailored, through disaggregate mode choice models, to reflect specific <b>trip</b> <b>conditions.</b> The logit mode split function can provide share elasticities that vary not only with tripmaker characteristics, but also with travel conditions encountered along the individual route. Frequently however, average estimates of elasticities are used to predict aggregate or market wide changes in mode share which may result from congestion surcharges. Grouping individual elasticities into market averages is mandated by lack of time and money, or insufficient detail in the travel data. To the extent that logit-based elasticities reflect wide variations across tripmaker and trip characteristics, group averaging can introduce significant distortions in obtaining an accurate market response to travel cost modifications. In the absence of transferability, a reliable evaluation of congestion pricing strategies would be difficult to obtain. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} compare a cross-sectional sample of point elasticities obtained from a binary logit function against an overall average and to assess the nature of any variability in terms of selected contextual travel variables. ...|$|E

40|$|Wells {{that are}} drilled today are {{becoming}} {{deeper and more}} complex, and actions to make these wells economically justifiable are desired by oil companies. One method {{is to reduce the}} non-productive time during drilling by analysing the hook load response to restrictions in the well. The goal is to recognize abnormal behavior as early as possible to prevent stuck pipe or other incidents that may lead to non-productive time. In present thesis a mathematical model for simulating hook load during normal <b>tripping</b> <b>conditions</b> is made. The model is based on theory about forces acting in the borehole, and properties of the drill string and the wellbore are inserted into it. The goal is to make good hook load simulations for simple <b>tripping</b> <b>conditions,</b> as restrictions most often cause problems during tripping operations. If restrictions were to occur, the changes in hook load during tripping would be identified quickly, and remedies can be started early. A laboratory that simulates tripping out of a nearly horizontal well is buildt and experiments are done. The laboratory experiments are carried out with and without mud flow, to identify also the forces that depends on mud circulation. Washout has been imitated in order to see how restrictions affect the hook load. The model consists of mathematical equations that describe all forces acting on the drill string. The laboratory results were used to adjust the equations, so they match hook load behavior even better. From comparison with the laboratory results {{it was found that the}} model creates accurate hook load simulations under simple conditions. Simulations with mud flow during tripping were inaccurate because the forces that occur during circulation were poorly mathematically described in the model. It is not possible to run real time drilling data in the model to see if the model is realistic because block position measurements are missing and some measurement rates are too low, so the equations in the model is not general enough. With improved position measurements and following adjustments in the model, it is likely that the hook load behavior model could be used to reduce the non-productive time during drilling. </p...|$|R

40|$|Similar {{to other}} countries, {{also in the}} Netherlands young male drivers (ages between 18 and 24 years) are overrepresented in crashes during weekend nights, thereby fatally {{injuring}} {{one or more of}} their passengers. This overrepresentation may be due to two contributing factors: (a) a higher exposure-to-risk because of dangerous trip condition, and (b) a higher tendency to take risks. Studies on these factors, mostly carried out in jurisdictions where youngsters are licensed at an earlier age than in Europe, suggest a strong –often negative– influence from peer-aged passengers. Given that in adolescence susceptibility to peer pressure reduces with age, these findings may not be applicable to late licensing countries, such as in Europe. In the Netherlands –a late licensing country– youngsters are licensed after the age of 18 years, followed by a 5 year probation period with a legal alcohol limit of 0. 2 g/L. Further, designated driver schemes are in place since 2001, alcohol limits are enforced by random breath testing schemes, and no passenger and night time restrictions are in force. Against this background, we examined the incidence of dangerous <b>trip</b> <b>conditions</b> and risk taking among young male drivers and compared those with a reference group with a low passenger fatality rate. To that end, data on <b>trip</b> <b>conditions</b> and risk behavior were obtained from a data base on 18, 608 randomly selected drivers during weekend nights in 2010, between 22 : 00 and 06 : 00. This data base held information for each randomly selected on breath alcohol concentration (BAC), license status, driver characteristics (age and gender), number of passengers, time of night, and level of urbanization. Binary logistic regression analysis confirmed the overrepresentation of young male drivers in traffic, carrying more frequently passengers than the reference group, especially after midnight. Urbanization level was not a modifying factor, but ‘time of night’ was, with riskier conditions after midnight in terms of: (a) a higher young male driver presence, (b) young male drivers carrying more frequently multiple passengers and (c) a higher prevalence of illegal BACs. After midnight, no evidence was found for a protective effect of the presence of one passenger on alcohol use. Of the young male drivers, 5 % were over the legal limit and 3 in 5 young males who were over the limit carried passengers. However, the indicative result that young male drivers with multiple passengers were less likely to have been drinking than solo drivers or drivers with just one passenger, is suggestive of a protective effect of multiple passengers. These results may guide preventive strategies, including police enforcement and designated driver programmes. (Author/publisher...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{control of}} voyage systems has become {{increasingly}} important in many applications one important application is hauling by different mediums such as skyways, pathways, bar ways and so on. These applications usually involve queries over locality connections with dynamically unstable and multifarious <b>trip</b> <b>conditions.</b> There may be potential of user's secrecy violated when they are querying about the general required data on the private party servers where the position information about the users will be recognized.

The Directional aware Bichromatic Reverse K-NN by assigning each item and query with a confined region is applied such that the high-priced recomputation is not required {{as long as the}} query and objects remain in their respective confined regions. The proposed system reduces the cost in client-server architectures because an object does not report its location to the server unless it leaves its confined region or the server sends a position update appeal.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} opportunistic and dedicated sensors is transforming a once data-starved transport field {{into one of}} the most data-rich. While link-level travel time information can be derived or inferred from this data, methods for estimation of trip travel times between an origin and a destination pair are still evolving and limited, especially in the context of probability distribution estimation. This paper proposes a generalized Markov chain approach for estimating the probability distribution of trip travel times from link travel time distributions and takes into consideration correlations in time and space. The proposed approach consists of three major components, namely state definition, transition probabilities estimation and probability distribution estimation. A heuristic clustering method, based on Gaussian mixture models, has been developed to cluster link travel time observations with regard to their homogeneity and underlying traffic conditions. A transition probability estimation model is developed as a function of link characteristics and <b>trip</b> <b>conditions</b> using a logit model. By applying a Markov chain procedure, the probability distribution of trip travel times is estimated as the combination of Markov path travel time distributions weighted by their corresponding occurrence probabilities. The link travel time distribution is conditioned on the traffic conditions of the current link that can be estimated from historical observations. A moment generating function based algorithm is used to approximate the Markov path travel time distribution as the sum of correlated link travel time distributions conditional on traffic conditions. The proposed approach is applied in a transit case study using automatic vehicle location data. The results indicate that the method is effective and efficient, especially when correlations and multimodal distributions exist...|$|E

To make the load handling capabilities of security monitoring and inspection systems more scalable, security can be increased by reducing the variability of transportation routes to a finite set of authorized routes between trip origin and destination locations. Then trip anomalies, which are unexpected trip variations, {{can be used in}} inspection targeting criteria. In addition, the effectiveness of the inspection sampling rate can be increased by always inspecting trips with unjustifiable anomalies and fulfilling the remainder of the sampling rate with other trips. While some anomalies can be automatically detected by vehicle tracking systems, other anomalies can be detected by inspectors based on information provided by drivers. This creates a need for an independent objective verification {{of the quality of the}} information provided by the driver, as this information can be used to detect transportation anomalies and, in some cases, justify the anomalies to avoid costly inspections. This thesis proposes the use of a geographic awareness modeling (GAM) system to determine whether route-following anomalies of monitored vehicles can be justified by driver detection of adverse road conditions. While current GIS applications provide geographically accurate representations of a road network, they do not provide mechanisms or information to corroborate or contradict scenarios describing <b>trip</b> <b>conditions</b> along a given route. This thesis also presents a design and one implementation of a GAM system which can provide independent, reliable verification of route-related information provided by vehicle drivers. A benefit of implementing such a system would be to complement the expertise and the experience of inspectors to increase the effectiveness of inspection targeting policies and sampling rates. ...|$|E

This all leads to an economic loss. This is why the virus detection and the carriers, or Persistently Infected (PI) animals, eradication are important. If the virus presence was previously suspected in Bolivia, since 2009 it is certain that there is BVDV infection and the prevalence is high in comparison with others areas. Furthermore, this virus can also infect « New Worlds camelids » which are the alpacas, lamas, vicunas and guanacos species living in South-America. The aim {{of this study was to}} implement a BVDV detection method for the Foundation of Andeans Productions Promotion PROINPA in Bolivia. This objective was first met by a prevalence evaluation of the virus using ELISA anti-antibodies analysis. Then, a screening of the tested herds containing animals with a positive serology was done by real-time PCR and finally the PI animals were detected by individual real-time PCR analysis or by two ELISA anti-antigens analysis’s in a 3 week's interval. There was no problem from an infrastructure viewpoint; the laboratories have all the necessary material and equipment and the labor was qualified for both analyses. But the logistic part was more difficult, because the molecular kit has to be preserved at minus twenty degrees. And this kit took 10 days to arrive from Belgium. Because none of the molecular analysis’s succeeded, we concluded that the kit had been damaged during the travel and had been degraded. The kit conservation conditions seemed to be a problem and that is why the elaboration of a new lyophilized kit was tried in Belgium. The lyophilisation of the BVDV sequences, the IPC and EPC was easy but wasn’t possible for the Master MIX (containing the Taq Polymerase (Taq)) and the Reverse Transcriptase (RT). The « Illustra Ready-To-GoTM RT-PCR Beads », from GE Healthcare, are beads made of Taq and RT that can be stored at room temperature. The combination of a lyophilized part of the LSI kit (BVDV sequences, EPC and IPC) with those beads will lead to a molecular BVDV detection kit that can be stored at room temperature. However, this combination doesn’t seem to work. This can be due to a lot of different things like the incompatibility between the primers size and design and the Taq, the temperature activities of the Taq and the RT, the salt concentration, etc. In conclusion, different experiments are required to finalize a qPCR kit resistant to long <b>trip</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|E

Nowadays the loads {{supplied by the}} power systems migrate towards exhibiting significant strong nonlinear behavior accompanied by inrush currents or high-order harmonics that can cause a false tripping of circuit breakers.
