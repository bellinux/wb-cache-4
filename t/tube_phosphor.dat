Their low-efficiency phosphors (notably in the Red) were weak and long-persistent, leaving trails after moving objects. Starting in the late 1950s, picture <b>tube</b> <b>phosphors</b> would sacrifice saturation for increased brightness; this deviation from the standard at both the receiver and broadcaster {{was the source of}} considerable color variation.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Spent {{fluorescent}} lamps, {{classified as}} hazardous {{waste in the}} EU, are segregated at source. Processes for the recovery of critical rare-earth (RE) elements from the phosphor powder waste, however, often involve use of aggressive acid or alkali digestion, multi-stage separation procedures, and production of large aqueous waste streams which require further treatment. RESULTS To overcome these difficulties phosphor powder pre-treated with dilute HCl was leached with a 1 : 1 wt. [Hmim][HSO 4]:H 2 O solution at a solid:liquid ratio of 5 %, at 80 [*]°C for 4 [*]h with stirring at 300 [*]rpm to recover 91. 6 [*]wt% of the Y and 97. 7 [*]wt% of the Eu present. The yttrium-europium oxide (YOX), (Y 0. 95 Eu 0. 05) 2 O 3, recovered by precipitating the dissolved RE elements from the leach solution with oxalic acid and converting the oxalate to an oxide phase by heating, was characterised by FTIR, XRD and luminescence analysis. The analyses suggest the recovered oxide {{has the potential to}} be directly reused as YOX phosphor. Regeneration and reuse of the ionic liquid is achieved with only minor leaching efficiency losses found over four leaching/recovery cycles. CONCLUSION The recovery of yttrium europium oxide from waste fluorescent <b>tube</b> <b>phosphor</b> by a simple efficient low cost ionic liquid process has been developed...|$|E
50|$|Some Williams tubes {{were made}} from radar-type cathode ray <b>tubes</b> with a <b>phosphor</b> coating that made the data visible, while other tubes were {{purpose-built}} without such a coating. The {{presence or absence of}} this coating had no effect on the operation of the tube, and was of no importance to the operators since the face of the tube was covered by the pickup plate. If a visible output was needed, a second tube connected in parallel with the storage <b>tube,</b> with a <b>phosphor</b> coating but without a pickup plate, was used as a display device.|$|R

50|$|Synthetic fluorapatite doped with manganese-II and antimony-V {{formed the}} basis for the second {{generation}} of fluorescent <b>tube</b> <b>phosphors</b> referred to as halophosphors. When irradiated with 253.7 nm mercury resonance radiation they fluoresced with broad emission which appeared within the range of acceptable whites. The antimony-V acted as the primary activator and produced a broad blue emission. Addition of manganese-II produced a second broad peak to appear at the red end of the emission spectrum {{at the expense of the}} antimony peak, excitation energy being transferred from the antimony to the manganese by a non radiative process and making the emitted light appear less blue and more pink. Replacement of some of the fluoride ions with chloride ions in the lattice caused a general shift of the emission bands to the longer wavelength red end of the spectrum. These alterations allowed phosphors for Warm White, White and Daylight tubes, (with corrected color temperatures of 2900, 4100 and 6500 K respectively), to be made. The amounts of the manganese and antimony activators vary between 0.05 and 0.5 mole percent.The reaction used to create halophosphor is shown below. The antimony and manganese must be incorporated in the correct trace amounts if the product is to be fluorescent.|$|R

50|$|Unlike modern full-dome systems, {{which use}} LCD, DLP, SXRD or Laser {{projection}} technology, {{the heart of}} the Digistar II is a large cathode ray <b>tube.</b> A <b>phosphor</b> plate is mounted atop the tube, and light is then dispersed by a large lens to cover the planetarium dome. The use of a CRT means the Digistar II has a darker black-level than full-dome projectors, but, as it is only one tube, the D2 is monochromatic. The Digistar II projects a bright, phosphorescent green—though many (including both visitors and planetarians) report they cannot distinguish between this green and white.|$|R

50|$|Other Image Converter tube based systems {{emerged in}} the 1950s which {{incorporated}} a modified GenI image intensifier with additional deflector plates which allowed a photon image to be converted to a photoelectron beam. The image, while in this photoelectron state, could be shuttered on and off as short as a few nanoseconds, and deflected to {{different areas of the}} large 70 and 90 mm diameter phosphor screens to produce sequences of up to 20+ frames. In the early 1970s these camera attained speeds up to 600 million frame/s, with 1 ns exposure times, with up to 15 frames per event. As they were analog devices there were no digital limitations on data rates and pixel transfer rates. However, image resolution was quite limited, due to the inherent repulsion of electrons and the grain of the phosphor screen. Resolutions of 10 lp/mm were typical. Also, the images were inherently monochrome, as wavelength information is lost in the photon-electron-photon conversion process. There was also a fairly steep trade-off between resolution and number of images. All images needed to fall on the output phosphor screen. Therefore, a four image sequence would mean each image occupies one fourth of the screen; a nine image sequence has each image occupying one ninth, etc. Images were projected and held on the <b>tube's</b> <b>phosphor</b> screen for several milliseconds, long enough to be optically, and later fiber optically, coupled to film for image capture. Cameras of this design were made by Hadland Photonics Limited and Cordin Company. This technology remained state of the art until the mid-1990s when the availability of CCD image capture enabled instant results in digital format.|$|R

Phosphors activated with Sn 2 + or Pb 2 + {{were found to}} cathodoluminesce in the red spectral region and exhibit relative efficiencies (~c ~ Rel.) of 1. 1 and 4. 6 %, respectively. The Pb 2 + phosphor has a short fluores-cent decay time (Io/ 100 ~ 10 - 6 sec) and was found suitable for use as the red screen component in a flying spot scanner tube (FSST) employed as the transducer in color video playback. Coactivation of SrGa 2 S 4 by Ce z + and Pb 2 e was found {{to result in a}} white-emitt ing phosphor that exhibits lower noise in FSST screens than is usually found when phosphor blends are employed. The cathodoluminescence emission and decay prop-erties of the Ce 8 + activated alkaline earth thiogallates were reported earlier (1) with part icular emphasis on factors governing the use of these materials in flying spot cathode-ray <b>tubes.</b> <b>Phosphors</b> activated with ions possessing the ns 2 electronic onfiguration (T 11 +, Sn 2 +, Pb 2 +, Sb 3 +, Bi 3 +) are also of interest for use in this type of device because their fluorescence lifetime should be very short. As a consequence, these ions were also evaluated as activators in the SrGa 2 S 4 host lattice, and this paper describes the cathodolumines-cence emission and decay characteristics of the Pb 2 + and Sn 2 + activated, and Ce 3 +-Pb 2 + coactivated SrGa 2 S 4 phosphors and discusses their application in flying spot scanner tubes (FSST) designed for use in color video playback systems.

40|$|The {{advances}} in high-voltage switching developed {{in this project}} allow a camera user to rapidly vary the number of output frames from 1 to 25. A high-voltage, variable-amplitude pulse train shifts the deflection location to the new frame location during the interlude between frames, making multiple frame counts and locations possible. The final deflection circuit deflects to five different frame positions per axis, including the center position, making {{for a total of}} 25 frames. To create the preset voltages, electronically adjustable {+-} 500 V power supplies were chosen. Digital-to-analog converters provide digital control of the supplies. The power supplies are clamped to {+-} 400 V so as not to exceed the voltage ratings of the transistors. A field-programmable gated array (FPGA) receives the trigger signal and calculates the combination of plate voltages for each frame. The interframe time and number of frames are specified by the user, but are limited by the camera electronics. The variable-frame circuit shifts the plate voltages of the first frame to those of the second frame during the user-specified interframe time. Designed around an electrostatic image tube, a framing camera images the light present during each frame (at the photocathode) onto the <b>tube’s</b> <b>phosphor.</b> The phosphor persistence allows the camera to display multiple frames on the phosphor at one time. During this persistence, a CCD camera is triggered and the analog image is collected digitally. The tube functions by converting photons to electrons at the negatively charged photocathode. The electrons move quickly toward the more positive charge of the phosphor. Two sets of deflection plates skew the electron’s path in horizontal and vertical (x axis and y axis, respectively) directions. Hence, each frame’s electrons bombard the phosphor surface at a controlled location defined by the voltages on the deflection plates. To prevent the phosphor from being exposed between frames, the image tube is gated off between exposures...|$|R

The projection cathode ray tubes can be arranged in various ways. One arrangement is to use one <b>tube</b> and three <b>phosphor</b> (red, green, blue) coatings.

With the possibility of replacing mercury gas in fluorescent <b>tubes</b> novel <b>phosphors</b> are necessary with increased efficiency. In this thesis the luminescence and quantum cutting of NaLaF 4 :Pr 3 + is investigated. NaLaF 4 :Pr 3 + samples with varying concentrations of Pr 3 + were studied.

The resulting lifetimes were used to discover {{the influence of the}} different non-radiative decay processes and the influence of temperature and concentration on those processes. The main processes of non-radiative decay are energy migration and cross-relaxation. It was concluded that at low concentrations NaLaF¬ 4 :Pr 3 + is an efficient quantum cutter. At higher concentrations the influence of concentration quenching lowers the efficiency significantly. It was also concluded that the influence of temperature was insignificant for low concentration samples.

50|$|Enough {{of the air}} {{has been}} removed from the tube that most of the {{electrons}} can travel the length of the tube without striking a gas molecule. The high voltage accelerates these low-mass particles to a high velocity (about 37,000 miles per second, or 59,000 km/s, about 20 percent of the speed of light, for a typical tube voltage of 10 kV). When they get to the anode end of the tube, they have so much momentum that, although they are attracted to the anode, many fly past it and strike the end wall of the tube. When they strike atoms in the glass, they knock their orbital electrons into a higher energy level. When the electrons fall back to their original energy level, they emit light. This process, called fluorescence, causes the glass to glow, usually yellow-green. The electrons themselves are invisible, but the glow reveals where the beam of electrons strikes the glass. Later on, researchers painted the inside back wall of the <b>tube</b> with a <b>phosphor,</b> a fluorescent chemical such as zinc sulfide, {{in order to make the}} glow more visible.

During sunlit atmospheric conditions, ICON FUV images the limb altitude profile in the shortwave (SW) band at 135. 6 nm and the longwave (LW) band at 157 nm perpendicular to the satellite motion to retrieve the atmospheric O/N 2 ratio. In conditions of atmospheric darkness, ICON FUV measures the 135. 6 nm recombination emission of O+ ions used to compute the nighttime ionospheric altitude distribution. ICON Far Ultra- Violet (FUV) imager is a Czerny–Turner design Spectrographic Imager with two exit slits and corresponding back imager cameras that produce two independent images in separate wavelength bands on two detectors. All observations will be processed as limb altitude profiles. In addition, the ionospheric 135. 6 nm data will be processed as longitude and latitude spatial maps to obtain images of ion distributions around regions of equatorial spread F. The ICON FUV optic axis is pointed 20 degrees below local horizontal and has a steering mirror that allows {{the field of view}} to be steered up to 30 degrees forward and aft, to keep the local magnetic meridian in the field of view. The detectors are micro channel plate (MCP) intensified FUV <b>tubes</b> with the <b>phosphor</b> fiber-optically coupled to Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs). The dual stack MCP-s amplify the photoelectron signals to overcome the CCD noise and the rapidly scanned frames are co-added to digitally create 12 -second integrated images.
