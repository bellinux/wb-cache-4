25|$|In June 2002, Norwegian Air Shuttle {{stated that}} they would start flights from Rygge, should the airport be built. At the same time, the {{military}} and the airport company were discussing where the optimal location for the <b>terminal</b> <b>should</b> be. Once decided, the Rygge Sivile Lufthavn hoped to send an application for a concession to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. In March 2003, Rygge Labour Party stated they were opposed to the civilian airport, because of the local noise concerns. In May, the airport company confirmed that Ryanair, which was using Torp, had shown interest in using Rygge. In June, the Rygge Sivile Lufthavn stated that had changed their strategy, and that they now were going to primarily target low-cost airlines. The airport hoped to initially establish routes to Copenhagen, Stockholm, London and Amsterdam, and that international destinations would be prioritized before domestic destinations. In February 2004, the Civil Aviation Authority stated that 51 issues needed to be resolved before civilian traffic would be permitted.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{downlink}} throughput improvement for IEEE 802. 11 a/g systems by using a modified access point (AP) equipped with multiple antennas.

In this paper we concentrate on channel estimation over acknowledgement (ACK) bursts and effect of imperfections such as non-ideal channel reciprocity and delayed channel estimates. Simulations based on channel models approved by the IEEE 802. 11 Standard Group demonstrate that a near doubling of downlink capacity can be achieved in a conference room environment in the case of low levels of channel reciprocity errors at the AP. 1...|$|R

40|$|In a {{manipulative}} experiment {{the following}} {{predictions about the}} relationship between fruit mass, pappus area, and terminal velocity in the fruits of Tragopogon dubious (L.) were tested: (1) <b>terminal</b> velocity <b>should</b> be proportional to the square root of disk loading (disk loading = mass/area), (2) when pappus area is held constant, <b>terminal</b> velocity <b>should</b> be proportional to the square root of the mass and (3) when fruit mass is held constant, <b>terminal</b> velocity <b>should</b> be inversely proportional to the square root of pappus area. Although qualitative support was found for each prediction, terminal velocity declined more slowly than predicted with increasing pappus area and increased more quickly than expected when mass was increased. When disk loading was held constant, fruits with larger pappuses fell more quickly than fruits with smaller pappuses. These results suggest that the area of the pappus is not a good estimator of its ability to produce drag (its effective area) for two reasons: (1) because the radial morphology of the pappus causes the density of drag producing cross hairs to decrease {{along the length of the}} pappus ray and (2) because the projected area of the pappus may change if the pappus is bent upwards by the drag force acting on it. Thus, increasing parental investment in pappuses does not decrease terminal velocity as quickly as expected...|$|R
