5|$|This strong odour can be {{detected}} {{half a mile away}} by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> under the parent plant, others swallow <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> being dispersed as a result. The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.|$|E

5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to <b>the</b> <b>seed,</b> having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to <b>the</b> <b>seed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Magi sacrifices {{herself to}} give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to {{remember}} everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus {{the source of his}} power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta seemingly sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree. Pips {{and the rest of the}} fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> that Crysta fed him to start growing wildly. Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember everything that has transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. <b>The</b> <b>seed</b> sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.|$|E

5|$|Mid-year of 1967, Imelda started <b>the</b> <b>Seed</b> Disposal Program or Share for Progress, {{a project}} that {{suggested}} making vegetable gardens out of idle lots all over the country. 309,392 kits containing seeds were distributed in over 1,500 towns by 1968.|$|E
5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow {{them so they}} pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings {{well away from the}} parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E
5|$|Parasitoids {{have been}} found to parasitize B. rufimanus eggs: Chremylus rubiginosus and Triaspis thoracicus (family: Braconidae), and Dinarmus acutus (family: Pteromalidae). Their larvae develop into B. rufimanus larvae and adults emerge from <b>the</b> <b>seed,</b> leaving a small {{emergence}} hole in <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> (smaller than for B. rufimanus). Generalist predators on faba bean leaves such as spiders might feed on B. rufimanus eggs and contribute to their biological control although no data was found on their potential impact on the population size or growth.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>seeds</b> are achenes with {{bristles}} {{at their}} tips (cypselae). Like {{the hairs on}} dandelion <b>seeds,</b> <b>the</b> bristles allow <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> to be spread by the wind.|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{temperature}} for germination of Ziziphus mucronata subsp. mucronata Willd. is 27 °C in both light and dark. <b>The</b> <b>seeds</b> are typically light neutral in their germination response. No embryo dormancy {{is present in}} <b>the</b> <b>seeds.</b> Germination is completely inhibited while <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> are still enclosed in the fruits. Apparently the pericarp contains no germination inhibitors nor does it restrict water movement to <b>the</b> <b>seeds.</b> <b>The</b> inhibitory effect of the pericarp is most probably due to restriction of oxygen supply to <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> and/or mechanical resistance to embryo growth. <b>The</b> <b>seeds</b> are not very sensitive to water stress and can resist prolonged periods of soaking without showing any signs of soaking injury. This characteristic is probably an adaptation for survival during seed dispersal along drainage lines after flash floods...|$|R

5|$|Severe C. maculatus, infestations {{can affect}} 100% of the stored peas and cause up to 60% grain loss {{within a few}} months. The weevil {{generally}} enters the cowpea pod through holes pre-harvest and lays eggs on the dry seed. The larvae burrow their way into <b>the</b> <b>seed,</b> feeding on the endosperm. The weevil develops into a sexually mature adult within <b>the</b> <b>seed.</b> An individual bruchid will lay 20–40 eggs, and in optimal conditions each egg can develop into a reproductively active adult in 3 weeks. The most common methods of protection involve the use of insecticides, the main pesticides used being carbomates, synthetic pyrethoids and organophosphates.|$|E

5|$|The Guimarota {{locality}} {{is located}} in the eastern Lusitanian Basin, {{which is part of the}} Iberian Meseta. The vertebrate-bearing Guimarota-strata was deposited in a brackish lagoon that periodically received both freshwater and saltwater influxes. Ecologically, the environment would have been akin to a modern mangrove swamp. Plants known from megafossils include the horsetails Equisetum and Schizoneura; <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> fern Caytonia; the cycad Otozamites; the araucaria Brachyphyllum; Ginkgo; and the charophyte algae Porochara. Additionally, plant families known only from pollen include lycopods, forked ferns, possible scaly tree ferns (which may be matoniaceans or dicksoniaceans instead), royal ferns, <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> fern Sphenopteris, cypresses, and pines. Most of the preserved organisms probably originated from around the swamp, although there may have been minimal transportation by water currents.|$|E
