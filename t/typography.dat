He also worked as assistant editor on University of Liverpool's charity magazine, Pantosphinx, and on a music newsletter for Frank Hessy's musical instruments store called Frank Comments.

The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz.

They felt that similarities to the design of the first album, including Meat Loaf's name in Gothic <b>typography,</b> would entice consumers of the 1977 album to purchase this.The section from this episode about the marketing of Bat Out of Hell II, and the filming of this music video, has been reshown as part of BBC Learning Zone's media studies strand.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the concept of {{criminal}} profiling in terms of serial killers in the United States. The research provided in this paper was found using the most recent research available on the topic. The FBI’s Behavioral Unit, or National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC), is the current leading law enforcement agency that investigates these types of crimes. They utilize definitions, <b>typographies,</b> and motives to create a criminal profile to investigate serial killings. Ultimately, these profiles are inadequate because they are inconclusive and exclude multiple suspects that are potentially dangerous. Therefore, criminal profiling should be merely utilized as an investigative tool, rather than a prosecutorial tool. Ultimately, the F. B. I. ’s NCAVC must create a universal definition, as well as a more detailed list of <b>typographies</b> to help law enforcement more accurately identify and investigate serial killers...|$|R

40|$|In his posthumous Écrits sur l’art, French philosopher Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe {{considers}} his numerous {{experiences with}} artists and their works as {{different ways of}} putting himself to the ‘test of art’. This consists in pitting the main tenets of his philosophical works (<b>Typographies,</b> vol. I: Le Sujet de la philosophie, and <b>Typographies,</b> vol. II: L’Imitation des modernes) against his lived encounters with works and artists, while taking account of the particular complex of problems that confront art {{in the twentieth century}} following its two crises of authority, that of God and of Man. The central question that drives his Écrits sur l’art is ‘How can art identify itself?’ Lacoue-Labarthe asks us to take particular note of its reflexive formulation: when art becomes a self-constituting force, how can it be anything other than a form of survival? To support his position, Lacoue-Labarthe revisits several concepts he developed in his philosophical works: art as the site of a retreat, the hyperbological nature of art, the disaster of the subject and the concept of the figure.

Accented words were presented both in lower-case letters with written accents and upper-case letters with no written accents, two usual <b>typographies</b> in French. This procedure addressed the stimulus-matching problem by using intraword comparisons as some words have different orthographic neighbourhoods in the two cases. Neighbourhood frequency was varied across case change for half of the words while it was held constant for the other half. The results showed an interaction between letter-case and neighbourhood constancy, so the inhibitory neighbourhood frequency effect could not be attributed to interstimulus comparisons or to typographical change. Implications are discussed in current models of visual word recognition...|$|R
