5|$|On {{some of the}} figures, however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation {{for this is that}} over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. <b>Things</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E

Sober again, they leave Pamplona; Bill returns to Paris, Mike stays in Bayonne, and Jake goes to San Sebastián on the northern coast of Spain. As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives a telegram from Brett asking for help; she had gone to Madrid with Romero. He finds her there in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> have been.|$|E
25|$|Argus Filch is the {{caretaker}} of Hogwarts. While {{he is not}} an evil character, he is ill-tempered, which makes him unpopular with the student body, and occasionally with other staff. His knowledge of the secrets and short-cuts of the castle is almost unparalleled, except perhaps by the Weasley twins, Voldemort himself, Harry, Ron and Hermione, and other users of the Marauder's Map. He tends to favour almost sadistically harsh punishments, leading to his alliance with Umbridge. He has an obsessive dislike of mud, animate toys, and all other <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> interfere with his creation of an immaculately clean and orderly Hogwarts. He is also portrayed as having a constant antagonism towards Peeves the poltergeist and often tells Dumbledore that Peeves should be thrown out of Hogwarts. He also likes to wander Hogwarts corridors at night, presumably in the hope of catching a student out of bed.|$|E

[...] A dictionary definition referring to fantasy literature is [...] "fiction characterized by highly fanciful or supernatural elements." [...] Examples of fantasy supernaturalism include magic (spells, harm to opponents), magical places (Narnia, Oz, Middle Earth, Hogwarts), supernatural creatures (witches, vampires, orcs, trolls), supernatural transportation (flying broomsticks, ruby slippers, windows between worlds), and shapeshifting (beast into man, man into wolf or bear, lion into sheep). Such things are basic themes in fantasy.|$|E

2500|$|The headdresses worn by {{the women}} {{are perhaps the most}} {{spectacular}} and elaborate items of Akha dress. Akha women define their age or marital status with the style of headdress worn. At roughly age 12, the Akha female exchanges her child's cap for that of a girl. A few years later she will begin to don the jejaw, the beaded sash that hangs down the front of her skirt and keeps it from flying up in the breeze. During mid-adolescence she will start wearing the adult woman's headdress. Headdresses are decorated by their owner and each is unique.

2500|$|Properly speaking, Georgian {{does not}} {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives; rather, it distinguishes modifiers from modified by relative {{position in the}} nominal clause. [...] As a result of this, <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> sound like adjectives can have substantive force in Georgian: [...] one could say mindoda lurji ts'igni ("I would like the blue book") or just mindoda lurji ("I would like the blue one"). [...] The declension of these adjective-like modifiers {{is different from that}} of nouns, but like that of nouns, it depends on whether the root of the adjective ends with a consonant or a vowel: a vowel-final-stem adjective is identical in all cases, while a consonant-final-stem adjective changes from case to case. (Put another way, one might say that vowel-final-stem adjectives do not actually decline for case.) The following table presents declensions of the adjectives did- ("big") and ch'aghara- ("grey-haired" [...] actually used for people) with the noun datv- ("bear").|$|E

2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're very careful not to say <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted.
