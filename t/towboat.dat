5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} at New Orleans on 6 July, Chickasaw was decommissioned. She {{temporarily}} bore the name Samson between 15 June and 10 August 1869 before resuming her original name. She was sold on 12 September 1874 to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company who modified the ship into a coal barge {{with the name}} of Samson. The railroad converted the ship into a train ferry in 1880 and changed her to side-wheel propulsion under the name Gouldsboro. She was sold in the 1940s to the New Orleans Coal & Bisso <b>Towboat</b> Co. and converted into a work barge. It sank off the Greenville Bend of the Mississippi River in New Orleans sometime during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Despite limited {{information}} about its service routes and construction, the Nathan F. Cobb {{was the subject}} of two separate New York Times articles during its short career. One article reported the wreck the day after it occurred, the other article came from 20 June 1892 and chronicled a disturbance between mates. The Cobb was still in tow only three miles outside Mobile Bay, beginning its route from Mobile, Alabama to New York, when mate Henry Shaffer jumped over board to avoid a beating. Another mate, J. Trott had already used a belaying pin to half kill another seaman on the schooner and Shaffer was fearful for his life. Shaffer began swimming towards a nearby light house and was picked up nearly five miles from where he jumped over board. The captain of the <b>towboat</b> reported that Captain Cookson of the Cobb, mentioned incidentally they had lost a crewman. Both Cookson and Trott already had pending charges against them for cruelty and marooning of sailors, stemming from an incident in May 1891 at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana.|$|E

50|$|Competition skiing uses {{specifically}} designed <b>towboats.</b> Most <b>towboats</b> {{have a very}} small hull and a flat bottom to minimize wake. A true tournament ski boat will have a direct drive motor shaft that centers the weight in the boat for an optimal wake shape. However, some recreational ski boats will have the motor placed {{in the back of}} the boat (v-drive), which creates a bigger wake. Permitted <b>towboats</b> used for tournament water skiing are the Mastercraft ProStar 197, MasterCraft ProStar 190, Nautique 200, Malibu Response TXi, and Centurion Carbon Pro. These boats have ability to pull skiers for trick skiing, jumping, and slalom.|$|R

25|$|In 1824, the Allaire Works {{built the}} engine for , the first {{steamship}} {{in the world}} fitted with a compound engine. The high-pressure cylinder was 12inches in diameter and the low-pressure cylinder 24inches, with both having a stroke of 4 feet. In the same year, the Allaire Works also supplied a compound engine for a 200-ton <b>towboat</b> called Post Boy, and another for a small steamer, Linnaeus.|$|E
25|$|At {{considerable}} risk, this steamer {{was taken}} {{down through the}} first set of rapids in 1881, and the second set in 1890. Thereafter the first Harvest Queen was worked primarily between Astoria and Portland, Oregon until 1900, when it was dismantled. Most of the machinery was installed in a new, slightly smaller vessel, also called the Harvest Queen, which, although it had accommodations for passengers, was primarily worked as a <b>towboat.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1825, the Mowatts {{decided to}} try using the boat to tow barges. Since no {{steamboat}} had previously been utilized in such a role, the proposal was widely greeted with scepticism, but in the first attempt, Henry Eckford pulled two barges from New York to Albany in 24 hours, a commercially viable time. The principle having been established, other steamboat owners quickly followed suit, and steam towboats soon became a commonplace. Henry Eckford herself would thereafter spend much of {{her career as a}} <b>towboat.</b> However, she also continued to carry passengers, and in 1826 the steamer's cabin was converted to passenger accommodation. By this time, the fare from New York to Albany had dropped to a dollar.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans {{began as}} a strategically-located trading entrep√¥t, and it remains, above all, a crucial {{transportation}} hub and distribution center for waterborne commerce. The Port is the fifth-largest in the United States based on cargo volume and second-largest in the state after the Port of South Louisiana. It is the twelfth-largest in the U.S. based on cargo value. The Port of South Louisiana, also located in the New Orleans area, is the world's busiest in terms of bulk tonnage. When combined with Port of New Orleans, it forms the 4th-largest port system in volume. Many shipbuilding, shipping, logistics, freight forwarding and commodity brokerage firms either are based in metropolitan New Orleans or maintain a local presence. Examples include Intermarine, Bisso <b>Towboat,</b> Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Trinity Yachts, Expeditors International, Bollinger Shipyards, IMTT, International Coffee Corp, Boasso America, Transoceanic Shipping, Transportation Consultants Inc., Dupuy Storage & Forwarding and Silocaf.

The Blakeson, a <b>towboat</b> owned by Blakeny and Sons, offered [...] "moonlight cruises" [...] in the early 1930s for 50cents (approximately $6.50 in 2010 values). The service was popular until the <b>towboat</b> capsized in front of embarking passengers, causing them to lose interest. During their Environmental Impact Assessment in September 2005, AMEC cited recreational fishing and birdwatching as major pre-causeway activities. A fishery for Atlantic salmon existed downstream from the causeway for several years post-1968. The Moncton Naturalists' Club also publishes their Birding in the Moncton Area, a birdwatching guide covering sites from Sackville to Mary's Point. Other activities downstream from the causeway include boating, canoeing, kayaking, seal and harbour-porpoise viewing, and tour boating.
