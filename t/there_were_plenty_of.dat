5|$|On 14 May 1940, Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden {{announced}} {{the creation of}} the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV)—later to become known as the Home Guard. Far more men volunteered than the government expected {{and by the end of}} June, there were nearly 1.5million volunteers. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> personnel for the defence of the country, but there were no uniforms (a simple armband had to suffice) and equipment was in critically short supply. At first, the Home Guard was armed with guns in private ownership, a knife or bayonet on a pole, Molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} , the author Charles Mann, cites sources that {{speculate}} that the reason African slaves {{were brought to the}} British Americas was because of their immunity to malaria. Britain did not have large number of African slaves, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> unemployed workers who could come as indentured servants. In the area above the Mason–Dixon line, the malaria protozoa did not fare well, the English-speaking indentured servant proved more profitable as he would work toward his freedom and hence worked with less supervision and coercion. As malaria spread, places such as the tidewater of Virginia and South Carolina which had previously been habitable by white people became endemic with malaria. Small white landholders were at a disadvantage to plantation owners, as they risk complete economic ruin when they were sick, while plantation owners relied on more malaria resistant West African slaves. Malaria caused huge losses to British forces in the South during the revolutionary war as well as to Union forces during the Civil War. Malaria also helped weaken the Native American population and make them more susceptible to other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as {{they thought it was}} so easy. It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as by the time the bug was discovered, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E

25|$|Cullmann {{spent the}} {{following}} years recruiting immigrants to settle his lands, beginning with the first 13 families he established the town of Cullmann with in 1873. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> interested immigrants from the same region as Cullmann, as the events that had precipitated his leaving his homeland had likewise encouraged thousands of his countrymen to seek a new home as well. His leadership brought nearly a thousand new settlers to the area within a few years, something many locals weren't happy with. In one notable instance, a local man stabbed Cullmann in the head during an assassination attempt, an attack he survived but which left a lifelong scar. However, over the next twenty years, {{he was able to}} build and incorporate the town of Cullman, Cullman County, and to re-establish himself as a wealthy businessman. He died on December 3, 1895 of pneumonia, leaving behind a small enclave of German settlers {{in the middle of the}} American south.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{were able}} to buy a small range of {{provisions}} from their captors at Japanese prices, which escalated as the war went on. Black marketeering was sometimes tolerated by the guards, as they themselves were involved in the buying or exchanging of goods, and at other times punished severely. Although {{contact with the outside world}} was forbidden, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> opportunities to communicate with the locals. Firewood-gathering gangs in the jungle {{were able to}} make contact and arrange purchases when the guards were not paying attention; at other times these transactions were permitted with the permission of and in the presence of a lenient Japanese guard. Gold, in the form of rings and jewellery, and British pounds were in demand by the Japanese guards. Such was the desperation of the prisoners towards the end of their internment that two soldiers disinterred a recently buried body in order to retrieve the dead man's wedding ring.|$|E

25|$|As the {{popularity}} of the motorcar increased, train services were severely cut back {{due to the lack of}} patronage, and the number of services passing through Tunbridge Wells West declined as one line after another was closed from the 1950s onwards. First, the East Grinstead to Lewes line closed in 1958, then the Cuckoo Line in 1965, the Three Bridges to Groombridge in 1967, and finally the Wealden Line in 1969. Tunbridge Wells West was itself listed for closure in 1966, only to be subsequently reprieved. The line to Tunbridge Wells West remained open, although in its latter years passenger services were mainly confined to a shuttle service between Tonbridge (via the single line connection to Tunbridge Wells Central - now plain Tunbridge Wells) and Eridge with a few through trains to Uckfield; however there was a depot at the station which housed rolling stock for services on the Uckfield and East Grinstead - London (via East Croydon) lines, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> empty stock moves early and late in the day.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{continue}} {{to debate the}} effect of the Crusaders on Byzantium. The First Crusade saw Byzantium make substantial gains in territory although this may have been achieved by the Byzantines themselves; <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> civil conflicts in Asia Minor and amongst the Turks for Alexius to exploit. Furthermore, every other Crusade after the First had a detrimental effect on the Empire with Crusader armies unable to resist raiding towns which were supposed to be their allies but in Byzantine territory there were quarrels over supplies and a few incidents of fighting. Once again, the westerners had created an unfavorable impression of themselves, and once again the Greeks had made themselves seem untrustworthy. At Constantinople, there were further incidents, even to the point that Conrad III threatened to return from the crusade and take the city by force. The Second Crusade saw increased unity amongst the Islamic World, with Zengids able to bring Damascus into the fold and soon after much of Syria became a united front against the Crusades and a threat to Byzantine interests there. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I even threatened an assault on Constantinople in the Third Crusade and the Fourth Crusade saw the sack of Constantinople and substantial loss of territory by the Byzantines to the Frankish Crusaders and the Seljuq Turks.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

Four-engined land planes being unavailable for over-water operations to international destinations, thus/therefore flying boats became part of the solution. At {{the far end of the}} longest international route (which became the Kangaroo Route), on-water landing areas were found in places such as Surabaya and in the open sea off Kupang.

500|$|With {{temperatures}} reaching 122° on {{the artificial}} turf at Texas Stadium, the Giants played the Dallas Cowboys on September 16. The Giants dominated {{from the outset}} and used backup players heavily throughout the game. Lawrence Taylor batted a Troy Aikman pass high into the air, which he caught and returned for a touchdown. The Giants' defense held the Cowboys to 20 rushing yards and 156yards of total offense, while the Giants' offense gained 369 yards. The Cowboys totaled only nine first downs, averaged 1.8yards per rush and were dominated in time of possession, 41:40 to 18:20. Despite the 28–7 victory, Giants center Bart Oates still felt the offense could improve its play: [...] "e missed a lot of assignments.

500|$|By {{the time}} silver was {{eliminated}} from the half dollar, it {{had been out of}} circulation for so long that banks had eliminated the slot for the denomination from machines. The Mint anticipated a comeback for the denomination, but in July 1971, Mint Director Mary Brooks disclosed that the Treasury was holding 200million of the new base metal half dollars, as commercial banks expressed little interest in ordering them. [...] "I can't understand the population. [...] They're not using them." [...] According to Brooks, most of the over one billion Kennedy half dollars containing silver had been hoarded by the public. [...] Brooks theorized that because the silver Kennedy half dollar never circulated much and few half dollars were struck in 1970 in anticipation of the authorization to eliminate silver, the public had become accustomed to not seeing the half dollar in trade. [...] Brooks suggested, [...] "If the country knew <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> them around, they'd probably start hoarding them, too." ...|$|E

There, Mitchell often took part in plays, [...] "largely because you got to play cards backstage." [...] His roles mainly consisted of small minute-long parts, until he won the role of Rabbit in Winnie-the-Pooh.

[...] Mitchell had been [...] "obsessed" [...] with comedy writing since his school days, as he [...] "always felt that doing a joke was the cleverest thing", and [...] "would intrinsically prefer a parody of something to the actual thing itself".|$|E
500|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{descriptions}} in Chinese {{literature of}} {{the time on the}} operations and aspects of seaports, maritime merchant shipping, overseas trade, and the sailing ships themselves. In 1117, the author Zhu Yu wrote not only of the magnetic compass for navigation, but also a hundred-foot line with a hook that was cast over the deck of the ship, used to collect mud samples {{at the bottom of the}} sea in order for the crew to determine their whereabouts by the smell and appearance of the mud. In addition, Zhu Yu wrote of watertight bulkhead compartments in the hulls of ships to prevent sinking if damaged, the for-and-aft lug, taut mat sails, and the practice of beating-to-windward. Confirming Zhu Yu's writing on Song dynasty ships with bulkhead hull compartments, in 1973 a [...] long, [...] wide Song trade ship from c. 1277 was dredged from the water near the southern coast of China that contained 12 bulkhead compartment rooms in its hull. Maritime culture during the Song period was enhanced by these new technologies, along with the allowance of greater river and canal traffic. All around there was a bustling display of government run grain-tax transport ships, tribute vessels and barges, private shipping vessels, a multitude of busy fishers in small fishing boats, along with the rich enjoying the comforts of their luxurious private yachts.|$|E

Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau" [...] in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Sepinwall wrote that Michael's [...] "struggle to deal with the guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before."

[...] Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones commented that [...] " [...] suicidal plight was well conveyed and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> shocks and thrills along the way". Before the fourth season finale aired, Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen ranked Michael being unable to commit suicide as the thirteenth best moment of the season, but did add [...] "This story line didn't match the hype". Oscar Dahl from BuddyTV called Michael's death [...] "the culmination of a fairly lackluster story arc".|$|E
