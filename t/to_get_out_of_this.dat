500|$|Gilligan {{also came}} up with the idea to have a {{crossover}} with the show , which also takes place in Baltimore.

[...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode.

500|$|Late that night, on {{the night}} of 16 July, the family was awakened and told to come down to the lower level of the house because there was unrest in the town at large and they would have to be moved for their own safety.

The family paused and crossed themselves when they saw the stuffed mother bear and cubs that stood on the landing, perhaps as a sign of respect for the dead.

Alexandra, who had requested chairs for herself and Alexei, sat to her son's left. The Tsar stood behind Alexei, Dr. Botkin stood to the Tsar's right, Tatiana and her sisters stood behind Alexandra along with the servants. They were left for approximately half an hour while further preparations were made. The group said little during this time, but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English, violating the guard's rules that they must speak in Russian. Yurovsky came in, ordered them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Tatiana and her family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky's command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.|$|E

Kierkegaard wrote: [...] "In Fichte, subjectivity became free, infinite, negative.
