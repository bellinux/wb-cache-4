2500|$|On {{the cutting}} edge of {{research}} pertaining to motivation in the workplace is the integration of motivation and creativity. Essentially, according to Ambrose and Kulik, the same variables that predict intrinsic motivation are associated with creativity. This is a helpful conclusion in that organizations can measure and influence both creativity and motivation simultaneously. Further, allowing employees to choose creative and challenging jobs/tasks has been shown to improve motivation. In order <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>creativity,</b> setting [...] "creativity goals" [...] can positively influence the process, along with allowing more autonomy (i.e., giving employees freedom to feel/be creative). Other studies have found that team support may enable more creativity in a group setting, also increasing motivation.|$|E

At its core, the common attribute of Web 2.0 is to help navigate the vast information available on the Web in order to find what is being bought. It is the notion of a usable pathway. SCM 2.0 replicates this notion in supply chain operations. It is the pathway to SCM results, a combination of processes, methodologies, tools, and delivery options to guide companies to their results quickly as the complexity and speed of the supply chain increase due to global competition; rapid price fluctuations; changing oil prices; short product life cycles; expanded specialization; near-, far-, and off-shoring; and talent scarcity.|$|E

We explore the practical and pedagogic benefits of developing bespoke multimedia resources to teach practical skills, identifying common themes from these disparate discipline areas. Student focus groups revealed that, practically, the opportunity for repeated viewing at convenient times promoted less reliance on lecturers and better preparation prior to practical demonstrations. Pedagogically, time for reflection and sense making underpinned an increase in confidence which in turn led <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> <b>creativity.</b> The student voice was also used to identify recommendations and challenges driving future change...|$|R

While age diversity can lead <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> <b>creativity</b> and a greater richness of values and skills, it can also lead to value clashes, disrespect of each other's viewpoints, and increased conflict. As a result, nurses frequently experience stress, work–life imbalance, and a withdrawal from commitment. We propose the injection of positive diversity mindsets (age diversity appreciation) as one remedy. Specifically, we suggest that age diversity appreciation is positively related to nurses' well-being (stress and work–life balance), and also positively related to their team commitment. We further hypothesize that nurses' trust in co-workers mediates the hypothesized relationships. Our survey data of 138 nurses in a large hospital in Germany supported our hypotheses. We discuss both theoretical and managerial implications of our findings in the context of age diversity and nursing work outcomes in hospitals...|$|R

We obtained control measures of these values with a standard psychological test (NEO-FFI). As opposed to conventional personality tests, where people have to fill out lengthy questionnaires and surveys, our method offers an automated, and potentially more reliable way to assess these personality characteristics. Once these characteristics are considered, teams can be reshuffled and their membership changed for higher creativity...|$|E

To this end, imagery presenting green settings varying in unpredictability and spaciousness was displayed before and during a creative drawing task in a high school classroom. After completion participants additionally filled out a questionnaire comprising self-report measures for perceived creativity and positive affect. Both unpredictability and spaciousness enhanced creative performance, with images combining these two factors being particularly inspiring. Furthermore, spaciousness resulted in higher self-reported creativity. The effects of unpredictability and spaciousness on positive affect were not significant. These findings demonstrate that nature imagery has the potential <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>creativity</b> in individuals and warrant follow-up studies that may further clarify the role of spaciousness, unpredictability, and potentially other creativity-enhancing features of nature imager...|$|E
