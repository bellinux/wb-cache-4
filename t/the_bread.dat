Six types of yeast leavened breads were evaluated: control (100 % bread flour), flaxmeal (15 %) bread, and flaxmeal (15 %) bread that contained 0. 01 % respectively of BHA, BHT, BHA and BHT, and ascorbic acid.

40|$|Currently UK {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} intakes are below recommendations. Bread is a staple food consumed by ~ 95 % of adults in western countries. In addition, bread provides an ideal matrix by which functionality can be delivered to the consumer in an accepted food. Therefore, enriching bread with vegetables may be an effective strategy to increase vegetable consumption. This study evaluated consumer acceptance, purchase intent and intention of product replacement of bread enriched with red beetroot, carrot with coriander, red pepper with tomato or white beetroot (80 g vegetable per serving of 200 g) compared to white control bread (0 g vegetable). Consumers (n= 120) rated their liking of <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> overall, {{as well as their}} liking of appearance, flavour and texture using nine-point hedonic scales. Product replacement and purchase intent of <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> was rated using five-point scales. The effect of providing consumers with health information about <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> was also evaluated. There were significant differences in overall liking (P< 0. 0001), as well as liking of appearance (P< 0. 0001), flavour (P= 0. 0002) and texture (P= 0. 04), between <b>the</b> <b>breads.</b> However, <b>the</b> significant differences resulted from <b>the</b> red beetroot <b>bread</b> which was significantly (P< 0. 05) less liked compared to control bread.

40|$|White breads with Yudane dough (Yudane bread) {{were made}} from {{commercial}} hard flour by the no first fermentation method.

In <b>the</b> Yudane <b>bread</b> making method, an extended final proof, lower dough gas retention and gassing power, as well as specific loaf volume were observed compared to conventional bread making (control) without Yudane dough. Also, the moisture content of <b>the</b> Yudane <b>breads</b> increased with increasing water absorption for <b>bread</b> making. <b>The</b> total and reducing saccharide and maltose contents in the water-soluble fraction of Yudane bread also increased with the volume of added Yudane dough. <b>The</b> Yudane <b>breads</b> were very soft just after baking, and the staling (temporal changes in hardness) and starch retrogradation of <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> were somewhat reduced compared to the control. Further, <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> showed generally larger cohesiveness, i. e., <b>the</b> index of <b>bread</b> elasticity. Kinetic analysis indicated reduced bread staling and starch retrogradation rates compared to control. The data showed that the slow staling and unique texture of <b>the</b> Yudane <b>breads</b> were mainly due to the high moisture content, saccharide contents, and flour amylases-modification of swollen and gelatinized starch in <b>the</b> <b>breads,</b> which was related to the higher water absorption and starch swelling and gelatinization levels of the added Yudane dough.

5|$|Early Reformed theologians such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli {{rejected}} the medieval belief in transubstantiation, that <b>the</b> <b>bread</b> and wine of the Eucharist change into Christ's body and blood, but taught that Christ's person, including {{his body and}} blood, are presented to Christians who partake of it in faith. They also disagree with Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition which taught that Christ's body is physically eaten with the mouth in the sacrament. Later Reformed orthodox theologians continued to teach views {{similar to that of}} Calvin and Zwingli. In the modern period, Karl Barth espoused a symbolic view that the sacrament only communicates God's promises rather than functioning to actually confer these promises.

40|$|Four obligate {{heterofermentative}} {{lactic acid}} bacteria (LAB) strains (Weissella cibaria PON 10030 and PON 10032 and Leuconostoc citreum PON 10079 and PON 10080) were tested as single strain starters, mono-species dual strain starters, and multiple strain starter for the preparation and propagation of sourdoughs {{for the production of}} a typical bread at industrial level. The kinetics of pH and TTA during the daily sourdough refreshments indicated a correct acidification process for all trials. The concentration of lactic and acetic acid increased consistently during fermentation. The resulting molar ratios between these two organic acids in the experimental trials were lower than those observed in the control trial. The microbiological investigation showed levels of approximately 109 CFU/mL in almost all sourdoughs and the comparison of the genetic polymorphisms of the dominating LAB with those of the pure cultures evidenced the persistence of the added strains over time. <b>The</b> resulting <b>breads</b> were evaluated for several quality parameters. <b>The</b> <b>breads</b> with <b>the</b> greatest height were obtained with the quadruple combination of leuconostocs and weissellas. The highest softness was registered for <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> obtained from fermentations performed by W. cibaria PON 10032 alone and in combination. The different inocula influenced also the color, the void fraction, the cell density and the mean cell area of <b>the</b> <b>breads.</b> Different levels of acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, hydrocarbons, ketones, terpenes, furans and phenol were emitted by <b>the</b> <b>breads.</b> <b>The</b> sensory tests indicated <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> from <b>the</b> sourdoughs fermented with the seven LAB inocula as sweeter and less acidic than control <b>breads</b> and <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> from <b>the</b> trials with the highest complexity of LAB inoculums were those more appreciated by tasters. A multivariate approach found strong differences among the trials. In particular, control <b>breads</b> and <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> obtained with different starter LAB were quite distant and a more strict relation was found among the productions carried out by W. cibaria strains.
