A {{comprehensive review of}} the relevant literature from the last decade is done with focus on the particular consideration given to the {{different ways in which}} <b>Communication</b> <b>Strategies</b> have been defined under the corresponding influences in regard to the organization of strategy taxonomies. This study also seeks to examine how learners of second language perform in communicative tasks especially where they are confronted with linguistic problems and communication barriers. It also aims at identifying <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> used by <b>the</b> students from China studying in Malaysia to bridge the discrepancy between their communicative capabilities and their limited communicative resources. An attempt is also made to discover the problems encountered by them in communication which calls for the use of <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> methodology used in this study is a Qualitative Research method where the responses of the students in their communications based on three different tasks given is collected. The responses/utterances collected are then analysed to identify both the problems that are encountered as well as <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>strategies</b> that are used. As such, this research on second language learners' communicative strategies provides an elaborate framework for analyzing how learners manage to express themselves in spite of their limited knowledge of the target language. xv In addition, this study will also attempt to examine the practical application of <b>communication</b> <b>strategies.</b> Many studies (Tarone, 1977; Corder, 1983) dealing with the identification and classification of the linguistic manifestations have identified the gap that exist between communicative intentions and the linguistic resources available to the learner to realize them.

5000|$|Gregory M. Herek {{wrote that}} sissyphobia arises as {{combination}} of misogyny and homophobia. Communication scholar Shinsuke Eguchi (2011) stated: The discourse of straight-acting produces and reproduces anti-femininity and homophobia (Clarkson. 2006). For example, feminine gay men are often labeled [...] "fem," [...] "bitchy," [...] "pissy," [...] "sissy," [...] or [...] "queen" [...] (e.g., Christian, 2005; Clarkson, 2006; Payne,2007). They {{are perceived as}} if they perform like [...] "women," [...] spurring straight-acting gay men to have negative attitudes toward gay feminine men (Clarkson, 2006; Payne, 2007;Ward, 2000). This is called sissyphobia (Bergling, 2001). Kimmel (1996) supports that [...] "masculinity has been (historically) defined as the flight from women and the repudiation of femininity" [...] (p. 123). Thus, sissyphobia plays as <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>strategy</b> for straight-acting gay men to justify and empower their masculinity. (p. 38).|$|E

50|$|Much of {{what has}} been {{discussed}} about new technologies and its influence on collective action in a global public sphere refers mainly to developed countries and social classes that have these technologies readily available to them; media systems and social technologies in the developing world have yet to experience much of this phenomenon. Collin Sparks has organized a chronology of development communication theory that explains the limits and changes in a more global sense, rather than a simple developed-global sense. Sparks takes a survey of development communication theory from three failed paradigms to modernity. Changing social structures in his analysis meant not only the stratification of distribution between rural and urban, but also of the distribution of mass media and development information in rural areas. Economic development was therefore paramount in the acceptance of the development message, {{rather than the other way}} around. (45) Following the failure of this paradigm came a continuity variant. This new approach to the dominant paradigm meant minimal adjustments to the goals and methods, but a need for the modern expert to understand the world of non-modern object of <b>the</b> <b>communication</b> <b>strategy.</b> The participatory paradigm, arising later, was a radical shift. There “was no self-evident category of modernity, whether embodied in a western society or elsewhere, and therefore no single goal towards which every nation should aspire: ‘development is not a series of known steps through which each country passes towards pre-defined goals.’” It stressed industrialization and urbanization as stepping-stones, and that societies were likely to have different trajectories and their own normative goals and standards. This meant most importantly that there was no universal development model, needs were based on those of the local community, and vertical communication replaced horizontal communication.|$|E
