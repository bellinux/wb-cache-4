5|$|In June 2010, {{one of the}} TBMs {{completed}} its tunnel at <b>the</b> <b>cavern.</b> The second TBM broke through the wall of <b>the</b> <b>cavern</b> on July 15, 2010, completing its tunneling operation. The TBMs were partially disassembled and backed up to the 25th Street shaft, where they were lifted out. In April 2011, the MTA announced that the contract covering the tunnels, the 34th Street station mezzanine and passenger platform was 85% complete, and that the systems contract, covering mechanical and electrical systems, electric power, lighting and train tracks would be awarded by July 2011. A second entrance to the station is planned. In May 2012, the MTA announced that the extension, now 65% complete, had received {{the installation of the}} first set of rails.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{played at}} the venue 27 times, commemorated in a blue plaque erected in New Brighton in 2011. The only British venue The Beatles played at more often was <b>the</b> <b>Cavern</b> Club. Little Richard and the Rolling Stones also {{performed}} at the Tower Building.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} set in large grounds, which {{included}} a boating lake, a funfair, gardens, and a sports ground. The sports ground housed, at different times, a football team, an athletics track and a motorcycle speedway track.

5|$|Harry {{arranged}} for the future Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, to see them perform a lunchtime concert at <b>the</b> <b>Cavern</b> Club on 9 November 1961. Epstein subsequently asked Harry to create a national music paper, the Music Echo, but after disagreements with Epstein about editorial control, he {{decided to become a}} P.R. agent; working for many solo artistes and groups, including Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin and the Beach Boys, as well as many others.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 a {{retrospective}} of Berni's work was organized at the Instituto Di Tella, including the collage Monsters. Versions {{of the exhibit}} were shown in the United States, Argentina, and several Latin American countries. Compositions such as Ramona en la caverna (Ramona in <b>the</b> <b>Cavern),</b> El mundo de Ramona (Ramona's World), and La masacre de los inocentes (Massacre of the Innocent) were becoming more complex. The latter was exhibited in 1971 at the Paris Museum of Modern Art. By the late 1970s Berni's Juanito and Ramona oil paintings had evolved into three-dimensional altar pieces.|$|E

5000|$|Visitors may explore <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> in a 45 minute guided tour. <b>The</b> <b>caverns</b> {{were found}} {{by a couple}} farm boys back in 1920 after their dog fell through a hole {{that led to the}} caves. They decided to name <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> after their dog in honor of his discovery. Guided tours of <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> were begun in 1923. The best known {{attraction}} is a bell-shaped flowstone formation known as the [...] "Wedding Bell". Weddings have been held under the Bell. The cave is located in a hill overlooking the surrounding region.|$|R
5000|$|Bull Shoals Caverns is a {{limestone}} cavern {{located in}} Bull Shoals, Arkansas. [...] <b>The</b> <b>caverns</b> were created approximately 350 million years ago, during the Ordovician period and were carved out by water method. <b>The</b> <b>caverns</b> were formed by water seeping into {{the cracks of}} the rocks, gradually enlarging the cracks and dissolving the surrounding rocks. There is an underground river that flows through <b>the</b> <b>caverns.</b>|$|R
5|$|Oregon Caves is a solutional cave, with {{passages}} totaling about , {{formed in}} marble. The parent rock was originally limestone that metamorphosed to marble during the geologic processes {{that created the}} Klamath Mountains, including the Siskiyous. Although the limestone formed about 190million years ago, the cave itself is no older than a few million years. Valued as a tourist cave, <b>the</b> <b>cavern</b> also has scientific value; sections of the cave that are not on tour routes contain fossils of national importance.|$|E
5|$|The Leicester Square Theatre {{is based}} in nearby Leicester Place. It was {{constructed}} in 1955 as a church, before becoming the Notre Dame Hall, then <b>the</b> <b>Cavern</b> in the Town, a popular live music venue in the 1960s. In the 1970s, it was renamed back to the Notre Dame Hall, where the Sex Pistols played one of their first gigs at the club on 15 November 1976. It was converted into a theatre in 2002 as The Venue, and refurbished as the Leicester Square Theatre in 2008. In 2014, it began a production of a musical based on Oscar Wilde's De Profundis.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} movie {{opens with}} the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases {{one of them}} to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down <b>the</b> <b>cavern</b> with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as <b>the</b> <b>cavern</b> is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest.|$|E
50|$|This began {{a time of}} {{prosperity}} for <b>the</b> <b>caverns,</b> with Riley and Dill making appearances on television game shows. Celebrities were invited to visit <b>the</b> <b>caverns,</b> stories were written about <b>the</b> <b>caverns,</b> and an advertising campaign began in all forms of media. Also, in 1954, Riley became an ordained minister and is reputed to have held church services and performed wedding ceremonies in the cave.|$|R
5000|$|Sunnet {{finds that}} a tiered {{community}} has evolved in <b>the</b> underground <b>caverns</b> — <b>the</b> pygmies inhabiting a large underground collection {{of natural and}} artificial caverns and tunnels, and the captured humans in a deliberately isolated subsection of <b>the</b> <b>caverns.</b> He is also {{surprised to learn that}} family life exists in <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> — [...] "natives", children of captured humans who were born and have lived all their lives in <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> exist, and are generally happy with their life, and have no wish to escape.|$|R
50|$|The land {{adjacent}} to Zane Shawnee Caverns was historically {{used as a}} thoroughfare by the Shawnee, as it provided a portage between the Great Miami River and the rivers feeding into Lake Erie (particularly the Maumee River). <b>The</b> <b>caverns</b> were not generally known until they were discovered in 1892, when John Dunlap rescued {{a boy and a}} dog from a sinkhole. <b>The</b> <b>caverns</b> were named <b>the</b> Zane <b>Caverns,</b> after <b>the</b> nearby village of Zanesfield. <b>The</b> <b>caverns</b> were operated privately as a show cave throughout most of the 20th century.|$|R
5|$|The steel casket {{containing}} the gold is traced {{by the police}} allowing them to track down Diabolik's hideout. They close in on Diabolik, who is melting the gold and turning it into ingots. Because the police are shooting at him, Diabolik is unable to control the heating of the gold, and the whole cavern ends up being covered in molten gold. Again, Diabolik {{is believed to be}} dead, with his heat-proof suit now covered in solidified gold. The police seal off <b>the</b> <b>cavern</b> intending to recover the gold later. Eva is allowed to pay her respects to Diabolik, who winks at her.|$|E
5|$|The team {{designed}} venues {{that represented}} {{parts of the}} Beatles' history {{in order to create}} an atmosphere of authenticity. For example, the set of The Ed Sullivan Show was recreated from photographs and videos, including a rare color photograph in Apple's collection that showed the yellow tint used to enhance the video as shown on black-and-white television sets. <b>The</b> <b>Cavern</b> Club, Shea Stadium, Budokan, Abbey Road Studios and the rooftop of the Apple Corps Headquarters also appear as venues in the game. Fashions of the 1960s were researched to properly apply them to the various virtual crowds at these locations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Harry {{obtained}} a place at Liverpool's College of Art at 68 Hope Street. After studying typography and page layouts, he borrowed the college's duplicating machine and published a newspaper called Jazz in 1958, which reported concerts at the Liverpool Jazz Society club, the Temple Jazz Club and <b>the</b> <b>Cavern</b> Club. He also worked as assistant editor on University of Liverpool's charity magazine, Pantosphinx, and on a music newsletter for Frank Hessy's musical instruments store called Frank Comments. The title was suggested by the owner, Frank Hesselberg, as a play on his own comments, but was abandoned after a few issues.|$|E
50|$|An {{elevator}} {{building for}} access to <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> was completely enclosed by the 1957 park visitor center. Other buildings, now demolished, included a concessions building, built in 1928, and operated by the park concessioner, <b>the</b> <b>Caverns</b> Supply Company.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Fireclay <b>Caverns</b> were {{excavated}} {{to supply}} clay to brickworks of the Mount Morgan Mine. Clay was mined from within <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> by pick and shovel, then transferred by underground rail to a brickworks {{lower in the}} Mount Morgan Mine site. Excavation from <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> ceased when their clay was no longer required by the mine.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>caverns</b> are {{surrounded}} by a tourist-driven area. Other activities in the park include hiking and biking trails, five picnic tables for general use, a swimming pool, and a mini-golf course. <b>The</b> <b>caverns</b> also host an annual bluegrass festival.|$|R
5|$|Bevelle, {{the spiritual}} {{center of the}} Yevon religion, lies on a thin strip of land {{slightly}} north of Macalania. The city is built {{as a series of}} layers, with the headquarters of Yevon located at the top. The Via Purifico, located beneath Bevelle, serves as an oubliette for outcasts. Further north are the Calm Lands, a series of plains that have been the site of numerous battles in Spira's history; <b>the</b> <b>Cavern</b> of the Stolen Fayth, an equally historical area; and Mt. Gagazet, home of the Ronsos. Lastly, the sacred city of Zanarkand is on the northern tip of the Spiran mainland, reduced to ruins by Sin one thousand years before the events of Final Fantasy X.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, 2011, the {{contract}} for building {{the station was}} awarded to the joint venture of Skanska USA and Traylor Bros Inc. , <b>the</b> <b>cavern</b> stretching from 83rd to 87th Streets was 57% excavated. By July 2013, construction of the station was 53% complete. The final blast for the 86th Street station was completed for an escalator cavern on November 22, 2013. Skanska/Traylor were still installing waterproofing and steel reinforcement, as well as putting concrete around the underground cavern, entrances, and ancillaries. , entrances 1 and 2 were being built, and excavation was 100% complete; , the station shell was complete, bringing the total Second Avenue Subway project progress to three-fourths completion.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few people}} visited the cave during the next decade. Among them was Thomas Condon, {{professor}} of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he {{and a group of}} students hiked from Williams to <b>the</b> <b>cavern,</b> which they inspected by candlelight. Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Secret Cave" [...] {{was renamed}} to the [...] "Caverns of Sonora" [...] and was opened for public tours July 16, 1960.In 1961, James sold <b>the</b> <b>Caverns</b> of Sonora to nine Sonora investors. They formed a {{corporation}} with Stanley Mayfield at the head. In April of 1963, the Texas House of Representatives gave <b>the</b> <b>Caverns</b> of Sonora a special citation.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>caverns</b> were {{discovered}} in 1822 by local fishermen and since that time have been of interest to locals and travelers alike. Half hour guided tours escort visitors through <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> with information about cavern history, resident creatures, and the formations viewed along the way. Formed in a deposit of Shady Dolomite {{at the base of}} Humpback Mountain, Linville Caverns offer an environment for the public to explore the subterranean world of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Visitors hear the lore surrounding <b>the</b> <b>caverns,</b> including <b>the</b> tale of the Civil War deserters who used <b>the</b> <b>caverns</b> as a hideout, as well as the geology of the stalactites, stalagmites, and other formations found on the tour route.|$|R

5|$|Since the opening, {{the venue}} has hosted Gjøvik Hockey, {{which started in}} 1993 in the Fourth Division. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall hosted 16 ice hockey matches between 12 and 26 February, {{including}} two quarter-finals and one semi-final. The remaining matches were played at the larger Håkons Hall in Lillehammer. In March 1995, the operator announced that the ice would remain throughout the year. Because of the natural cooling of the mountain, the operator saved 1,000 kilowatts in heating costs by reusing the cooling system to heat the rest of <b>the</b> <b>cavern</b> hall. On 4 April 1995, the venue was used to host an international match between Norway and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Starr {{considered}} leaving Storm at {{that time}} to join Derry and the Seniors, but accepted a job with Tony Sheridan at the Top Ten Club on 30 December 1961, as Sheridan's offer of more money, a flat and a car was too good to refuse. Starr's stay with Sheridan was short-lived, as he found Sheridan's habit of changing the set list without telling his backing group beforehand frustrating, so he rejoined the Hurricanes. On 5 February 1962, Best fell ill and the Beatles had to play a lunchtime concert at <b>the</b> <b>Cavern</b> and an evening concert at the Kingsway club in Southport. As the Hurricanes had no concert that day Starr played with them live on stage for the first time (although he had recorded with them in Hamburg).|$|E
5|$|The Quarrymen—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ken Brown—went to {{the club}} to arrange their first booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish {{painting}} the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows and stars. In addition to the four boys' artistic contributions, Cynthia Powell, later to become Cynthia Lennon, painted a silhouette of John on the wall, which can still be seen today. The group often played at The Casbah as other venues, like <b>The</b> <b>Cavern</b> Club, had a jazz-only policy at that time. The cellar—with its original decoration—still exists.|$|E
