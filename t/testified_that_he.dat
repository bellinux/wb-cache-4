5|$|Blythe further <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{not under}} the {{influence}} of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs. Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
5|$|Still another, Walter Kwiatkowski, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> paid Horton $600 (in {{addition}} to the $200 bond) to have the case against him dropped where Glasser was acting as prosecutor. And another, Victor Raubunas, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> twice paid bribes to Kretske in cases that Glasser was handling (Raubunas was convicted a third time, after refusing to pay Kretske, in a case prosecuted by Ward himself). Mae and Anthony Jurkas, two small-time bootleggers, testified that Glasser declined to prosecute them {{in exchange for the}} name of their bootlegging boss.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hearing}} into the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury {{in return for}} {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
50|$|For example: {{a witness}} who <b>testifies</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw the {{defendant}} shoot the victim gives direct evidence. A witness who <b>testifies</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw the defendant fleeing {{the scene of the}} crime, or a forensics expert who says that ballistics proves that the defendant’s gun shot the bullet that killed the victim both give circumstantial evidence from which the defendant’s guilt may be inferred.|$|R
50|$|He {{was acquitted}} in a Waco court on April 9, 2010 after <b>testifying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> acted in self-defense.|$|R

5|$|John Kadlec, a {{consulting}} engineer {{on the original}} construction, has <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> raised concerns at the time about sloppy workmanship and inadequate construction materials at the site, including structural columns that were already crooked, steel beams that were already rusting despite being new, and the ultimately fateful decision to place the complex's parking area on the roof. According to Kadlec, the construction company opted to resolve the structural issues not by redoing the construction, but by anchoring the building's back wall to the rock outcropping behind it. James Keywan, the building's original architect, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also strongly objected to the rooftop parking, but had little choice once Algocen made their decision to proceed with that plan.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, five {{government}} witnesses testified, including Dr. Quidor and the Leetes' {{mother and}} sister. Quidor <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had discovered blood on {{a ball of}} twine, although it had been painted over with vermilion.|$|E
5|$|The {{case went}} to trial in British Columbia, where Brashear <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had no memory of the incident. McSorley <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> tried to hit Brashear in the {{shoulder}} to start a fight with him, but missed, resulting in the head shot. McSorley was found guilty but avoided a jail sentence. He was required to complete 18 months of probation, {{in which he was}} not allowed to play in a game against Brashear. Brashear returned to play prior {{to the end of the}} season. McSorley, who missed the remaining 23 games of the regular season, had his suspension officially set at one year following the conviction. However, he ultimately never played in another NHL game during his career.|$|E
50|$|Lucious was {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw Manning enter the women’s home. No witnesses said they saw Manning leave that apartment.|$|R

5|$|The defense case {{commenced}} on March 25. The third {{count of}} the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton testified that his duties would include acting as a criminal defense attorney for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington. Burton <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, {{and that he had}} only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, the {{prosecution}} began its case in chief. Post Office Department employees identified {{the letters of}} complaint received against Rialto. Ernest H. Kastor, of a St. Louis advertising firm, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> introduced Burton to Dennis and Harlan in November 1902. Witnesses said that the agreement was as Krum described and that the pay was agreed as $2,500 in $500 installments. Dyer read into evidence the letter from Burton to Rialto.|$|E
5|$|The Cowboys {{were about}} a block {{and a half}} from the West End Corral at 2nd Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom's wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which he thought they would be departing if they were leaving town.|$|E
2500|$|... {{a former}} {{colleague}} in the Libyan Airlines office in Malta, Abdulmajid Gialka, who {{was due to}} <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had seen {{the construction of the}} bomb, or at least its loading onto the plane at Frankfurt; ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, ay, my Lady,' said Spinks, 'there {{are plenty}} of us to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> made my young Lord fall back as in a swoon, and reel like one distraught. Pray Heaven it have not gone further.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Naow, I {{call that}} sensible," [...] said an Eastport man. [...] "I've bin over that graound with his writin', jest {{as he read}} it, in my two hands, and I can <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> got it all in." ...|$|R
5|$|The defense {{continued}} a {{few more}} days with testimony from a Navy psychiatrist who verified that the immense explosion would generate fear in each man. A black petty officer under Delucchi <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had heard no derogatory remarks or conspiratorial comments and that it had been a surprise to everybody when all of the men suddenly refused to march toward the docks on August 9.|$|E
5|$|The next court {{session was}} on July 1. At this session, Satoshi Kawamitsu, an {{attorney}} for the employment agency that V. N. worked for, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had tried to arrange a jidan settlement between Brown and V. N. in December 2002, but V. N. had insisted on pressing charges. He stated that he informed her that once the charges were filed, she {{would not be able to}} withdraw them until the trial began.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{you have}} lodged the gentleman {{for a time}} and you can <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a {{punctual}} paymaster and a civil inmate. But I want documents fit to be filed with the correspondence of the owners at home".|$|R
50|$|Former {{president}} Dacko {{was called}} to the witness stand to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had seen photographs of butchered bodies hanging in the dark cold-storage rooms of Bokassa's palace immediately after the 1979 coup. When the defence put up a reasonable doubt during the cross-examination of Dacko <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not be positively sure if the photographs he had seen were of dead bodies {{to be used for}} consumption, Bokassa's former security chief of the palace {{was called to}} <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had cooked human flesh stored in the walk-in freezers and served it to Bokassa on an occasional basis. The prosecution did not examine the rumours that Bokassa had served the flesh of his victims to French President Giscard d'Estaing and other visiting dignitaries.|$|R
5000|$|... "Known to {{me since}} my {{youthful}} {{days as a}} Boy's Scout in the Gambia, I now write to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a community leader and activists who {{tried very hard to}} capture our memories and stories in the pages of history." ...|$|R
5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E
5|$|Ike {{reported}} {{in his testimony}} afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him. He said Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan offered him his rifle and to fight him {{right there in the}} courthouse, which Ike declined. Ike also denied ever threatening the Earps. Ike was fined $25 plus court costs and after paying the fine left unarmed. Virgil told Ike he would leave Ike's confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel, which was favored by Cowboys when in town. Ike <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> picked up the weapons from William Soule, the jailer, a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} inquiry, chaired by Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner, Monts <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had not been}} given {{sufficient}} time to familiarize himself with the ship and its crew, who were themselves unfamiliar with the vessel. Monts argued that the mobilization process for the newly commissioned ship should have lasted four to six weeks, rather than the three he had been given. The day before the squadron left Wilhelmshaven, Batsch complained to General Albrecht von Stosch, {{the chief of the}} Kaiserliche Marine, that a significant number of dockyard workers were still finishing work on Grosser Kurfürst. Werner and the board determined that Admiral Batsch was at fault and exonerated Monts.|$|E
60|$|Frank Cavilla {{lived and}} worked as a house {{decorator}} in London. He is described as a good workman, a steady fellow, and not given to drink, while all his neighbours unite in <b>testifying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a gentle and affectionate husband and father.|$|R
50|$|Knowing {{he will be}} arrested, Logan turns {{himself in}} the next day at Larrue's office. Keller has planted the bloody cassock among Logan's belongings, and when Logan is tried in court, Keller <b>testifies</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw Logan enter the church after the murder, acting suspiciously.|$|R
50|$|The last {{exception}} applies up to {{the quantity}} admitted, which may include the entire contract. This reversed the rule at common law that permitted a defendant to <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> indeed contracted with the plaintiff but refuses to perform {{because it is not}} in writing.|$|R
5|$|Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike {{driver who}} saw {{part of the}} {{incident}} were the only surviving witnesses. Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements, nor did he testify in his own trial or give {{a statement to the}} police. The driver traveling north on the turnpike <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had seen a State Trooper struggling with a Black man between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.|$|E
5|$|The Earps {{hired an}} {{experienced}} trial lawyer, Thomas Fitch, as defense counsel. Wyatt <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> drew his gun only after Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury went for their pistols. He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys {{and explained that}} they intended to disarm the cowboys. He said they fired in self defense. Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross-examination that was contradictory, or appeared to dodge his questions, or in which they {{said they could not}} remember.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp testified {{after the}} gunfight that {{five or six}} weeks prior he had met Ike Clanton outside the Alhambra Hotel. Ike told Wyatt that Doc Holliday had told him he knew of Ike's {{meetings}} with Wyatt and about Ike providing information on Head, Leonard, and Crane, {{as well as their}} attempted robbery of the stage. Ike now accused Earp of telling Holliday about these conversations. Earp <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> told Ike he had not told Holliday anything. Wyatt Earp offered to prove this when Holliday and the Clantons next returned to town.|$|E
5000|$|Smith was {{a witness}} in a suit brought by {{employees}} of a failed newspaper, the Los Angeles Press, <b>testifying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had given $275 to Winfield Scott, {{the manager of the}} newspaper, to [...] "tide the paper over" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "had no assurance of political support from him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Harold Brown, who {{had been}} acting as booking agent for Sechelt not {{surprisingly}} disagreed with Engineer Kick, <b>testifying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought a vessel of Sechelts type could have handled the sea conditions on the Strait {{and he had never}} at any time seen Sechelt out of trim ...|$|R
50|$|Such {{evidence}} is potentially problematic, since people make mistakes. In {{the case of}} dock identification of the accused, the witness can <b>testify</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had previously identified witness, at an ID parade, for example. Others may also testify to show such prior identification by the witness.|$|R
