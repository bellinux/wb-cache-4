60|$|It was perceived, too, {{that while}} Hester never put forward even the humblest <b>title</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> in the world's privileges--further than to breathe the common air and earn daily bread for little Pearl and herself by the {{faithful}} labour of her hands--she {{was quick to}} acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man whenever benefits were to be conferred. None so ready as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty, even though the bitter-hearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door, or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a monarch's robe. None so self-devoted as Hester when pestilence stalked through the town. In all seasons of calamity, indeed, whether general or of individuals, the outcast of society at once found her place. She came, not as a guest, but as a rightful inmate, into the household that was darkened by trouble, as if its gloomy twilight were a medium {{in which she was}} entitled to hold intercourse with her fellow-creature. There glimmered the embroidered letter, with comfort in its unearthly ray. Elsewhere the token of sin, it was the taper of the sick chamber. It had even thrown its gleam, in the sufferer's bard extremity, across the verge of time. It had shown him where to set his foot, while the light of earth was fast becoming dim, and ere the light of futurity could reach him. In such emergencies Hester's nature showed itself warm and rich--a well-spring of human tenderness, unfailing to every real demand, and inexhaustible by the largest. Her breast, with its badge of shame, was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one. She was self-ordained a Sister of Mercy, or, we may rather say, the world's heavy hand had so ordained her, when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result. The letter was the symbol of her calling. Such helpfulness was found in her--so much power to do, and power to sympathise--that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification. They said that it meant Abel, so strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman's strength.|$|E

40|$|Opening Plenary Session“The Secret Sharer”, {{written in}} 1909 in a {{respite from the}} {{composition}} of the novel that was to become Under Western Eyes, is one of Conrad’s most straightforward as well as one of his most popular stories. It moves steadily forward to an exciting narrative climax, and more or less observes the classical unities of action, time and place. The consensus of the large critical literature it has engendered is that the tale’s centre of gravity lies in {{the relationship between the two}} parties to the “secret sharing” of the story: the young captain, poised uncertainly on the threshold of his first voyage in command of a ship, and Leggatt, the fugitive murderer whom he takes on board, hides in his own quarters without the knowledge of his own crew, and eventually helps to escape. This relationship is based on an intuitive and romantic kinship each feels for the other, which is another meaning of the title phrase “the secret sharer”. The tale is narrated as a retrospect by the young captain himself, and critical opinion also agrees in seeing in him an example of the Conradian “unreliable narrator”. This paper will argue that the young captain is in some crucial respects a great deal more unreliable than has been noticed hitherto. In doing so, it promises to reveal more than one more layer of meaning in the tale’s cunning <b>title,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>share</b> at least one more vital secret, buried in the story by the narrator because he too is unaware of it...|$|R
50|$|Up until 1997 {{a league}} system was used, if {{two or more}} clubs {{finished}} with {{the same number of}} points they would share the title.

2500|$|A {{trust is}} created by a settlor, who {{transfers}} <b>title</b> <b>to</b> {{some or all of}} his or her property to a trustee, who then holds <b>title</b> <b>to</b> that property in trust {{for the benefit of the}} beneficiaries.

It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals <b>to</b> <b>share</b> a single role.

In a March 2009 interview, Rickly explained the album's <b>title</b> refers <b>to</b> humanity's <b>shared</b> experience, and {{that many of the}} songs were influenced by the words of his favorite poets and authors: [...] "Almost every song on the record is connected to a different writer. The first song, [...] "Resuscitation of a Dead Man" [...] is influenced by Denis Johnson's Resuscitation of a Hanged Man. Another song is based on a book [...] Time's Arrow.

60|$|It may {{at first}} appear strange, but I {{believe it is}} true, that I cannot by means of money raise a poor man and enable him to live much better than he did before, without proportionably {{depressing}} others in the same class. If I retrench the quantity of food consumed in my house, and give him what I have cut off, I then benefit him, without depressing any but myself and family, who, perhaps, may be well able to bear it. If I turn {{up a piece of}} uncultivated land, and give him the produce, I then benefit both him and {{all the members of the}} society, because what he before consumed is thrown into the common stock, and probably some of the new produce with it. But if I only give him money, supposing the produce of the country to remain the same, I give him a <b>title</b> <b>to</b> a larger <b>share</b> of that produce than formerly, which share he cannot receive without diminishing the shares of others. It is evident that this effect, in individual instances, must be so small as to be totally imperceptible; but still it must exist, as many other effects do, which, like some of the insects that people the air, elude our grosser perceptions.|$|R

However, Federer was unable to sustain his form against Djokovic as he squandered a break in the opening set and despite a fightback to win the second set tiebreaker from 3-6 down, he lost the match in 4 sets, committing 35 unforced errors in the process. It marked the first time Federer had lost two back to back finals at Wimbledon, and it again denied him the chance to win a record 18th Grand Slam and a record 8th Wimbledon <b>title</b> <b>to</b> break his <b>shared</b> record of 7 Wimbledon titles with Pete Sampras.|$|R

Therefore he desired I would let him know, “what these costly meats were, and how any of us happened to want them?” Whereupon I enumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with the various methods of dressing them, which could not be done without sending vessels by sea to every part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for sauces and innumerable other conveniences. I assured him “that this whole globe of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better female Yahoos could get her breakfast, or a cup to put it in.” He said “that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its own inhabitants. But what he chiefly wondered at was, how such vast tracts of ground as I described should be wholly without fresh water, and the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink.” I replied “that England (the dear place of my nativity) was computed to produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are able to consume, as well as liquors extracted from grain, or pressed out of the fruit of certain trees, which made excellent drink, and the same proportion in every other convenience of life. But, in order to feed the luxury and intemperance of the males, and the vanity of the females, we sent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries, whence, in return, we brought the materials of diseases, folly, and vice, to spend among ourselves. Hence it follows of necessity, that vast numbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by begging, robbing, stealing, cheating, pimping, flattering, suborning, forswearing, forging, gaming, lying, fawning, hectoring, voting, scribbling, star-gazing, poisoning, whoring, canting, libelling, freethinking, and the like occupations:” every one of which terms I was at much pains to make him understand.|$|R
