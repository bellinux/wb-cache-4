40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for retrieving the {{temporal and spatial}} evolution of the charge density and the current of a steadily-developing upward leader based on ground observations of electrical fields and high speed camera images of two upward positive leaders initiated by a classical rocket-triggered lightning before the wire disintegration. For {{a period of a}} few milliseconds, for <b>the</b> upward <b>leader</b> segments developing above altitude about 200 [*]m, we obtained <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> speed, calculated <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> charge density and <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> current. For <b>the</b> two <b>leaders,</b> both <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> speed and <b>the</b> charge density, hence <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> current, showed a trend of increase as <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> propagated upward. There was a good consistency in the variation trend between <b>the</b> calculated <b>leader</b> current and <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> channel brightness. <b>The</b> <b>leader</b> current calculated agreed well with the current measured at the channel base, indicating that our proposed model for retrieving <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> charge density is effective and reliable.

25|$|If, after <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> had {{selected}} its equilibrium quantity, the follower deviated from the equilibrium and chose some non-optimal quantity {{it would not}} only hurt itself, {{but it could also}} hurt <b>the</b> <b>leader.</b> If <b>the</b> follower chose a much larger quantity than its best response, the market price would lower and <b>the</b> <b>leader's</b> profits would be stung, perhaps below Cournot level profits. In this case, the follower could announce to <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> before <b>the</b> game starts that unless <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> chooses a Cournot equilibrium quantity, the follower will choose a deviant quantity that will hit <b>the</b> <b>leader's</b> profits. After all, the quantity chosen by <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> in equilibrium is only optimal if the follower also plays in equilibrium. <b>The</b> <b>leader</b> is, however, in no danger. Once <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> has chosen its equilibrium quantity, it would be irrational for the follower to deviate because it too would be hurt. Once <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> has chosen, <b>the</b> follower is better off by playing on the equilibrium path. Hence, such a threat by the follower would not be credible.|$|R

25|$|Consider the {{following}} strategy profiles: <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> plays Cournot; <b>the</b> follower plays Cournot if <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> plays Cournot and the follower plays non-Stackelberg if <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> plays Stackelberg and if <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> plays something else, the follower plays an arbitrary strategy (hence this actually describes several profiles). This profile is a Nash equilibrium. As argued above, on the equilibrium path play is a best {{response to a}} best response. However, playing Cournot {{would not have been}} the best response of <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> were it that the follower would play Stackelberg if it (<b>the</b> <b>leader)</b> played Stackelberg. In this case, the best response of <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> would be to play Stackelberg. Hence, what makes this profile (or rather, these profiles) a Nash equilibrium (or rather, Nash equilibria) {{is the fact that the}} follower would play non-Stackelberg if <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> were to play Stackelberg.|$|R
