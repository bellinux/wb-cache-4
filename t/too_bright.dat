5|$|The Philadelphia Athletics {{indicated}} {{immediate interest}} in Chamberlain, {{hoping that he}} would pitch most of the team's games. Chamberlain earned a 22–23 win-loss record in 1891. He was the losing pitcher {{in the last of}} 485 shutouts recorded in the few seasons of American Association play. In August, he gave up the longest home run that had been hit at Boston's Congress Street Grounds. Chamberlain pitched for the NL's Cincinnati Reds in 1892, compiling a 19–23 record. In May of that season, Chamberlain pitched in an unusual game that was suspended due to sunlight; the scoreless game was in extra innings when umpire Jack Sheridan ruled that the sun was <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> for players to see the ball. The 1892 Reds finished with an overall record of 82–68. League officials split the season into two halves and the Reds finished fourth and eighth in the respective halves.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction {{of the sun and}} moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> immediately before moonset to actually see the crescent.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} crew, {{following the}} airport's routine, moved three vehicles to the runway: a UAZ-469 all-terrain vehicle with an attached trailer, {{operated by a}} driver and crew manager in front; followed by KrAZ and Ural trucks. The latter were equipped with dry air compressors and loaded with fuel, and weighed 16–20 tons. The drying detail then proceeded to violate their own safety rules while performing their tasks: all of their vehicles should have their top, flickering lights on continuously. However, the lights were <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> for the maintenance workers' liking, so they kept them lit only until they started and after they finished their work.|$|E
60|$|Saxon {{looked at}} her old friend curiously, with a swift glance that sketched all the tragedy. Mary was thinner, though there was more color in her cheeks--color of which Saxon had her doubts. Mary's bright eyes were handsomer, larger--too large, <b>too</b> feverish <b>bright,</b> <b>too</b> restless. She was well dressed--too well dressed; and she was {{suffering}} from nerves. She turned her head apprehensively to glance into the darkness behind her.|$|R

50|$|The {{meeting is}} carried on with dim light so that spirits {{eventually}} willing to manifest in visible form will not find it <b>too</b> hard (<b>bright</b> light apparently makes materialisation more difficult, as the spirit requires much more of energy to become visible against it), as Katie King said.|$|R
25|$|C3 plant {{metabolism}} was chronologically first. It requires {{large amounts}} of water (which is lost through transpiration), moderate temperatures and moderate sunlight. About 95% of plants are C3. In places where the water supply is minimal, the temperature is too high, or the sunlight <b>too</b> <b>bright,</b> C3 plants cannot thrive, but C4 metabolism evolved at multiple locations convergently within the same families by a slight alteration of the metabolic process. It requires {{a fraction of the}} water, and thrives in warmer environments and bright sunlight. C4 plants spread where C3 plants must decline. About 5% of the Earth's plants are C4, far less than for grasses, for which the number is 46%.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{conversion}} was a {{rehabilitation of the}} building's facade. Since flashing was not originally included around the building's windows, rainwater failed to drain, causing window shelves to corrode and the surrounding masonry to fail. During the rehabilitation, the facade was cleaned and rebuilt and repaired where needed. Along with adding weatherproofing, 97 percent of {{the windows in the}} tower needed replacement. The new windows were originally criticized for being <b>too</b> <b>bright,</b> but the brightness has faded over time. Two-story windows on the 33rd floor needed to be replaced, but the first replacements did not meet historical preservation standards, and a second set had to be designed and were subsequently approved. The large windows in the base were repaired, reglazed and cleaned. The street-level windows were restored to their original appearance based on physical evidence and drawings.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{recurring}} storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest {{one of these}} lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates {{about what will happen}} if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not <b>too</b> <b>bright,</b> also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.|$|E

500|$|In the 2010 MLB All-Star Game, Wilson debuted a pair {{of bright}} orange cleats and {{continued}} to wear them throughout the season. On July 27, Marlins' manager Edwin Rodríguez complained that the shoes were <b>too</b> <b>bright.</b> Wilson received a $1,000 fine from MLB the next day, and he responded by coloring half of the shoes black with a marker. He said afterwards, [...] "The fact that he (Rodríguez) thinks these shoes throw 97–100 with cut {{might be a little}} far-fetched. I guess we should probably have these checked for performance-enhancing cleats." [...] He also stated that he was punished [...] "for having too much awesome on my feet." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{occasionally}} {{changed his}} hair and lost or gained weight for parts, {{and he went to}} great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: [...] "The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult." [...] In an earlier interview with The New York Times, he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, [...] "that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's a beautiful thing... Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great– well, that's absolutely torturous." [...] This struggle was confirmed by the author John le Carré, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel A Most Wanted Man. While praising the actor's intelligence and intuition, le Carré acknowledged the burden that Hoffman felt: [...] "It was painful and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing. The world was <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> for him to handle." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{passage is}} obscure, but Cerutti and Richardson argue that Gracchus begins the fight as a loincloth-wearing retiarius. When the tide turns against him, he dons a tunic and a womanish wig (spira), {{apparently}} {{part of the}} same costume, and thus enjoys a reprieve, although this attire may not itself have been considered effeminate as it was also worn by the priests of Mars of whom Gracchus was the chief priest. The change of clothing seems to turn a serious fight into a comical one and shames his opponent. It is unusual to see a gladiator depicted this way in a satire, as such fighters usually take the role of men who are [...] "brawny, brutal, sexually successful with women of both high and low status, but especially the latter, ill-educated if not uneducated, and none <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> intellectually." [...] The retiarius tunicatus in the satire is the opposite: [...] "a mock gladiatorial figure, of equivocal sex, regularly dressed in costume of some sort, possibly usually as a woman, and matched against a secutor or murmillo in a mock gladiatorial exhibition." ...|$|E

500|$|Palmetto Leaves was not Stowe's first travel memoir. In 1854 she {{published}} Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands {{about her}} {{first trip to}} Europe, a book unique as an American woman's view of Europe. She followed this with Agnes of Sorrento that appeared as a serial in The Atlantic Monthly from 1861 to 1862. Source material for Agnes of Sorrento was culled from her observations of and experiences in Italy, collected during her third trip to Europe, which she took with her family. Olav Thulesius, author of Harriet Beecher Stowe in Florida, recognizes Stowe's tendency to spin everything she saw into something selectively positive. Stowe addressed this in the foreword to Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands, writing: If the criticism be made that every thing is given couleur de rose, the answer is, Why not? If there be characters and scenes that seem drawn with <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> a pencil, the reader will consider that, after all, there are many worse sins than disposition to think and speak well of one's neighbors.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{above-mentioned}} historic process {{of determining the}} age and distance to globular clusters is not as robust as first thought, since the morphology and luminosity of globular cluster stars in color-magnitude diagrams are influenced by numerous parameters, {{many of which are}} still being actively researched. Certain clusters even display populations that are absent from other globular clusters (e.g., blue hook stars), or feature multiple populations. [...] The historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time, or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance, has likewise been overturned (e.g., NGC 2808). [...] Further, the morphology of the cluster stars in a color-magnitude diagram, and that includes the brightnesses of distance indicators such as RR Lyrae variable members, can be influenced by observational biases. One such effect is called blending, and it arises because the cores of globular clusters are so dense that in low-resolution observations multiple (unresolved) stars may appear as a single target. [...] Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star (e.g., an RR Lyrae variable) is erroneously <b>too</b> <b>bright,</b> given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined. [...] Consequently, the computed distance is wrong, and more importantly, certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder, and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the Hubble constant.|$|E
500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to get a little more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little <b>too</b> <b>bright.</b> I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E

2500|$|Cassatt {{displayed}} eleven works, including Lydia in a Loge, Wearing a Pearl Necklace, (Woman in a Loge). Although critics {{claimed that}} Cassatt's colors were <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> {{and that her}} portraits were too accurate to be flattering to the subjects, her work was not savaged as was Monet's, whose circumstances were the most desperate of all the Impressionists at that time. [...] She used her share of the profits to purchase a work by Degas and one by Monet. She participated in the Impressionist Exhibitions that followed in 1880 and 1881, and she remained {{an active member of}} the Impressionist circle until 1886. In 1886, Cassatt provided two paintings for the first Impressionist exhibition in the US, organized by art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. Her friend Louisine Elder married Harry Havemeyer in 1883, and with Cassatt as advisor, the couple began collecting the Impressionists on a grand scale. Much of their vast collection is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky, {{the costume}} {{designer}} for Daredevil and Jessica Jones, serves as costume designer for Luke Cage as well. The series sees Cage have a wardrobe evolution from his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket that {{was introduced in}} Jessica Jones. Maslansky took inspiration from the comics illustrations, as she did on the other Marvel Netflix series, but also looked to the [...] "rich and colorful history" [...] of Harlem, and Coker's own vision. In looking {{to pay homage to}} Cage's original costume with his updated clothing for the series, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> for a guy who is trying to keep his identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. The series' title sequence, which uses yellow overtones, blends a silhouette of Luke Cage with images of Harlem.|$|E
2500|$|Money is {{primarily}} obtained {{in an unusual}} way. One of the Magnus that can be put into a deck is a camera, available in three different levels of quality or effectiveness. When in battle, the character can use the camera {{to take a picture}} of an enemy. After the battle, that picture will develop in about ten real time minutes. Once fully developed, a photo's value {{is primarily}} determined by the enemy photographed as well as conditions in effect at the time. Photos of rarer enemies (i.e. bosses) are worth more. If the enemy blocks a camera shot, the enemy in the photo will appear somewhat distorted and will be worth less. Using light or dark attacks along with the camera will make the photo lighter or darker, respectively. A photo will sell for less if it is <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> or too dark. Photos of PCs normally have very low sellback value, but there is a small chance of getting [...] "rare shots" [...] that are worth a decent amount.|$|E
2500|$|Hastings {{represents}} the traditional English gentleman—not <b>too</b> <b>bright</b> but absolutely scrupulous, {{a throwback to}} the Victorian-era gentleman who is always concerned about [...] "fair play". Hastings himself notes that he is somewhat old-fashioned. While Poirot, who is not above lying, surreptitiously reads other people's letters or eavesdrops, Hastings is horrified of such acts and usually refuses to perform them to help Poirot in one of his cases. Although he lacks Poirot's intellect, Poirot often compliments Hastings' ability to remember facts and details about their cases even if he deplores the manner in which Hastings tells the story at times. Hastings' physical appearance is rarely described in the novels because he is often the narrator. However, it is mentioned that he, like Poirot, has a moustache which becomes a target of the detective's criticism in Peril at End House: 'And your moustache. If you must have a moustache, let it be a real moustache, a thing of beauty such as mine.' Although he has served in the army, Hastings is not a ruthless man by nature, with Poirot noting during his final letter to Hastings in Curtain that he knows that Hastings is not a murderer.|$|E

Of course, we must be conscious {{of the possibility of}} reverse causality here <b>too,</b> with <b>bright</b> people getting good jobs and building up more assets and so on, but, again, {{it seems likely that the}} lower pressure to start work, or get married earlier that comes with family wealth, reaps benefits in terms of longer time spent in education, great literacy and more good jobs. The size of this effect is much larger for men, so young men’s life chances seem to improve faster with household wealth.|$|R
