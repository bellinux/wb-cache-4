5|$|For {{the letter}} experiment, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> 219 Japanese {{undergraduate}} students to rate {{each of the}} 45 hiragana, part of the Japanese writing system, according to how much they liked it. For the number experiment, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> 269 Japanese undergraduate students to rate the numbers between 0 and 49 on attractiveness. The number 49 {{was chosen as the}} upper limit to mask the true aim of the study, which 31 (being the maximum number of days in a month) might have hinted at. Likewise, the number 0 was included for disguise. Participants had to give ratings on a six-point scale, ranging from 1 if they disliked the number very much, to 6 if they liked it very much. Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthday.|$|E
5|$|Dusk was at 19:00 and the Turkish attack had now reached Malone's Gulley and The Nek. The New Zealanders {{waited until}} the Turks came close, then opened fire in the darkness, {{stopping}} their advance. Seriously outnumbered, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> for reinforcements. Instead, the supporting troops to their rear were withdrawn and the Turks managed to get behind them. So, taking the machine-guns with them, they withdrew off Russell's Top into Rest Gully. This left the defenders at Walker's Ridge isolated {{from the rest of}} the force.|$|E
5|$|Estimated {{numbers of}} Calusa at the {{beginning}} of the Spanish occupation ranged from 4,000 to 7,000. The society declined in power and population; by 1697 their number was estimated to be about 1,000. In the early 18th century, the Calusa came under attack from the Yamasee to the north. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> the Spanish for refuge in Cuba, where almost 200 died of illness. Soon they were relocated again to the Florida Keys.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{consider}} Boston {{a highly}} cultured city, {{perhaps as a}} result of its intellectual reputation. Mark Twain once wrote of it, [...] "In New York, <b>they</b> <b>ask,</b> 'How much money does he have?' In Philadelphia, <b>they</b> <b>ask,</b> 'Who were his parents?' In Boston <b>they</b> <b>ask,</b> 'How much does he know?'" [...] Much of Boston's culture originates at its universities.|$|R

5|$|Rhodes' initial {{response}} to the declaration of war was diplomatic; <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> the Roman Republic for help against Philip. The Romans, however, were wary of another war, the Second Punic War having just ended. The Roman Senate attempted to persuade the populace to enter the war, even after Pergamum, Cyzicus and Byzantium had joined the war on the Rhodians side, {{but was unable to}} sway the city's war-weary population.|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> {{her if she}} had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of}} the leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} East–West shipping lane in the Baltic Sea passed the Hiiu sandbank. Already {{before the year}} 1490 the Hanseatic merchants were seeking permission to mark this peninsula with an outstanding landmark. Around 1490 <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> the bishop of Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek to let them build a landmark on the Kõpu peninsula which was under the bishop’s control. This action had no real results.|$|E

5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E
5|$|When Dowling's {{attorneys}} {{learned about}} the retainer to DLA Piper <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> the court to order {{the return of the}} retainer to the plaintiff, and the circuit court ruled in favor of Dowling.

5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known to use that route.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure, the rite by which, until 1973, a seminarian became a cleric. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> for a conservative seminary to complete their studies. After directing them to the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, Lefebvre was urged to teach these seminarians personally. In 1969, he received permission from the local bishop to establish a seminary in Fribourg which opened with nine students, moving to Écône, Switzerland in 1971.|$|E
5|$|After the UFA entered electoral {{politics}} {{and won the}} 1921 election, new premier Herbert Greenfield asked Brownlee to serve as his attorney-general. Brownlee agreed and {{was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Alberta in a by-election in the riding of Ponoka. As attorney-general, he was an important member of Greenfield's government. He was closely involved in its most important activities, including efforts to better the lot of farmers living in Alberta's drought-ridden south, divest itself of money-losing railways, and win jurisdiction over natural resources from the federal government. When a group of UFA backbenchers grew frustrated with Greenfield's weak leadership, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> Brownlee to replace him. Brownlee eventually agreed, and became premier in 1925.|$|E
5|$|By mid-August 1942, Stanley had {{recovered}} {{enough to be}} moved to the dysentery wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks. Padres Chambers and Payne had heard that Stanley had decorated the prisoners' chapel at Bukit Batok. So <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> {{him if he would}} do some paintings for St Luke's Chapel, which was recently converted from the ground floor of Block 151, near the area where Stanley was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to St Luke the Physician. Stanley agreed, and sought inspiration for the proposed paintings in the Gospels.|$|E

5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} {{that he would have to}} defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, Warren {{met with}} Dr Albert K. Chapman, the Vice President and General Manager of Eastman Kodak, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the {{director}} of the Manhattan Project and Colonel James C. Marshall, the commander of the Manhattan Engineer District (MED). <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> him about his work with radiation and isotopes and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED. In March 1943, Warren met with Major Hymer L. Friedell at the MED's New York City headquarters. Friedell had joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in August 1942 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had been involved in radiology research under Dr Robert S. Stone. Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation. Warren was unable to provide all the information, but agreed to initiate research at Rochester.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005, {{three men}} {{carrying}} guns {{broke into his}} home, removing any valuables. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> if he was gay, and when he refused to respond they kidnapped him, later shooting him dead and dumping the body elsewhere. The police subsequently arrested four individuals and charged them with murder in the furtherance of a robbery. The accused remained in police custody for almost ten years before the case came to court. At that point, the police dropped their murder charges against two of the accused. The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them {{to life in prison}} with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole.|$|E

5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was never intended that they last more than five years. It is remarkable that two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but {{that they are in}} 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the public}} as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them. In 1939, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> the United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Mary Wilson's {{brother died}} {{unexpectedly}} {{that night in}} Hull; although {{she and her husband}} did not attend for a second day's racing, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> all the other guests not to interrupt the plans, and the remainder of the party attended, watching the St. Leger Stakes. During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling the peer that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E
