5|$|Cooley {{was born}} in Maryland, but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, {{when he arrived in}} East Florida, a {{province}} of Spanish Florida, as part of a military expedition. He established himself as a farmer {{in the northern part of}} the province before moving south, where he traded with local Indians and continued to farm. During the period in which the region was transferred from Spanish to U.S. governance, he sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the King of Spain and was evicting the Indians from their lands. Unhappy with the actions of the Spanish, he moved to the New River area in 1826 <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> far as possible from the Spanish influence.|$|E
5|$|The UN counterattack at Inchon {{collapsed}} the North Korean {{line and}} cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> much of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18â€“19. After the forces there, {{the remainder of the}} North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units rapidly pursued them north, passing over the Naktong River positions, which were no longer of strategic importance.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Jordan, within miles of the Iraqi border, to achieve Bigelow's goal of authenticity. Iraqi {{refugees}} were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but director Kathryn Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, she wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> close to the war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraq border. She had wanted to film in Iraq, but the production security team could not guarantee their safety from snipers.|$|E

25|$|The attacking team {{uses the}} bomb in attack, but this attack can quickly turn to {{defensive}} if the bomb is fielded {{by the opposition}} team. Therefore, there is a defensive element in deciding whether to kick a bomb. A bomb is useful defensively because {{even if it is}} fielded by the opposition, it is still useful in giving the kicking team ample time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> close as possible to the player with the ball which allows the kicking team to prevent the opposing team from making too much ground towards their in goal area.|$|E

Part 1 was the third most popular programme on Boxing Day for 16- to 34-year-olds.|$|E
25|$|In {{engineering}} and economics, many problems involve multiple objectives {{which are not}} describable as the-more-the-better or the-less-the-better; instead, there is an ideal target value for each objective, and the desire is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> {{close as possible to}} the desired value of each objective. For example, energy systems typically have a trade-off between performance and cost or one might want to adjust a rocket's fuel usage and orientation so that it arrives both at a specified place and at a specified time; or one might want to conduct open market operations so that both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are {{as close as possible to}} their desired values.|$|E

25|$|England resumed on {{the fourth}} day looking <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> close as {{possible}} to Australia's score in the hope of bowling them out cheaply in the second innings, and set up an easy chase. Lamb moved on from his overnight 103 in much the same fashion as he had done the previous day. Smith joined in and the pair looked quite comfortable throughout the morning. Lamb was batting confidently and the pair took their partnership past 50. A short time later however, Lamb was undone by a brilliant trade-mark bat-pad catch by David Boon off Alderman's bowling. A short time later Derek Pringle, out LBW, became debutant Greg Campbell's first ever Test wicket, and his only victim of the whole tour.|$|E
25|$|NDP Now and the Waffle {{fought for}} control of the partyâ€™s bureaucracy, by trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> many people elected as party {{officers}} of the Federal Executive and Council. The major battles were for the partyâ€™s executive positions, especially the President and Vice-President positions. NDP Now, and its trade union backers, nominated the Ontario NDPâ€™s former leader, Donald C. MacDonald as its candidate for party President. The Waffle candidate was Susan Gudmundson, from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Both MacDonald and Gudmundson were vying to succeed Allan Blakeney, who was stepping down as president because he recently was elected {{as the leader of the}} Saskatchewan NDP. MacDonald won 885 to 565, as expected, but Gudmundson received a surprisingly high level of support, due in part, to leadership candidate Ed Broadbent's supporters and the relative strength of the Waffle's supporters.|$|E

25|$|Fractional {{ownership}} divides {{a property}} into more affordable segments {{for individuals and}} also matches an individual's ownership time to their actual usage time. A fractional share gives the owners certain privileges, such {{as a number of}} days or weeks when they can use the property. Occasionally, the property is sold after a predetermined time, distributing the relative proceeds back to the owners. A few private owner-groups have developed highly sophisticated usage allocation schemes and other features based on the principle of attempting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> close as possible to the flexibility of individual ownership, and only compromising this to the minimum extent necessary to accommodate multiple owners. In such schemes, the basic agreement is between the members themselves, whereas in most commercial fractional ownership schemes, the owner's principal relationship is with the property developer and/or promoter of the scheme.|$|E
25|$|The fog {{lifted from}} the town around 10 a.m. and Sumner gave his order to advance an hour later. French's brigade under Brig. Gen. Nathan Kimball began to move around noon. They {{advanced}} slowly through heavy artillery fire, crossed the canal in columns over the narrow bridges, and formed in line, with fixed bayonets, behind the protection of a shallow bluff. In perfect line of battle, they advanced up the muddy slope until they were cut down at about 125 yards from the stone wall by repeated rifle volleys. Some soldiers were able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> close as 40 yards, but having suffered severe casualties from both the artillery and infantry fire, the survivors clung to the ground. Kimball was severely wounded during the assault, and his brigade suffered 25% casualties. French's brigades under Col. John W. Andrews and Col. Oliver H. Palmer followed, with casualty rates of almost 50%.|$|E
25|$|Ricoeur also {{invoked the}} notion of distanciation when {{interpreting}} and understanding others. For Ricoeur, distanciation is two-fold: a) humans always interpret from a distanced position via their physical and experiential proximity to the experiences being discussed (i.e., they were not always there when it happened), and b) {{there will always be}} a distance between their experiences and their interpreted truths and meaning of those experiences. While imagination enables hermeneutic therapists to understand their clients and empathize with their experiences, {{there will always be a}} distance between what the therapist imagines and the actual embodied experience of the client. Ironically, it is this concept of distanciation that invokes the therapist's responsibility to make the attempt, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> close as is possible, because without breaching that surface, truth and meaning are limited in their co-creation. Hermeneutic counseling theory states that a therapist and a client cannot work together to co-create meaning without empathically envisioning and understanding one another.|$|E
