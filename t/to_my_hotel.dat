60|$|We {{drove back}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> {{and waited for}} Harold. To my horror and alarm, he never came near us. I might almost have doubted him--if {{he had not been}} Harold.|$|E
6000|$|... "Once I had a fright," [...] he told her. [...] "I {{was in a}} {{restaurant}} close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel.</b> I was there with {{a young woman who}} is typing the play for me." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{attended}} the theatre that night. When I returned <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel,</b> a quiet man in dark clothes, who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief, appeared, magically, at my side.|$|E
60|$|I {{have gone}} back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>hotel,</b> and I have engaged not too {{expensive}} bedroom. My uncle does not know. He still is in his private office. I secure my room.|$|R
60|$|May I entreat you {{to thank}} Mr. Carter very earnestly and kindly in my name, for his proffered hospitality; and, further, {{to explain to}} him that since my {{readings}} began, I have known them to be incompatible with all social enjoyments, and have neither set foot in a friend's house nor sat down to a friend's table in any one of all the many places I have been to, but have rigidly kept myself <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotels.</b> <b>To</b> this resolution I must hold until the last. There is not the least virtue in it. It is a matter of stern necessity, and I submit with the worst grace possible.|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} {{a wave of}} feeling between self-disgust and fear poured over me. This vortex was drawing me into deep and unknown things.... I hailed a passing fiacre, went straight <b>to</b> <b>my</b> little <b>hotel,</b> settled <b>my</b> account with the proprietor, and caught a night train for Switzerland.|$|R
60|$|Nobody {{would speak}} {{to me in the}} gardens, though I felt that they ought to have invited me to drink, and I crept back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> to eat six {{different}} fresh chutnies with one curry.|$|E
6000|$|The Young Man: [...] "No, no; there isn't. But now I {{must run}} away. I haven't been <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> yet; I was just driving {{up from the}} ship, and I saw the flowers in the window, and--stopped. Good-by!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Mr. Anne, if I {{may have}} the honour of your company at dinner--shall we say Tortoni's?--we will on our way step round <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel,</b> the Quatre Saisons, behind the Hôtel de Ville, and order a calèche and four to be in readiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I make my {{next move}} I'll have a lawyer," [...] he said. [...] "I know {{somebody}} tried <b>to</b> blow up <b>my</b> <b>hotel,</b> and I {{think it was}} some of your boys--that Lawrence boy especially. But I ain't going to have 'em arrested until I can prove it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do it!" [...] cried Jason Spar. [...] "I'll show 'em they can't insult me {{and take}} away my trade and then try <b>to</b> blow up <b>my</b> <b>hotel!</b> I'll have 'em all locked up! Then we can examine 'em one by one, and get 'em tangled up and make 'em confess." ...|$|R
5000|$|Marysia Ulam was {{the aunt}} of the {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam. In his memoire, Adventures of a mathematician, Ulam wrote: [...] 'My uncle Michael's wife happened {{to live in}} Paris {{at the time and}} she kindly offered to receive me and <b>to</b> send <b>to</b> <b>my</b> modest <b>hotel</b> her chauffered limousine to take me sightseeing. I was so embarrassed at the thought of being seen arriving in a Rolls-Royce or a Duesenberg at the Louvre or some other museum, it felt so incongruous, that I declined her offer' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I don't think I need {{keep you}} any longer," [...] he told Hutton {{after a long}} pause. [...] "I'll leave the thing over {{for a day or}} two, and you can send across <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> if you wish to discuss it again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Letters {{addressed}} to Miss de Barral, {{you had better}} bring over <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> over there," [...] said Fyne beginning to feel extremely worried about the future. The man said [...] "Yes, sir," [...] adding, [...] "and if a letter comes {{addressed to}} Mrs.." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{we talked}} {{of the places}} and things that I more {{particularly}} desired to see and, well, {{the end of it}} was that I went back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> in love with Natalie; and as she afterwards confessed, she went to bed in love with me.|$|E
60|$|This direct thrust I {{gently and}} smilingly parried by asking Mrs. Mackenzie whether she {{supposed}} a gentleman {{who had just}} paid an electioneering bill, and had, {{at the best of}} times, but a very small income, might sometimes not be in a condition to draw satisfactorily upon Messrs. Hobson or any other bankers? Her countenance fell at this remark, nor was her cheerfulness much improved by the tender of one of the two bank-notes which then happened <b>to</b> be in <b>my</b> possession. I said that I had a use for the remaining note, and {{that it would not be}} more than sufficient <b>to</b> pay <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> bill, and the expenses of <b>my</b> party back <b>to</b> London.|$|R
60|$|I resume my hasty notes, {{of which}} I sent {{you the first}} {{instalment}} some weeks ago. I mentioned that I intended <b>to</b> leave <b>my</b> <b>hotel,</b> not finding in it real matter. It was kept by a Pomeranian and the waiters without exception were from the Fatherland. I {{might as well have}} sat down with my note-book Unter den Linden, and I felt that, having come here for documentation, or <b>to</b> put <b>my</b> finger straight upon the social pulse, I should project myself as much as possible into the circumstances which are in part the consequence and in part the cause of its activities and intermittences. I saw there could be no well-grounded knowledge without this preliminary operation of my getting a near view, as slightly as possible modified by elements proceeding from a different combination of forces, of the spontaneous home-life of the nation.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Ashwood had resumed her {{conventional}} courtesy without however {{losing her}} feminine {{desire to make}} her companion pay for the agitation he had caused her. [...] "We would have been always pleased to see you," [...] she said vaguely, [...] "and I hope, as you are here now, you will come with me <b>to</b> the <b>hotel.</b> <b>My</b> brother"-- ...|$|R
60|$|We made {{connections}} at {{the railroad}} junction and reached Worcester at midnight {{in time for}} a good sleep. I took the silent and backward pitcher <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel.</b> In the morning we had breakfast together. I showed him about Worcester and then carried him off to the ball grounds.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So you can't {{sell your}} picture, and you've lost your job, and your girl has shaken you?' he said. 'Pretty bad, but still you've no call to go {{mingling}} with automobile wheels. You {{come along with}} me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel,</b> and tomorrow we'll see if we can't fix up something.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{leave these}} fine discriminations to the theologian. I know that I went back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> in Vevey with my mind healed, with my will {{restored}} to me, and my ideas running together into plans. And I know that I {{had come out}} that day a broken and apathetic man.|$|E
60|$|My dear {{brother in}} Science--I resume my hasty notes, of which I sent {{you the first}} {{instalment}} some weeks ago. I mentioned then that I intended <b>to</b> leave <b>my</b> <b>hotel,</b> not finding it sufficiently local and national. It was kept by a Pomeranian, and the waiters, without exception, were from the Fatherland. I fancied myself at Berlin, Unter den Linden, and I reflected that, having taken the serious step of visiting the head-quarters of the Gallic genius, I should try and project myself; as much as possible, into the circumstances which are in part the consequence and in part the cause of its irrepressible activity. It {{seemed to me that}} there could be no well-grounded knowledge without this preliminary operation of placing myself in relations, as slightly as possible modified by elements proceeding from a different combination of causes, with the spontaneous home-life of the country.|$|R
60|$|I {{will tell}} you the reason. <b>My</b> uncle's <b>hotel</b> is fashionable hotel. Rich Americans, rich Maharajahs, rich people of every nation come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>hotel.</b> They come, and with them they have brought their pets. Monsieur, it was the {{existence}} of a nightmare. Wherever I have looked there are animals. Listen. There is an Indian prince. He has with him two dromedaries. There is also one other Indian prince. With him is a giraffe. The giraffe drink every day one dozen best champagne to keep his coat good. I, the artist, have my bock, and my coat is not good. There is a guest with a young lion. There is a guest with an alligator. But especially there is a cat. He is fat. His name is Alexander. He belongs to an American woman. She is fat. She exhibits him to me. He is wrapped in a silk and fur creation like an opera cloak. Every day she exhibits him. It is 'Alexander this' and 'Alexander that', till I 'ate Alexander very much. I 'ate all the animals, but especially Alexander.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{episode of}} Candy Candy was written at Domaine De Beauvois, a chateau-hotel in France. Mizuki said [...] "I {{wanted to say}} good-bye to Candice in {{beautiful}} place. If possible, I {{wanted to go to the}} United Kingdom When I was into the room, tears welled up in my eyes because a picture of fox hunting was hung on the wall. Fox hunting--it took Anthony's life. When I remember Candice, autumn days at the beautiful <b>hotel</b> came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mind. The <b>hotel</b> was like the villa of Ardray family." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{looking at}} his watch, he said, [...] "It is twenty-five minutes to four. I shall take a cab and go {{directly}} to the legation. I was on my way <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel,</b> but there is no time for that now," [...] and, after shaking hands with the professor, he hailed a cab.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{talk like}} {{a package of}} self-raising {{buckwheat}} flour," [...] said Del Delano. [...] "You've had a talent handed to you by the Proposition Higher Up; and it's {{up to you to}} do the proper thing with it. I'd like to have you go up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> for a talk, if you will." ...|$|E
60|$|I did better. I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel,</b> {{called for}} the hotel book, and {{registered}} an oath, which is, therefore, copyright. I swore that in twenty-five years I would be even with him I hated. I prayed, rather inconsistently, that honour and happiness might be the lot of her I had lost. After that I felt better.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after my}} trip was all agreed upon and settled, father {{had to go}} to New York, and there he saw Mr. Colbert, and of course told him of my plans. That afternoon, old Colbert came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>hotel,</b> and {{proposed}} to him that I should take his son with me. He had always heard, he said, that I was a sensible fellow, and fit to be trusted, and he would be very glad to have his boy travel with me. And he furthermore said that if I had the care of Samuel--for of course he didn't call his son Rectus--he would pay me a salary. He had evidently read about young English fellows travelling on the continent with their tutors, and I suppose he wanted me to be his son's tutor, or something like it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> wouldn't {{be good enough}} for you," [...] replied Ralph, honestly. [...] "I didn't want <b>to</b> waste <b>my</b> money, and so chose a cheap place." ...|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 On September 2013 I moved from Rochester, NY to Thailand. It {{had been a}} long process of {{reflection}} and pondering on the direction my life was going, and finally I strongly felt that I would steer my life 2 ̆ 7 s vessel towards the eastern part of our shrinking planet. I landed at the airport of Bangkok and moved immediately <b>to</b> a <b>hotel.</b> <b>My</b> first duty was to learn Thailand 2 ̆ 7 s language needed to obtain a working license. 2 ̆...|$|R
60|$|Once {{or twice}} he stopped, as if bewildered or beset by some sudden doubt or memory; {{and every time}} he stopped, Freda licked his hand. They {{disappeared}} round the corner of the street, and I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> to see about dinner. On the way I met Jules le Ferrier, and asked him to come too.|$|E
6000|$|X came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> in Paris {{one day to}} take me to see {{a certain}} munitions organisation. He took from his pocket a picture {{postcard}} that had been sent him by a well-meaning American acquaintance from America. It bore a portrait of General Lafayette, and under it was printed the words, [...] "General Lafayette, Colonel in the United States army." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went back}} {{by way of}} Paris, having settled with the priest that he should write to me at my banker's there {{as soon as he}} could after Alfred had {{returned}} to Wincot. If I had gone to the East, the letter would have been forwarded to me. I wrote to prevent this; and, on my arrival at Paris, stopped at the banker's before I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>hotel.</b>|$|E
60|$|If I were to {{describe}} all the incidents {{of the next}} fortnight in their order, my story would never come to an end; and your patience would be exhausted. Morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly 'rickshaw and I used to wander through Simla together. Wherever I went there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company <b>to</b> and from <b>my</b> <b>hotel.</b> At the Theatre I found them amid the crowd of yelling jhampanies; outside the Club veranda, after a long evening of whist; at the Birthday Ball, waiting patiently for my reappearance; and in broad daylight when I went calling. Save that it cast no shadow, the 'rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and iron. More than once, indeed, I have had to check myself from warning some hard-riding friend against cantering over it. More than once I have walked down the Mall deep in conversation with Mrs. Wessington to the unspeakable amazement of the passers-by.|$|R
60|$|I enquired at <b>my</b> <b>hotel</b> {{for that}} in which Charles Strickland was living. It was called the Hotel des Belges. But the concierge, {{somewhat}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> surprise, {{had never heard of}} it. I had understood from Mrs. Strickland that it was a large and sumptuous place {{at the back of the}} Rue de Rivoli. We looked it out in the directory. The only hotel of that name was in the Rue des Moines. The quarter was not fashionable; it was not even respectable. I shook my head.|$|R
60|$|We {{left him}} working among his chemicals, {{and we walked}} {{together}} towards <b>my</b> <b>hotel.</b>|$|R
