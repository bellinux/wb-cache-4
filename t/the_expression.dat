40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to survey the {{presence}} of folk expressions, i. e. proverbs, proverbial expressions, wellerisms and familiar expressions, {{in some of the}} realistic children’s books by Astrid Lindgren. The purpose also includes the study of the contextual and pragmatic functions of <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> as well as how <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> are integrated into the text by the change of the formulaic standard structure. The contextual and pragmatic function concern when, how and why <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> are used and who the users of <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> are. <b>The</b> questions at issue are: What kind of folk <b>expressions</b> occur in <b>the</b> children’s books by Astrid Lindgren? What contextual and pragmatic functions do <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> have? How are <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> integrated into <b>the</b> text? To be able to answer <b>the</b> questions, folk <b>expressions</b> were excerpted from the books with the help of close reading. The contextual and pragmatic functions of <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> were determined by analysing the communicative context, the senders and the receivers of <b>the</b> <b>expressions,</b> <b>the</b> senders’ purpose in using <b>the</b> <b>expressions.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> changes in the structure of <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> were analysed in order to determine how <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> were integrated into the text. The result shows that <b>the</b> 52 folk <b>expressions</b> found in general are used in dialogues between adults as senders and children as receivers. The senders use <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> mainly to comment on anything or anyone with the purpose to explain, i. e. a didactic purpose. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> have not changed their formulaic standard structure, and <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> that have changed are used as allusions, paraphrases or ellipses of folk expressions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of recipes for {{replenishing}} qi and activating blood on p 16, p 21, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D 1 and cyclin E gene <b>expressions</b> in <b>the</b> liver of aging rats. Methods: A recipe for replenishing qi and a recipe for activating blood were administered to aging rats respectively, and {{the effects of}} the above recipes on <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> of senescence related genes (p 16, p 21, PCNA, cyclin D 1 and cyclin E) were examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting methods. Results: <b>The</b> <b>expressions</b> of p 16, p 21 and cyclin D 1 mRNAs and proteins in the liver of the untreated aging rats were up-regulated, while <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> of PCNA and cyclin E mRNAs and proteins decreased. As compared with the untreated aging rats, both recipes could down-regulate <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> of cyclin D 1 mRNA and protein and up-regulate <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> of cyclin E mRNA and protein, but had no obvious effects on <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> of mRNAs and proteins of p 16, p 21 and PCNA. Conclusion: Recipes for replenishing qi and activating blood can improve the liver cell proliferation of aging rats via down-regulating <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> of cyclin D 1 mRNA and protein and up-regulating <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> of cyclin E mRNA and protein...|$|R

5|$|The {{choice of}} poly(A) site can be {{influenced}} by extracellular stimuli and depends on <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> of the proteins that take part in polyadenylation. For example, <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> of CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results {{in the selection of}} weak poly(A) sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like lysozyme and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins. RNA-binding proteins other than those in the polyadenylation machinery can also affect whether a polyadenyation site is used, as can DNA methylation near the polyadenylation signal.|$|E
