This will be done {{in conjunction with the}} major <b>transformation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elephant & Castle area to create thousands of new homes and potential for new retail development to provide growth in the area. This is also in line with a further consultation on its worksite for the Bakerloo line due to the highly constrained space surrounding the platforms of the line. New tunnels could be dug alongside with new platforms to accommodate the increase in demand if the Bakerloo line extension comes into service.|$|E
5|$|The author noted wryly {{that later}} in the series Allen's hair became similar to a Super Saiyan, a <b>transformation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dragon Ball series where the character's hair becomes spiky. Hoshino said that early in D.Gray-mans publication, Allen {{was one of the}} hardest {{characters}} to draw. By the tenth volume, she said that the character was more difficult to draw than Yu Kanda. In the manga's first chapters, Allen's eyes have had different colors (such as red and light blue) due to a discussion between Hoshino and her editor; it was later decided to give him silver eyes. The series' title, D.Gray-man, is meant to have several meanings, (most referring to the state of Allen and the other main characters).|$|E

None of the current AFL teams have taken a black swan emblem in allusion to any natural qualities of the bird, and its sole representation in the symbology of the league refers to the largely unresearched phenomenon of late 19th-mid 20th century migration between Western Australia and Victoria - now borne by a club that has emigrated to New South Wales.

5|$|Comprehensive Political Guidance (CPG), {{a policy}} {{document}} {{that had been}} agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an addition to the 1999 Strategic Concept document, was formally endorsed during the summit. The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing <b>transformation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, the {{technology}} of cotton-spinning machinery improved, and the need for larger buildings to house bigger, better and more efficient equipment became apparent. The profitability of cotton spinning meant that open land that had been used for farming since antiquity, was utilised for purpose-built weavers' cottages. Larger buildings were still desired, and construction of two water powered cotton factories (two or three times the size of a cottage) can be traced to 1782. The construction of more mills followed—ten by 1789—facilitating a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic <b>transformation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region; the population moved away from farming, adopting employment in the factory system. The introduction of the factory system led to an increase of the township's population; from 872 in 1714 to 3,500 in 1801, mostly as a result of an influx of people from Yorkshire and Lancashire looking for employment in the cotton mills.|$|E

5|$|The Real Monasterio de Santa Ana is a Christian monastery in Badajoz, {{declared}} a Bien de Interés Cultural site in 1988. It is {{the headquarters of}} the Order of St. Clare in the city and lies {{in the heart of the}} old city. It was founded in 1518 by Ms. Leonor de Vega i Figueroa, under the blessing of Pope Leo X, and belonged to the jurisdiction of the Franciscan province of San Miguel. According to the tombstone in the grounds, Figueroa was abbess of the monastery for forty years until her death on April 17, 1558. She was buried in the grounds, until moved to the Cripta Real del Monasterio de El Escorial. The monastery underwent a major <b>transformation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century although the original structure partly remains. Outwardly, part of the building has buttresses and a tower with two bells. On the vault of the chancel stands a lookout tower with a lattice brick convent, topped with pinnacles. The church of the monastery has a single nave which was rebuilt in the late 17th century, and the presbytery is covered by a late Gothic rib vault dated to the first half of the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the region}} in and around Chadderton was {{dominated}} by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A fulling mill at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776. The damp climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile production {{to be carried out}} without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton spinning in the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural <b>transformation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.|$|E

The notion of a <b>transformation</b> <b>in</b> e-Research can operate on many levels: <b>transformations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tools used to conduct research, <b>transformations</b> <b>in</b> projects that enable new types of e-Research, transformations to ordinary scientific practice, <b>transformations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> types of scientific questions that can be asked and able to be asked, and <b>transformations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scientific imagination.
