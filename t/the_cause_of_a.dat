5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} is <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts {{can be added to}} table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E

5|$|Robert Koch, {{a pioneer}} in medical microbiology, worked on cholera, anthrax and tuberculosis. In his {{research}} into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905.

5|$|The prime {{motivation}} behind Magnús' {{cooperation with}} Ælfgar is uncertain. One {{possibility is that}} he was attempting to establish Norwegian authority in the west as a means to prepare an invasion of England. In so doing, Magnús may have backed <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local faction that opposed Echmarcach. Certainly, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann records that Ímar's apparent son, Gofraid Crobán (died 1095)a future ruler of Dublin and the Islesbacked the Norwegian invasion of England led by Magnús' father in 1066.|$|E

In this episode, Scully tries to discover <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mysterious illness after several men in a prison die.

40|$|We examine to {{what extent}} there exists {{heterogeneity}} in <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> banking crisis. For this purpose, we use a random coefficient logit model including 110 countries between 1970 and 2007. We conclude that there exists significant heterogeneity in <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> banking crisis. We find that a high credit growth, a negative GDP growth and a high real interest rate are on average <b>the</b> most important <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> banking crisis.

5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given as <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was paid in that year; {{in the following year}} it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. An adjustment to the share capital was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E
5|$|Jagiello's baptism {{failed to}} end the crusade of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his {{conversion}} was a sham, perhaps even a heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that pagans remained in Lithuania. From then on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crusade and faced the growing threat to its existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance. Władysław sponsored {{the creation of the}} diocese of Vilnius under bishop Andrzej Wasilko, the former confessor of Elisabeth of Hungary. The bishopric, which included Samogitia, then largely controlled by the Teutonic Order, was subordinated to the see of Gniezno and not to that of Teutonic Königsberg. The decision may not have improved Władysław's relations with the Order, but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland, enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart.|$|E

40|$|For traffic {{accidents}} when one vehicle {{enter into the}} opposite direction lane, the criterion for <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident (for most cases) is the collision place.

Rarely, however, there are also accidents, where there is not decisive in which lane impact happened. Such traffic accidents, however, occur very rarely and by the experts are often considered for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> traffic accidents wrong.

40|$|To {{understand}} texts {{written in}} natural language (LN), {{we use our}} knowledge about the norms of the domain. Norms allow to infer more implicit information from the text. This kind of information can, in general, be defeasible, but it remains useful and acceptable while the text do not contradict it explicitly. In this paper we describe a non-monotonic reasoning system based on the norms of the car crash domain. The system infers <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident from its textual description. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident {{is seen as the}} most specific norm which has been violated.
