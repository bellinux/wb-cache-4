5|$|The tenth season closes several long-running storylines. Charlie {{breaks up}} with Ross {{to get back}} {{together}} with her ex-boyfriend. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross' feelings about them being together and decide {{it would be best}} to remain friends. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler— a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler, making a joke for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|ROBERTS: [...] "No; if it {{happened}} to strike on that train anywhere, it might spoil one of the folds. I can't risk it." [...] A ring is heard at <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>door.</b> They spring to their feet simultaneously.|$|E
6000|$|Dan felt {{a rush of}} {{tenderness}} in {{his heart}} {{at the sound of the}} kind, humbugging little voice. [...] "No, thank you, Mrs. Pasmer, I couldn't stay, thank you. I--I thank you very much. I--good-bye, Mrs. Pasmer." [...] He wrung her hand, and found his way out of <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>door,</b> leaving her to clear up the mystery of his flight and his broken words as she could.|$|E

He did not answer, {{and when he did}} not she tried to call Jordan McCrary, a UNCCH soccer player she knew. At 4:25 a.m., she left <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> to get in McCrary's car. At that time, Rosario said later, she {{believed}} Hedgepeth was asleep in her room, and left <b>the</b> <b>apartment's</b> <b>door</b> unlocked.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{the militants}} fired through <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>doors</b> hitting Mazal Edry, who died later of her wounds in the stairwell. Then the squad broke into <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> of <b>the</b> Bibas family whom {{lived on the}} third floor. After murdering {{the mother of the}} family, they threw grenades from the windows, {{demanding}} the release of their comrades from Israeli prisons. During the event, the three children of the Bibas family, jumped out of <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> from their third-floor window, suffering only light injuries. Jean Pierre Alimi, a resident of the neighborhood, was killed by the militants while he helped evacuate the wounded.|$|R

6000|$|He {{must have}} made more clatter than he {{supposed}} with his key at <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>door,</b> for his wife had come to let him in when he flung it open. [...] "Why, Basil," [...] she said, [...] "what's brought you back? Are you sick? You're all pale. Well, no wonder! This {{is the last of}} Mr. Fulkerson's dinners you shall go to. You're not strong enough for it, and your stomach will be all out of order for a week. How hot you are! and in a drip of perspiration! Now you'll be sick." [...] She took his hat away, which hung dangling in his hand, and pushed him into a chair with tender impatience. [...] "What is the matter? Has anything happened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts, in a rapture {{of admiration}} and affection: [...] "Oh, who cares {{for the truth}} in such a cause, you poor heroic angel, you? Well, if you insist upon going, I suppose we must; and now the only way {{is for you to}} keep {{everything}} clearly in mind. You'd better say it over backward, now, and begin with evening dress, because that's the most important. Now! Evening dress; Mrs. Miller awfully angry; last half, anyway; mustn't go to sleep; Willis at ten; me alone with the children; both girls out. Now, do you think--Ow--e--e--e!" [...] A ring at the door extorts a shriek from Mrs. Roberts, who simultaneously gathers her robes about her, in order to fall with decency in the event of burglars or fire, while her husband rises and goes to open <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "Who can it be, at this hour? Oh! Amy!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{house in}} which Mrs. C---- resided in the old town of Edinburgh, was a flat or story of a land accessible, as was then universal, by a common stair. The family who {{occupied}} the story beneath were her acquaintances, {{and she was in}} the habit of drinking tea with them every evening. It was accordingly about six o'clock, when, recovering herself from a deep fit of anxious reflection, she was about to leave the parlour in which she sat in order to attend this engagement. The door through which she was to pass opened, as was very common in Edinburgh, into a dark passage. In this passage, and within a yard of her when she opened the door, stood the apparition of her kinsman, the deceased officer, in his full tartans, and wearing his bonnet. Terrified at what she saw, or thought she saw, she closed the door hastily, and, sinking on her knees by a chair, prayed to be delivered from the horrors of the vision. She remained in that posture till her friends below tapped on the door, to intimate that tea was ready. Recalled to herself by the signal, she arose, and, on opening <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>door,</b> again was confronted by the visionary Highlander, whose bloody brow bore token, on this second appearance, to the death he had died. Unable to endure this repetition of her terrors, Mrs. C---- sank on the door in a swoon. Her friends below, startled with the noise, came upstairs, and, alarmed at the situation in which they found her, insisted on her going to bed and taking some medicine, in order to compose what they took for a nervous attack. They had no sooner left her in quiet, than the apparition of the soldier was once more visible in the apartment. This time she took courage and said, 'In the name of God, Donald, why do you haunt one who respected and loved you when living?' To which he answered readily, in Gaelic, 'Cousin, why did you not speak sooner? My rest is disturbed by your unnecessary lamentation--your tears scald me in my shroud. I come to tell you that my untimely death ought to make no difference in your views for your son; God will raise patrons to supply my place and he will live to the fullness of years, and die honoured and at peace.' The lady of course followed her kinsman's advice and as she was accounted a person of strict veracity, we may conclude the first apparition an illusion of the fancy, the final one a lively dream suggested by the other two.|$|E
50|$|The Back Hallway was {{originally}} the Grand Entrance to <b>the</b> Disney <b>apartment.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> {{at the rear}} {{is connected to the}} ground floor by a nondescript flight of stairs located in a small courtyard (the Royal Courtyard is currently occupied by an extension of the Pieces of Eight shop).

5000|$|Later {{in the day}} as Poo Bear and B-Fool {{walk out}} of an {{apartment}} they are approached by a clean cut, seemingly harmless man walking up the alley next to the apartment building. The man asks Poo Bear if he's selling [...] "bud" [...] (marijuana). Poo Bear rudely rebuffs the man, who simply says [...] "Alright" [...] and turns to walk away. It {{turns out that the}} clean cut man is Poo Bear's rival Cartoon, the Crip whose best friend was murdered at the gas station {{at the beginning of the}} film. Because of his neat appearance Poo Bear and B-Fool don't recognize him as a rival gang member. Seconds after walking away Cartoon turns around, draws a Glock pistol and opens fire on Poo Bear and B-Fool who attempt to flee back into the apartment. While B-Fool makes it to <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>door</b> Poo Bear is shot twice in his back. As Poo Bear staggers towards <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>door</b> B-Fool closes the security door behind himself, leaving Poo Bear outside and defenseless. As Poo Bear struggles to make it into the apartment Cartoon shoots him a third time and Poo Bear collapses in front of <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>door.</b> Cartoon stands over Poo Bear and fires another six shots (a total of nine rounds altogether) into him before running back down the alley into an awaiting car and drives off.|$|E
50|$|Running {{to elude}} the police, he rushes into an {{apartment}} that is occupied by junkies (Two men and a woman).

50|$|The ground {{plans of}} <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> {{are based on}} Gropius's {{contribution}} to the Siemensstadt settlement of 1929-30. To the north are two bedrooms and a bathroom, to the south a living room, kitchen and another bedroom. Since the house is built as a concrete skeleton, <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> {{have only a few}} load-bearing walls, so that open-plan kitchen/living-areas can be created. <b>The</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>doors</b> are partly ceiling-high and equipped with aluminum handles. Originally, all windows were designed as filigree steel frame constructions. As steel frames had exceeded the budget, Gropius donned wooden windows with frames painted in a grey tone, mimicking steel. In order to save the desired filigree effect, the wooden frames of the south-facing windows were sloped by combining rotary window with fixed windows. There is no basement. Storerooms and laundry rooms are located on the ground floor.|$|R
50|$|When {{police arrived}} at Fernandez's apartment, they {{believed}} {{a suspect in}} a gang-related assault had just entered. While approaching <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> they heard screaming and fighting occurring inside. Police knocked on <b>the</b> <b>apartment's</b> <b>door,</b> which was answered by Fernandez's bloodied girlfriend. Believing that Fernandez may have assaulted his girlfriend, police attempted to separate the two. Fernandez refused to follow the police's directive to step away from his girlfriend and yelled “You don’t {{have a right to}} come in here. I know my rights.” The officers soon realized that Fernandez was the suspect in the gang-related assault and arrested him for that crime. About an hour later the police came back to ask Fernandez's girlfriend for consent to search <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> which she gave. Fernandez later challenged the lawfulness of this third-party consent. Counsel to Fernandez were attorneys Jeff Fischer and Gerald Peters.|$|R

He exits by jerking his hands away from her and remarks in voiceover that this was the last time he ever saw her. He leaves in a taxi, staring emptily into space, as the camera slowly enters a whispering hole.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile, Oliver, {{after he}} had prowled around the room in the {{stealthy}} manner which we have endeavoured to describe--all, even the highest officers making way for him, and loading him with their ceremonious attentions, which his modesty seemed desirous to avoid--again entered <b>the</b> inner <b>apartment,</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of which were presently thrown open, and King Louis entered the presence chamber.|$|R

5000|$|It was no {{accident}} that Dulles chose the Herrengasse apartment; the house was located in the medieval section of old Bern that was constantly in a mist of vehicle traffic and pedestrians. To allay any suspicions, a sign at <b>the</b> <b>apartment's</b> <b>door</b> stated: [...] "Allen W. Dulles, Special Assistant to the American Minister." [...] It was, however, the rear and more discreet entrance to the property that was most convenient to Dulles. By this entrance, guests were able {{to come and go}} unnoticed. Dulles was also able to use his influence to have the street lights outside the property turned off to assist the secrecy of his visitors. These welcomed guests included spies, traitors, refugees, priests, exiles and expatriates, anyone who could provide him with intelligence. One of the most distinguished visitors to <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> was Prince Max Egon zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a special agent of Himmler.|$|R
50|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} co-hosted on RadioIO by Burke's {{longtime friend and}} sidekick Colin G Brady, Board Operator/on-air talent Rick and an ever changing series of RadioIO interns {{and friends of the}} show. On November 28, 2012, Colin G Brady did not arrive to the studio for the daily broadcast.

Shifty found Brady dead on his kitchen floor while live on the phone with Shannon and the crew back at the studio. The show quickly cut to commercial, returning shortly thereafter to complete the show with a shocked crew and audience.|$|E
