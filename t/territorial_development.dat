In order to analyze the economic activities in the territory three important dimensions are pointed out: innovative and competitive dynamics; the economic relations within sectors and enterprises in the local economy; and the rural-urban relationships. About 80 interviews to local actors were made, and other available data and surveys were processed. The results show that the rural-urban relationships are the key to understand the economy in this region. Nevertheless, the local economy presents a fragmented development: a majority of low competitiveness sectors with scarce aptitude to generate economic local interrelationships, and some competitive sectors but that work disconnected {{of the rest of the}} local economy. Finally, the way for a possible transformation is discussed for this region, as well as some conditions that must accompany this process. <b>territorial</b> economic <b>development,</b> North-East of Uruguay, productive organization, innovation, rural-urban relationships. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmong famous {{seaside resort}} areas, rivieras are complex coastal systems where, {{more than in}} any other coastal region, coastal views have an {{economic}} value and can be considered as a heritage. Resulting from the combination of an indented coastline, an amphitheatre or balcony shaped topography and accessibility to viewpoints, coastal views are a major component of riviera systems. They are part of the riviera identity and they considerably influence <b>territorial</b> <b>developments.</b> Taking the French Riviera – part of the Côte d’Azur stretching from Nice to Menton - as a case study, we will illustrate panoramic views’ importance through road developments. Viewshed analysis achieved with GIS gives indeed clear evidence of how coastal views from roads have been valorized by sightseeing. The issue of view management in coastal areas should be discussed. Natural as well as man-made heritage, coastal views are affected by land use change. Using systems analysis, we will try to identify threats and preservation strategies related to them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Territorial</b> {{sustainable}} <b>development</b> must {{be regarded}} as a mutual enrichment of participatory research-action activity, which improves the utility and the accessibility of territorial knowledge and conventional research, which guarantees quality in the long-term. Territorial intelligence, which integrates the concepts of locality, knowledge based society and sustainable development is strongly orientated towards action: its ambition is to respect the ethical principles of <b>territorial</b> sustainable <b>development</b> which are participation, global and balanced approach to territories and partnership. The idea is to improve a territory by increasing the connection between research and action and between scientific rigour and the participation of actors and citizens. The complementarity of the participatory approach and individualized approach, the added value of the contribution of communities to the quality of scientific research and the interdisciplinary character of territorial sciences will emerge from this paper. Our research looks into the functioning of cities in the east of France, which have always experienced territorial, social, economic and demographic inequalities and disparities in terms of housing and residential migration, and wheter this functioning has led to socio-spatial segregation. Indeed, this phenomenon i...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{organization}} studies territories has repeatedly been contested as this review will highlight. These debates have included proponents {{for and against}} the convergence of the field, based upon beliefs that organization studies does or {{does not need to}} emulate the discipline status of a unified science such as physics. The ‘paradigm wars’ can equally be regarded as an academic ‘turf war’ and more recently ontological, epistemological and methodological shifts have resulted in a greater emphasis upon the centrality of discourse and practice within organization studies. Academic tribes and territories: Intellectual enquiry and the cultures of disciplines which is frequently cited within education studies, is rarely cited within organization studies. In the context of this Special Issue focussed upon The Territorial Organization a contribution to organizational studies is made in three substantial ways: through (1) engaging ethnographically with the cultures of organizational studies, (2) understanding how competing beliefs in convergence and divergence inform our understanding of the territorial nature of organization studies, and (3) understanding how <b>territorial</b> <b>developments</b> within education studies inform understanding about the territorial nature of organization studies...|$|R

Under the present conditions, increas-ing significance is gained by the conditionings of the development of particular regions, which should constitute the basis of the directions of development of given provinces. For this reason, this study presents the idea of factors and elements of territorial marketing of a region present in the literature on the subject in the context of competitiveness of the region. For several years ter-ritorial marketing, whose subject can be a commune, a district, a region, a state and also a special spatial unit with exceptional social and political, tourist and historic meaning, in particular land-scape and national parks as well as nature reserves and protected landscape regions, has started to {{play a significant role in}} development...|$|R

After responses by Vega Ramos and Charlie Hernández, Acevedo Vilá took responsibility for the loss and dismissed the conservative argument, while Miranda Marín directly questioned the honesty of the premise. While the latter began sounding as a potential governor candidate, the conservative wing responded by promoting the final draft of Colberg Toro's document for a <b>territorial</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Budapest is {{the fourth}} most [...] "dynamically growing city" [...] by {{population}} in Europe, and the Euromonitor predicts a population increase of almost 10% between 2005 and 2030. The European Observation Network for <b>Territorial</b> <b>Development</b> and Cohesion says Budapest's population will increase by 10% to 30% only due to migration by 2050. A constant inflow of migrants {{in recent years has}} fuelled population growth in Budapest. Productivity gains and the relatively large economically active share of the population explain why household incomes have increased in Budapest {{to a greater extent than}} in other parts of Hungary. Higher incomes in Budapest are reflected in the lower share of expenditure the city's inhabitants allocate to necessity spending such as food and non-alcoholic drinks.|$|E

In 1997, following the failed campaign of conservative Héctor Luis Acevedo for the governorship, representative Aníbal Acevedo Vilá became the president of the PPD. Under his presidency, a Status Commission led to the Caguas mayor William Miranda Marín and senator José Ortiz Dalliot, both liberals, to determine that there was an ideological disparity between the conservative message of past PPD presidents and the party's base. While Acevedo Vilá and other factions argued for a non <b>territorial</b> <b>development</b> to the Commonwealth, when US Rep. Don Young introduced United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act in 1997 {{the party was}} divided on its language and the proposed format, eventually leaving PROELA as the only faction that supported it.
