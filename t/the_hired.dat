5|$|Mark Gyrion, Daley's second cousin, was a {{superintendent}} of garages for the City's Water Management Department, and among his duties was deciding when City-owned trucks should be sold for scrap. Gyrion's mother-in-law's firm, Jacz Transportation, participated in <b>the</b> <b>Hired</b> Truck Program, receiving about $1 million between 1998 and 2004. Jacz Transportation bought a truck {{three days after}} the city sold it to a Franklin Park dealership and then leased it back to the city. Gyrion was accused of failing to disclose his mother-in-law's role in <b>the</b> <b>Hired</b> Truck Program and the transfer of the truck. Gyrion was fired and Jacz Transportation was one of 13 truck companies suspended from <b>the</b> <b>Hired</b> Truck program. About 35% of the 70 firms in the program were suspended or referred to the city's Inspector General. The program was overhauled in 2004, and phased out in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The $40 million-a-year Hired Truck {{program was}} the biggest scandal of Daley's first 15 years as mayor. <b>The</b> <b>Hired</b> Truck Program hired private truck {{companies}} to do city work. A six-month investigation by the Chicago Sun-Times resulted in a three-day series of articles in January 2004 that revealed some participating companies were being paid for doing little or no work, had American Mafia connections or were tied to city employees, or paid bribes {{to get into the}} program. Between 1996 and 2004, companies in <b>the</b> <b>Hired</b> Truck Program gave more than $800,000 in campaign contributions to various politicians, including Daley, House Speaker Michael Madigan, and Governor Rod Blagojevich; Daley received at least $108,575 and his brother John Daley and his ward organization more than $47,500.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>HIRE</b> Act {{was enacted}} in 2010. However, {{it is hard}} to {{estimate}} its effects.

5|$|In late July 2006, bus benches {{in several}} Californian cities were {{decorated}} with promotional artwork for Christ Illusion. City officials in Fullerton, California, demanded the artwork be immediately removed from seventeen bus benches located throughout the city, and contacted <b>the</b> <b>hired</b> company which had originally put the adverts {{in place to}} assume the task. The officials disliked the band's name, which they felt referred to a murderer. They also took offense to the antichrist and skull logo adorning the bench artwork. Eventually, the artwork was removed. However, various Orange County, California areas surrounding the city of Fullerton still had benches sporting the cover artwork.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley {{obtained}} commitments {{from over}} 80 prospective Park Grill investors, {{including some of}} Mayor Daley's friends and neighbors. Each share of the restaurant cost investors $200,000. Among the investors are Daley's friend Fred Barbara, a nephew of the late Chicago Alderman Fred Roti. Barbara has ties to <b>the</b> <b>Hired</b> Truck Program scandal and the blue bag recycling controversy. Other investors include relatives of Daley's political adviser Timothy Degnan, two neighbors of the mayor, Ray Chin, an O'Hare Airport contractor, and Rick Simon, a controversial figure who runs a janitorial business {{and sits on the}} board of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau. Also among the investors was Daley's cousin Theresa E. Mintle, then the Chicago Transit Authority’s director of governmental affairs and former congressman Morgan F. Murphy, who has had business dealings with convicted labor union official John Serpico. Among the vendors for Park Grill was an architectural metal company owned by the son of then Chicago Alderman Burton Natarus (42nd).|$|E
5|$|The French naval {{authorities}} considered Allemand's cruise a major {{success in}} a year that had cost them huge numbers of ships and men. In addition to Ranger and Calcutta, Allemand had captured <b>the</b> <b>hired</b> naval cutter Dove and 43 merchant ships, including the lumbering Brothers. With the exception of Calcutta, all of these prizes had been burnt and their prisoners had been transferred to the French squadron, 1,200 in total. For minimal casualties, Allemand had inflicted a blow against British Atlantic trade and tied up substantial Royal Navy resources during a complicated and strategically vital campaign. Calcutta was bought into the French Navy and became an armed storeship, still carrying the designated 50 guns. She served for three years before her destruction at the Battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809. Her British officers were later exchanged and honourably acquitted at the court-martial that investigated her loss.|$|E
50|$|In a {{contract}} manufacturing business model, <b>the</b> <b>hiring</b> firm approaches <b>the</b> contract manufacturer with a design or formula. The contract manufacturer will quote the parts based on processes, labor, tooling, and material costs.

5|$|Warhol {{arrived in}} New York City in 1949, {{directly}} from the School of Fine Arts at Carnegie Institute of Technology. He quickly achieved success as a commercial illustrator, and his first published drawing appeared in the Summer 1949 issue of Glamour Magazine. In 1952, he had his first art gallery show at the Bodley Gallery with a display of Truman Capote-inspired works. By 1955, he was tracing photographs borrowed from the New York Public Library's photo collection with <b>the</b> <b>hired</b> assistance of Nathan Gluck, and reproducing them with a process he had developed earlier as a collegian at Carnegie Tech. His process, which foreshadowed his later work, involved pressing wet ink illustrations against adjoining paper. During the 1950s, he had regular showings of his drawings, and exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (Recent Drawings, 1956).|$|E
5|$|Katherine Marlowe is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. She is the coldly calculating leader of a secret society whose roots date back over four hundred years {{to the court of}} Queen Elizabeth I. She has a long-standing rivalry with Nathan Drake over Sir Francis Drake’s ring – something they both contend is rightfully theirs and is also the key to an ancient mystery. Katherine Marlowe is a much more cerebral enemy than Drake has confronted in the past, using both psychological and physical tactics to get what she is after. Marlowe also has the assistance of her team of highly trained agents in this secret society – they are far more elusive and dangerous than <b>the</b> <b>hired</b> guns Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan have faced before. She treats her subordinates with slight disdain, getting annoyed with Talbot for hiring Charlie Cutter. Marlowe appears to have studied Nathan's past and reveals that he's not actually the direct decedent of Sir Francis Drake - he was merely in an orphanage named after the great explorer. She first meets a teenage Drake in Colombia, forcing him to give her the Cipher disk he had just stolen from a museum to her but fails to get Sir Francis Drakes ring when he runs off. Twenty years later, she meets with Drake in an Alleyway and steals his ring. However, she soon discovers it's a fake and promptly loses both the disc and the ring when Drake steals both. Marlowe then sends Talbot and her agents to France and Syria, successfully getting the clues to the location of Ubar. She then captures Nate and Sully and leaves for the lost city. Nathan eventually finds her using a winch to drag out King Solomon's hallucinogenic Talisman from the lakes in Ubar and destroys the foundations of the city, causing Marlowe to fall into a pool of quicksand. Though Drake attempts to save her, Marlowe submerges and dies.|$|E
