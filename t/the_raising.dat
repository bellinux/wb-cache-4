50|$|The total bet can {{be divided}} into two {{components}} - the call and <b>the</b> <b>raise,</b> both being usually called as Chaal. Each player has to place a bet that is at least equal to the previous player's bet, with <b>the</b> option of <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> bet. This bet then becomes the (new) current level of bet (Chaal). Usually there is a limit imposed to <b>the</b> <b>raise,</b> such that <b>the</b> total bet amount (with the call and <b>the</b> <b>raise)</b> cannot exceed twice that of the previous player's bet. Also, the bet should be in even amounts (2,4,6,8..), especially when there is one player still in the game as Blind player. It is because the player playing blind plays half of the normal bet, and odd amounts can't be halved.|$|R
