5|$|Following Suter's {{return from}} suspension, NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was {{supposed}} by Ducks Head Coach Pierre Pagé <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{that he would}} have given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya's injuries were immediately known. Later in the season, prior to a game between the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs in April 1998, Suter received a death threat, presumably for his actions against Kariya, forcing the NHL to position added security at the Blackhawks bench for the contest. With Kariya away from the team for extended periods of time, the Ducks struggled and finished second-last in the West.|$|E
5|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the creation of}} the Polish Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-creation of the Polish state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there. About the Polish Legion, Napoleon himself is reputed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. The President does not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E

5|$|Sai Baba also {{condemned}} distinction {{based on}} religion or caste. It remains unclear {{if he was}} a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba. His teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived, practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone's Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> Look to me, and I shall look to you.|$|E

25|$|Ali pledged {{allegiance}} (bay'ah) to Abu Bakr {{six months}} after the latter became caliph.

25|$|The Austrian {{covering}} force was entrenched and though Clerfayt was in nominal command, Coburg {{was on the}} scene and in control of the battle. Coburg was so certain of success that he was supposed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that if he were defeated, he would become a sans-culotte. This story made the rounds in the French army and made its soldiers eager to make the Coalition commander wear trousers.|$|E
25|$|Defence {{minister}} Ljungberg {{had informed}} the military {{leadership of the}} government's decision to mobilize at around 0200hrs on 9 April. Both Laake and the general staff understood the orders from Ljungberg to entail a partial and silent mobilization. This led to much confusion amongst both {{the military and the}} civilian population. At the same time, minister of foreign affairs Halvdan Koht was reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that orders for a general mobilization had been issued.|$|E

25|$|The Portolá Expedition of 1769, {{one of the}} two expeditions {{that led}} to the {{founding}} of Los Angeles, camped at the Kuruvunga village while travelling along the route that would become known as El Camino Real.

In the 1800s, the spring served as the water supply for the city of Santa Monica.|$|E
25|$|Cato is {{represented}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that he served his first campaign in his 17th year, when Hannibal was overrunning Italy. Plutarch, {{who had the}} works of Cato before him but was careless in dates, did not observe that the estimation of Livy would take back Cato's 17th year to 222, when {{there was not a}} Carthaginian in Italy, whereas the computation of Cicero would make the truth of Cato's statement in harmony with the date of Hannibal's first invasion.|$|E
