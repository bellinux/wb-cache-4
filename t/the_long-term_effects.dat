5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of high {{unemployment}} and social unrest, and many critics {{on the left}} of the political spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment as well as her monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). <b>The</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of inflation, {{notably the}} {{significant}} increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while {{commonly found in}} the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and {{a significant increase in the}} number of part-time staff. The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E

30|$|When an {{individual}} receives {{more than one}} treatment {{during the course of}} the unemployment spell, only the first occurrence will be selected. This can either be a referral, an invitation, or an automatic referral. If a second treatment occurs at a later moment, the unemployment duration is right censored at that point. For each of the three treatment types, we distinguish between the immediate <b>effect</b> and <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> (van den Berg et al. 2014). The immediate effect relates to the month during which the treatment was obtained and the subsequent month. <b>The</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> relates to all later months in the unemployment spell.|$|R
5|$|WINDALCO {{reported}} {{a loss of}} 10,000tons of aluminum due to flooding. Manufacturing companies reported J$18.3million (US$296,000) in losses, primarily from suspended operations. In November, the Jamaica Labour Party sought J$3.2billion (US$51.8million) in additional funding to repair roads damaged by Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, Emily, and Wilma. The following month, the Jamaica Agricultural Society received J$5.5million (US$88,266) from the Japanese embassy to assist 500farmers in Portland Parish. <b>The</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of Dennis were limited, with nearly every economic sector returning to normal within a few months. The only exceptions were exports of banana and coffee crops, {{both of which were}} still recovering from Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Overall implications to the nation's gross domestic product were negligible, merely flat-lining growth rather than causing decline. However, in combination with the effects of a drought early in 2005, inflation values required adjustment upwards from 9% to 14.3%.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{knowledge}} of the taxonomy, biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment {{of the risk of}} species extinctions from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. <b>The</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E

5|$|Yet such flaws {{were not}} {{immediately}} obvious {{and by the}} second half of 1967 the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province seemed to have melted away, abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long Tan and Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted Graham to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. He reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effects</b> of Australian operations in the province which had increased the population's sense of security. During his tour of duty the task force had conducted 32 operations before he handed over command in October 1967. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E

40|$|Reliable {{modelling}} of sulfide and methane {{production in}} sewer systems {{is required for}} efficient sewer emission management. Wastewater compositions affect sulfide and methane production kinetics through both its short-term variation influencing the substrate availability to sewer biofilms, and its <b>long-term</b> variation affecting <b>the</b> sewer biofilm structure. While the short-term effect is well considered in existing sewer models {{with the use of}} Monod or half-order equations, <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> has not been explicitly considered in current sewer models suitable for network modelling. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> of wastewater compositions on sulfide and methane production activities in rising main sewers was investigated. A detailed biofilm model was firstly developed, and then calibrated and validated using experimental data measured during the entire biofilm development period of a laboratory sewer reactor. Based on scenario simulations using the detailed biofilm model, empirical equations describing <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>effect</b> of sulfate and sCOD (soluble chemical oxygen demand) concentrations on kH 2 S (the maximum sulfide production rate of sewer biofilm) and kCH 4 (the maximum methane production rate of sewer biofilm) were proposed.
