5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E

Peter attempts to defend himself, but Morlun proves <b>too</b> <b>powerful.</b> Morlun brings down the Globe Theater around everyone, and absorbs Peter's life essence. Before disappearing into another dimension, Morlun declares that all spiders will die.|$|E
5|$|Meta Knight {{also appears}} in three {{installments}} of the Super Smash Bros. video game series; in Super Smash Bros. Melee, he {{appears in the}} form of a trophy, and in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he is a playable character. However, Meta Knight was removed from professional gaming competitions in the United States and Canada due to being considered <b>too</b> <b>powerful.</b> Meta Knight returned as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U after the series' director, Masahiro Sakurai, assured some changes to re-add him; among the changes, Meta Knight lost his ability to glide, and his unrivaled attack speed was toned down.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 1098, the crusaders {{defeated}} Kerbogha in a pitched battle {{outside the}} city, a victory caused by Kerbogha's inability {{to organize the}} different factions in his army. While the crusaders were marching towards the Muslims, the Fatimid section of the army deserted the Turkish contingent, as they feared Kerbogha would become <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> were he able to defeat the Crusaders. According to Christian eyewitnesses, an army of Christian saints came {{to the aid of}} the crusaders during the battle and crippled Kerbogha's army.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1787, the {{convention}} received a tentative draft {{written by a}} Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason {{as a basis for}} discussion, containing such points important to him as the requirement that money bills originate in the House and not be amendable in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was <b>too</b> <b>powerful,</b> as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt {{fall of the}} Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may {{reflect the fact that}} the Barmakids may have become indeed <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was {{to have a chance to}} succeed, the power of the Barmakids had to be broken. Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E
50|$|Henry's {{principal}} {{problem was}} to restore royal authority in a realm {{recovering from the}} Wars of the Roses. There were <b>too</b> many <b>powerful</b> noblemen and, {{as a consequence of}} the system of so-called bastard feudalism, each had what amounted to private armies of indentured retainers (mercenaries masquerading as servants).|$|R

5|$|As the {{flagship}} of Admiral Juan de Lángara, the ship fought at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 16January 1780, {{where she was}} captured by the British Royal Navy and commissioned as the third rate HMS Gibraltar in March of that year. She spent a short while in the English Channel before joining Samuel Hood's squadron in the West Indies and {{taking part in the}} Capture of St Eustatius in February 1781 and the Battle of Fort Royal the following month. Gibraltar and five other ships were sent to stop a French invasion fleet bound for Tobago in May 1781, but found the French <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> and had to withdraw. In November, her 18-pound guns were replaced with 24-pounders, after which, in February 1782, she sailed to the East Indies and in the following year participated in the Battle of Cuddalore.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that Khiêm was {{involved}} in the plot, Khánh had him exiled to Washington as ambassador, and eased General Dương Văn Minh out of the political scene, thereby removing the other two nominal members of the ruling triumvirate. However, concerned that Kỳ and Thi had become <b>too</b> <b>powerful,</b> Khánh had Phát and Đức acquitted at their military trial in an attempt to use them as political counterweights. Despite his survival, the coup was seen by the historian George McTurnan Kahin as the start of Khánh's ultimate political decline. Due to the intervention of Kỳ and Thi, Khánh was now indebted to them, and in an attempt to maintain his power in the face of increasing military opposition, he tried to court support from Buddhist civilian activists, who supported negotiations with the communists to end the Vietnam War. As the Americans were strongly opposed to such policies, relations with Khánh became increasingly strained and he was deposed in February 1965 with US connivance.|$|E
5|$|Harvey’s other Test {{match was}} between Australia and the West Indies at the MCG during the Christmas-New Year period of 197980. It was {{won by the}} {{visitors}} by 10 wickets, with a bowling attack of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Croft, and Joel Garner proving <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> for their hosts. Harvey’s colleague was Tony Crafter. Harvey also stood in four ODIs played during the inaugural World Series Cup that season, which involved England, Australia and the West Indies. He presided {{in three of the}} round-robin matches, the third of which was between the two visiting teams at the Gabba. It was the only time that Harvey umpired a match at his adopted home ground. He later presided over the first match of the finals series, between the West Indies and England at the MCG. This was his sixth and final appointment at ODI level. Harvey also officiated three Shield matches, Queensland’s tour match against England and one of their domestic one-dayers during the season.|$|E
40|$|When is {{regulation}} {{more efficient}} than competition? This column provides a theoretical framework for thinking about these issues and explores its implications using electricity data from the US. It argues regulation can be {{more efficient than}} competition when investment inducement is salient, and that deregulation can be inefficiently implemented when consumer groups are <b>too</b> politically <b>powerful...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{spirits in}} the series are ranked into 7 major classes; Sub-Imp, Imp, Foliot, Djinni, Afrit, Marid & Super-Marid in order of {{ascending}} power. Sub-Imps were rarely named as they weren't worth summoning or studying. Super-Marids were also ill understood, however for a different reason; they were far <b>too</b> intelligent, <b>powerful</b> & often destructive to summon.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after George's {{accession}} in Hanover, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out. At {{issue was}} the right of Philip, the grandson of King Louis XIV of France, to succeed to the Spanish throne {{under the terms of}} King Charles II of Spain's will. The Holy Roman Empire, the United Dutch Provinces, England, Hanover and many other German states opposed Philip's right to succeed because they feared that the French House of Bourbon would become <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> if it also controlled Spain. As part of the war effort, George invaded his neighbouring state, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, which was pro-French, writing out some of the battle orders himself. The invasion succeeded with few lives lost. As a reward, the prior Hanoverian annexation of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg by George's uncle was recognised by the British and Dutch.|$|E
5|$|The 1704 {{campaign}} lasted considerably {{longer than}} usual as the Allies sought to wring out maximum advantage. Realising that France was <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> {{to be forced to}} make peace by a single victory, however, Eugene, Marlborough and Baden met to plan their next moves. For the following year the Duke proposed a campaign along the valley of the River Moselle to carry the war deep into France. This required the capture of the major fortress of Landau which guarded the Rhine, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle itself. Trier was taken on 27 October and Landau fell on 23 November to the Margrave of Baden and Prince Eugene; with the fall of Trarbach on 20 December, the campaign season for 1704 came to an end.|$|E
5|$|Vitus Bering {{had been}} a {{prominent}} sailor in Russia. After successful expeditions in 1725, 1728, and 1730, Bering was sent to explore {{what is now the}} Bering Sea area of the Pacific in 1740. He soon settled on Kamchatka, where he started a settlement and built two additional vessels, dubbed St. Peter and St. Paul. In 1741 Bering and his company started towards North America, but were stalled by a storm and in being delayed were forced to take land. During the storm they could not make out the Alaskan coast. The storm proved <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> so the ships turned around, along the way charting several of the Aleutians, including Gareloi. Since then, it has been barely studied, resulting in a fragmentary knowledge of its eruptions and possibly even unrecorded episodes.|$|E

5|$|With Delilah being <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> {{to defeat}} by normal means, Sokolov {{suggests}} the player investigate {{the home of}} mining magnate Aramis Stilton (Richard Cansino). Upon entering Stilton's mansion, the player discovers that he had gone insane after witnessing Delilah's resurrection. With {{the aid of a}} timepiece granted by the Outsider, the player travels back in time and observes the Duke, Jindosh, and Ashworth pull Delilah from the Void. Afterwards, Delilah siphons part of her soul into a statue, effectively making her immortal. The player invades the Duke's palace to eliminate him and retrieve Delilah's soul. After either killing the Duke or working with his body double to depose him, the player finds the statue and extracts Delilah's soul. With Delilah's soul in hand, the player returns to Dunwall for a final confrontation with Delilah. After reuniting Delilah with her soul, the player may choose to kill Delilah or trick her into trapping herself inside her own painting.|$|E
5|$|In 1138 King Stephen chose Theobald to {{fill the}} vacant archbishopric of Canterbury over Stephen's own brother Henry, the Bishop of Winchester, who had helped Stephen gain the throne of England. Stephen feared that Henry would be <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> as archbishop, and would attempt to control the king. The {{election}} took place on 24December; Stephen was present with the papal legate, Alberic of Ostia, and {{a small group of}} barons and bishops, but Henry was absent overseeing the ordination of deacons. Most historians consider that Stephen arranged the election's timing to ensure Henry's absence. Henry believed that Theobald had been elected not only because of Stephen's concerns but also because Waleran of Meulan, the lay patron of Bec, was attempting to put his own man {{in one of the most}} powerful positions in England. Waleran and his twin brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, were Henry's chief rivals for Stephen's favour, and Henry disliked both of them intensely. Although Theobald was pious and well-educated, he had only become abbot the year before, and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery, which had already produced two archbishops of Canterbury, Lanfranc and Anselm. Theobald had no important family connections to advance his career, and few clerical allies.|$|E
5|$|In September, the Catholic Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức {{launched}} a coup after being demoted by Khánh {{in response to}} Buddhist pressure; Phát was a well-known Diệm loyalist. They were supported by the Đại Việt, Khiêm and Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo. While Thảo was also a Catholic, he was an undetected communist spy who tried to foment infighting at every opportunity. The coup failed and Khánh exiled Khiêm to Washington as ambassador, and his close friend Thảo was sent along as press attache. Concerned that Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and General Nguyễn Chánh Thi—who had put down the coup attempt for him—had become <b>too</b> <b>powerful,</b> Khánh had Phát and Duc acquitted in their military trial {{in an effort to}} use them as a political counterweight. However, the coup was seen as the start of Khánh's ultimate political decline. Due to the intervention of Kỳ and Thi, Khánh was now indebted to them. In an attempt to maintain his political power in the face of increasing opposition from within the junta, he tried to court support from Buddhist civilian activists, who supported negotiations with the communists to end the war. As the Americans were strongly opposed to such policies, relations with Khánh became increasingly strained.|$|E
50|$|Similar to Basutoland, Scanlen's {{government}} {{wished to}} dis-annex the Transkei (another costly and turbulent territory which Sprigg had conquered). However Scanlen faced {{the problem of}} British opposition to this move.

5|$|Returning to Cuba, Castro {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure in {{protests against the}} government’s attempts to raise bus fares, a mode of transport used mostly by students and workers. That year, Castro married Mirta Díaz Balart, a student from a wealthy family through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite. The relationship was a love match, disapproved of by both families. Mirta’s father gave them {{tens of thousands of}} dollars to spend in a three-month honeymoon in New York City, and the couple also received a U.S. $1,000 wedding gift from the military general and former president Fulgencio Batista, a friend of Mirta’s family. That same year, Grau decided not to stand for re-election, which was instead won by his Partido Auténticos new candidate, Carlos Prío Socarrás. Prío faced widespread protests when members of the MSR, now allied to the police force, assassinated Justo Fuentes, a self-educated black Cuban who was a prominent UIR member and friend of Castro's. In response, Prío agreed to quell the gangs, but found them <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> to control.|$|E
5|$|The guns {{proved to}} be <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> for Furious light hull, and they became {{available}} for other uses during 1917, after trials showed the ship could not handle the stress of firing. Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, commander of the Dover Patrol, conceived a plan to mount two guns inside the shell of the Palace Hotel in Westende from where they could bombard the naval facilities at Zeebrugge and Bruges, provided that the hotel was captured during the upcoming Battle of Passchendaele. He planned to transport the guns across the English Channel lashed to the torpedo bulges of monitors. He also thought {{that they could be}} used on the decks of monitors and as such a dual purpose carriage was designed for the guns, which could be used both afloat and ashore. Only a limited amount of traverse was required for either role, but elevation had to be increased to 45° to maximize range. The concept was approved 23 September 1917, and Elswick was ordered to design the new 'B CD' mounts for delivery in five months.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mina finds Hansel {{hanging from}} a tree. She takes him to a nearby spring where she heals his wounds and makes love to him.

Edward tends Gretel's wounds and tells her that he helped her because trolls serve witches. Hansel and Gretel reunite at an abandoned cabin which they discover is both a witch's lair and their childhood home. Muriel appears in front of them, telling them the truth of their past. She reveals that Hansel and Gretel's mother was a grand white witch named Adrianna who married a farmer. On {{the night of the}} last Blood Moon, Muriel planned to use the heart of the white witch to complete her potion. She found Adrianna <b>too</b> <b>powerful</b> and decided to use Gretel's heart instead. To get rid of Adrianna, Muriel revealed to the townspeople that Adrianna was a witch. The resulting angry mob burned her alive and hanged Hansel and Gretel's father. Following this revelation, the siblings battle Muriel before she stabs Hansel and abducts Gretel for the ceremony.|$|E
