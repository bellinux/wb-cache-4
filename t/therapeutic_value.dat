5|$|Lilly's {{greatest}} {{contributions to}} the industry were his standardized and methodical production of drugs, his dedication to research and development, and the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> of the drugs he created. As {{a pioneer in the}} modern pharmaceutical industry, many of his innovations later became standard practice. Lilly's ethical reforms, in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines, began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs. During his lifetime, Lilly had advocated for federal regulation on medicines; his son, Josiah, continued that advocacy following his father's death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced Plasmodium vivax malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as Treponema pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of chemotherapeutic research and was practised until 1950. Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> of malaria inoculation {{in the treatment of}} dementia paralytica.|$|E

40|$|Honey {{has been}} used as a {{therapeutic}} agent since ancient times for health maintenance and the treatment of various ailments. In modern days, researchers reappraised the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>values</b> of honey, such as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, anti-tumor, and wound healing properties. These findings supported its applications in the modern healthcare system as complementary medicine. Gelam honey (GH) is a monofloral Malaysian honey which has been proven to have considerable health benefits. This paper presents a state of the art review on the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>values</b> of GH. A descriptive elucidation is performed to elaborate a wide spectrum of biological activities of GH using evidence from a considerable body of literature. The compositional and physiochemical characteristics of GH have contributed substantially to its putative biological properties.

25|$|Buddhism and {{the modern}} {{discipline}} of Psychology have multiple parallels and points of overlap. This includes a descriptive phenomenology of mental states, emotions and behaviors, as well as theories of perception and unconscious mental factors. Psychotherapists such as Erich Fromm have found in Buddhist enlightenment experiences (e.g. kensho) the potential for transformation, healing and finding existential meaning. Some contemporary mental-health practitioners such as Jon Kabat-Zinn increasingly find ancient Buddhist practices (such as the development of mindfulness) of empirically proven <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value,</b> while Buddhist teachers such as Jack Kornfield see Western Psychology as providing complementary practices for Buddhists.|$|E
25|$|A {{turning point}} in Panizza's life came in 1883, when the thirty-year-old {{convinced}} his mother, who had profitably sold her hotel, to establish a trust that would provide him with an annual allowance of six thousands marks. With this financial backing, he abandoned medicine in 1884 and devoted himself exclusively to literary pursuits. While suffering a major depression that year, Panizza had discovered the curative and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> of writing. His first three volumes of poetry were rather crude constructions in jagged tetrameter, consciously inspired by Heinrich Heine: Düstre Lieder (1886), Londoner Lieder (1887) and Legendäres und Fabelhaftes (1889).|$|E

25|$|In 1987, Jan Lawson Hinely {{argued that}} this play has a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value.</b> Shakespeare in many ways explores the sexual fears of the characters, {{releases}} them, and transforms them. And the happy ending is the reestablishment of social harmony. Patriarchy itself is also challenged and transformed, as the men offer their women a loving equality, one founded on respect and trust. She even viewed Titania's loving acceptance of the donkey-headed Bottom {{as a metaphor for}} basic trust. This trust is what enables the warring and uncertain lovers to achieve their sexual maturity. In 1988, Allen Dunn argued that the play is an exploration of the characters' fears and desires, and that its structure is based on a series of sexual clashes.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatments}} such as nerve grafting, tendon lengthening, tendon transfers, {{and limb}} lengthening and shortening were used extensively during this time. Patients with residual paralysis {{were treated with}} braces and taught to compensate for lost function {{with the help of}} calipers, crutches and wheelchairs. The use of devices such as rigid braces and body casts, which tended to cause muscle atrophy due to the limited movement of the user, were also touted as effective treatments. Massage and passive motion exercises were also used to treat polio victims. Most of these treatments proved to be of little <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value,</b> however several effective supportive measures for the treatment of polio did emerge during these decades including the iron lung, an anti-polio antibody serum, and a treatment regimen developed by Sister Elizabeth Kenny.|$|E
25|$|ECT {{soon became}} {{more popular than}} cardiazol {{convulsion}} therapy in mental hospitals in the UK. It was quickly identified as being especially useful {{in the treatment of}} affective psychosis. The <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> of ECT in schizophrenia was recognised as limited, but some psychiatrists saw it as useful to control the behaviour of institutionalised patients who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Some psychiatrists thought that ECT should be restricted to the treatment of depression; others used it in the treatment {{of a wide variety of}} disorders, for example, schizophrenia, epilepsy, neurosis, and hysteria. It was also used on people who had suffered war trauma. By the mid 1950s there was a 20 fold difference in the rate of ECT use in mental hospitals in the UK, and a similar difference in its rate of use in teaching hospitals. In the 1940s and 1950s ECT machines used sine-wave current and patients were given a shock lasting a fraction of a second.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of deliberate cranial deformation or flattening {{is well documented}} among the pre-Columbian Maya peoples, and is evidenced from the Preclassic era onwards. By the use of cradleboards and other compression techniques applied to the growing skull from infancy, a variety of head-shapes were fashioned, with different regions and time-periods exhibiting a difference in style and ideal. The practice was applied to both males and females, and was not thought to be particularly associated with class or social standing. It was widely adopted however, {{to the point where}} one particular study which examined over 1,500 skulls drawn from across the Maya region determined that at least 88% exhibited some form of intentional cranial deformation. These practices have no known <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> although they may have been intertwined with the expression of Maya cultural values, beliefs and identity. It is argued by some scholars in the field such as Vera Tiesler, that trepanation among the Maya was also imbued with a culturally-significant meaning apart from any medical benefit.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is a {{phenanthrene}} {{opioid receptor}} agonist– its main effect is binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptors {{in the central}} nervous system. Its intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the assay and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a full agonist while in others {{it can be a}} partial agonist or even antagonist. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the μ-opioid receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Morphine is also a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal analgesia, miosis (pinpoint pupils) and psychotomimetic effects. δ-Opioid is thought {{to play a role in}} analgesia. Although morphine does not bind to the σ-receptor, it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-pentazocine, inhibit morphine analgesia, and σ-antagonists enhance morphine analgesia, suggesting downstream involvement of the σ-receptor in the actions of morphine.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1918, Dr. Cadbury treated lepers, {{who were}} outpatients in the Canton Hospital leprosy clinic, for one year. The Canton Hospital {{was the first}} to have an {{organized}} leprosy clinic in China. He injected these patients with a mixture of chaulmoogra oil, resorcin, and camphorated oil. Then, he reported the results in The China Medical Journal in 1920. He wrote:"We must state that the various remedies, as outlined above, while in most cases of leprosy they have definite <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value,</b> yet unless the patients are cared for in a sanatorium, given proper food, together with baths and attention to personal hygiene, a complete cure can hardly be looked for."In 1926, Dr. Cadbury tackled widespread issue of Chinese children not knowing their birth dates. He collected information from 1013 Cantonese children. His calculations to estimate the ages of these children revealed an understanding of the customs of the Canton people. For example, he learned that most of the children claimed they were born in August, September, and October most likely due to the tradition that Canton merchants were gone for most of the year except around Chinese New Year.|$|E
