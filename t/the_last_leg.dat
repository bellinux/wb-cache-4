40|$|Secondary sexual {{characters}} in centipedes are briefly discussed {{and it is}} suggested that the spines on the prefemora of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> pair of <b>legs</b> in some scolopendrids are used in specific discrimination prior to mating. The hypothesis is discussed with reference to Scolopendra spp. of the eastern Mediterranean, north-east Africa and Arabia. Where species of Scolopendra with virtually identical spinulation on <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>legs</b> are sympatric, a large size difference exists between them. It is suggested that in some genera where the prefemoral spines are absent, speciation may have been inhibited.

5|$|During the English {{winter of}} 1922–23, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{selected}} {{a team to}} tour Australia and New Zealand. This side, captained by Archie MacLaren and composed mainly of amateurs, was not particularly strong and contained several players chosen for their social standing rather than cricketing ability. The team played four first-class games in Australia against state teams; the first was drawn {{and the others were}} lost. After scores of 75 and 58 against Western Australia, Chapman played consecutive innings of 53, 73 and 69 against South Australia and Victoria, followed by 100 in the most eagerly awaited match of the tour against a strong New South Wales side. The press and public praised his attacking batting and his fielding, although Frank Iredale, a former Test cricketer, noticed some flaws in his technique. When the team moved on to New Zealand, after an uncertain start Chapman scored 533 runs at an average of 48.45, including two centuries. The tourists returned to Australia for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>leg</b> of the tour; Chapman scored 91 against New South Wales and 134 in 142 minutes against South Australia.

5|$|Channel 4's {{coverage}} of the Games was billed as the most extensive Paralympic coverage ever broadcast in the United Kingdom; it promised over 150 hours of live coverage throughout the Games on Channel 4 and sister channel More4, and additional coverage online and through special channels carried by Freesat, Sky and Virgin TV (in both standard and high definition). The broadcaster also invested around £600,000 towards training new on-air personalities with expertise in disability sports for the Games, {{many of whom were}} disabled themselves—they would also be joined by Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow, and BBC Sport personality Clare Balding. Channel 4 also broadcast supplemental programming to lead towards the Games, such as Paralympic-focused documentaries, other IPC championships, and That Paralympic Show, a weekly program focusing on disability sports.
