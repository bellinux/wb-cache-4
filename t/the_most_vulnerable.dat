5|$|Any German {{invasion}} of Britain {{would have to}} involve the landing of troops and equipment somewhere on the coast, and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> areas were {{the south and east}} coasts of England. Here, Emergency Coastal Batteries were constructed to protect ports and likely landing places. They were fitted with whatever guns were available, which mainly came from naval vessels scrapped {{since the end of the}} First World War. These included 6inch (152mm), 5.5inch (140mm), 4.7inch (120mm) and 4inch (102mm) guns. These had little ammunition, sometimes as few as ten rounds apiece. At Dover, two 14inch (356mm) guns known as Winnie and Pooh were employed. There were also a few land based torpedo launching sites.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Puerto Cabezas, {{population}} 60,000, meteorologists expected a direct hit. Local authorities announced a curfew to prevent looting.

5|$|As {{with other}} primates, {{one of the}} {{principal}} threats to both ruffed lemur species is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining. Both species appear to be very sensitive to logging, and are thought to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> of rainforest lemurs. The hardwoods that are favored for construction materials and selectively logged are also preferred by ruffed lemurs for their fruits and potentially affect their travel routes through the canopy. Deforestation, on the other hand, {{is a result of the}} need to provide firewood and to support subsistence agriculture and cash crops. For red ruffed lemurs, Slash-and-burn agriculture, known locally as tavy, is practiced seasonally on the Masoala peninsula between October and December, and its practice is expanding. Additionally, cattle are sometimes allowed to free-range over these former agricultural clearings, preventing forest re-growth.|$|E

5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are {{in a part of}} the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable,</b> particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Onjong, the Chinese recognized the ROK II Corps as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> unit of the Eighth Army. Besides lacking the firepower of their US counterpart, the ROK II Corps also held the most difficult terrain on the UN right flank. At 10 a.m. on November 24, the ROK 7th Infantry Division on the II Corps' left flank attacked north from Tokchon. At the same time, the ROK 8th Infantry Division on the II Corps' right flank advanced north from Yongwon. The stubborn defenses by the PVA 38th and 42nd Corps soon ground the Korean advances to a halt, and the continuous fighting for the next two days failed to create any gains for the Koreans. During the advances, the Chinese defenses managed to create a wedge {{in the center of the}} ROK 7th Infantry Division, forcing the division to commit most of its reserves on the front line. Meanwhile, the ROK 6th Infantry Division in the II Corps' rear could only offer its 2nd Infantry Regiment as the corps' reserve due to the earlier losses at Onjong.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Essex's {{campaign}} failed, {{suffering a}} total defeat at the Battle of Lostwithiel in early September 1644.

Blake {{was aware of the}} vulnerability of Taunton, which, unlike many towns and cities of the time, did not have any town walls. On {{the eastern side of the}} town, which was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable,</b> he dug trenches outside the Eastern gate and erected a barricade across the street within it. At least three earthen forts were also built in that end of town. King Charles I held council in Chard, and shortly after ordered a Royalist force numbering 3,000 troops to set up the first siege of Taunton. Initially, Sir Francis Dodington was going to command the attack, but the only available men were those in Bridgwater under the command of Colonel Edmund Wyndham.|$|E

5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E
5|$|On October29, Honduras President Ricardo Maduro {{declared}} a State of National Emergency as Beta was forecast to bring heavy rains up to 12in (300mm). Three departments, Gracias a Dios, Colon, Olancho and El Paraiso, were placed under Red Alert and mandatory evacuations {{were put in}} place. The departments of Atlántida, Yoro, Comayagua, Francisco Morazán and Choluteca were placed under Yellow Alert and a Green Alert was {{in place for the}} rest of the country. The Local Emergency Management Agency opened its regional and municipal offices to conduct preparative activities. An emergency radio network was set up to alert the public of any emergencies. The government designated several public schools as shelters for the affected population. In the Francisco Morazán Department, the Tegucigalpa Municipal Emergency Committee opened 73 shelters. Extensive cleaning and garbage disposal was conducted, especially around creeks, rivers, and sewers. The National Armed Forces were placed in strategic areas and were on stand-by for search and rescue operations once the storm passed. About 3,306tons (3,000tonnes) of food was reported to be available and local travels in the country were suspended. In Tegucigalpa, the emergency committee called for the evacuation of 125,000 people from <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> areas of the capital. About 8,000 others were evacuated from 50 communities along the Nicaragua border due to the threat of flooding. A hurricane alert was put in place for areas north of the Nicaragua border but was cancelled on October30 after Beta turned towards the southeast.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} Conwy were built at {{around the same}} time as the castle itself, under the overall {{supervision}} of Master James of Saint George, Edward's chief architect in North Wales. Each summer huge numbers of labourers were mobilised from across England, massed at Chester, and then brought into Wales for the building season. The first phase of work on the walls in 1283 involved digging ditches and erecting a palisade around the future town to secure the area in order to allow further work to commence. The stone walls and towers were then constructed in three phases. Between 1284 and 1285, Richard the Engineer, Master James' second in command in North Wales, built the western side of the walls; this was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> side of the town and was deliberately given priority. In 1286, John Francis, a Savoyard mason, finished the south wall and in 1287 the remainder of the walls along the eastern quayside were completed under the supervision of Philip of Darley. Edward's accountants did not separate the costs of the town walls from that of the castle, and the total cost of the two projects came to around £15,000, a huge sum for the period.|$|E
