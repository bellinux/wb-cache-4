5000|$|The Code makes a {{distinction}} between certain classes of beneficiaries {{with respect to the}} traditional reporting requirements for trustees with respect to the assets and transactions actually held in the trust. Under the older common law, only current beneficiaries (sometimes termed [...] "income beneficiaries") were entitled to receive reports or accountings of <b>trust</b> <b>transactions</b> and that such reports were sufficient to protect the interest of those current beneficiaries. [...] However, the Code has now permitted [...] "qualified beneficiaries" [...] to at least be informed of their right to receive a trustee's periodic report of <b>trust</b> <b>transactions</b> and assets and are entitled to receive it if they do in fact request it. [...] "Qualified beneficiaries" [...] are defined as a beneficiary who, on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined: (A) is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (B) would become a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if a present distributees' interest ended on that date without causing the trust to terminate; or (C) would become a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust did terminate on that date. [...] Essentially, this means that future beneficiaries (i.e., children or grandchildren) might be exposed to information that the grantor only intended to pass to the current beneficiaries. Although the UTC limited the reporting requirements to trustees accepting duties after the Code's enactment, a number of states have changed the standard UTC language, often in response to concerns from corporate trustees of the unwieldiness of such requirements and the danger that future trust beneficiaries may interfere and create contention concerning the operation of the trust.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sketches}} broadly {{the efficiency}} and equity effects of income trusts that make their use {{as a substitute for}} the direct holding of shares of a corporation problematic for tax policy purposes. The paper also considers the potential effectiveness of an equity recharacterization rule applicable to the high-yield junk debt that is the common feature of the basic income trust structure. The author suggests that this type of narrowly focused rule would be more target-efficient than other possible responses to income trusts, such as fundamental reform of the corporate income tax or the restrictions on the holding of trust units proposed in the 2004 budget. However, a principal difficulty in designing an equity recharacterization rule is ensuring that it applies equally to structures that realize the same effect as the basic income trust structure but do not use high-yield junk debt. The author argues that income trusts are examples of tax-driven financial innovation {{in the sense that they}} replicate an existing set of securities and therefore have no nontax rationale. These securities are essentially redundant, and the innovative process of which they are a product does not constitute “genuine” financial innovation. This essential characteristic of income trusts distinguishes them from real estate investment trusts, which arguably do not present a tax policy problem (or at least not the same one). More particularly, income <b>trust</b> <b>transactions</b> are redundant in the sense that they do not complete capital markets by providing investors with a risk and return payoff profile that is otherwise unavailable. In the absence of any efficiency gains or desirable distributional effects associated with income trusts, the available tax benefit is the subject of a defensible government response intended to eliminate it. But without any clear evidence that income trusts are substituted generally for the corporate form, any response can defensibly be limited to a narrowly targeted one that introduces a “taxlaw friction” by shifting the debt-equity boundary that is the focus of the basic income trust structure. Because the precise dividing points along this boundary lack any obvious normative content, the suggested policy focus should be the development of a legislative response that redraws the debt-equity boundary in a manner that minimizes perceived efficiency losses otherwise associated with the use of income trusts. <br /...|$|E

Reliability in Grids can be enhanced by both way model. The user is satisfied with resource provider’s ability and the same is true in reverse case also. Trust relationship must be established between resource provider and user. Reputation decides the trustworthiness of an entity, whereby opinion of other entities is also sought. In this paper we propose a model which allows only <b>trusted</b> <b>transactions</b> for both providers and users which improves security in Grid computing. I...|$|R
40|$|How {{to develop}} a trust {{management}} model and then to efficiently control and manage nodes {{is an important issue}} in the scope of social network security. In this paper, a trust management model based on a cloud model is proposed. The cloud model uses a specific computation operator to achieve the transformation from qualitative concepts to quantitative computation. Additionally, this {{can also be used to}} effectively express the fuzziness, randomness and the relationship between them of the subjective trust. The node trust is divided into reputation <b>trust</b> and <b>transaction</b> <b>trust.</b> In addition, evaluation methods are designed, respectively. Firstly, the two-dimension trust cloud evaluation model is designed based on node’s comprehensive and trading experience to determine the reputation trust. The expected value reflects the average trust status of nodes. Then, entropy and hyper-entropy are used to describe the uncertainty of trust. Secondly, the calculation methods of the proposed direct <b>transaction</b> <b>trust</b> and the recommendation <b>transaction</b> <b>trust</b> involve comprehensively computation of the <b>transaction</b> <b>trust</b> of each node. Then, the choosing strategies were designed for node to trade based on trust cloud. Finally, the results of a simulation experiment in P 2 P network file sharing on an experimental platform directly reflect the objectivity, accuracy and robustness of the proposed model, and could also effectively identify the malicious or unreliable service nodes in the system. In addition, this can be used to promote the service reliability of the nodes with high credibility, by which the stability of the whole network is improved...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that trust is a mechanism of relational governance, which can influence the costs associated with the formation, development and maintenance of interorganizational relationships, in this article one aims to test the relation between <b>trust</b> and <b>transaction</b> costs in these relationships. Based on the literature on <b>trust</b> and on <b>transaction</b> costs, one puts forward four new hypotheses, which suggest a negative relation between trust and costs of information, of negotiation, of implementation and of monitoring in interorganizational relationships. These hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analysis in a quantitative case study where the buyer is illustrated by an automaker and its suppliers are represented by a sample of the major ones. The results suggest that there are significant, yet negative relations between trust and costs of negotiation and of monitoring. The relations between trust and costs of information and of implementation, in turn, are not statistically significant. We believe that these results represent a more-fined grained understanding of the relation between <b>trust</b> and <b>transaction</b> costs in interorganizational relationships to the degree that it is suggested that the four types of transaction costs are not perfectly correlated...|$|R

Although various mechanisms have been developed to elevate trust in e-commerce, research shows that shoppers continue to be skeptical about buying online and lack of trust is often cited as the main reason for it. Thus, enhancing success in e-commerce requires eliminating or reducing the risks. In this chapter, we present a multi-attribute trust management model that incorporates <b>trust,</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and product warranties. The new trust management system enables potential buyers to determine the risk level of a product before committing to proceed with the transaction. This is useful to online buyers as it allows them to be aware of the risk level and subsequently take the appropriate actions to minimize potential risks before engaging in risky businesses. Results of various simulation experiments show that the proposed multi-attribute trust management system can be highly effective in identifying risky transaction in electronic market places. <br /...|$|R

The MQ 5 survey includes quarterly net investment data arising from financial transactions (investments) made by insurance companies, self-administered pension funds, investment trusts, unit trusts and property unit trusts. Annual balance sheet data for short-term assets and liabilities are also reported. Income and expenditure data for insurance companies and self-administered pension funds are reported quarterly. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research (in particular, users interested in geographical variables for MQ 5 may also consider applying for the Business Structure Database (SN 6697) and obtain them via linking).
