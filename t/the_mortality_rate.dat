5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, <b>the</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half <b>the</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> {{for people}} who reach a {{hospital}} alive was estimated at 30% in 1966; more recent estimates place this number at 9%. The number of people reaching a hospital alive has increased, perhaps due to improved prehospital care or specialized treatment centers. Of those who reach the hospital alive but then die, most do so within the first two hours of arrival. The sooner a TBI is diagnosed, the higher the mortality rate; this is likely due to other accompanying injuries that prove fatal.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a series of forest recovery researches of a subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest, this study was carried out to measure <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> of tree stumps changed by species diameter at breast height (DBH) based on the surveys of 62 woody species and 1, 893 tree stems taller than 1. 2 m in four 20 m X 10 m plots were recorded in 1993. At an August 1998 tree census five years after clearcut, all sprouting stems higher than 1. 0 m were identified, and the statuses of all the residual stumps were checked. The investigation showed that 382 stumps were dead without any living sprouts whereas 1, 511 stumps were survived with living sprouts. The further studies showed that <b>the</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> of stumps did not vary with DBH of the stand, but vary with the species DBH remarkably. <b>The</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> by stump DBH within species for these whose total stump numbers ≧ 10 stems in the study plots were divided into four patterns: (a) With the increasing DBH, <b>the</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> increased, (b) Inversely, with the increasing DBH in a certain extent, <b>the</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> decreased, (c) With an increasing DBH, <b>the</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> decreased at first and then increased to some extent, (d) <b>The</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were independent of DBH. The above results suggested that different species might have different mortality patterns, and that different tree species might have different rational DBH ranges for sprout natural regeneration. This knowledge could be much useful for forest recovery forecasting when the severe forest disturbances occurred in subtropical regions. 本研究は、亜熱帯常緑広葉樹林の森林回復に関する研究の一環として、 1993 年に沖縄島北部の琉球大学農学部与那フィールドの林地に設置された試験地を対象に、皆伐施業 5 年後の 1998 年に根株の生育と毎木調査を実施した。今回は主として、根株の生育、とくに枯死状態について報告する。皆伐施業試験地では、設定された天然林当時の樹高 1. 2 m以上の立木 62 樹種、 1, 893 個体のうち、 382 個体の根株が枯死し、 1, 511 個体の根株に萌芽が認められた。根株の枯死率は、全個体で胸高直径間には明確な差がなく、樹種別の胸高直径間に差がみられた。根株個体数が 10 個体以上の 33 樹種別および胸高直径別の根株枯死率は 4 型に類別された：(a) 胸高直径の増加にともなって枯死率も増加した（カクレミノ､タイミンタチバナなど 7 種）；(b) 胸高直径の増加にともない一定の直径範囲で枯死率が減少した（イヌガシ､イタジイなど 9 種）；(c) 胸高直径の増加にともない枯死率は初め減少し、その後増加した（サクラツツジ、ヤブツバキなど 4 種）；(d) 枯死率は胸高直径と関係がなかった（イジュ、ツゲモチなど 13 種）。萌芽力に対して、根株枯死率の類型別に異なることが示唆された...|$|R

5|$|Throughout most {{of history}} <b>the</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> of TBI {{was thought to}} be 100%. However, in 1871 a healed TBI was noted in a duck that had been killed by a hunter, thus demonstrating that the injury could be survived, at least in the general sense. This report, made by Winslow, was the first record in the medical {{literature}} of a bronchus injury. In 1873, Seuvre made one of the earliest reports of TBI in the medical literature: a 74-year-old woman whose chest was crushed by a wagon wheel was found on autopsy to have an avulsion of the right bronchus. Long-term survival of the injury was unknown in humans until a report was made of a person who survived in 1927. In 1931, a report made by Nissen described successful removal of a lung in a 12-year-old girl who had had narrowing of the bronchus due to the injury. Repair of TBI was probably first attempted in 1945, when the first documented case of a successful suturing of a lacerated bronchus was made. Prior to 1950, <b>the</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> was 36%; it had fallen to 9% by 2001; this improvement was likely due to improvements in treatments and surgical techniques, including those for injuries commonly associated with TBI.|$|E
