5|$|The {{government}} of Lincolnshire is constituted as a council-manager form government with elements of home rule, which it adopted via ordinance in 1976. The village {{is headed by}} a mayor who presides over a board of six trustees at every meeting, although the daily functions of the village are carried out by a professional salaried village manager. Once elected, the mayor serves a four-year term; the elected trustees serve four-year <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> staggered. It {{is the responsibility of}} the mayor to appoint a village manager, although the manager cannot take office until the board has approved the mayor's choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It {{is worth noting that}} JCR and MCR are <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of dialectal words and phrases used in New Zealand English. These are mostly {{informal}} <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> more common in casual speech. A considerable number of loanwords have also been taken from the Māori language as well as from Australian English. (see the separate section, below).|$|E

25|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} inclusive design supports {{the identification of}} extreme outliers or edge cases to outline the archetype users as “real” users who lie outside stereotypical archetypes. Conventional persona creation is embedded in simplified averages, while an edge case persona thrives on diversity and uniqueness and describes personae needs in <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> unsentimental, honest and candid descriptors.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{explicit}} continued fraction expansion of e, one {{can show that}} e is not a Liouville number (although the partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion are unbounded). Kurt Mahler showed in 1953 that π is also not a Liouville number. It is conjectured that all infinite continued fractions with bounded <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not eventually periodic are transcendental (eventually periodic continued fractions correspond to quadratic irrationals).|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{at least}} one notable {{scientific}} work has advocated using the lunar geological time scale to subdivide the Hadean eon of Earth's geologic time scale. In particular, it is sometimes found that the Hadean is subdivided into the Cryptic, Basin Groups 1-9, Nectarian, and Early Imbrian. This notation is not entirely consistent with the above lunar geologic time scale in that the Cryptic and Basin Groups 1-9 (both of which are only informal <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not used in geologic maps) comprise the Pre-Nectarian period.|$|E

25|$|On May 25, 2011, the SEC adopted final Regulation 21F to {{implement}} the provisions of Section 21F of the Exchange Act. Regulation 21F became effective on August 12, 2011. Among other things, Regulation 21F defines <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> essential to the whistleblower’s program operations, establishes procedures for submitting tips and applying for awards, including appeals of SEC determinations, and whether and to whom to make an award; describes the criteria the SEC will consider in making award decisions, and implements Dodd-Frank’s prohibition against retaliation for whistleblowing.|$|E
25|$|The Organon was Aristotle's {{body of work}} on logic, {{with the}} Prior Analytics constituting the first {{explicit}} work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic. The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name term logic, are {{the analysis of the}} judgements into propositions consisting of two <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of syllogisms that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.|$|E
25|$|The {{nonlinearity}} of the EFE makes finding exact solutions difficult. One way {{of solving}} the field equations is to make an approximation, namely, that far from the source(s) of gravitating matter, the gravitational field is very weak and the spacetime approximates that of Minkowski space. The metric is then written as {{the sum of the}} Minkowski metric and a term representing the deviation of the true metric from the Minkowski metric, with <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> quadratic in or higher powers of the deviation being ignored. This linearization procedure can be used to investigate the phenomena of gravitational radiation.|$|E

25|$|Some {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} into how often gay men use homosexual slang <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> often not understandable to those outside of the LGBT community. The particular slang used by gay men as well as lesbians has been recorded in a number of specialist dictionaries, and according to researcher Greg Jacobs, is that the terminology listed in said dictionaries revolves heavily around sexual matters including terms for sex organs, preferences and activities, although Jacobs questions whether this accurately reflects {{the amount of time spent}} by gay people talking about sex and sexuality or whether it is down to methodological assumptions that conversations amongst LGBT people is primarily dominated with talk about sex.|$|E
25|$|The {{commonly}} understood {{opposite of}} truth is falsehood, which, correspondingly, {{can also take}} on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy, art, and religion. Many human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most (but not all) of the sciences, law, journalism, and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. Commonly, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to an independent reality, in what is sometimes called the correspondence theory of truth.|$|E
25|$|The lexicon is a {{catalogue}} of words and <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of words and bound morphemes, which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like affixes. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered {{to be part of}} the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. Lexicography, closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an encyclopedia or a dictionary. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization, and the new words are called neologisms.|$|E

25|$|Because genres are {{dependent}} on content for definition, genres have changed and evolved as newer styles of video games have come into existence. Ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more lifelike and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities (e.g., virtual pets), pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming {{or in some cases}} add new possibilities in play (such as that seen with titles specifically designed for devices like Sony's EyeToy). Some genres represent combinations of others, such as massively multiplayer online role-playing games, or, more commonly, MMORPGs. It is also common to see higher level genre <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> collective in nature across all other genres such as with action, music/rhythm or horror-themed video games.|$|E
25|$|Central and {{peripheral}} are <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{closely related}} to concepts such as proximal and distal, but they are so widely applicable that in many respects their flexibility makes them hard to define. Loosely speaking, they distinguish near and far, inside and out, or even organs of vital importance such as heart and lungs, from peripheral organs such as fingers, that undoubtedly may be important, but which {{it may not be}} life-threatening to dispense with. Examples of the application of the terms are the distinction between central- and peripheral nervous systems, and between peripheral blood vessels and the central circulatory organs, such as the heart and major vessels. The terms also can apply to large and complex molecules such as proteins, where central amino acid residues are protected from antibodies or the like, but peripheral residues are important in docking and other interactions. Other examples include Central and peripheral circadian clocks, and central versus peripheral vision.|$|E
25|$|The Arizona Board of Regents governs Arizona State University {{as well as}} the state's {{other public}} universities; University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University. The Board of Regents is {{composed}} of twelve members including eleven voting, and one non-voting member. Members of the board include the Governor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction acting as ex-officio members, eight volunteer Regent members with eight year <b>terms</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> appointed by the Governor, and two Student Regents with two years term, serving a one-year term as non-voting apprentices. ABOR provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona. ASU has five campuses in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona including the Tempe campus in Tempe; the West campus and the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Glendale; the Downtown Phoenix campus; and the Polytechnic campus in Mesa.
