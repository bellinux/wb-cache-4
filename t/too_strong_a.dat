5|$|In November 1979, Brock met Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc. Concerned that Fechter's {{animatronics}} {{would be}} <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> <b>a</b> competition for Bushnell’s work, Brock requested that Bushnell release {{him from the}} co-development agreement, citing misrepresentation. In December 1979, Brock and Fechter formed “Showbiz Pizza Place Inc”, severing Brock's business relationship with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering. Showbiz Pizza Place opened its first location on March 3, 1980, in Kansas City, Missouri.|$|E

25|$|Not {{completely}} {{satisfied with}} the play itself, Christie decided to try her hand at playwrighting and wrote Black Coffee – a stage play not based on a previous work and again featuring Poirot. It was first presented in 1930 but after this Christie decided that Poirot was <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> <b>a</b> character to be portrayed on stage and removed him from all of her own subsequent adaptations of her books. She did, however, allow Arnold Ridley to include the character in his 1940 adaptation of Peril at End House.|$|E

25|$|However, after a {{successful}} rehabilitation, the next opportunity for Hadlee {{to claim the}} test wicket world record was against India in India in 1988. After touring India in 1976 Hadlee, plagued by stomach troubles, had decided never to play cricket there again, however {{the opportunity to make}} history was <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> <b>a</b> lure to pass up. He duly captured the record, and his 374th test wicket, in the first test of the series. In the second test a 10 wicket haul helped New Zealand to a rare test win in India, although the series was eventually lost 2–1.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, {{defeating}} the Republic of China's military forces and establishing Manchukuo, a puppet state. The Hoover administration deplored the invasion, but {{also sought to}} avoid antagonizing the Japanese, fearing that taking <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> <b>a</b> stand would weaken the moderate forces in the Japanese government. In response to the Japanese invasion, Hoover and Secretary of State Henry Stimson outlined the Stimson Doctrine, which held that the United States would not recognize territories gained by force. The Hoover administration based this declaration on the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, in which several nations (including Japan and the United States) renounced war and promised to peacefully solve disputes. In the aftermath of invasion of Manchuria, Stimson {{and other members of}} the Cabinet came to believe that war with Japan might be inevitable, though Hoover continued to push for disarmament among the world powers.|$|E
25|$|After Cannae, several south Italian cities allied {{themselves}} to Hannibal: the Apulian towns of Salapia, Arpi and Herdonia {{and many of}} the Lucanians. Mago marched south with a Carthaginian army detachment and, some weeks later, the Bruttians joined him. Simultaneously, Hannibal marched north with part of his forces and was joined by the Hirpini and the Caudini, two of the three Samnite cantons. The greatest gain was the second largest city of Italy, Capua, when Hannibal's army marched into Campania in 216 BC. The inhabitants of Capua held limited Roman citizenship and the aristocracy was linked to the Romans via marriage and friendship, but the possibility of becoming the supreme city of Italy after the evident Roman disasters proved <b>too</b> <b>strong</b> <b>a</b> temptation. The treaty between them and Hannibal can be described as an agreement of friendship, since the Capuans had no obligations, but provided the harbour through which Hannibal was reinforced.|$|E

500|$|Audiences also {{responded to}} the Beatles' brash social impudence. Director Richard Lester said, [...] "The general aim of the film was to present what was {{apparently}} becoming a social phenomenon in this country.

Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they liked, talk to the Queen as they liked, {{talk to the people}} on the train who 'fought the war for them' as they liked. ... still based on privilege—privilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech. The Beatles were the first people to attack this… they said if you want something, do it. You can do it. Forget all this talk about talent or ability or money or speech. Just do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} (February) {{plan for}} Operation Anger {{had called for}} an immediate crossing of the Nederrijn near Oosterbeek {{as soon as the}} river was reached, if the situation allowed it (Operation Quick Anger). Alternatively, if the German defenses were considered <b>too</b> <b>strong,</b> <b>a</b> better prepared crossing downstream at Renkum could be made (Operation Anger). However, Crerar had ruled that operations could not be made against Arnhem until II Corps had crossed the IJssel and advanced on Apeldoorn, and so Anger could not yet proceed. [...] Additionally reconnaissance patrols on 3 and 4 April determined that German observation posts and positions on the Westerbouwing Heights overlooking the river would make crossing the Nederrijn dangerous. Attempts were made to create smokescreens obscuring the southern bank of the Nederrijn from the watching Germans, a technique that had proved successful in the buildup to Operation Plunder. [...] The screen stretched from the town of Randwijk, [...] west of Arnhem, along the south bank of the river to Huissen, south of Arnhem, but strong winds and a lack of appropriate generators reduced its effectiveness. Additionally the ground on the Island was deteriorating and on 7 April, after considering various alternatives, Foulkes decided Arnhem must be attacked from the east, across the IJssel.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} decade of Dubinsky's tenure some of these new members began to rebel, protesting their {{exclusion}} from positions of power within the union.

[...] Ayo Jegede of Stylus Magazine panned the album, criticizing the band in the terms of [...] "being progressive": [...] "I'm not sure, but I think [...] "progressive" [...] is about growth and change.

Yamaguchi created [...] "Word" [...] in response to [...] "Atarashii Sekai" [...] - a song that expressed optimistic feelings of wanting to travel, when he remembered walking with a girl beside a river at night. On [...] "Word" [...] he revisited these memories, instead applying a realistic lens to the event. He wanted to create a song that would make a person cry if they heard it on a winter's night, which was an idea he struggled to actualize until he {{was inspired}} by creating the lyric yoru ga bokura o tameshiteru na.|$|E
