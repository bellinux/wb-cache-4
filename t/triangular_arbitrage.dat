50|$|<b>Triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> (also {{referred}} to as cross currency arbitrage or three-point arbitrage) is the act of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity resulting from a pricing discrepancy among three different currencies in the foreign exchange market. A <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> strategy involves three trades, exchanging the initial currency for a second, the second currency for a third, and the third currency for the initial. During the second trade, the arbitrageur locks in a zero-risk profit from the discrepancy that exists when the market cross exchange rate is not aligned with the implicit cross exchange rate. A profitable trade is only possible if there exist market imperfections. Profitable <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> is very rarely possible because when such opportunities arise, traders execute trades that {{take advantage of the}} imperfections and prices adjust up or down until the opportunity disappears.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{have shown}} a {{decrease}} in the incidence of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities from 2003 to 2005 for the Japanese yen and Swiss franc and have attributed the decrease to broader adoption of electronic trading platforms and trading algorithms during the same period. Such electronic systems have enabled traders to trade and react rapidly to price changes. The speed gained from these technologies improved trading efficiency and the correction of mispricings, allowing for less incidence of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the efficiency of}} the FX market by searching for <b>triangular</b> and multi-currency <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities from 1997 to 2007. We show that both <b>triangular</b> and multi-currency <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities exist in the FX market. Further, we find evidence of a decreasing trend in relation to the total number of arbitrage opportunities per year. In most cases we see a decrease of over 50 % and {{all the way up to}} 80 – 90 %. Finally, we use actual unmasked volume data to investigate the profit potential of these arbitrage opportunities. Our results show the same negative tendency, i. e. the profit potential has been reduced sharply in recent years with a decrease of over 50 % for all triangular roundtrips, and as high as 99 % for multi-currency roundtrips...|$|R
30|$|From around 1880 {{until the}} {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, the gold standard served as role model for the international currency system. During this era of the classical gold standard, the definition of the currency value in terms of gold—the so-called mint-par—gave rise to officially fixed exchange rates. Nevertheless, the rates on the foreign exchange markets did move to some degree. One reason was that international gold shipments, which enforced the mint-par, were costly, wherefore the market exchange rate could fluctuate within a band of gold-arbitrage inactivity (see e.g. Clare 1895, ch. 7). An ongoing debate is still trying to determine the width of this band, which was delimited by the so-called gold-points. There are several reasons why this {{has turned out to be}} challenging including the numerous, time-varying cost components to transport gold across countries (Clare 1902, pp. 78 – 79; Canjels et al. 2004, p. 869), or the complications arising when <b>triangular</b> gold <b>arbitrage</b> is possible (Coleman 2007). 1 To nevertheless provide some rough values, for the French and the Belgian franc, contemporaneous sources set the upper and lower gold-points at, respectively, 25.12 Fcs/£ and 25.32 Fcs/£ (Clare 1895, p. 126; Tate 1908, p. 51), for the Dutch guilder at 12.05 Fl/£ and 12.15 Fl/£ (Tate, 1908, p. 328), and for the German mark at 20.32 M/£ and 20.53 M./£ (Clare 1895, p. 131) reflecting deviations of between 0.2 and 0.7 per cent from the mint-pars of, respectively, 25.22 Fcs/£, 12.07 Fl/£, and 20.43 M/£. Furthermore, even in its heyday, the gold standard was not a homogeneous system. In Europe, Britain and Germany came closest to the theoretical ideal of a freely convertible monometallic currency backed by gold, followed by Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, where the conversion of the local currency into gold was subject to some restrictions (see Eichengreen 2008, pp. 20 ff.). Still, for decades, these relatively wealthy and financially advanced European nation states managed to anchor the exchange rate to the mint-par, which arguably implied that the remaining, small fluctuations on the foreign exchange market were primarily a reaction to international differences in interest (discount) rates (Clare 1902, p. 94). Conversely, the currency systems of other European countries were at most incompletely associated with the gold standard. For example, aside from a short period in the 1880 s, the Italian mint-par of 25.22 lire/£ was never officially instituted (Eichengreen 2008, p. 17). In Spain, Portugal, or Russia, substantial parts of the currency consisted of inconvertible paper money (Clare 1895, pp. 157 – 160). Austria-Hungary had essentially a freely floating currency until the end of the 1880 s, and undertook several monetary reforms during the 1890 s to gradually stabilise the exchange rate against gold around the year 1900 (see Von Mises 1909; Flandreau and Komlos 2006). The exchange rates of all these countries were relatively instable (Einzig 1962, 198 – 199) and reacted to fluctuations in international trade, or changes in foreign indebtedness (Clare 1902, p. 94).|$|R
50|$|Some {{international}} banks {{serve as}} market makers between currencies by narrowing their bid-ask spread {{more than the}} bid-ask spread of the implicit cross exchange rate. However, the bid and ask prices of the implicit cross exchange rate naturally discipline market makers. When banks' quoted exchange rates move out of alignment with cross exchange rates, any banks or traders who detect the discrepancy {{have an opportunity to}} earn arbitrage profits via a <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> strategy. To execute a <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> trading strategy, a bank would calculate cross exchange rates and compare them with exchange rates quoted by other banks to identify a pricing discrepancy.|$|E
50|$|Research {{examining}} high-frequency {{exchange rate}} data {{has found that}} mispricings do occur in the foreign exchange market such that executable <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities appear possible. In observations of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> the constituent exchange rates have exhibited strong correlation. A study examining exchange rate data provided by HSBC Bank for the Japanese yen (JPY) and the Swiss franc (CHF) found that although {{a limited number of}} arbitrage opportunities appeared to exist for as many as 100 seconds, 95% of them lasted for 5 seconds or less, and 60% lasted for 1 second or less. Further, most arbitrage opportunities were found to have small magnitudes, with 94% of JPY and CHF opportunities existing at a difference of 1 basis point, which translates into a potential arbitrage profit of $100 USD per $1 million USD transacted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> {{opportunities}} {{may only}} exist when a bank's quoted exchange rate is not {{equal to the}} market's implicit cross exchange rate. The following equation represents the calculation of an implicit cross exchange rate, the exchange rate one would expect in the market as implied from the ratio of two currencies other than the base currency.|$|E
50|$|Mere {{existence}} of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities {{does not necessarily}} imply that a trading strategy seeking to exploit currency mispricings is consistently profitable. Electronic trading systems allow the three constituent trades in a <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> transaction to be submitted very rapidly. However, there exists a delay between the identification of such an opportunity, the initiation of trades, {{and the arrival of}} trades to the party quoting the mispricing. Even though such delays are only milliseconds in duration, they are deemed significant. For example, if a trader places each trade as a limit order to be filled only at the arbitrage price and a price moves due to market activity or new price is quoted by the third party, then the triangular transaction will not be completed. In such a case, the arbitrageur will face a cost to close out the position that is equal to the change in price that eliminated the arbitrage condition.|$|E
50|$|For example, Citibank detects that Deutsche Bank is quoting {{dollars at}} a bid price of 0.8171 €/$, and that Barclays is quoting pounds at a bid price of 1.4650 $/£ (Deutsche Bank and Barclays are {{in other words}} willing to buy those {{currencies}} at those prices). Citibank itself is quoting the same prices for these two exchange rates. A trader at Citibank then sees that Crédit Agricole is quoting pounds at an ask price of 1.1910 €/£ (in other words {{it is willing to}} sell pounds at that price). While the quoted market cross exchange rate is 1.1910 €/£, Citibank's trader realizes that the implicit cross exchange rate is 1.1971 €/£ (by calculating 1.4650 × 0.8171 = 1.1971), meaning that Crédit Agricole has narrowed its bid-ask spread to serve as a market maker between the euro and the pound. Although the market suggests the implicit cross exchange rate should be 1.1971 euros per pound, Crédit Agricole is selling pounds at a lower price of 1.1910 euros. Citibank's trader can hastily exercise <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> by exchanging dollars for euros with Deutsche Bank, then exchanging euros for pounds with Crédit Agricole, and finally exchanging pounds for dollars with Barclays. The following steps illustrate the <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> transaction.|$|E
50|$|Tests for {{seasonality}} in {{the amount}} and duration of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities have shown that incidence of arbitrage opportunities and mean duration is consistent from day to day. However, significant variations have been identified during different times of day. Transactions involving the JPY and CHF have demonstrated {{a smaller number of}} opportunities and long average duration around 01:00 and 10:00 UTC, contrasted with a greater number of opportunities and short average duration around 13:00 and 16:00 UTC. Such variations in incidence and duration of arbitrage opportunities can be explained by variations in market liquidity during the trading day. For example, the foreign exchange market is found to be most liquid for Asia around 00:00 and 10:00 UTC, for Europe around 07:00 and 17:00 UTC, and for America around 13:00 and 23:00 UTC. The overall foreign exchange market is most liquid around 08:00 and 16:00 UTC, and the least liquid around 22:00 and 01:00 UTC. The periods of highest liquidity correspond with the periods of greatest incidence of opportunities for <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> This correspondence is substantiated by the observation of narrower bid-ask spreads during periods of high liquidity, resulting in a greater potential for mispricings and therefore arbitrage opportunities. However, market forces are driven to correct for mispricings due to a high frequency of trades that will trade away fleeting arbitrage opportunities.|$|E
40|$|Imad Moosa {{shows that}} the effect of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> in the forward market is similar to the {{combined}} effect of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> in the spot market and covered interest arbitrage. He also shows that when the forward rates are inconsistent then this implies inconsistency of the spot rates and/or the violation of covered interest parity. When the bid-offer spreads are allowed for, the equilibrium conditions hold only approximately. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{first show}} that there are in fact <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> {{opportunities}} in the spot foreign exchange markets, analyzing the time dependence of the yen-dollar rate, the dollar-euro rate and the yen-euro rate. Next, we propose a model of foreign exchange rates with an interaction. The model includes effects of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> transactions as an interaction among three rates. The model explains the actual data of the multiple foreign exchange rates well. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> {{within the}} spot {{foreign exchange market}} using high-frequency executable prices. We show that <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities do exist, but that most have short durations and small magnitudes. We find intra-day variations in the number and length of arbitrage opportunities, with larger numbers of opportunities with shorter mean durations occurring during more liquid hours. We demonstrate further {{that the number of}} arbitrage opportunities has decreased in recent years, implying a corresponding increase in pricing efficiency. Using trading simulations, we show that a trader would need to beat other market participants to an unfeasibly large proportion of arbitrage prices to profit from <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> over a prolonged period of time. Our results suggest that the foreign exchange market is internally self-consistent and provide a limited verification of market efficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a microscopic model which describes {{the dynamics of}} each dealer in multiple foreign exchange markets, taking account of the <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> transaction.

40|$|Bitcoins are {{bought and}} sold with most major currencies, and the {{resulting}} prices are ?exchange rates? of currencies per Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoins in national currencies have been quite volatile over the brief period of Bitcoin?s existence. Among national currencies, the possibility of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> leads to near equality of bilateral exchange rates and exchange rates obtained via triangular trade. We explore {{the relationship between a}} bilateral exchange rate of two major national currencies and the exchange rate that can be obtained via triangular trade through Bitcoins. Features of the Bitcoin exchanges make it difficult to meet conditions necessary for strict (risk-free) arbitrage, but market pressures from the threat of arbitrage constrain the national currency prices of Bitcoins to adjust toward the bilateral foreign exchange rate obtained in the traditional foreign exchange market. In this paper, we compare the Bitcoin implied exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Chinese Renminbi to the market US Dollar/Renminbi exchange rate, and show that the Bitcoin implied rate adjusts toward the FOREX market rate due to market pressures from the threat of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> One implication is that the bilateral rate and the triangular trade rate obtained from trade in Bitcoins are cointegrated, and we study the adjustment process when these exchange rates are misaligned...|$|E
40|$|Arbitrage {{opportunities}} {{arise when}} new information affects {{the price of}} one security because dealers in other related securities are slow to update their quotes. These opportunities are toxic since they can result in a trading loss for liquidity suppliers with stale quotes. We develop a measure of dealers ’ exposure to toxic arbitrage trades. Using data on high frequency <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities in the FX market, we show that an increase in dealers ’ exposure to toxic arbitrage trades has a significant positive effect on trading costs. The finding suggests a possible harmful effect of high frequency arbitrage activities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{bilateral}} spatial price models do not estimate bilateral transactions costs when trade with third cities is important. The paper examines trans-Atlantic gold arbitrage during {{the gold standard}} era by assembling a database indicating when trans-Atlantic gold shipments occurred. It shows that two-way gold shipments between New York and London frequently occurred prior to 1901. However, in 1901 gold shipments to London ceased and were replaced by <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> shipments through Paris. Consequently, New York and London gold price data cannot be used to estimate New York-London transactions costs after 1901, as no trade took place. ...|$|E
40|$|Short-lived {{arbitrage}} opportunities {{arise when}} prices adjust with a lag to new information. They are toxic because they expose dealers {{to the risk}} of trading at stale quotes. Hence, theory implies that more frequent toxic arbitrage opportunities and faster responses to these opportunities should impair liquidity. We provide supporting evidence using data on <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> As predicted, illiquidity is higher on days when the fraction of toxic arbitrage opportunities and arbitrageurs’ relative speed are higher. Overall, our findings suggest that the price efficiency gain of high-frequency arbitrage comes at the cost of increased adverse selection risk. ...|$|E

40|$|High {{frequency}} trading (HFT) {{has become}} a predominant feature of financial markets. Thisthesis studies {{different aspects of the}} HFT in the Electronic Broking Services (EBS) interbank foreign exchange (FX) market. The first paper of this Thesis (Chapter 1) studies changes in the spread, market depth anddegree of adverse selection due to the lower minimum tick size. The main conclusion is that thereduction in the spread was mostly absorbed by the HFTs, whereas the manual traders were pushedback {{from the top of the}} order book and experienced longer execution times. Manual marketmakers were willing to cross the spread and act as market takers changing the informationalcontent of the order flow. Market depth was reduced significantly following the introduction ofdecimal pip pricing. The second paper of this Thesis (Chapter 2) presents the effect of the tick size change onthe adverse selection problem in the EBS market. Econometric analysis of serial correlationproperties of jumps in exchange rates, and of the spread leads to the conclusion that adverseselection is reduced by tick size change. Similar cleavage occurs before and after tick size changein an empirical adverse selection proxy. This chapter sheds light on trading behavior of marketparticipants. The third paper of this thesis (Chapter 3) discusses the properties of triangular arbitrageopportunity in the EBS market. The results cast into question current understanding of triangulararbitrage in the literature, specifically in relation to algorithmic trading. The increasingpresence of algorithmic traders does not offer significant improvement in speed of price discoveryby quickly consuming the <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities.

Arbitrage opportunities violate these pricing relationships and are analogous to multivariate additive outliers. Robust identification/filtering of arbitrage opportunities in the data is accomplished by Kalman filtering. The state space model {{used to describe the}} pricing relationships is general enough to handle both linear and non-linear models. The recursive Kalman equations are adapted to filter tick data, cope with the erratic arrival of observations and produce estimates of all the arbitrage prices on every time step.

40|$|MBA thesis - WBSThis paper {{uses the}} {{principle}} of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> to measure the efficiency with which information is disseminated across foreign exchange markets. Three dimensions of efficiency, namely profitability, persistence and stability of the expected returns, {{have been identified as}} suitable measures and evaluated quantitatively to determine the validity of the semi-strong form of market efficiency proposed by Fama (1970). Using published data from a New York Stock Exchange listed foreign exchange trading firm, the price quotes were pre-processed and evaluated quantitatively for statistical relevance, using appropriate hypotheses and parametric approaches to data analysis. The key finding {{of this study is that}} although there were instances where prices deviated from triangular parity, the frequency was statistically insignificant and does not represent generalised and on-going inefficiency in the market. When taking a holistic view of profitability, persistence and stability of the expected returns, the foreign exchange market is efficient; offering insufficient opportunity to generate excess economic returns arising from an informational advantage in any one market...|$|E
40|$|If {{financial}} markets displayed the informational efficiency postulated in the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), arbitrage operations would be self-extinguishing. The present paper considers arbitrage sequences in foreign exchange (FX) markets, in which trading platforms and information are fragmented. In Kozyakin et al. (2010) and Cross et al. (2012) {{it was shown}} that sequences of <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> operations in FX markets containing 4 currencies and trader-arbitrageurs tend to display periodicity or grow exponentially rather than being self-extinguishing. This paper extends the analysis to 5 or higher-order currency worlds. The key findings are that in a 5 -currency world arbitrage sequences may also follow an exponential law as well as display periodicity, but that in higher-order currency worlds a double exponential law may additionally apply. There is an "inheritance of instability" in the higher-order currency worlds. Profitable arbitrage operations are thus endemic rather that displaying the self-extinguishing properties implied by the EMH.

40|$|This paper investigates how a {{small country}} fares in an exchange— rate union if that country is subject to real and {{monetary}} disturbances originating at home and abroad. By joining a union, the country can fix the exchange rate between its currency and the currency of another country or countries. The paper asks whether or not fixing this exchange rate helps to modify the effects of disturbances on the domestic economy. This question is investigated within a model consisting of an aggre-gate demand equation dependent upon the terms of trade, an aggregate supply equation in which labor supply is responsive to the general price level, and a financial equation that determines the exchange rate of the domestic currency relative {{to one of two}} foreign currencies (the other being determined by <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage).</b> Aggregate supply behavior varies depending upon whether wages respond to prices with a lag or are indexed to current changes in the general price level.

40|$|We present {{analysis}} of a unique foreign exchange data set which consists of a complete deal record for 1 month from the dominant foreign exchange electronic broking system complete with anonymized banker and trader identities. This is used to put flesh on the proposition that there is private information in foreign exchange markets. We find that, in liquid dollar exchange rates, traders who specialize their activity in that rate have the largest price impact from aggressive trading. In non-dollar cross pairs, the traders with the largest impact on prices are <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> traders who spread their trades evenly across the three exchange rates in the relevant triangle. High volume traders of any kind also have reasonably large price impact from market orders. The same taxonomy of traders predicts that specialists and high volume traders suffer least price impact when supplying liquidity and this is verified in our analysis. Finally, we document {{the effect of a}} trader being located in a large institution on the information content of trades. Individuals located on large trading floors move prices further when they trade aggressively and suffer smaller adverse price movements when they trade passively...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} show how efficient the markets are by using Fama’s Efficiency Market Hypothesis (EMH). The theory states that an investor cannot increase his returns without taking additional risk. The markets can be efficient in different forms depending on the information included in the traded asset. It is quoted that: "There ain't {{no such thing as}} a free lunch". However, the topic still remains disputable since researchers have introduced controversial findings after investigating different markets. Overall, emerging markets have been characterized with higher volatility which consequently declares for market imperfections. Commonly, these market inefficiencies are quickly captured by the eye of the investors who are lurking for potential benefits through exploiting them. These are the so called arbitrage opportunities which exist on different level of impact, depending on the attitude of the market. The existence of arbitrage is clear evidence against Fama’s theory and it has been documented in numerous studies. Unfortunately those events occur rarely and disappear in a matter of seconds, thus; is highly competitive to capitalize. Over the last decade high frequency trading (HFT) became popular on different markets and it allowed traders to make decisions and execute transactions in a matter of milliseconds using algorithms. The market we are interested in is the Forex market which is a decentralized market where currencies from all over the world are traded. Main participants include multinational banks which rely heavily on HFT. The method used to benefit from inefficiency is called <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> and it involves selling and buying 3 sets of currency pairs in times when a parity is violated. The goal of this study is to answer the following research question, “Is there a difference in <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities between emerging markets and developed ones?” The main objective of this research is to examine how the number of arbitrage occurrences varies considering different market characteristics. Furthermore, the originality of the research stems from the comparison between strategies using currencies from developed economies and emerging ones. Moreover, the additional academic value comes from the analysis of a new dataset that has not yet been examined. Lastly, our results make an empirical contribution into a country’s economy by reducing market inefficiencies and increasing economic stability. Our sample consists of quantitative data totaling to 2. 4 million observations per quotation taken from 2011 and 2013 for currencies picked using a non-probability convenience method based on their property to be converted to EUR and USD currency and availability of information. The research revealed that differences between the two types of market exist, and indicates that the “early” markets possess higher arbitrage activity in contrast to the mature economies. These results should boost the potential for a better trading management and upgrade the profit growth...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to detect periods in which two {{currencies}} can be classified as being the ”same” asset. Two currencies can be treated as the same asset if their exchange rates vis-`a-vis the same base currency are cointegrated with a cointegration vector that is consistent with the <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> condition. In a first step, it is theoretically derived under which conditions, with respect to the process of the fundamentals, the exchange rates are cointegrated. The empirical results yield that periods of strong comovements of the US dollar and Pound sterling based upon the Euro prevail during the 1990 s and periods of comovements of Euro and Pound sterling denominated in US dollar prevail since the introduction of the Euro. Furthermore, no long-run relationships can be discovered. This paper gives four major innovations to the literature. It first shows under which conditions exchange rates can be bivariately cointegrated. Secondly, it uses the cross-rate identity to test for cointegration, i. e. deducing recursively. Thirdly, it applies the cointegration methodology within a triangular framework by detecting cointegration between exchange rates that are not only denominated in U. S. dollars. And lastly, it shows that comovements between two exchange rates exist in a narrower sense but only in short periods, whereas the economic variables which have caused the relationship are explored.

40|$|A {{currency}} trio {{is a set}} {{of three}} currencies and their respective exchange rates, which have a relationship fixed by a <b>triangular</b> <b>arbitrage</b> condition. This condition forms the basis for the derivation of a geometric interpretation of the relationships between the exchange rates. In the geometric framework, the three currencies in a currency trio are represented by a triangle, where each of the vertices represents a currency. The volatilities of the exchange rates are represented by the lengths of the sides joining the respective currencies and the cosine of each angle represents the correlation between the two exchange rates depicted by the angle's adjacent sides. The geometric approach is particularly useful when dealing with implied data as it allows the calculation of implied correlation using implied volatility. This is valuable as implied volatility is frequently quoted in the foreign exchange market; whereas, implied correlation is not directly quoted and is more difficult to extract from market data. This dissertation aims to thoroughly investigate the geometric framework and use it to visualise and interpret the relationships between currencies in a currency trio. The analysis will initially look at currency trios with realised spot data before moving on to implied data. In the implied data context, the framework will be used to extract and evaluate implied correlation estimates using implied volatility data extracted from the foreign exchange market. The framework will be extended to investigate whether an illiquid option can be proxy hedged using options on the two other currencies in a currency trio. Finally, the findings will be discussed and the feasibility of the applications of the framework will be considered...|$|E
