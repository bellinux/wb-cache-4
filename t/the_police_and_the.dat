5|$|Girlschool’s {{third album}} Screaming Blue Murder was {{recorded}} in February and March 1982 {{under the direction of}} Nigel Gray, the successful producer of <b>The</b> <b>Police</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Professionals. The album had a worldwide release in June 1982 but, despite the strong promotion, it reached only No.27 in the UK Album Chart. Critics generally considered Screaming Blue Murder a weaker offering in comparison with the preceding two albums.|$|E

5|$|After {{interrogation}} by Doggett, Purnell {{confesses to}} snatching Billy in 1990 {{on behalf of}} someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two FBI agents go to Jeppy’s home and find Josh in a compartment under {{the floor of his}} horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case. Scully believes it was justice from beyond the grave and that {{the important thing is that}} it saved Josh Underwood.|$|E
5|$|By 1963, {{following}} some 15 {{years of}} unrelenting pressure from <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ABC, Stoumen {{decided he was}} no longer able financially to sustain the fight. The cost of his long legal battle was more than $38,000. Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his legal bills, but none offered any assistance. The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual Halloween party. After a final defiant Halloween celebration at which only non-alcoholic beverages were served and an attempt to survive on food and soft drink sales, the Black Cat closed down for good in February 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} soldiers fulfilled {{a number}} of different purposes. Initially they were collaborators in the conquest of Indochina, helping to defeat the forces of the Nguyễn Dynasty and then in its pacification. After the pacification campaign was officially completed in 1897, the two main functions of the colonial army were the maintenance of internal peace and external security. Both these tasks were fulfilled in conjunction with other armed institutions, such as the Garde indigène (later indochinoise), the gendarmerie, <b>the</b> <b>police,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> irregular partisans in the border regions. The Garde indigène, a paramilitary force, was primarily responsible for dealing with disturbances of the peace and thus {{played an important role in}} the repression of public demonstrations and popular unrest.|$|E

5|$|The scandal {{resulted}} {{in hundreds of}} alleged victims of Savile and other abusers approaching <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> NSPCC. Their claims were investigated and {{formed the basis of}} the report, which found that Savile's alleged offences were committed across England and Scotland, in hospitals, prison facilities, schools and BBC premises. Offences were reported between 1955 and 2009, totalling 214 alleged offences across 28 police forces. The most frequent alleged offending coincided with Savile's peak celebrity status. Numbers of alleged victims totalled 450, of whom 328 were minors at the time. They were aged between 8 and 47 years, majority being 1316.|$|E
5|$|As in the House of Commons, {{a number}} of {{qualifications}} apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981. Specifically, members must be {{over the age of}} 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK. Members of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified. An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament {{if he or she is}} judged to be insane under the terms of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.|$|E
5|$|Gautham and Sameera go to London, {{where they}} and their driver Gulaab Singh escape from a murder attempt; Gautham's manager, Michael, is killed. The Rubik's Cube, when solved a certain way, reveals a safe-deposit-box number in which Gautham finds a {{preserved}} rice sample. After escaping another murder attempt in a parking lot, he eludes <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two men with Sameera and Singh's help. One of the men—a fan—seeks revenge for his father (one of the other murderers, according to the aged taxi driver), who was killed by Gautham in Belfast when he performed there. Gautham learns that the aged taxi driver he met previously is a businessman and the murderer; the person hit by the businessman's car in Gautham's presence was the actual, innocent taxi driver.|$|E

5|$|Gould {{missed the}} entire 1891 {{campaign}} {{as he and}} his brother Bob had travelled to the West Indies to conduct civil engineering work. Gould regained his international place and the captaincy on his return for the 1892 Home Nations Championship. The tournament was a failure for Wales; the team lost all three of their matches. There was little consistency for Gould at centre, with three different centre-pairings in each of the matches; Garrett against England, Conway Rees at home to Scotland and in the Irish encounter, Gould's younger brother Bert. The 1892 Championship was soured by the aftermath of the Wales–Scotland encounter, which was played in Swansea at St. Helen's. After Wales lost the game 7–2, members of the crowd, angered by Jack Hodgson's refereeing of the game, attacked him. The assailants by-passed <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> referee had to be rescued by members of the Welsh team. In the struggle, Gould was struck on the chin, and it was reported that Hodgson only reached the Mackworth Hotel because Gould accompanied him on the coach.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs and {{his team}} {{eventually}} find and arrest Dom, Mia, Brian, and Vince. While transporting them to the airport for extradition to the United States, the convoy is attacked by Reyes' men, who kill Hobbs' team. Hobbs and Elena are saved by Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince as they fight back and escape, but Vince is shot {{in the process and}} dies. Wanting to avenge his murdered team, Hobbs and Elena agree to help with the heist. The gang breaks into the police station and tear the vault holding Reyes' money from the building using their cars, dragging it through the city. After an extensive police chase, Dom makes Brian continue without him while he attacks <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pursuing Reyes, using the vault attached to his car to smash their vehicles. Brian returns and kills Zizi while Reyes is badly injured by Dom's assault. Hobbs arrives on the scene and executes Reyes to avenge his team. Though Hobbs refuses to let Dom and Brian go free, he gives them a 24-hour head start to escape on the condition they leave the vault as it is. However, the vault is empty as it had been switched during the chase. After splitting the cash (Vince's share is given to his family), they go their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a report {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. The report {{was based on a}} recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to take into consideration the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted in the statute of limitations having come into effect by the time the report was published. A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E

5|$|JNA and Croatian sources {{disagree}} on events immediately following {{arrival of the}} JNA in Dalj. While the JNA claimed it requested a cessation of the fire only to be refused by the defenders of the police station, Croatian sources claim the JNA demanded the unconditional surrender of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ZNG, and were refused by the Croatian force. Both versions agree that the combat resumed until approximately 10a.m., when three tank main gun rounds, fired by the JNA, hit the police station. While the JNA reported there were no Croatian policemen or ZNG troops captured alive, contradicting its own report stating that the Croatian force located outside the police station accepted cessation of hostilities, the Croatian sources claim that those who surrendered were killed after their capture. Overall, 39 {{were killed in the}} fighting for the police station in Dalj—20 policemen, 15 ZNG troops and four civil defencemen.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{notified}} the McCann, Savage, and Farrell {{families of the}} deaths {{on the evening of}} 6 March. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of Sinn Féin, was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mairéad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. Northern Irish authorities flooded the neighbourhoods where McCann, Farrell and Savage had lived with soldiers and police to try to prevent public displays of sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at. At the border, the authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> members of the procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse.|$|E

5|$|The Moscow militsiya {{sealed off}} {{downtown}} Moscow during the funeral on 15 November. Large avenues were tightly guarded by <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Moscow military garrison. The soldiers, {{who stood in}} front of the House of the Unions, wore black-edged red armbands. The House of the Unions was decorated by numerous red flags and other communist symbols. Brezhnev's body lay in state for three days at the House of the Unions. On the third day the coffin was placed on an artillery carriage towed by an olive-green BRDM-2 armored vehicle of the Red Army—led by dozens of wreaths as well as Brezhnev's decorations carried by Soviet military personnel and other mourners—to the Lenin Mausoleum on the Red Square, where it was greeted by speeches by Andropov; Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov; Anatoly Alexandrov, the President of the Academy of Sciences; and a factory worker. After the speeches, pallbearers, led by Andropov and Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, carried the coffin to another location close to the mausoleum. It was here that Brezhnev's family made their farewell. Before the body was laid to rest Viktoria kissed Brezhnev on the face in accordance with Russian traditions. As Brezhnev's body was lowered into the grave a military squad saluted while an orchestra played the Soviet national anthem. According to Time magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of Soviets.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} {{included two}} judges, {{one for the}} civil court {{and one for the}} criminal court. In the same building were the Office and Court of Appeals. The judges of the Castellania were native Maltese and dealt with cases {{that took place in the}} district of Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities. Other districts, such as those under the courts of Mdina and Rabat, followed the same model and had to adopt decisions taken at the Castellania. On three days per week, the Fiscal Prosecutor brought cases before the judges. There was also a Cancelliere, who was responsible for receiving and preserving judicial acts, registering the sentences meted out by the judges and supervising the other workers in the courts. There was a Gran Visconte (the Chief of police) who coordinated <b>the</b> <b>police,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Capitani di notte who implemented the sentences. Other workers included an official who saw that prisoners were treated fairly, those who were responsible for the archives and advocates for legal aid. Advocates were generally Italian-speaking Maltese, as most knights and foreigners considered the position as for the inferior people. A report was drafted weekly and sent to the palace of the Grand Master, informing about occurrences presented to the Castellania.|$|E
5|$|Tom {{is arrested}} by <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> guests prepare to leave. Lois goes to comfort Tom's co-anchor, Diane Simmons, only to {{intuitively}} realize {{she is the}} true murderer when Diane shows a dress for her solo debut on the news, even though she couldn't have known Tom would be leaving. Diane reveals that she had dated Woods until he dumped her upon her fortieth birthday, around which Tom arranged her to be replaced on the Channel 5 News. Seeking revenge, Diane bribed Priscilla to make James become a born-again Christian and throw the dinner party so she could murder Woods and frame Tom for the crime, but was forced to kill the other guests after her plan went awry upon Stephanie's accidental death. Priscilla woke up when she was removing the knife due to Joe pointing out her fingerprints were on it, so had her throat slit. When Diane was hiding the body in Tom's room, Muriel saw her so was stabbed. The murderess {{did not have time}} to conceal the knife, but was able to wipe her fingerprints clean. She killed Derek to stop the police getting involved. Diane then attempts to silence Lois by forcing her outside to a nearby cliff, only to be be shot down herself with a suppressed sniper rifle fired by Stewie, who proclaims if anyone were to kill Lois, he would be the one to do it.|$|E
