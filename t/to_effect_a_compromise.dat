One cannot read the negotiations without being convinced that they were never meant to succeed, and the party which did not mean them to succeed was the party which prepared all the time for war. De Villiers, a friendly critic, says of the Transvaal Government: 'Throughout the negotiations they have always been wriggling to prevent a clear and precise decision.' Surely the sequel showed clearly enough why this was so. Their military hand was stronger than their political one, and it was with that that they desired to play the game. It would not do, therefore, to get the negotiations into such a stage that a peaceful solution should become inevitable.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for designing optimal feedback controllers for systems having subsystem sensitivity constraints. Such constraints reflect {{the presence of}} subsystem performance indices which are {{in conflict with the}} performance index of the overall system. The key to the approach is the use of relative performance index sensitivity (a measure of the deviation of a performance index from its optimum value). The weighted sum of subsystem and/or operational mode relative performance index sensitivies is defined as an overall performance index. A method is developed to handle linear systems with quadratic performance indices and either full or partial state feedback. The usefulness of this method is demonstrated by applying it to the design of a stability augmentation system (SAS) for a VTOL aircraft. A desirable VTOL SAS design is one that produces good VTOL transient response both with and without active pilot control. The system designed using this method is shown <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> satisfactory <b>compromise</b> solution <b>to</b> this problem...|$|R

This paper {{describes}} the Hi-NOON neural simulator, originally {{conceived as a}} general-purpose, object-oriented software system for the simulation of small systems of biological neurons, {{as an aid to}} the study of links between neurophysiology and behaviour in lower animals. As such, the artificial neurons employed are spiking in nature: <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> <b>an</b> appropriate <b>compromise</b> between computational complexity and biological realism, modeling was at the transmembrane potential level of abstraction. Further, since real neural systems incorporate different types of neurons specialized to somewhat different functions, the software was written to accommodate a non-homogeneous population of neurons. Hi-NOON has been used in animat (cricket phonotaxis) and biologically-based robot studies. In particular, it was employed to implement the nervous system of our ARBIB robot. A simple model of synaptogenesis has been added so improving the stability of its learning {{in the light of the}} stability-plasticity dilemma, and as a mechanism for long-term memory. The efficacy of the simulator is illustrated with respect to some recent applications to situated systems studies. Now that Hi-NOON has been expanded to simulate large nervous systems in a concurrent environment, it can be applied to humanoid robotics in the future. ...|$|R
60|$|A roof, Richard contended, {{was a part}} of the edifice {{that the}} ancients always {{endeavored}} to conceal, it being an excrescence in architecture that was only to be tolerated on account of its usefulness. Besides, as he wittily added, a chief merit in a dwelling was to present a front on whichever side it might happen to be seen; for, as it was exposed to all eyes in all weathers, there should be no weak flank for envy or unneighborly criticism to assail. It was therefore decided that the roof should be flat, and with four faces. To this arrangement, Marmaduke objected the heavy snows that lay for months, frequently covering the earth to a depth of three or four feet. Happily the facilities of the composite order presented themselves <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise,</b> and the rafters were lengthened, so as to give a descent that should carry off the frozen element. But, unluckily, some mistake was made in the admeasurement of these material parts of the fabric; and, as one of the greatest recommendations of Hiram was his ability to work by the “square rule,” no opportunity was found of discovering the effect until the massive timbers were raised on the four walls of the building. Then, indeed, it was soon seen that, in defiance of all rule, the roof was by far the most conspicuous part of the whole edifice. Richard and his associate consoled themselves with the relief that the covering would aid in concealing this unnatural elevation; but every shingle that was laid only multiplied objects to look at. Richard essayed to remedy the evil with paint, and four different colors were laid on by his own hands. The first was a sky- blue, in the vain expectation that the eye might be cheated into the belief it was the heavens themselves that hung so imposingly over Marmaduke’s dwelling; the second was what he called a “cloud-color,” being nothing more nor less than an imitation of smoke; the third was what Richard termed an invisible green, an experiment that did not succeed against a background of sky. Abandoning the attempt to conceal, our architects drew upon their invention for means to ornament the offensive shingles.|$|E
6000|$|When Seneca {{followed}} {{the band of}} [...] "Injins" [...] and his co-anti-renters, in their precipitate retreat on the hamlet, his revelations produced a general consternation. It then became known that the young Paris spendthrift {{was on his own}} estate, that he had actually been among the disaffected that day, had learned many of their secrets, and had probably made black marks against certain of the tenants, whose leases were nearly expired. Bad as this was, of itself, it was not the worst of the matter. Nothing was more certain than the fact that this young landlord knew a few of those who had committed felony, and might have sundry highly probable suspicions as to others. The guilty lay at his mercy, as a matter of course; and there was a sufficiency of common sense left among these conspirators, to understand that a man, who must feel that attempts were making to rob him of his estate, would be very likely to turn the tables on his assailants, did an occasion offer. When men embark in an undertaking as innately nefarious as that of anti-rentism certainly is, when it is stripped of its pretentions and stands in its naked deformity, they are not apt to stop at trifles. To this desperate character of its mischief, the country owes the general depression of truth that has accompanied its career, its false and dangerous principles, its confusion between right and wrong, and finally its murders. It has been the miserable prerogative of demagogues alone, to defend its career and its demoralization. Thus has it happened that the country has seen the same quasi legislators--legislators by the vote of a party and the courtesy of the country, if by no other tenure--supporting with an air of high pretension, the very doubtful policy of attempting to make men moral by statute law, on the one side, while they go the full length of these property depredators, on the other! In such a state of society, {{it is not surprising that}} any expedient should be adopted to intimidate and bully me into silence. It was consequently determined, in a conclave of the chiefs, that a complaint should be made against my uncle and myself, before an anti-rent justice of the peace, for felony under the recent statute, in appearing [...] "disguised and armed," [...] as a means of preventing our complaints against real offenders. It is true, we were not in masks, but our disguises, nevertheless, were so effectual as possibly to meet the contingency contemplated by the law, had we been armed. As to weapons, however, we had been totally and intentionally without anything of the sort; but oaths cost villains, like those engaged in this plot, very little. Those oaths had been taken, and warrants were actually signed by the magistrate, of which the service was suspended at Seneca's solicitation, merely to enable the last <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> <b>compromise.</b> It was not thought sufficient, however, to menace my uncle and myself with a prosecution of this nature; intimidation of another sort was to be put in requisition, to enforce the dread of the legal proceedings; a measure which should let us see that our assailants were in downright earnest. Opportunity had ascertained that something serious was to be attempted, and she believed that very night, though what it was precisely was more than she knew; or knowing, was willing to communicate.|$|E

The flexibility which was a central design goal of Hi-NOON NOON means that the system is also capable of modelling interconnections of non-spiking artificial neurons with continuous or piecewise linear activation functions. The e cacy of the simulator is illustrated with respect to some recent applications to situated systems studies. We also consider prospects for integrating Hi-NOON NOON with a conventional circuit simulator in the future...|$|R
