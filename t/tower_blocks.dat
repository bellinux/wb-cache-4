5|$|Like much of British post-war planning, {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by large, cheap <b>tower</b> <b>blocks,</b> brutalist architecture {{and expansion of}} roads. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversed, with the closure of some main roads and the regeneration of the Broadmead shopping centre. In 2006 {{one of the city}} centre's tallest post-war blocks was torn down. Social housing <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> have also been demolished to be replaced by low rise homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{housing and}} land {{shortage}} within Smethwick continued after World War II, rendering {{the council to}} concentrate primarily on constructing medium-rise maisonettes, flats and high-rise <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> for social housing needs.|$|E
5|$|TheHeart and NumberOne are the {{residential}} {{elements of the}} development, providing 378 apartments in two <b>tower</b> <b>blocks.</b> TheHeart is a 22-storey apartment building on the quayside and NumberOne, another 22-storey building, is next to the studio facilities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{organisation}} has led {{and developed}} several innovative projects. Community Links’ advice sessions on unsafe <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> estates in the 1980s inspired the Newham <b>Tower</b> <b>Block</b> Tenants Campaign, {{and led to}} demolition of the Ronan Point <b>Tower</b> <b>Block</b> 1986 and establishment of The National <b>Tower</b> <b>Block</b> Campaign.|$|R
50|$|The total plinth area of <b>Tower</b> <b>Block</b> I is 31,559 sq m and <b>Tower</b> <b>Block</b> II is 33,304 sq m. The {{ground level}} is raised up to 1.40 m (4'7") to avoid water {{stagnation}} {{and to allow}} gravity flow of rainwater. Each <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> has three staircases and eight lifts and the building has a ramp with access to all floors. A separate fire-escape staircase and garbage disposal lift are found at the rear side of the building.|$|R
50|$|Trinity Green was {{included}} on a Mile End mural created in 2011. In 2016, local residents complained at proposals for Sainsbury's {{to build a}} 28-storey <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> less than 80 yd from the Trinity Green almshouses; they argued that the <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> would cast a shadow over the almshouses.|$|R
5|$|Lam Tin Estate {{consisted}} of <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> numbered 1 to 24. Blocks 1 to 14 of Lam Tin Estate were built between 1962 and 1965 as type 4 public housing buildings (第四型公屋); the other 10 towers were built between 1969 and 1975 as type 6 public housing buildings (第六型公屋). There was no Block 9, leaving {{the number of}} buildings in Lam Tin Estate at 23.|$|E
5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters on the roof of <b>tower</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{south bank}} of the Vardar river {{generally}} comprises highrise <b>tower</b> <b>blocks,</b> including the vast Karpoš neighbourhood which {{was built in the}} 1970s west of the centre. Towards the East, the new municipality of Aerodrom was planned in the 1980s to house 80,000 inhabitants {{on the site of the}} old airport. Between Karpoš and Aerodrom lies the city centre, rebuilt according to plans by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. The centre is surrounded by a row of long buildings suggesting a wall ("Gradski Zid").|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} an estimated 150 pirate {{radio stations in}} the UK. A large proportion of these pirate radio stations operate in London, with significant clusters in Harlesden, Crystal Palace, Stoke Newington, Southwark and Lambeth. Set-up costs for pirate radio stations are minimal with a transmitter generally built by the engineer of the station. In days gone by these were powered by car batteries, but when the Pirates moved to <b>tower</b> <b>blocks,</b> the power came directly from the block room. Pirate radio stations may receive income from advertising and publicising events at nightclubs. DJs may pay to broadcast on pirate radio stations to gain public exposure.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many places}} in London, the Old Kent Road area {{did not suffer}} {{significant}} bomb damage during World War II. In 1968, a flyover opened at the northern end allowing access to New Kent Road which catered for the main flow of traffic. During the 1970s, run-down Victorian properties on and around Old Kent Road were demolished {{to make way for}} new housing estates. Burgess Park was created as part of the County of London Plan in 1943, which recommended new parkland in the area. Several <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> were built along the road, although some earlier 19th-century buildings, such as Nos.360–386, survived.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, brutalist <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> {{were adopted}} as a {{solution}} and this period saw the building of new towns, including Glenrothes and Cumbernauld, but the social and building problems of these constructions soon became apparent. The creation of new towns and council house estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches. From the 1980s Scottish architecture began to recover its reputation, with new buildings like that created to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow and more recently the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh. There has also been urban regeneration, involving the replacement and renovation of existing buildings and landscapes. The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers {{and the introduction of}} English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland. As the production of state sponsored housing subsided in the 1970s there was a return to conservatism in church design, but there were some original and post-modern designs from the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Clearances around Albion Hill {{began in}} the 1950s. From 1959, the narrow, densely {{populated}} terraces between Albion Hill and Morley Street were cleared and replaced with landscaped open space and seven tower blocks—Brighton's first such buildings. The first, Highleigh, opened on 11 May 1961. Like its later neighbours, it has 11 storeys. The steep Richmond Street was severed {{as part of this}} redevelopment; its lower section was replaced by a zig-zag path down the hillside and a short road called Richmond Parade, and new roads (Grove Hill and Ashton Rise) were built between the <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> and across the slope of the hill. Similarly, the lowest section of Carlton Hill was renamed Kingswood Street when it was redeveloped in the 1960s: Brighton Art College (now part of the University of Brighton) was extended in 1967 by Brighton borough architect Percy Billington, taking up a large corner plot.|$|E
5|$|There are 13 {{residential}} neighbourhoods, {{each with}} a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows. There are no residential <b>tower</b> <b>blocks,</b> apart from the 8 storey Milton Mount Flats at the North end of Pound Hill. Many houses have their own gardens and are set back from roads. The hub of each neighbourhood is a shopping parade, community centre and church, and each has a school and recreational open spaces as well. Crawley Development Corporation's intention was for neighbourhood shops to cater only to basic needs, and for the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements. The number of shop units provided in the neighbourhood parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each neighbourhood, the number actually built ranged from 19 in the outlying Langley Green neighbourhood to just seven in West Green, close to the town centre.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Livingstone and {{his comrades}} {{developed}} a new strategy for obtaining political power in Lambeth borough. Focusing on campaigning for the marginal seats {{in the south of}} the borough, the safe Labour seats in the north were left to established party members. Public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of Prime Minister Edward Heath led to Labour's best local government results since the 1940s; Labour leftists gained every marginal seat in Lambeth, and the borough returned to Labour control. In October 1971, Livingstone's father died of a heart attack; his mother soon moved to Lincoln. That year, Labour members voted Livingstone Vice-Chairman of the Housing Committee on the Lambeth London Borough Council, his first job in local government. Reforming the housing system, Livingstone and Committee Chairman Ewan Carr cancelled the proposed rent increase for council housing, temporarily halting the construction of Europe's largest <b>tower</b> <b>blocks,</b> and founded a Family Squatting Group to ensure that homeless families would be immediately rehoused through squatting in empty houses. He increased the number of compulsory purchase orders for private-rented properties, converting them to council housing. They faced opposition to their reforms, which were cancelled by central government.|$|E

5|$|Populations of the {{peregrine}} falcon have bounced back {{in most parts}} of the world. In Britain, there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. In Southampton, a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on pain of a possible prison sentence, from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In many parts of the world {{peregrine falcon}}s have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, <b>tower</b> <b>blocks,</b> and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{junction}} with Tottenham Court Road suffered significant bomb damage during the Second World War. Patrick Abercrombie's contemporary Greater London Plan called for a new ring road around Central London called the 'A' Ring, but post-war budget constraints meant that a medley of existing routes were improved to form the ring road, including Euston Road. An underpass to avoid the junction with Tottenham Court Road was proposed in 1961, with construction taking place in 1964. The property developer Joe Levy was keen to develop buildings {{in the area and}} bought various properties. When the London County Council (LCC) refused planning permission because of the underpass development, Levy, who had outline planning permission, insisted the council pay him £1 million if they wanted to compulsorily purchase the site. Over the next four years, Levy bought properties along the north side of Euston Road, and an agreement was reached so that the council built the underpass and he built a complex of two <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> with office shops and apartments, the Euston Tower.|$|E
5|$|The older houses relied {{mainly on}} heating from open coal fires, {{which led to}} {{problems}} with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the Clean Air Act 1956. Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme to get well under way. In the 1950s, the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent <b>tower</b> <b>blocks.</b> By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a larger social housing stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood.|$|E

25|$|Starting in the 1950s, a {{total of}} 464 <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> above six storeys were built in Birmingham, 7% of all the <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> {{constructed}} in the United Kingdom, with the first Birmingham <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> being built in Duddeston, part of the Nechells and Duddeston Redevelopment Area, in the late-1950s. They were designed by S.N. Cooke and Partners and proved to be extremely costly for the city council. In 1960, the Lyndhurst estate in Erdington was completed and the entire estate won a Civic Trust award in 1961. The main tower block on the estate, the 16storey Harlech Tower, became the tallest tower block in the city, although it was later surpassed by many more <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> including the 32storey Sentinels in the city centre, which were inspired by the Marina City complex in Chicago. Stephenson Tower was another city-centre tower block, located on top of New Street Station, although the refurbishment of New Street Station saw the demolition of the tower. A group of four <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> located behind The Rep Theatre on Broad Street have also undergone an extensive renovation to improve their insulation and appearance.|$|E
25|$|These {{plans were}} for the {{demolition}} of 1,416 homes including 17 of the 34 <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> and 24 of the 27 maisonette blocks. Of the <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> proposed for demolition were the Centre 8 blocks and five additional <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> which had been identified as being in such a poor state that renovation was not possible. 1,100 homes were to be constructed on the sites released by demolition. The remaining <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> which included the fourteen on Farnborough Road and Concorde Tower were to be refurbished with new insulation and security features. The other low-rise residential properties were also to be refurbished in Neighbourhood Strategies. Economic proposals included the large-scale redevelopment of Castle Vale Shopping Centre to create a modern hub for the community and for new offices to be constructed for the community organisations. Plans for an upgrade of the medical services were already advancing when the masterplan was being produced.|$|E
