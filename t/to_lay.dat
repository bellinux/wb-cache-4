5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, both ships were mobilized <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> a series of minefields, initially to protect Germany's coastlines in the North and Baltic Seas. In August, the two ships laid offensive minefields off the British coast, and Nautilus made a similar attempt in October that was cancelled when radio intercepts indicated British naval forces were present. In June 1915, Albatross {{was transferred to the}} eastern Baltic, where she began <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> offensive minefields. The last of these resulted in the Battle of Åland Islands on 2 July after a group of Russian armored cruisers intercepted Albatross and her escorts. The cruisers badly damaged Albatross, and to prevent her sinking, her captain beached the ship off the coast of neutral Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} (SMAW), also known as manual {{metal arc welding}} (MMA or MMAW), flux {{shielded}} arc welding or informally as stick welding, is a manual arc welding process that uses a consumable electrode covered with a flux <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> the weld.|$|E
5|$|Sloped, {{vertical}} or upside-down welding {{requires more}} operator skill, and often necessitates {{the use of}} an electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool.

Towards {{the end of}} her life, the queen reverts <b>to</b> <b>laying</b> fertilized eggs. These eggs give rise to new female queens. The new adult queens forage for food. They use the nest for shelter, but the new queens do not contribute to the nests food reserves. During this time, the new queens mate with roaming male drones, build up reserves of body fat, and fill their nectar crop with honey to survive winter hibernation. The rest of the colony, including the old queen, dies in mid-autumn.|$|R

5|$|All birds lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many {{exceptions}} to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.|$|E
