50|$|A {{resistive}} <b>touchscreen</b> <b>panel</b> comprises several layers, {{the most}} important of which are two thin, transparent electrically resistive layers separated by a thin space. These layers face each other with a thin gap between. The top screen (the screen that is touched) has a coating on the underside surface of the screen. Just beneath it is a similar resistive layer on top of its substrate. One layer has conductive connections along its sides, the other along top and bottom. A voltage is applied to one layer, and sensed by the other. When an object, such as a fingertip or stylus tip, presses down onto the outer surface, the two layers touch to become connected at that point: The panel then behaves as a pair of voltage dividers, one axis at a time. By rapidly switching between each layer, the position of a pressure on the screen can be read.|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{progress}} in flexible or stretchable electronics {{over the past}} decade has extensively impacted various technologies such as wearable devices, displays and automotive electronics for smart cars. An important challenge is the reliability of these deformable devices under thermal stress. Different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between plastic substrates and the device components, which include multiple inorganic layers of metals or ceramics, induce thermal stress in the devices during fabrication processes or long-term operations with repetitions of thermal cyclic loading&# 8211;unloading, leading to device failure and reliability degradation. Here, we report an unconventional approach to form photo-patternable, transparent cellulose nanofiber (CNF) hybrid films as flexible and stretchable substrates to improve device reliability using simultaneous electrospinning and spraying. The electrospun polymeric backbones and sprayed CNF fillers enable the resulting hybrid structure to be photolithographically patternable as a negative photoresist and thermally and mechanically stable, presenting outstanding optical transparency and low CTE. We also formed stretchable origami substrates using the CNF hybrid that are composed of rigid support fixtures and elastomeric joints, exploiting the photo-patternability. A demonstration of transparent organic light-emitting diodes and <b>touchscreen</b> <b>panels</b> on the hybrid film suggests its potential for use in next-generation electronics. ope...|$|R
40|$|Various {{wearable}} {{electronic devices}} {{have been developed}} for extensive outdoor activities. The key metrics for these wearable devices are high touch sensitivity and good mechanical and thermal stability of the flexible <b>touchscreen</b> <b>panels</b> (TSPs). Their dielectric constants (k) are important for high touch sensitivities. Thus, studies on flexible and transparent cover layers that have high k with outstanding mechanical and thermal reliabilities are essential. Herein, an unconventional approach for forming flexible and transparent cellulose nanofiber (CNF) films is reported. These films are used to embed ultralong metal nanofibers that serve as nanofillers to increase k significantly (above 9. 2 with high transmittance of 90 %). Also, by controlling the dimensions and aspect ratios of these fillers, the effects of their nanostructures and contents on the optical and dielectric properties of the films have been studied. The length of the nanofibers can be controlled using a stretching method to break the highly aligned, ultralong nanofibers. These nanofiber-embedded, high-k films are mechanically and thermally stable, and they have better Young's modulus and tensile strength with lower thermal expansion than commercial transparent plastics. The demonstration of highly sensitive TSPs using high-k CNF film for smartphones suggests that this film has significant potential for next-generation, portable electronic devices...|$|R

40|$|The conspicuously massive {{growth in}} the number of {{products}} utilizing capacitive touchscreen technology has raised awareness of the technology. The embedded system used to detect and report finger touches to the host is fairly complex and difficult to verify. An automated verification system is required to systematically test this type of system in a reasonable amount of time. This thesis describes the framework for an automated verification system for embedded capacitive touchscreen systems. The framework includes a Cartesian desktop robot, test instruments, communications bridge, and custom-built test management software. The criteria for selecting a Cartesian desktop robot rather than a SCARA robot are discussed. The SCARA robot provides quicker but less precise movements, while the Cartesian desktop robot supports a larger payload and accommodates more <b>touchscreen</b> <b>panels</b> in its work envelope. The criteria for choosing to develop custom-built test management software instead of purchasing existing off-the-shelf test management are also discussed. Both solutions support hardware abstraction, verification procedures, procedure sequencing, and output of the results. The custom-built solution is more flexible, providing access to how the software framework is implemented and allowing adjustments as needed. Off-the-shelf solutions are limited in what customizations they support and often have unnecessary features that utilize valuable computing resources...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} {{ability of}} industrial robots to perform complex tasks {{in collaboration with}} humans requires more capable ways of communication and interaction. Traditional systems use separate interfaces such as <b>touchscreens</b> or control <b>panels</b> in order to operate the robot, or to communicate its state and prospective actions to the user. Transferring human communication, such as gestures to technical non-humanoid robots, creates various opportunities for more intuitive humanrobot-interaction. Interaction shall no longer require a separate interface such as a control panel. Instead, it should take place directly between human and robot. To explore intuitive interaction, we identified gestures that are relevant for co-working tasks from human observations. Based on a decomposition approach we transferred them to robotic systems of increasing abstraction and experimentally evaluated how well these gestures are recognized by humans. We created a humanrobot interaction use-case in order to perform the task of handling dangerous liquid. Results indicate that several gestures are well perceived when displayed with context information regarding the task. I...|$|R
