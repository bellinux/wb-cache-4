40|$|Despite {{increases}} {{in the number of}} nations permitting elective pregnancy termination, abortion facility location has not widely attracted the attention of scholars. This paper, however, explores the spatial bias of abortion facility location in the northeastern United States. Constructing and testing two sets of regression models with time of location and intensity of location, respectively, employed as the dependent variables it was found that several variables were important in abortion facility location in the study area, while several other variables were found not important. Among the variables having an affect upon location of pregnancy <b>termination</b> <b>facilities</b> were legislative action, population size, and proportion of females in the population. Variables having no influence were presence of opposition groups, and income level of an area. The diffusion pattern of northeastern United States abortion facilities was typical of a technological innovation in a developed region. Initial spread was contagious, followed by hierarchical according to the size of urban centers, followed by an infilling process whereby areas between the large centers began adopting the innovation. ...|$|E

25|$|Copper roofs {{may be used}} as part of a {{lightning}} protection scheme where the copper skin, gutters and rainwater pipes can be linked and bonded to an earth <b>termination</b> <b>facility.</b> The thickness of copper specified for roofing materials is usually adequate for lightning protection. A dedicated lightning protection system may be recommended to adequate lightning protection with an installed copper roof system. The system would include air terminals and intercepting conductors on the roof, a system of ground electrodes, and a system of down-conductors connecting the roof and ground components. It is recommended that the copper roof be bonded to the system of conductors. Bonding ensures that the conductors and roof remain at equipotential and reduce side flashing and possible roof damage.|$|R

40|$|Commission (NRC) is {{noticing the}} {{approval}} of the decommissioning plan for the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT or the licensee) GT Research Reactor (GTRR) and is also noticing the <b>termination</b> of <b>Facility</b> Operating License No. Râ€“ 97 for the GTRR. The NRC has terminated the license of the decommissioned GTRR, which was in the Neely Nuclear Research Center in the north-central part of the GT campus in the city of Atlanta, Georgia, and has released the site for unrestricted use. The licensee requested termination of the license in a letter to NRC dated June 14, 2002. The GTRR was a 5 MW thermal, heavy-water-moderated,-cooled, and-reflected reactor that was fueled with uranium aluminum alloy plates. It was licensed and first operated in 1964 and had a licensed thermal power level of 1 MW, which was upgraded to 5000 kW thermal in 1974. The reactor was permanently shut down on November 17, 1995. The licensee submitted a decommissioning plan to NRC for review and approval in letter...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{has become}} inevitably exuberant {{at the edge}} nodes of metro- and/or wide-area networks due to the triple play transports of voice, data and video information globally supported on the bricolage of modern Internet. Commensurately, the local exchange carriers improvise necessary infrastructure at the physical-layer level across the entire turf of the service area. Pertinent to this context, {{the scope of this}} study is to evaluate the conjectural impact on trunk <b>terminations</b> (and related <b>facility)</b> that decide the forecasts on network access line (NAL) requirements at the traditional circuit-switches (of T 1 -hierarchy) located in the premises of a central office (CO) where the changing trends in traffic patterns of telecommunication transports are encountered. For optimal engineering designs of interoffice facility, the dynamics of such NAL requirements is modeled in terms of traffic profiles measured in terms of centum-call-second metric at CO terminations...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring of {{leachate}} {{quality is}} the essential measure in aftercare for evaluating landfill stabilization. Generally, the most common way of leachate monitoring is executed at inlet of leachate treatment facility. However, {{it does not necessarily}} reflect actual state of the site. Thus, not only the methodologies focusing on the discharge for the determination of <b>facility</b> <b>termination</b> but also the methodology that is capable to seize the degree of waste stabilization in landfill must be necessary. In the study, monitoring of leachate quality stored in 68 gas ventilation pipes was conducted and degree of waste stabilization at each location in the landfill was estimated by a statistical approach using the results obtained by monitoring. Leachate characteristics varied significantly for each pipe but seemed to reflect the waste condition of nearby location. Correlation among the analysed items was quite high. Namely, the difference of leachate quality seemed to be categorized by only the level of concentration but not specific characteristics. To confirm this, Euclidean distances of dissimilarity were calculated by multidimensional scaling by using six items of leachate quality and temperature. Two factors (thickness of leachate and concentration of TOC and EC) that distinguish leachate characteristics appeared. To indicate the degree of stabilization by location, spatial distribution of TOC, TN, IC, and CI were estimated by using the ordinary Kriging methodology. As the result, it was estimated that concentration of leachate existing within the landfill, especially TN, was higher than completion criteria for leachate, in most part of calculated area...|$|R
