40|$|Discus throw is {{track and}} field event with acyclic type of movement. It is {{performed}} with specific rhythm. Athlete tries to direct maximal speed {{from all of the}} body segments towards the discus in order to achieve the maximum result. Beside initial velocity, discus position {{at the time of the}} throw and its rotation around its axis largely influence on <b>throw</b> <b>length.</b> During its flight discus is exposed to aerodynamic forces, which can extend or reduce its trajectory. The best results are accomplished by circular movement of the body, by which discus is thrown 8 to 12 meters. This part of the body movement which influences on the discus is performed in the interval of 0. 14 to 0. 16 seconds. It is common for all throwing events that throwing technique is divided into four phases with different sub phases...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{reliable}} measurement of droplet velocities and droplet size has increased {{with the more}} widespread use of water mist systems. Two optical measuring techniques have been investigated, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and phase Doppler anemometry (PDA). Measurements have been performed on two high-pressure nozzles, a hollow cone nozzle and a full cone nozzle. Both methods performed well close to the nozzle and further away from the nozzle. In the intermediate region the results obtained with PIV are biased against the larger droplets. The two methods complement each other, PIV giving the instantaneous velocity field and PDA giving both the droplet velocity and droplet size at a point. The measurement indicates that higher <b>throw</b> <b>length</b> can be archived with a full cone nozzle compared to the hollow cone nozzle, if both nozzles have the same cone angle and flow rate...|$|E
40|$|Jets {{generated}} at chute ends move {{a potential}} scour zone {{away from the}} dam, and dissipate flow energy to reduce the scour. Usually, so-called flip buckets or ski jumps are provided to generate jets, yet they are rarely issued by deflectors. The application of a theoretical mass point parabola is limited to predict the jet features, because effects related to the take-off angle and the disintegration process affect the jet air transport and trajectories. This research discusses the effect of pre-aeration of the approach chute flow on the jet features. A comparison with a former study indicates that mainly the upper jet portion is affected, that the black water jet core becomes shorter, and that the air transport increases. Although the lower trajectory is less affected and thus remains more coherent, the small effect of pre-aeration is sufficient to reduce the total jet <b>throw</b> <b>length,</b> so that pre-aerated jets tend to be shorter as compared with black-water approach flow jets, in agreement with prototype observations...|$|E

Objectives: The aim is to identify and compare the {{influence of}} the anaerobic burden of shuttle the accuracy and length of throw a grenade at a selected group of 20 students of the University of Defence in Brno. Students will participate in three testing grenade throwing. Throwing at a target, the size 6 x 3 m, no load, after load in the form of cross shuttle run 10 x 10 m and after loading with 15 kg backpack. Methods: It is a descriptive analysis. Measurements were performed using a tape measure and observing the impact of throws. For statistical evaluation of the comparative method was used.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to define the influence of the kinematic parameters in the javelin throw success in the top junior athletes at the European Junior Athletics Championships in Novi Sad. A set, consisting of 17 kinematic variables, was applied on a sample of 16 athletes, and the same variables were registered at the 2009 Novi Sad European Junior Championships. The criteria variable was the achieved <b>throw</b> <b>length</b> (javelin throw). The subjects were represented by 113 successful javelin throws. The results of the chosen kinematic variables correlation analysis showed the existence of multiple significant relations between the observed variables. Based on the observed kinematic variables correlation analysis, the next conclusion can be made: the javelin release speed has the most important role, followed by the fast front support leg placing. The results are expected and logical, and can be used in kinesiology practice, especially in the process of young throwers 2 ̆ 7 technique learning and in development of motor abilities relevant for this athletic discipline...|$|E
40|$|The rugby union {{line-out}} {{is a key}} {{aspect of}} game play and involves players from both teams contesting for the ball {{after it has been}} thrown in from the side line. Successful lines-out throws require the ball to be delivered accurately to the hands of a jumping and/or lifted team mate (approximately 3 - 3. 5 m off the ground) over distances of between 5 - 18 m. Previous research has suggested considerable inter and intra-individual differences in the throwing techniques of international level players. Accordingly, this project investigated the interrelationships between accuracy and the line-out throwing characteristics of three elite international rugby players, and then analyzed whether these changed for throws over increasing length. Three-dimensional (3 D) data were developed from video footage (50 Hz) of three elite international subjects for 30 throws over three distances (6 m, 10 m, and 15 m). Results showed notable differences between subjects in many variables at each of the key throw phases. However, several variables such as the degree of trunk flexion {{at the end of the}} backswing and at ball release, coupled with elbow flexion angle at ball release remained constant as <b>throw</b> <b>length</b> increased. All subjects exhibited high levels of consistency in movement patterns across all throw lengths. Findings indicated that these high performance line-out throwers shared several common characteristics that will provide useful guides in the development of training program...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{evaluate}} a method of automated cutting needle biopsy (ACNB) that combines {{the use of a}} long-throw needle, higher mean number of needle passes, and tandem system, in terms of the accuracy of specific diagnosis of small and large lung lesions and the safety of the procedure. Materials and Methods: Fifty-seven ACNBs were performed under computed tomography guidance using a tandem system with a 20 -gauge and 18 -gauge (through non-aerated lung) automated cutting needle with a <b>throw</b> <b>length</b> of 23 mm. We classified the nodules into 21 small nodules (≤ 2 cm) and 36 large nodules (> 2 cm). All ACNB diagnoses were divided into three groups: specific, non-specific, and false diagnoses. All of the complications were recorded. Results: The mean number of ACNB specimens obtained was 2. 0. Of the 35 ACNB procedures for malignant lesions, 33 yielded a specific malignant diagnosis (33 / 35, 94 %). Of the 22 procedures for benign lesions, 17 gave a specific benign diagnosis (17 / 22, 77 %). The diagnostic accuracy for small nodules was no lower than that for large nodules. Postbiopsy pneumothorax occurred in 18 patients (32 %). Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of the combined method is as high for small lung nodules as for large ones. The procedure has high diagnostic accuracy for the subtypes of lung cancer and an acceptable complication rate. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|The potency rate is {{obtained}} {{by noting that}} pristine seafloor enters the outer rise at the subduction rate U and exits into the trench with horizontal strain and absolute <b>throw</b> per <b>length</b> of H/X.

The absolute value of throw across the outer rise is HW/X and seafloor remains in the outer rise over a time W/U. That is, the time averaged throw production for a batch of seafloor equals the spatial averaged rate of throw production across the outer rise.
