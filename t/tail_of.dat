5|$|The spiny {{plates on}} the back and <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the tuatara {{resemble}} those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to break off its tail when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 caudal vertebrae. Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only caudal vertebrae known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
40|$|The <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> {{gravitational}} waves {{are caused by}} scattering of linear waves onto the space-time curvature generated by the total mass-energy of the source. Quite naturally, the <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>tails</b> are caused by curvature scattering <b>of</b> the <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> waves themselves. The <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>tails</b> {{are associated with the}} cubic non-linear interaction between two mass monopole moments and, dominantly, the mass quadrupole of the source. In this paper we determine the radiation field at large distances from the source for this particular monopole-monopole-quadrupole interaction. We find that the <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>tails</b> appear at the third post-Newtonian (3 PN) order beyond the usual quadrupole radiation. Motivated by the need of accurate templates {{to be used in the}} data analysis of future detectors of {{gravitational waves}}, we compute the contribution <b>of</b> <b>tails,</b> and <b>of</b> <b>tails</b> <b>of</b> <b>tails,</b> up to the 3. 5 PN order in the energy flux generated by inspiraling compact binaries.

5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|Body {{impressions}} of Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania {{suggest that some}} terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians. They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water. The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were gregarious. The head of one individual rests under the <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> another {{in what may be}} a courtship display. Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders.|$|E

5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> gas and dust often {{visible to the naked}} eye.|$|E

5|$|From a {{behavioral}} standpoint, {{one of the}} most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971.

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation process can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|Least weasels {{from various}} parts of its range vary greatly in size. The body is slender and {{elongated}} and the legs and tail are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs and <b>tail</b> <b>of</b> the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating {{the boundary between the}} two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and {{in the northern part of}} its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.|$|E

Like other species of fairywrens, splendid fairywrens may use a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds.

50|$|One of the {{differentiating}} {{features of}} males and females is the males have thicker and longer tails (because they contain the inverted hemipenes).
