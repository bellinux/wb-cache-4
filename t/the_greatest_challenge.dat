5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Ape Escape lasted approximately two-and-a-half years. Shortly after the development team began conceiving {{the design and}} concept for Ape Escape, they attended a meeting regarding the {{development of}} the DualShock. Intrigued by the potential of the controller, the team implemented its use in Ape Escape, making it the first video game to require the use of the DualShock for gameplay. Conceptualizing the controls for the controller's analog sticks was <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> for the team, and the controls underwent great testing prior to finalization.|$|E

According to Shinkai, <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> in the project was to keep the animation both short and entertaining while also covering the two main themes: family bonds and the future. Hirano's narration, which provided character background and insight into their personalities, helped Shinkai structure the film.|$|E
5|$|Two Rivers is {{the final}} {{checkpoint}} in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Mushers are required to rest at least eight hours in Two Rivers in odd years to ensure the health of their dogs during the final leg of the race. The terrain in this stretch is among the easiest on the trail, with gently rolling hills and forest which gradually change into an urban landscape as racers approach Fairbanks. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> for racers in the Two Rivers area is distinguishing the Yukon Quest trail from other sled dog trails, {{many of which have}} similar markings. Mushers have occasionally been deceived by these markings and taken wrong turns.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of the difficulties in developing a God of War game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes, and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.|$|E

5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E
25|$|Holding an {{exploding}} bomb together is <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> of fission weapon design.

25|$|On {{the western}} side of Ottawa, phase two opened a year later in October, 1961. The central section {{presented}} <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge,</b> as an embankment was built to create grade-separations. In addition, the structures over the Rideau Canal and river required several years of construction. On May15, 1964, the majority of the third phase was ceremonially opened.|$|E

Generals must learn to do and stick to their job of strategists and planners, leaving tactics where they belong; platoon commanders must learn to take their own growing share of responsibility to conduct actions that concur with the intent indicated by generals, without minute by minute directions.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> facing Bowell {{as prime}} {{minister}} was the Manitoba Schools Question. The Conservative Party was bitterly divided {{on how to handle}} the Manitoba Schools Question, and as a result, on January 4, 1896, seven cabinet ministers resigned, demanding the return of Tupper. As a result, Bowell and Aberdeen were forced to invite Tupper to join the 6th Canadian Ministry and on January 15 Tupper became Secretary of State for Canada, with the understanding that he would become prime minister following the dissolution of the 7th Canadian Parliament.|$|E
25|$|All the {{proteins}} from the tissue {{are present in}} the gel, so that individual enzymes must be identified using an assay that links their function to a staining reaction. For example, detection can be based on the localised precipitation of soluble indicator dyes such as tetrazolium salts which become insoluble when they are reduced by cofactors such as NAD or NADP, which generated in zones of enzyme activity. This assay method requires that the enzymes are still functional after separation (native gel electrophoresis), and provides <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> to using isozymes as a laboratory technique.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> to the {{recycling}} of plastics is {{the difficulty of}} automating the sorting of plastic wastes, making it labor-intensive. Typically, workers sort the plastic {{by looking at the}} resin identification code, although common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory. Typically, the caps for PETE bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not recyclable, which presents additional problems for the sorting process. Other recyclable materials such as metals are easier to process mechanically. However, new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed to increase the capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling.|$|E
25|$|The {{engineering}} {{problems associated}} with leaving Earth and developing space propulsion systems have been examined for over a century, and millions of man-hours of research have been spent on them. In recent {{years there has been}} an increase in research on the issue of how humans can survive and work in space for extended and possibly indefinite periods of time. This question requires input from the physical and biological sciences and has now become <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> (other than funding) facing human space exploration. A fundamental step in overcoming this challenge is trying to understand the effects and impact of long-term space travel on the human body.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> to the {{department}} and its detectives during Seedman's tenure as chief was the Black Liberation Army (BLA). An offshoot of the Black Panthers who espoused a more militant and radical philosophy, they staged deadly ambushes on police officers in cities across the country. In New York their three attacks left four officers dead and two seriously wounded; in one, no suspects have ever been identified. After one of the attacks the BLA claimed responsibility, saying it was avenging the deaths of 19 prisoners in the Attica prison riots the previous year. It was {{in this context that}} the incident that ended Seedman's police career occurred.|$|E

25|$|In both cases, {{having a}} crew member lift {{the end of the}} mast out of the water may help speed the process, as <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> of righting a capsized boat is {{shedding}} the weight of the water from the sails. A helpful step, where possible (on a loose footed sail), is to disconnect the clew of the sail from the boom, which prevents the sail from scooping up water as the sail lifts out of the water. The bow of the capsized vessel should be pointed towards the wind so that when the sail starts to lift out of the water the wind can catch underneath the sail and help right the boat.|$|E
25|$|Certain themes appear {{repeatedly}} in {{depictions of the}} journey. Ra overcomes numerous obstacles in his course, representative of the effort necessary to maintain maat. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> is the opposition of Apep, a serpent god who represents the destructive aspect of disorder, and who threatens to destroy the sun god and plunge creation into chaos. In many of the texts, Ra overcomes these obstacles {{with the assistance of}} other deities who travel with him; they stand for various powers that are necessary to uphold Ra's authority. In his passage Ra also brings light to the Duat, enlivening the blessed dead who dwell there. In contrast, his enemies—people who have undermined maat—are tormented and thrown into dark pits or lakes of fire.|$|E
25|$|After the Revolution, {{genuinely}} {{democratic politics}} became {{possible in the}} former colonies. The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Concepts of liberty, individual rights, equality among men and hostility toward corruption became incorporated as core values of liberal republicanism. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>challenge</b> to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on {{the consent of the}} governed. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with directly elected representative government.|$|E
