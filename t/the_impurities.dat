40|$|We {{consider}} a finite, disordered 1 D quantum lattice with a side-attached impurity. We study theoretically {{the transport of}} a single electron from <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> into <b>the</b> lattice, at zero temperature. The transport is dominated by Anderson localization and, in general, the electron motion has a random character due to the lattice disorder. However, we show that by adjusting <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> energy <b>the</b> electron can attain quasi-periodic motions, oscillating between <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> and a small region of the lattice.

5|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is contaminated {{it may not be}} used for ritual purification.

The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.|$|E
