5|$|The Griffins, the Swansons, and Quagmire {{prepare for}} a road trip, ostensibly for a {{vacation}} in Maine. Quagmire distracts Bonnie and Lois as Peter alters course to Virginia instead.

Peter asks Cleveland where he first heard the joke, and Cleveland reveals that a Washington, D.C., bellhop named Sal Russo <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him. The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin. Joe shoots out one of the car's tires, causing it to spin out of control and flip onto its roof. The Quahog group arrive at a Washington hotel and locate Sal, who is reluctant to reveal the source of the joke. He races away on a handcart through Washington.

25|$|The pelesit {{is created}} from the tongue {{of a newly}} buried dead body whose mother was also the eldest of her siblings. Its {{appearance}} {{is that of a}} cricket and it is kept in a bottle which is buried if the owner wishes to rid herself of it. In advance of a polong's arrival, the pelesit will enter the body of whomever its mistress has <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> attack. A person who has been thus afflicted might rave about cats. The pelesit is in many ways comparable to the bajang, but whereas the bajang's owner is always male, the pelesit may only be kept by a female. It may be fed on blood from the tip of the fourth finger or, alternatively, with saffron rice. Like the polong, the pelesit can be forced to reveal the name of their owner through magical questioning.|$|E

500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{parody of}} the song {{performed}} by Bieber caused controversy after a video of it was released by the entertainment news website TMZ on June 4, 2014. The video featured a then 14-year-old Bieber, parodying the song with the main lyric [...] "One less lonely nigger," [...] and {{that if he were}} to kill [...] "one less lonely nigger," [...] he'd be [...] "part of the KKK." [...] Sources stated that Bieber told his mentors, musical artists Usher and Will Smith, about the video after it was filmed, after which Usher showed Bieber some historically racist videos in an effort to teach him about the degradational intent of the word [...] "nigger" [...] and other racial epithets.

He said Maine says Bieber is still family for the artists on Young Money, according to TMZ. The publication reports that Maine says Bieber has black friends and that [...] "Bieber does not have a slave mentality." [...] According to Mack Maine, Bieber [...] "treats his people with respect."

2500|$|Before leaving Hogwarts to {{accompany}} Dumbledore in locating another horcrux –part of Voldemort's soul– Harry discovers from Professor Trelawney {{that it was}} Snape who overheard the prophecy and <b>told</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Voldemort, resulting in Voldemort hunting down Harry and his parents. Despite this and Harry's angry questions, Dumbledore avers his trust in Snape. Returning to Hogwarts after retrieving Voldemort's Horcrux, Harry and Dumbledore alight atop the school's astronomy tower. Gravely weakened by the horcrux's protective potion, Dumbledore tells Harry he must fetch Snape, but before Harry can leave, Draco suddenly arrives, intending to carry out Voldemort's order to assassinate Dumbledore, closely followed by other Death Eaters (followers of Voldemort), and Snape. Snape interrupts the planned murder, killing the headmaster himself. Harry, who is paralysed under his invisibility cloak by Dumbledore for his own protection, witnesses the kill, and is released upon Dumbledore's death. Enraged, he pursues Snape, Draco, and the Death Eaters as they flee the castle. Snape easily blocks Harry's spells and jeeringly points out Harry's mistakes, but never strikes back. During the confrontation, Snape reveals himself as the eponymous [...] "Half-Blood Prince" [...] (being the half-blood son of Muggle Tobias Snape and pure-blood Eileen Prince). Snape passes through the school gates and Disapparates with Draco in tow at the book's end. The full relationship between Dumbledore and Snape {{and the reason for}} Snape's actions remain unknown until the final book. In an interview, Rowling mentioned that {{at this point in the}} series, the Harry–Snape relationship has become [...] "as personal, if not more so, than Harry–Voldemort." ...|$|E
