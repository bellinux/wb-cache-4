50|$|High-strain-rate {{superplasticity}} {{has been}} observed in aluminium-based and magnesium-based alloys. But for ceramic materials, superplastic deformation has been restricted to low strain rates for most oxides, and nitrides {{with the presence of}} cavities leading to premature failure. Here we show that a composite ceramic material consisting of tetragonal zirconium oxide, magnesium aluminates spinal and alpha-alumina phase exhibit superplasticity at strain rates up to 1.0 s−1. The composite also exhibits a large <b>tensile</b> <b>elongation,</b> exceeding 1050% or a strain rate of 0.4 s−1.Superplastic metals and ceramics have the ability to deform over 100% without fracturing, permitting net-shape forming at high temperatures. These intriguing materials deform primarily by grain boundary sliding, a process accelerated with a fine grain size. However, most ceramics that start with a fine grain size experience rapid grain growth during high temperature deformation, rendering them unsuitable for extended superplastic forming. One can limit grain growth using a minor second phase (Zener pinning) or by making a ceramic with three phases, where grain to grain contact of the same phase is minimized. A research on fine grain three phase alumina-mullite(3Al2O3•2SiO2)-zirconia, with approximately equal volume fractions of the three phases, demonstrates that superplastic strain rates as high as 10−2/sec at 1500 °C can be reached. These high strain rates put ceramic superplastic forming into the realm of commercial feasibility.|$|E

The beneficial effect of gas bubbling on the <b>tensile</b> <b>elongation</b> of castings was {{resulted from the}} removal of inclusions in melt. The removal efficiency of inclusion by bubble floatation is dependent on processing variables including flow rate of gas, gas blowing time and melt temperature.

40|$|The {{effective}} forming of near-net-shape {{parts from}} aluminum alloys is of significant interest for automotive and aerospace applications. It {{has traditionally been}} thought that the very high tensile ductilities necessary for many near-net-shape forming operations, in excess of 100 %, were only available in fine-grain superplastic materials. Tensile ductilities in excess of 300 %, however, have been attained in coarse-grain, non-superplastic, binary Al-Mg alloys {{as a result of}} a solute-drag-controlled dislocation creep process. Such enhanced ductilities from non-superplastic Al-Mg alloys might offer an inexpensive alternative to superplastic alloys that often require elaborate processing to develop fine grain sizes. In this investigation, tension tests at various temperatures and strain rates were used to characterize the ductility, strain-rate sensitivity, and strain-hardening behavior of two binary alloys: Al- 2. 8 wt. %Mg and Al- 5. 5 wt. %Mg. Under the proper conditions, <b>tensile</b> <b>elongations</b> of 300 % were achieved.
