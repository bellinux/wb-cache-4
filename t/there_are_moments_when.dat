500|$|Taylor {{praised the}} music: [...] "Brayson's catchy score, which moves deftly through swing, blues, jazz and early rock'n'roll can rise to good old showbiz brassiness when needed". Henry Hitchings of the Evening Standard gave a mixed {{view of the}} music, [...] "There are seductive melodies {{and a couple of}} {{genuinely}} catchy songs. But it never settles into a single confident idiom, and between the big numbers there are lulls, especially in the overlong first half." [...] Letts praised Campbell for his vocal talents, stating that he [...] "does some worthy old-fashioned crooning – in a pleasant song called 'Marking Time' <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> he actually sounds like Nat King Cole." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} split about Lazenby; {{he has been}} {{considered}} {{to have been the}} worst Bond, and has variously been described as [...] "laconic and humourless", [...] "a little stiff" [...] and [...] "annoying and smug". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> one yearns for a little of his louche panache". The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement". Pauline Kael called Lazenby [...] "quite a dull fellow" [...] in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker. However, Peter R. Hunt, director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying [...] "he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed".|$|E
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E

500|$|Jordan Sowunmi of Exclaim! {{stated that}} the album excels when Hopsin [...] "focuses on {{external}} obsessions: ode to amateur skating 'Nollie Tre Flip' has the most enticingly offbeat rapping on the album, {{as well as a}} dizzying internal rhyme scheme, while 'Turn on the Lights' analogue 'Dream Forever' is heartfelt and raw." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic praised the album's consistency for providing [...] "shocking lyrics and infectious hooks", highlighting 'Rip Your Heart Out' featuring Tech N9ne as a standout track. Dominick Grillo of DJBooth noted that Hopsin's [...] "technical passionate wordplays offer constant comparisons to Eminem", concluding that the album is [...] "a dark, often violent creative response to the pressure now resting on Hopsin's shoulders", conceding that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> Hopsin [...] "weighs himself (and the audience) down with layers upon layers of negativity", though admitting that the album [...] "works best when Hopsin is either angrily fighting or humorously poking fun at some sort of ludicrosity." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{consumer}} {{magazines and}} newspapers generally gave Gone with the Wind excellent reviews. However, while its production values, technical achievements, and scale of ambition were universally recognized, some reviewers of the time found the film to be too long and dramatically unconvincing. Frank S. Nugent for The New York Times best summed up the general sentiment by acknowledging that while {{it was the most}} ambitious film production made up to that point, it probably was not the greatest film ever made, but he nevertheless found it to be an [...] "interesting story beautifully told". Franz Hoellering of The Nation was of the same opinion: [...] "The result is a film which is a major event {{in the history of the}} industry but only a minor achievement in motion-picture art. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> the two categories meet on good terms, but the long stretches between are filled with mere spectacular efficiency." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews were critical {{of either the}} film, Lazenby, or both, {{while most of the}} contemporary reviews in the British press referred to George Lazenby at some point as [...] "The Big Fry", a reference to his previous acting in [...] Fry's Chocolate [...] advertisements. Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> one yearns for a little of his louche panache." [...] For all the criticism of Lazenby, however, Malcolm says that the film was [...] "quite a jolly frolic in the familiar money-spinning fashion". Tom Milne, writing in The Observer was even more scathing, saying that [...] "I... fervently trust (OHMSS) will be the last of the James Bond films. All the pleasing oddities and eccentricities and gadgets of the earlier films have somehow been lost, leaving a routine trail through which the new James Bond strides without noticeable signs of animation." ...|$|E

500|$|At age 17, {{in a bid}} to {{show people}} he was {{prepared}} for adult roles, he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer's play Equus, which had not been revived since its first run in 1973, at the Gielgud Theatre. Radcliffe took on the lead role as Alan Strang, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped £1.7million, and the role generated significant pre-opening media interest, as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene. Equus opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007. Radcliffe's performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against-type role. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he [...] "displays a dramatic power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward." [...] He added: [...] "I never thought I would find the diminutive (but perfectly formed) Radcliffe a sinister figure, but as Alan Strang ... <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion." [...] The production then transferred to Broadway in September 2008, with Radcliffe still in the lead role. Radcliffe stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London. Radcliffe's performance was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.|$|E
500|$|The Telegraphs Nigel Farndale {{praised the}} film's {{balanced}} {{view of the}} director: [...] "ven though he was portrayed in this exquisite drama as a manipulative, vindictive martinet, the portrait was not unsympathetic." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon echoed this view, praising Jones's Hitchcock and writing that the actor [...] "managed to give [...] touches of humanity, too. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> you feel a real pang of sympathy for Hitchcock, although admittedly they don't last long". [...] "liding gracefully through it all (and with an impeccable American accent) Sienna Miller brings untouchable beauty and icy glamour, but also captures the extraordinary resilience Hedren must have had to withstand everything Hitchcock threw at her." [...] In The Telegraph, Clive James said [...] " [...] better choice [...] {{could not have been}} made than Sienna Miller, who is even lovelier than Hedren was...Toby Jones, quite believably looked stunned". John Doyle of Canada's The Globe and Mail was less impressed with the actors' performances. Of Miller (whom he described as [...] "good but not great") he wrote, [...] "She doesn't have the iciness that Hedren had in her youth and she struggles to convey Hedren's enormous strength of character as a woman unwilling to let Hitchcock have his way". Doyle was equally critical of Jones, describing him as someone who [...] "seems to be imitating Hitchcock rather than inhabiting the role".|$|E
2500|$|This [...] "opaque" [...] {{technique}} has been Godard's trademark style for many years. In 1995 Jean-Michel Frodon described the same complexities as Bordwell and wrote that when viewing a Godard film <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> {{one has the}} tendency to resist the experience. As the film unfolds you are suddenly confused, you don't quite grasp something {{and you feel like}} you are losing your footing. On the point of drowning one is liable to think Godard is vague and obscure but then there is a maritime movement/shift and if one lets oneself be carried by the next wave that comes one soon recovers the drift of the film.|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff {{retired from}} {{international}} football in October 1977, having helped {{the national team}} qualify for the upcoming World Cup. Without him, the Netherlands finished runners-up in the World Cup again. Initially, the reason given for missing the 1978 World Cup were political reasons given a military dictatorship was in power in Argentina at that time. In 2008, Cruyff stated to the journalist Antoni Bassas in Catalunya Ràdio {{that he and his}} family were subject to a kidnap attempt in Barcelona a year before the tournament, and that this had caused his retirement. [...] "To play a World Cup you have to be 200% okay, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> there are other values in life." ...|$|E
2500|$|I have to {{say that}} <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> I wonder — moments when its two senior networks, first set up as a partnership, {{schedule}} simultaneously programmes of identical character, thereby contradicting the very reason that the BBC was given a second network. Then there are times when both BBC One and BBC Two, intoxicated by the sudden popularity of a programme genre, allow that genre to proliferate and run rampant through the schedules. The result is that other kinds of programmes are not placed, simply {{because of a lack of}} space. Do we really require so many gardening programmes, make-over programmes or celebrity chefs? Is it not a scandal in this day and age, that there seems to be no place for continuing series of programmes about science or serious music or thoughtful in-depth interviews with people other than politicians? ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have given}} the game mixed reviews. Billboards Doug Reece commented that [...] "Unfortunately, the detail {{is so great that}} <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> Virtual Springfield can become {{somewhat}} tedious." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com gave the game a three out of five rating, criticizing the lack of a plot but praising the humor. She wrote that Virtual Springfield [...] "isn't so much a game as an interactive tour of Springfield and The Simpsons characters. Though your task is to collect trading cards around town, it doesn't offer any difficulty in finding them. The game controls make it difficult, however, to pick up the cards and collect them. The real fun of Virtual Springfield is browsing the Kwik E Mart, visiting Krustylu Studios or hangin' on Evergreen Terrace with the Simpson family. The entire cast lent their voice to this game, so meeting the characters and hearing their quotes is a lot of laughs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cleanth Brooks {{used the}} Ode: Intimation of Immortality {{as one of}} his key works to analyse in his 1947 work The Well Wrought Urn. His {{analysis}} broke down the ode as a poem disconnected from its biographical implications and focused on the paradoxes and ironies contained within the language. In introducing his analysis, he claimed that it [...] "may be surmised from what has already been remarked, the 'Ode' for all its fine passages, is not entirely successful as a poem. Yet, we shall be able to make our best defense of it in proportion as we recognize and value its use of ambiguous symbol and paradoxical statement. Indeed, it might be maintained that, failing to do this, we shall miss much of its power as poetry and even some of its accuracy of statement." [...] After breaking down the use of paradox and irony in language, he analyses the statements about the childhood perception of glory in Stanza VI and argued, [...] "This stanza, though not one of the celebrated stanzas of the poem, {{is one of the most}} finely ironical. Its structural significance too is of first importance, and has perhaps in the past been given too little weight." [...] After analysing more of the poem, Brooks points out that the lines in Stanza IX contains lines that [...] "are great poetry. They are great poetry because ... the children are not terrified... The children exemplify the attitude toward eternity which the other philosopher, the mature philosopher, wins to with difficulty, if he wins to it at all." [...] In his conclusion about the poem, he argues, [...] "The greatness of the 'Ode' lies in the fact that Wordsworth is about the poet's business here, and is not trying to inculcate anything. Instead, he is trying to dramatize the changing interrelations which determine the major imagery." [...] Following Brooks in 1949, C. M. Bowra stated, [...] "There is no need to dispute the honour in which by common consent it [...] is held" [...] but he adds [...] "There are passages in the 'Immortal Ode' which have less than his usual command of rhythm and ability to make a line stand by itself... But these are unimportant. The whole has a capacious sweep, and the form suits the majestic subject... <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> we suspect Wordsworth of trying to say more than he means. Similarly, George Mallarby also revealed some flaws in the poem in his 1950 analysis: [...] "In spite of the doubtful philosophical truth of the doctrine of pre-existence borrowed from Platon, in spite of the curiously placed emphasis and an exuberance of feeling somewhat artificially introduced, in spite of the frustrating and unsatisfying conclusion, this poem will remain, so long as the English language remains, one of its chief and unquestionable glories. It lends itself, more than most English odes, to recitation in the grand manner." ...|$|E
