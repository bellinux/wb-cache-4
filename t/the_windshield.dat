5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. <b>The</b> <b>windshield</b> could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} with three bench seats, {{one for the}} driver and his assistant, and two others for the crew. The rear cargo area contained storage compartments, {{one on each side}} and two in the rear. <b>The</b> <b>windshield</b> could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted above the rear storage compartments. It fastened to <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> when erected.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} {{common to all}} versions. This had bench seats, one for the driver and his assistant, and another for the crew. The rear portion of the upper body was adapted for the vehicle's intended role. The artillery model had two extra bench seats for the gun's crew and space for its ammunition. The cargo version had just two storage compartments mounted {{in the front of}} the cargo compartment, one on each side, that opened to the outside. <b>The</b> <b>windshield</b> could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> when erected.|$|E

50|$|Some {{legislations}} ban {{the placement}} of articles, devices and other paraphernalia on <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> of vehicles.|$|R
50|$|In 1966 the car got power brakes, {{while in}} 1967 other changes were added: for example <b>the</b> <b>windshield's</b> height was {{enlarged}} by 66 mm.|$|R
5|$|National Airlines' New York-Miami route {{was usually}} flown by a Boeing 707 as Flight 601. On January 5, 1960, the 707 {{aircraft}} scheduled {{to fly to}} Miami was grounded due to cracks that were discovered in the cockpit windshield. <b>The</b> <b>windshield</b> replacement procedure would take eight hours to perform, so National Airlines transferred the passengers of Flight 601 to two propliner aircraft it had in reserve.|$|E
5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed <b>the</b> <b>windshield.</b> She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|In Muncie, Indiana, Nora Pearce and Curtis Delario {{argue about}} the death of her husband, Ray. Nora {{believes}} Ray died from Gulf War syndrome. After attempting to comfort her, Delario starts to drive home and crashes into a man {{in the middle of the}} road. His car is totaled, but the man is unharmed as the car breaks around his body. Curtis, grievously injured, looks up at the man and says, “Ray?” The man’s arm slams through <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> as Curtis screams.|$|E

50|$|The {{first order}} of SD70M-2 {{locomotives}} had their headlights mounted on the cab, while the second order (8800 series) dropped the headlight to the nose, and also features added red marker lights mounted above <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> on <b>the</b> cab.|$|R
50|$|The 117 series trains have 20 meter long {{corrosion-resistant}} steel {{bodies with}} {{two sets of}} semi-automatic sliding double doors per side (Nagoya-area cars have fully automatic doors). The 117 features a built-in classification headboard directly below <b>the</b> <b>windshield's</b> center post.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as <b>the</b> <b>windshield.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the design}} was further {{modified}} to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red searchlight for the Spanner Anlage infrared detection system. The infrared lamp {{in the nose}} was used to illuminate the target while the display unit in <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> made the reflection visible to the target. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner infrared detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E
5|$|Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra chose several {{camera angles}} to {{simulate}} {{the look of a}} comic book panel. Various visual narrative motifs were also applied. Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass. As a newborn, he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors, and as a young child, he is seen reflected in a blank TV screen. When he leaves his calling card on <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> of David Dunn's car, he is reflected in a glass frame in his art gallery. Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing. Using purple as Mr. Glass' color to David Dunn's green was also Jackson's idea. Mr. Glass' wig was modeled after Afro-American statesman Frederick Douglass. As he does in his other films, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance. He plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium.|$|E
5000|$|BTR-60PPM - BTR-60PB {{converted}} into a civilian armoured firefighting vehicle. The turret and center hand rails were removed, as were the steel covers for <b>the</b> <b>windshields.</b> <b>The</b> firing ports were all blocked, as were the periscopes. Three windows were added {{on each side of}} the hull. It was fitted with a crate on top of the hull. It also carries an A-crane on the right side of the hull.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 February 2016, Rayani Air flight RN180 {{scheduled}} for Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 was cancelled {{due to a}} broken cockpit <b>windshield.</b> <b>The</b> next day, the airline issued a press statement apologising for the flight cancellation, and attributed <b>the</b> shattered <b>windshield</b> to a night flight previously. Rayani Air said they were investigating to see if <b>the</b> broken <b>windshield</b> {{was an act of}} sabotage, and would liaise with relevant authorities to deal with this.|$|R
50|$|The Fords {{introduced}} for 1955 {{also featured}} <b>the</b> panoramic <b>windshields</b> found on Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs the previous year.With this panoramic <b>windshield</b> <b>the</b> A-pillars have a vertical angle.this gives the driver more panoramic visibility.|$|R
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944 the Luftwaffe {{initiated}} Operation Steinbock. Cunningham filed two claims {{during the}} offensive which lasted until May 1944. On {{the night of}} the 20/21 February 1944 he claimed Junkers Ju 188 damaged at 22:09 near Staplehurst. One Ju 188 was lost and its destruction was attributed to another pilot. On {{the night of the}} 23/24 February he claimed a probable victory against another Ju 188 off Beachy Head. One Ju 188E-1 landed at Coulommiers after surviving an attack by a night fighter. Werknummer 260222, code U5+AN from 5./KG 2 returned with two crewmen injured—Unteroffizier Johann Triebel and Wihelm Spönemann. During these missions Cunningham was nearly shot down. Closing in on a Ju 188 from astern, the gunners suddenly opened fire and the Junkers took evasive manoeuvres. A single round struck <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> nearly shattering it. Glass fragments struck Cunningham in the face which were later removed in a field hospital. Later, a captured German crew told intelligence officers a new radar was being used in the rear of German aircraft to detect night fighters. Bombers were now more difficult to surprise. Cunningham's last encounter with the enemy in 1944 was in pursuit of an Me 410. He had to give up when his windshield iced over near the French coast.|$|E
5|$|On McGovern's December 15 mission over Linz, {{his second}} as pilot, {{a piece of}} {{shrapnel}} from flak came through <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> and missed fatally wounding him by only a few inches. The following day {{on a mission to}} Brüx, he nearly collided with another bomber during close-formation flying in complete cloud cover. The following day, he was recommended for a medal after surviving a blown wheel on the always-dangerous B-24 take-off, completing a mission over Germany, and then landing without further damage to the plane. On a December 20 mission against the Škoda Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, McGovern's plane had one engine out and another in flames after being hit by flak. Unable to return to Italy, McGovern flew to a British airfield on Vis, a small island in the Adriatic Sea off the Yugoslav coast that was controlled by Josip Broz Tito's Partisans. The short field, normally used by small fighter planes, was so unforgiving to four-engined aircraft that many of the bomber crews who tried to make emergency landings there perished. But McGovern successfully landed, saving his crew, a feat for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
50|$|The {{second major}} {{explosion}} nearly destroyed the chief's car; {{after he and}} his passenger were cut by flying glass, {{he was able to}} drive the damaged vehicle to a hospital. <b>The</b> <b>windshields</b> of a responding Henderson Fire Department vehicle were blown in, injuring the driver and firefighters with shattered glass.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{popular culture}} items feature the flag's design. Car bumper {{stickers}} decorated with the flag are seen on <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> {{of cars and}} many other designs also feature the flag. Shorts, shirts, keychains, and many other items are sold in Maryland and worn by people living in or from the state.|$|R
50|$|In 1917, the Tri-Continental Corporation {{was founded}} by John R. Oishei and {{introduced}} one of <b>the</b> first <b>windshield</b> wipers, known as Rain Rubber, for <b>the</b> slotted, two-piece <b>windshields</b> found {{on many of the}} automobiles of the time.|$|R
25|$|To {{minimize}} {{production costs}} for export, <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> wipers used a pattern where the wipers {{started in the}} center and wiped towards the edge of <b>the</b> <b>windshield,</b> instead of from the passenger side towards the driver.|$|E
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is to equip the vehicle with a single wiper placed in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>windshield,</b> allowing it to cover both sides of <b>the</b> <b>windshield.</b> This mitigates the amount of drag by decreasing the frontal area of the blade. While such application may be useful for racing, for most road vehicles this would produce minimal improvement in overall drag reduction.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} wipers {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> wiper on the passenger side of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air up and over the wipers.|$|E

50|$|Golf courses near {{residential}} communities {{will often}} have fences exceeding 20 {{feet in height}} {{in order to prevent}} struck balls from flying out of the course and into <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> of cars and windows of houses near the course. Such fences are not only not spite fences, but may actually be required.|$|R
5000|$|He {{first started}} by writing a modest tract titled [...] "Catholic Answers" [...] {{to counter the}} {{arguments}} {{he saw in the}} anti-Catholic tract. He distributed it on <b>the</b> <b>windshields</b> of <b>the</b> cars in the fundamentalist Protestant church's parking lot. Due to the feedback he received from that tract, he published 24 more tracts.|$|R
25|$|An {{attendant}} (gas jockey) {{operates the}} pumps, often wipes <b>the</b> <b>windshield,</b> and sometimes checks the vehicle's oil level and tire pressure, then collects payment (and perhaps a small tip).|$|E
25|$|That {{may seem}} {{easy to do}} when one looks through an always-clean, {{rear-view}} mirror. Unfortunately, however, it's <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged.|$|E
25|$|The cockpit {{windshield}} of {{the first}} 247s was angled forward, instead of the conventional aft sweep. This was the design solution (similar to that adopted by other contemporary aircraft that used a forward-raked windscreen) {{to the problem of}} lighted control panel instruments reflecting off <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> at night, but {{it turned out that the}} forward-sloping windshield would reflect ground lights instead, especially during landings and it also increased drag slightly. By the introduction of the 247D, <b>the</b> <b>windshield</b> was sloped aft in the usual way, and the night-glare problem was resolved by installing an extension (the glarescreen) over the control panel.|$|E
