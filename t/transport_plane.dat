5|$|Despite the {{tensions}} of the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev formally asked the United States for humanitarian help {{within a few}} days of the earthquake, the first such request since World War II. One hundred and thirteen countries sent substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union in the form of rescue equipment, search teams and medical supplies, but private donations and assistance from non-governmental organizations also had {{a large part of the}} international effort. While transporting some of these supplies to the region, a Soviet aircraft carrying 9 crew members and 69 military personnel and a <b>transport</b> <b>plane</b> from Yugoslavia were both destroyed in separate incidents. In support of the relief effort, recording artists united to produce several music-related contributions for the victims of the quake. A song was produced by a duo of French composers (including Charles Aznavour) and a studio album that featured songs donated by mainstream rock bands was released from the Rock Aid Armenia effort by the British music industry.|$|E
5|$|On 20 April 1945—Adolf Hitler's 56th birthday—Soviet {{troops were}} on the verge of taking Berlin and the Western Allies had already taken several German cities. Hitler's private secretary, Martin Bormann, put into action Operation Seraglio, a plan to {{evacuate}} the key and favoured members of Hitler's entourage from the Berlin bunker where they were based, the Führerbunker, to an Alpine command centre near Berchtesgaden—Hitler's retreat in southern Germany. Ten aeroplanes flew out from Gatow airfield under the overall command of General Hans Baur, Hitler's personal pilot. The final flight out was a Junkers Ju 352 <b>transport</b> <b>plane,</b> piloted by Major Friedrich Gundlfinger—on board were ten heavy chests under the supervision of Hitler's personal valet Sergeant Wilhelm Arndt. The plane crashed into the Heidenholz Forest, near the Czechoslovak border.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian {{pursued the}} He111 over the Saltdal valley and, with three attacks from astern, set the bomber ablaze, forcing it to crash. Hull then downed a Junkers Ju52 <b>transport</b> <b>plane</b> and, after unsuccessfully chasing another He111, {{destroyed}} two more Ju52s. The transports {{had been coming}} {{to the aid of}} the hard-pressed German forces fighting around Narvik; one was loaded with supplies, while the other two were carrying Fallschirmjäger paratroops. One of the latter aircraft successfully landed in German-held territory before burning out, allowing the crew and paratroopers aboard to exit safely, but the second spiralled out of control and crashed, killing eight German paratroopers. Hull then attacked another He111, which soon retreated, giving off smoke. Having used up all his ammunition, Hull returned to Bodø. In the space of about an hour, in a technologically-outdated aircraft and without assistance, he had destroyed four German planes and damaged a fifth.|$|E

5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} public {{emergency}} was declared {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella. This was because there was only a limited amount of food available on Funafuti to cater for the whole of the island nation, while providing Niulakita with immediate relief supplies. This enabled the Tuvaluan embassy in Suva, Fiji to appeal to various overseas countries and organisations including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Development Programme to provide aid and assistance to the island nation. During June 14, the Royal New Zealand Air Force deployed a <b>transport</b> <b>plane</b> carrying some relief materials including tarpaulins and water from New Zealand. The plane subsequently stopped in Noumea, New Caledonia and Nadi, Fiji to pick up further relief supplies that had been donated by Australia, Fiji and France. The crew of the plane subsequently conducted an aerial assessment of the damage on Niulakita, and reported seeing widespread damage, before they arrived at Funafuti Airport during June 15.|$|E

25|$|From Tatsinskaya, a Ju 52 plane {{would take}} approx. 1¼ hour to reach Stalingrad, {{from where it}} would return after a 3½ hour turnaround, {{theoretically}} {{making it possible to}} complete a mission in six hours. Tatsinskaya served as the main base for the Ju 52 <b>transport</b> <b>planes,</b> while Morozovskaya was mainly used by the He 111 bombers, which were converted to <b>transport</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{operation}} of which Levett {{had been part}} succeeded in supplying arms to the Israelis, but it was controversial and hazardous: The airlift violated a United Nations embargo on arms shipments to the Middle Eastern combatants.

On June 24, while in San Diego, California, the results of the tests were reported to Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis and he approved the flight to Hawaii. The next day they flew to Crissy Field, at the Presidio in San Francisco, California.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force {{considered}} Boeing's {{design to}} be better than that of Lockheed, but Lockheed's proposal was the lowest total cost bid. Lockheed was selected the winner in September 1965, then awarded a contract in December 1965. General Electric's TF39 engine was selected in August 1965 to power the new <b>transport</b> <b>plane.</b> At the time GE's engine concept was revolutionary, as all engines beforehand had a bypass ratio of less than two-to-one, while the TF39 promised and would achieve a ratio of eight-to-one, which had the benefits of increased engine thrust and lower fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli Air Force sent a C-130 Hercules <b>transport</b> <b>plane</b> to Sarafovo Airport, {{where it}} picked up 32 {{of the wounded}} and took them to Israel for treatment. A second Israeli C-130 landed in Sofia, {{carrying}} Magen David Adom specialists to evaluate the remaining wounded, and to judge whether {{it was safe to}} fly them home. The mission included military medical personnel, members of Unit 669, Home Front Command officers, along with a cadre of IDF officers. ZAKA personnel were also sent to Bulgaria to properly identify the bodies. At Ben-Gurion International Airport, 24 ambulances and medical were deployed to ensure that the injured could be swiftly transferred to local hospitals upon arrival.|$|E

25|$|During {{one of the}} National Air Tours, Schneider {{had taken}} off in his Cessna with the Warner Scarab engine, from Chicago bound for the balloon races in Cleveland. He saw the crowd scatter below, {{looked up and saw}} the 40-foot left wing of a twenty {{passenger}} Burnelli <b>transport</b> <b>plane</b> directly over him. Passengers in the Burnelli scrambled {{to the other side of}} the cabin to tilt the wing back up. Schneider sent his plane diving just as the Burnelli's wing scraped his plane's wing. A crash was averted by his dip. The officials said his quick action in dipping his plane close to the ground and then pulling clear of the grandstand had probably averted the most serious accident in the races.|$|E
25|$|A rocket parachute, the PRSM-915, was {{developed}} to ensure the vehicle's safe landing. To use the parachute, the BMD is first packed onto a special pallet before takeoff. To drop the BMD, a drogue chute is released that initially drags the BMD out of the Il-76 <b>transport</b> <b>plane.</b> Once clear of the plane a single large main chute opens. The deployment of the main chute triggers the deployment of four long rods which hang beneath the pallet. As soon as the rods touch the ground a retrorocket fires, slowing the BMD to a descending speed between 6m/s and 7m/s and giving it a relatively soft landing. It allowed a BMD to be relatively safely parachuted with both the driver and the gunner. This system entered service in 1975 for the BMD-1, and was always used for the BMD-2 afterwards.|$|E
25|$|On 25 February 1960 19 {{members of}} the Navy Band were flying from Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro to join {{the rest of the}} band at a {{reception}} for President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek. As the Navy <b>transport</b> <b>plane</b> approached Rio de Janeiro in a dense fog, it collided in midair with a Brazilian airliner above the city's harbor, not far from the landmark Sugarloaf Mountain. Among the 61 people killed were 19 {{members of the}} Navy Band, including the assistant leader, J. Harold Fultz, and most of the string section. Three U.S. sailors playing cards {{at the back of the}} airplane were the only survivors. The crash was the single worst event in the band's history, and devastated the remaining members of the band. Despite their losses the surviving musicians completed their South American tour.|$|E
