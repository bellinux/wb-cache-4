The primary physical mechanism behind <b>transistor</b> <b>aging</b> is Bias Temperature Instability (BTI).

If clock skew becomes too high, it can result in timing errors in synchronous designs.

40|$|Abstract—As {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor technologies enter nanometer scales, microprocessors {{become more}} vulnerable to <b>transistor</b> <b>aging,</b> mainly due to bias temperature instability and hot carrier injection. These phenomena lead to increasing device delays during the operational lifetime, which result in growing delays of the instruction pipeline stages. However, the aging rates of different stages are different. Hence, a previously delay-balanced pipeline becomes increasingly imbalanced resulting in a non-optimized design in terms of lifetime [i. e., {{mean time to failure}} (MTTF) ], frequency, area, and power consumption. In this paper, we propose an aging-aware, MTTF-balanced pipeline design, in which the pipeline stage delays are balanced at the desired lifetime rather than at design time. This can lead to significant MTTF (lifetime) improvements as well as additional performance, area, and power benefits. Our experimental results show that for two different microprocessors, MTTF can be extended by at least 2. 3 times while achieving an additional 10 % energy improvement with no penalty on delay and area. If the demand for performance is higher than that for a longer MTTF, it is also possible to improve the clock frequency by 2 %.

Hence, designers have to add significanttime margin as guardband to the main critical path, which imposes considerableperformance degradation to the system.

This thesis covers challenges and opportunities in monitoring aging, its effectsand methods to combat the imposed performance and lifetime degradation in nanometerscales semiconductor platforms. We devise methods to monitor and mitigate aging in computing platforms ranging fromthe conventional reconfigurable architectures to the contemporary 3 D network-on-chips andmany-core systems. To monitor aging-induced delay degradation on critical paths, we proposedSENSIBLE, a highly scalable aging sensor design that can help system-level designersto detect aging and react accordingly. Additionally, we proposed an application-dependantfiltering methodology to select Representative Critical Paths (RCPs) among a large pool ofcritical paths for aging monitoring in reconfigurable architectures. Furthermore, two proactivemethods are presented to mitigate aging impacts on application’s critical paths and SRAM cells in reconfigurable architectures.

40|$|Abstract — As {{dimensions}} of MOS devices have been scaled down, new reliability problems {{are coming into}} effect. One of these emerging reliability issues is aging effects which result in device performance degradation over time. NBTI (Negative biased temperature instability) is a well known aging phenomenon which is a limiting factor for future scaling of devices. NBTI results in the generation of trapped charges which cause Vt (threshold voltage) degradation of PMOS. It is observed that a sharp Vt shift occurs {{in just a few}} seconds after turning on the MOSFET. In nano-scale CMOS technologies, process (threshold voltage) and temperature variations are also crucial reliability concerns. On the other hand, NBTI itself is dependent on temperature and threshold voltage. In this paper, the combined effect of NBTI, process and temperature variations on the reliability of the 6 T SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) in 32 nm CMOS technology is analyzed. It is observed that: (1) Vt abruptly increases initially and afterwards Vt shift is very small, even for prolonged time; (2) Low Vt <b>transistors</b> <b>age</b> faster than high Vt transistors; and (3) NBTI Vt degradation is more significant at higher temperature. Along with these observations, we also quantified our results in terms of number of faulty cells in SRAM array. It is observed that: (1) number of faulty cells rises over time (8. 2 % rise in faulty cells for the inter-die nominal Vt chip over 2 years) due to SNM degradation; (2) {{rise in the number of}} faulty cells over time due to write failures under NBTI effect is practically negligible; (3) Leakage (in the worst case condition) and access time are not impacted by NBTI.

40|$|Advances in {{semiconductor}} technology using smaller sizes of transistors {{in order to}} fit more {{of them in the}} same area and increase performance, pose a threat for the reliability of integrated circuits. Technology scaling accelerates <b>transistor</b> <b>ageing</b> and degradation, causing more faults during the lifetime of an integrated circuit. Sources of faults such as manufacturing defects, degradation and <b>ageing</b> of <b>transistors</b> degrade the performance of integrated circuits leading to faults with a permanent effect that might be catastrophic for certain applications. A special case of integrated circuits, FPGAs, suffer from radiation-induced faults since they contain million of bits for the configuration of their resources that if flipped due to radiation might change the intended functionality of the application running on the FPGA, causing a failure. However, FPGAs can be dynamically reconfigured in the field and mitigate radiation effects providing fault-tolerance and high availability. A novel fault-tolerant architecture for an artificial pancreas application is proposed that consists of a mixed substrate of ASIC and FPGA. Fault detection is provided through modular redundancy, and dynamic reconfiguration is used as a repair mechanism. Experimental results show that 5, 100 x lower probability of failures per hour (PFH) than a DMR for permanent faults can be achieved with 2. 4 x more area than DMR. In addition, the proposed solution achieves 83 x lower PFH than a TMR with 1. 6 x area overheads when considering transient faults.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{socio-economic}} {{history of the}} relationship between music technology and organisational practices in twentieth-century Australia. It argues that the history of technology in the Australian music economy is dependent not only upon the changing technical characteristics of musical instruments and electronic consumer goods but also upon government policy-making, management practices in music technology manufacturing firms and patterns of music technology consumption. The thesis examines economic statistics regarding the import, export and local production of music technology in Australia. The economic statistics have not previously been examined in relation to the history of music technology in Australia. The historical analysis is structured according to a four-part periodisation which includes the Electric Age (1901 - 1930), the Electronic Age (1930 - 1950), the <b>Transistor</b> <b>Age</b> (1950 - 1970) and the Information Age (1970 - 1990). This periodisation enables the analysis to continually be refocussed as the key technological and socio-economic dynamics change. With this perspective, the history {{of the relationship between}} technology and organisation in the Australian music economy has been demonstrated to be dependent on a number of key technological changes. The thesis examines changes including the shift from acoustic to electric recording; the development of transistor-based consumer electronics goods; and the advent of digital information technology. However, a number of key social determinants, particularly organisational modes, are examined including changes from protectionist to more deregulated trade policy; lack of business skills in areas such as marketing, manufacturing technique and industrial research and development; {{and the development of a}} sense of popular modernity which is expressed in the consumption of new, technically advanced and glamorous music technology. In addition to the new perspectives on the history of music technology provided by the analysis of empirical economic data, this thesis contributes to the historiography of technology. The analytical framework it proposes locates music technology within what is described as an assemblage of technologies: technologies of production, technologies of sign systems, technologies of power and technologies of the self. This approach makes clear the interdependence of technological and social factors, and the inadequacy of narrow technological determinist and social constructivist accounts. The notion of an assemblage of technologies is further embellished by drawing upon key elements of recent theories of systems analysis: the seamless web, evolution and chaos theory. Through this analytical framework and the socio-economic analysis of the relationship between music technology and organisational practices, the thesis demonstrates that the history of technology cannot be understood unless it is seen as part of a complex and interacting technical, social, economic and institutional system...|$|R

40|$|VLSI {{circuits}} in nanometer VLSI technology experience significant variations - intrinsic process variations {{and variations}} {{brought about by}} <b>transistor</b> degradation or <b>aging.</b> These are generally embodied by yield loss or performance degradation over operation time. Although the degradation can be compensated by the worst-case scenario based over-design approach, it induces remarkable power overhead which is undesirable in tightly power-constrained designs. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is a more powerefficient approach. However, its coarse granularity implies difficulty in handling finegrained variations. These factors {{have contributed to the}} growing interest in poweraware robust circuit design. In this thesis, we propose a Built-In Proactive Tuning (BIPT) system, a lowpower typical case design methodology based on dynamic prediction and prevention of possible circuit timing errors. BIPT makes use of the canary circuit to predict the variation induced performance degradation. The approach presented allows each circuit block to autonomously tune its performance according to its own degree of variation. The tuning is conducted offline, either at power on or periodically. A test pattern generator is included to reduce the uncertainty of the aging prediction due to different input vectors. The BIPT system is validated through SPICE simulations on benchmark circuits with consideration of process variations and NBTI, a static stress based PMOS aging effect. The experimental results indicate that to achieve the same variation resilience, proposed BIPT system leads to 33 % power savings in case of process variations as compared to the over-design approach. In the case of aging resilience, the approach proposed in this thesis leads to 40 % less power than the approach of over-design while 30 % less power as compared to DVS with NBTI effect modeling...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of electronic}} circuits {{is influenced by}} ageing effects. Modelling the behaviour of circuits is a standard approach {{for the design of}} faster, smaller, more reliable and more robust systems. In this thesis, we propose a formalization of robustness that is derived from a failure model, which is based purely on the behavioural specification of a system. For a given specification, simulation can reveal if a system does not comply with a specification, and thus provide a failure model. Ageing usually works against the specified properties, and ageing models can be incorporated to quantify the impact on specification violations, failures and robustness. We study ageing effects in the context of analogue circuits. Here, models must factor in infinitely many circuit states. Ageing effects have a cause and an impact that require models. On both these ends, the circuit state is highly relevant, an must be factored in. For example, static empirical models for ageing effects are not valid in many cases, because the assumed operating states do not agree with the circuit simulation results. This thesis identifies essential properties of ageing effects and we argue {{that they need to be}} taken into account for modelling the interrelation of cause and impact. These properties include frequency dependence, monotonicity, memory and relaxation mechanisms as well as control by arbitrary shaped stress levels. Starting from decay processes, we define a class of ageing models that fits these requirements well while remaining arithmetically accessible by means of a simple structure. Modeling ageing effects in semiconductor circuits becomes more relevant with higher integration and smaller structure sizes. With respect to miniaturization, digital systems are ahead of analogue systems, and similarly ageing models predominantly focus on digital applications. In the digital domain, the signal levels are either on or off or switching in between. Given an ageing model as a physical effect bound to signal levels, ageing models for components and whole systems can be inferred by means of average operation modes and cycle counts. Functional and faithful ageing effect models for analogue components often require a more fine-grained characterization for physical processes. Here, signal levels can take arbitrary values, to begin with. Such fine-grained, physically inspired ageing models do not scale for larger applications and are hard to simulate in reasonable time. To close the gap between physical processes and system level ageing simulation, we propose a data based modelling strategy, according to which measurement data is turned into ageing models for analogue applications. Ageing data is a set of pairs of stress patterns and the corresponding parameter deviations. Assuming additional properties, such as monotonicity or frequency independence, learning algorithm can find a complete model that is consistent with the data set. These ageing effect models decompose into a controlling stress level, an ageing process, and a parameter that depends on the state of this process. Using this representation, we are able to embed a wide range of ageing effects into behavioural models for circuit components. Based on the developed modelling techniques, we introduce a novel model for the BTI effect, an ageing effect that permits relaxation. In the following, a <b>transistor</b> level <b>ageing</b> model for BTI that targets analogue circuits is proposed. Similarly, we demonstrate how ageing data from analogue transistor level circuit models lift to purely behavioural block models. With this, we are the first to present a data based hierarchical ageing modeling scheme. An ageing simulator for circuits or system level models computes long term transients, solutions of a differential equation. Long term transients are often close to quasi-periodic, in some sense repetitive. If the evaluation of ageing models under quasi-periodic conditions can be done efficiently, long term simulation becomes practical. We describe an adaptive two-time simulation algorithm that basically skips periods during simulation, advancing faster on a second time axis. The bottleneck of two-time simulation is the extrapolation through skipped frames. This involves both the evaluation of the ageing models and the consistency of the boundary conditions. We propose a simulator that computes long term transients exploiting the structure of the proposed ageing models. These models permit extrapolation of the ageing state by means of a locally equivalent stress, a sort of average stress level. This level can be computed efficiently and also gives rise to a dynamic step control mechanism. Ageing simulation has a wide range of applications. This thesis vastly improves the applicability of ageing simulation for analogue circuits in terms of modelling and efficiency. An ageing effect model that is a part of a circuit component model accounts for parametric drift that is directly related to the operation mode. For example asymmetric load on a comparator or power-stage may lead to offset drift, which is not an empiric effect. Monitor circuits can report such effects during operation, when they become significant. Simulating the behaviour of these monitors is important during their development. Ageing effects can be compensated using redundant parts, and annealing can revert broken components to functional. We show that such mechanisms can be simulated in place using our models and algorithms. The aim of automatized circuit synthesis is to create a circuit that implements a specification for a certain use case. Ageing simulation can identify candidates that are more reliable. Efficient ageing simulation allows to factor in various operation modes and helps refining the selection. Using long term ageing simulation, we have analysed the fitness of a set of synthesized operational amplifiers with similar properties concerning various use cases. This procedure enables the selection of the most ageing resilient implementation automatically. Viele alltägliche Geräte in Haushalt, Verkehr, zur Kommunikation oder Medizintechnik werden seit Mitte des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts von elektronischen Schaltungen beherrscht. Solche Schaltungen messen, steuern und regeln wichtige Eigenschaften, Funktionen und Prozesse und ermöglichen immer weiter ausgefeilte Anwendungen, höhere Effizienz und neue Einsatzmöglichkeiten. Grundsätzlich besteht ein Interesse an der einwandfreien Funktionalität solcher Geräte. Mit elektronischen Halbleiterschaltungen werden zunehmend kleinere Bauteile in diese Geräte verbaut. Einerseits führt dies zu einer wachsenden Systemkomplexität bei mitunter gleichbleibenden Abmessungen, andererseits werden im Zuge der Miniaturisierung physikalische Grenzen erreicht und bisweilen überwunden. Die Einzelteile eines Systems sind nach Fertigung nicht zugänglich und können nicht ausgetauscht werden. Als Konsequenz erwartet man einen Ausfall, sobald ein Einzelteil nicht mehr funktioniert. Um solchen Ausfällen vorzubeugen, möchte man gerne vor der Serienproduktion in Erfahrung bringen, wie sie zustande kommen. Hierzu bedarf es geeigneten Modellen und Analysemethoden. Die Entwicklung solcher im Falle von Analogschaltungen ist der Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit [...] ...|$|R
40|$|With {{technology}} scaling towards nanometer scale, the <b>transistor</b> <b>aging</b> and breakdown {{effects are}} becoming more prominent. Such effects result in system failure, if not addressed properly at the circuit and architecture level. Reconfigurable parallel architectures are inherently tolerant to failures due to deployment of redundancy and reconfigurability. The research goal here is to physically implement a parallel reconfigurable ALU in 90 nm CMOS technology following the Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design methodology. In such architecture, the redundant units can be shut down or put in low power mode. The conventional Verilog HDL does not support such low power techniques to be specified at RTL level. The new emerging Unified Power Format (UPF) allows specification of low power techniques at RTL. We will use UPF to specify power gating design technique at RTL and then take the design through ASIC design flow from RTL to GDS layout. We will also obtain power, performance, and area results for validation purpose and for demonstrating the benefits of such architecture...|$|E
