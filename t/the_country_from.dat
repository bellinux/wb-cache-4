5|$|According to the Bills of Mortality, {{there were}} in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665.

5|$|As {{with many}} post-Soviet states, {{the change in}} writing system and the debates {{surrounding}} it is closely intertwined with political themes. Although not having been used since the adoption of Cyrillic, the Latin script is supported by {{those who wish to}} bring the country closer to Uzbekistan, which has adopted the Latin-based Uzbek alphabet. The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those who wish to maintain the status quo, and not distance <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>from</b> Russia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, {{development}} of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>from</b> an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales, mainly in and around Cardiff (the capital), Swansea and Newport, and in the nearby valleys. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, Wales' economy depends on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism. Wales' 2010 gross value added (GVA) was £45.5 billion (£15,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain).|$|E

5|$|Australians {{participated in}} the defence of Britain {{throughout}} the war. More than 100Australian airmen fought with the RAF during the Battle of Britain in 1940, including over 30fighter pilots. Two AIF brigades (the 18th and 25th) were also stationed in Britain from June 1940 to January 1941 and formed part of the British mobile reserve which would have responded to any German landings. An Australian Army forestry group served in Britain between 1940 and 1943. Several Australian fighter squadrons were also formed in Britain during 1941 and 1942 and contributed to defending <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>from</b> German air raids and, from mid-1944, V-1 flying bombs.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the Jewish Resistance Movement was formed, {{comprising}} several pre-existing Jewish groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most Jewish males and some females were required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members. The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants into <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>from</b> Europe. It always attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Shostakovich {{acquired}} {{a book of}} Jewish folk songs, and from this he composed the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry. He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union. However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 {{under the pressure of}} the anti-Semitism that gripped <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>From</b> Jewish Folk Poetry could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, along with all the other works that were forbidden.|$|E

5|$|In September 1945, Hồ {{declared}} independence {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) following {{the withdrawal of}} Imperial Japan, which had seized control of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>from</b> France during the Second World War. At the time, there was a power vacuum, as both Japan and France had been decimated by the war. There was an outbreak of nationalist fervour in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned {{to be the leader}} of the local unit, but he left the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{stationed}} at Maadi, the regiment {{was moved to}} Garawla in July and participated in the defence of the Baggush Box two months later. In January 1941, it moved to Helwan for training. In March, the regiment became part of W Force, the British contingent sent to Greece to defend <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>from</b> Nazi Germany. It took up positions on the Aliakmon Line before the regiment was scattered during the British retreat from the country. Most of the regiment ended up in Crete, where it faced a German paratroop attack in May and evacuated with {{the remainder of the}} British force.|$|E
5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw {{the creation of a new}} constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>from</b> voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E

The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>from</b> the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road {{on that side of the}} ground.

5|$|Moldova's {{constitution}} forbids <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>from</b> {{joining a}} military alliance, but some politicians, such as Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO {{as part of}} a larger European integration.

Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway Moldovan region. This separatist issue could preclude Moldova from joining NATO.|$|E
