40|$|Radiometric {{correction}} is {{the essential}} prerequisite to obtain precise and valuable segmentation of remote sensing images, especially when dealing with mountainous regions where the terrain {{is more likely to}} be rough. Important applications such as snow cover segmentation have usually to be performed on images of very rough mountainous terrain where this preprocessing step turns out to be especially demanding. The knowledge of the topography of the imaged area through a digital elevation model (DEM) and of the backscatter function for the different terrain cover types are the basis for radiometric correction. Considering SAR images, the huge amount of processing for geographic and geometric calibration and registration that is needed prior to analysis is well established. Nonetheless, even assuming that these calibration and registration steps can been carried out with high precision algorithms, they are still prone to inaccuracies due to the quality of the <b>terrain</b> geometrical <b>description.</b> In the following is presented a model-based method that, exploiting the information contained both in the DEM and in the image, provides improved estimates, in a Bayesian framework, of the terrain itself and of the radiometric characteristics of the land cover...|$|R
40|$|Maps, recent {{cultural}} geographers {{are fond of}} reminding us, {{are products}} of the specific ideology from which they are written. A proper reading of a map, one that attends {{to it as a}} cultural product, can discover – even deconstruct – the ideological and cultural assumptions upon which its act of mapping is grounded. For Stephen Daniels and Denis Cosgrove, the metaphor of the map provides a crucially important analytic tool for disentangling the ways in which systems of power may be seen to work within – and through – a text. They note that, under the influence of post-structuralist theory, it has become commonplace to think of a text as a “discursive ‘terrain’ across which ‘sites’ of power may be ‘mapped’. ” Clearly, then, cartographic metaphors are useful in discussing literary texts in that they can accommodate an examination of both the overt and covert operations of those texts in their representations of the cultural and ideological landscape from which they are produced. Indeed, to map the world is to make that world readable, to make it familiar; but, like any text – or, in the particular case of this essay, Gary Snyder's poetic sequence Mountains and Rivers Without End (1996) – a map does more than simply describe a discursive <b>terrain.</b> Such <b>descriptions</b> also enact the conditions of their cultural production...|$|R

In addition, our results are meant to build upon themselves, such that they ought to look compelling at any point along the transition from village to metropolis. Our approach largely focuses upon land usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments, whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating road networks.

The artist has painted ―honey ‖ near the bay {{to create an}} unusually dense commercial zone, and left parcel boundaries quite loose. Note the neighborhoods with differing road layouts. Cities are widely used as content in digital productions, and their complexity makes them very difficult for artists to model. The few tools that help artists in this work do not model land use, meaning artists must arrange the buildings in the cities they create manually.

40|$|Millimeter-wave Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has smaller size, lower weight, {{and higher}} {{resolution}} {{compared with other}} bands. Thus, {{it has become a}} hot research topic. However, owing to its shorter wavelength, millimeter-wave InSAR data processing requires high-precision measurements of platform motion. For nonideal trajectories, traditional methods face difficulties in echo imaging and interferogram extraction. In addition, existing methods mainly produce SAR images based on plane projection. When the terrain changes abruptly, these methods may cause strong interferometric phase unwrapping and geometric distortion in SAR images. To overcome the abovementioned disadvantages of conventional methods in millimeter-wave InSAR imaging, an approach based on terrain surface projection is proposed. The echoes of different antennas are projected on the same terrain surface space for data imaging and interferogram extraction. In addition, the relation between terrain elevation and interferometric phase is derived. Simulations and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method; furthermore, the proposed approach improves the precision of interferometric phase extraction in complex motion conditions, while minimizing geometric distortion and phase wrapping in rough terrain, which is more conducive to <b>terrain</b> <b>description</b> and elevation inversion...|$|E

In this method, samples are "randomly" generated using physically-based particle systems. Introduction In computer graphics, an object is described either by a set of sample points or by an analytic scheme that uses mathematical equations to define its geometry and topology. Descriptions based on samples occur in areas such as medical images and <b>terrain</b> models. Analytical <b>descriptions</b> are usually found in applications of geometric modeling, such computeraided design and manufacture. When an object is described by samples, a reconstruction scheme is needed to recover its geometry and topology from the samples.

40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are sparse mobile ad-hoc {{networks}} {{in which there}} is typically no complete path between the source and destination. Content retrieval is an important service in DTNs. It allows peer-to-peer data sharing and access among mobile users in areas that lack a fixed communication infrastructure such as rural areas, inter-vehicle communication, and military environments. There are many applications for content retrieval in DTNs. For example, mobile users can find interesting digital content such as music and images from other network peers for entertainment purposes. Vehicles can access live traffic information to avoid traffic delay. Soldiers with wireless devices can retrieve relevant information such as <b>terrain</b> <b>descriptions,</b> weather, and intelligence information from other nodes in a battlefield. In this dissertation, we propose the design of a secure and scalable architecture for content retrieval in DTNs. Our design consists of five key components: (1) a distributed content discovery service, (2) a routing protocol for message delivery, (3) a buffer management policy to schedule and drop messages in resource-constrained environments, (4) a caching framework to enhance the performance of data access, and (5) a mechanism to detect malicious and selfish behaviors in the network. To cope with the unstable network topology due to the highly volatile movement of nodes in DTNs, we exploit the underlying stable social relationships among nodes for message routing, caching, and placement of the content-lookup service. Specifically, we rely on three key social concepts: social tie, centrality, and social level. Centrality is used to form the distributed content discovery service and the caching framework. Social level guides the forwarding of content requests to a content discovery service node. Once the content provider ID is discovered, social tie is exploited to deliver content requests to the content provider, and content data to the requester node. Furthermore, to reduce the transmission cost, we investigate and propose routing strategies for three dominant communication models in DTNs: unicast (a content is sent to a single node), multicast (a content is sent to multiple nodes), and anycast (a content is sent to any one member in a group of nodes). We also address several security issues for content retrieval in DTNs. In the presence of malicious and selfish nodes, the content retrieval performance can be deteriorated significantly. To address this problem, we use Public Key Cryptography to secure social-tie records and content delivery records during a contact between two nodes. The unforgeable social-tie records prevent malicious nodes from falsifying the social-tie information, which corrupts the content lookup service placement and disrupts the social-tie routing protocol. The delivery records from which the packet forwarding ratio of a node is computed, helps detect selfish behavior. Furthermore, we propose a blacklist distribution scheme that allows nodes to filter out misbehaving nodes from their social contact graph, effectively preventing network traffic from flowing to misbehaving nodes. Through extensive simulation studies using real-world mobility traces, we show that our content retrieval scheme can achieve a high content delivery ratio, low delay, and low transmission cost. In addition, our proposed misbehavior detection method can detect insider attacks efficiently with a high detection ratio and a low false positive rate, thus improving the content retrieval performance...|$|R

Terrain classification methods provide semantic descriptions of {{the physical}} nature of a given <b>terrain</b> region. These <b>descriptions</b> can be associated with nominal numerical physical parameters, and/or nominal traversability estimates, to improve mobility prediction accuracy. Here we study the performance of multi-sensor classification methods in the context of Mars surface exploration. The performance of two classification algorithms for color, texture, and range features are presented based on maximum likelihood estimation and support vector machines. In addition, a classification method based on vibration features derived from rover wheel-terrain interaction is briefly described. Two techniques for merging the results of these “low level ” classifiers are presented that rely on Bayesian fusion and meta-classifier fusion. The performance of these algorithms is studied using images from NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover mission and through experiments on a four-wheeled test-bed rover operating in Mars-analog terrain. Also a novel approach to terrain sensing based on fused 2 tactile and visual features is presented.

40|$|Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) aids {{the driver}} by {{providing}} information or automating the driving related tasks to improve driver comfort, reduce workload and improve safety. The vehicle senses its external environment using sensors, building {{a representation of}} the world used by the control systems. In on-road applications, the perception focuses on establishing the location of other road participants such as vehicles and pedestrians and identifying the road trajectory. Perception in the off-road environment is more complex, as the structure found in urban environments is absent. Off-road perception deals with the estimation of surface topography and surface type, which are the factors that will affect vehicle behaviour in unstructured environments. Off-road perception has seldom been explored in automotive context. For autonomous off-road driving, the perception solutions are primarily related to robotics and not directly applicable in the ADAS domain due to the different goals of unmanned autonomous systems, their complexity and the cost of employed sensors. Such applications consider only the impact of the terrain on the vehicle safety and progress but do not account for the driver comfort and assistance. This work addresses the problem of processing vision sensor data to extract the required information about the terrain. The main focus of this work is on the perception task with the constraints of automotive sensors and the requirements of the ADAS systems. By providing a semantic representation of the off-road environment including terrain attributes such as <b>terrain</b> type, <b>description</b> of the <b>terrain</b> topography and surface roughness, the perception system can cater for the requirements of the next generation of off-road ADAS proposed by Land Rover.

The accuracy will surpass that of any global satellite-based elevation model available. WorldDEM is a game-changing disruptive technology and will define a new standard in global elevation models. The German radar satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X form a high-precision radar interferometer in space and acquire the data basis for the WorldDEM.

40|$|Forests are {{significant}} resources from an ecological, {{economic and social}} point of view. Their protection and management could greatly benefit from a com- plete knowledge of the shape and distribution of trees in forest stands. To this purpose, aerial surveys, especially through Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), were {{carried out in the}} last years to acquire point clouds to be used in 3 D models aimed at achieving an accurate description of tree crowns and terrain. However, airborne data acquisition is expensive and may provide poor results in case of dense foliage. Further, point cloud resolution is not very high, as models with a grid of 2 - 3 m are usually obtained. In order to implement more accurate 3 D forest models, a feasible solution is the integration of point clouds obtained by aerial acquisition (ALS or photogrammetry) for the treetops and the <b>terrain</b> <b>description,</b> with information from terrestrial surveys. In this paper, we investigated the possible integration of point clouds obtained by Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) with those collected by photogrammetric 3 D models based on images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a test site located in northern Italy, with the aim of creating an accurate dataset of the forest site with high resolution and precision. The limits of ALS and TLS were bridged by aerial photogrammetry at low altitude (and vice versa). A 3 D model of the study area was obtained with a resolution of 5 cm and a precision of 3 cm.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} freely available digital elevation models (DEMs) for Amazonia is the one obtained by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). However, since SRTM tends to represent the vegetation surface instead of the ground surface, the broad use of SRTM DEM as a framework for <b>terrain</b> <b>description</b> in Amazonia is hampered by the presence of deforested areas. We present here two data sets: (1) a deforestation-corrected SRTM DEM for the interfluve between the Purus and Madeira rivers, in central Amazonia, which passed through a careful identification of different environments and has deforestation features corrected by a new method of increasing pixel values of the DEM (Renno, 2009); and (2) a set of 18 hydrological-topographic descriptors based on the corrected SRTM DEM. Deforestation features are related with the opening of an 800 km road in {{the central part of the}} interfluve and occupancy of its vicinity. We used topographic profiles from the pristine forest to the deforested feature to evaluate the recovery of the original canopy coverage by minimizing canopy height variation (corrections ranged from 1 to 38 m). The hydrological-topographic description was obtained by the Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND) algorithm, which normalizes the terrain elevation (above sea level) by the elevation of the nearest hydrologically connected drainage. The validation of the HAND data set was done by in situ hydrological description of 110 km of walking trails also available in this data set. The new SRTM DEM expands the applicability of SRTM data for landscape modelling; the data sets of hydrological features based on topographic modelling are undoubtedly appropriate for ecological modelling and an important contribution to environmental mapping of Amazonia. The deforestation-corrected SRTM DEM is available at [URL] the polygons selected for deforestation correction are available at [URL] the set of hydrological-topographic descriptors is available at [URL] the environmental description of access trails is available at [URL] and the limits of deforestation corrections and drainage validation are available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{generating}} solid models of terrain involves {{the conversion of}} topographical data into a form useable by a rapid-prototyping (RP) machine. The method was developed to enable {{the use of the}} RP machine to make solid models of Martian terrain from Mars Orbiter laser-altimeter topographical data. The method is equally applicable to the generation of models of the terrains of other astronomical bodies, including other planets, asteroids, and Earth. Topographical data describe a terrain in terms of a set of three-dimensional coordinates [e. g., Cartesian (x,y,z) or polar (latitude, longitude, radius) coordinates] of points or nodes on the terrain surface. The input data for the RP machines are required to provide a three-dimensional description, not of a single surface, but of a volume in this case, a ground volume that underlies the <b>terrain</b> surface. The <b>description</b> is required to be in the form of triangular elements that connect the nodes of all the surfaces and that completely bound the volume, with no open areas, no overlap of triangles, and no extraneous geometric elements. The software used in the present model-generation method was written in IDL - an advanced programming language that affords a number of tools, including subroutines that triangularize surfaces. The software creates a volume from the topographical surface data by adding sides to the edges of the terrain surface and joining the sides with a bottom surface. Each of the sides is triangularized by use of IDL subroutines, and then the software searches for extraneous elements and removes them. Topographical data are usually presented in a grid corresponding to polar coordinates, so that a model generated from such data is equivalent to a topographical map in Mercator projection. However an RP machine is fully capable of including the curvature of a planetary body in a model that it makes. Therefore, the software also offers a capability to transform the topographical data to a projection onto a surface having a curvature corresponding to that of the surface of the modeled planet...|$|R
40|$|Professional {{drivers of}} {{off-road}} vehicles, driving on irregular terrain {{such as in}} forestry, agriculture and mining, are exposed to whole-body vibration and mechanical shocks. These driver groups have reported severe musculoskeletal problems in the spine, but the association to seated postural reactions is not fully understood. One assumption is that unexpected shocks may create excessive load on spinal joints. The driver’s posture and exposure to mechanical shocks are required {{to be included in}} work risk assessments, but muscle activity and body kinematics are not included. The overall aim of this thesis was to describe and analyse seated postural reactions to mechanical shocks and to evaluate measuring of seated postures with relevance for risk assessment and the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders among drivers. The thesis includes four studies, all laboratory-based using a repeated-measures design. Postural reactions were recorded from 23 (Paper I) and 20 (Paper II & III) young, healthy male participants who were seated on a movable platform. The platform delivered mechanical shocks with peak accelerations up to 14 m/s 2 in lateral directions during different conditions. Furthermore, twenty participants (Paper IV) were tested by four testers for analysis of test-retest reliability within and between testers measuring seated postures. Kinematics were here detected by means of a motion analysis system (MoLabTM) and described for the spine as angular displacements or range of motion (ROM) using a three-segment model of neck, trunk and pelvis (Paper I–III) and as a more specific model (Paper IV). Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded bilaterally on the following muscles; trapezius upper part, upper neck, erector spinae and external oblique (Paper I–III). The general findings show that EMG amplitudes normalised to maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) did not exceed 2 % in the trapezius, 8 % in the upper neck and erector spinae and 18 % in the external oblique. The EMG amplitudes and the angular displacements in the neck were significantly reduced from the first compared to the fifth mechanical shock. Adding a cognitive task significantly increased angular displacements. The largest ROM with approximately 20 ° in each segment was found during a double-sided mechanical shock (shock that changes direction). The reliability within one tester measuring seated postures was mostly considered good and superior to the reliability between several testers, but still insensitive to changes of less than 10 °. Exposure to single-sided or double-sided mechanical shocks with accelerations up to 14 m/s 2 seem not to cause postural reactions {{to such an extent that}} overload of muscles or joint structures should be expected. There seems to be a quick adaptation that causes an improved readiness. The external obliques were most active when restoring equilibrium and seem important for stabilising the whole spinal column. Stability training, in order to improve neuromuscular control of the external obliques could, therefore, be a possible recommendation. The angular displacement in the neck increases if the subject solves a cognitive task of why such activities should be avoided when driving in difficult <b>terrains.</b> Since accurate <b>descriptions</b> of the spinal posture seems difficult even when advanced technical equipment is used, simpler models seem more appropriate. The results show that postural control is maintained even when exposed to considerable mechanical shocks. On the basis of these results, there is no need to change established risk assessment models...|$|R

Firstly, by {{the analysis of the}} variation tendency of sea floor relief feature point throughout the procedure of double direction rolling ball transform, and combined with the scale dependence character of positive direction rolling ball transform, both the traverse distribution range and the vertical distribution height of sea floor reliefs of a certain scale had been calculated. Secondly, based on the statistic characteristics of DDM grid point undulation extent, a rule of identifying detail (skeleton) reliefs had been established. Finally, by preserving the skeleton reliefs of specific scale factor, the overall trend of the changes of marine topography had been kept to meet the requirement of depth precision principle of DDM multi-scale representation. Besides, the paper demonstrated the ordered isomorphism characteristic of equidistant surface transform, and by extracting equidistant surface through double direction rolling ball transform of detail reliefs, the local undulation morphology of marine topography had been maintained to fulfill the depth order isomorphism principle of DDM multi-scale representation. Furthermore, the hierarchical nesting characteristic of terrain information in the process of double direction rolling ball transform had been demonstrated. The experiment results showed that this algorithm overcomed positive direction rolling ball transform's inability to reserve concave skeleton reliefs and preserve undulating marine topography, among its other inherent deficiencies. In addition, the algorithm preserved the hierarchical nesting of terrain information well with low <b>terrain</b> <b>description</b> uncertainty. It suggested that this algorithm could not only realize the automatic multi-scale representation of DDM but also preserve the basic terrain characteristics according to the reality principle...|$|E
