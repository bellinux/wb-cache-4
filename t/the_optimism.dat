5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids <b>the</b> <b>optimism</b> to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} about Dylan, a {{depressed}} college student who attempts suicide. He survives due to unlikely events, but is soon visited by a demon who explains he spared Dylan's life. In exchange, Dylan {{will be allowed to}} live one more month for every person he kills. Brubaker said he chose to make the character young because he wanted to include <b>the</b> <b>optimism</b> of youth. The comic examines the consequences of vigilante violence and its effects on Dylan’s loved ones. The story debuted to mostly positive reviews. Some reviewers felt it was too similar to Brubaker and Phillips' previous collaborations.|$|E

5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. <b>The</b> <b>optimism</b> proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|After Egypt's central {{government}} collapsed {{at the end}} of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes. In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed <b>the</b> <b>optimism</b> and originality of the period.|$|E
5|$|Joe Jordan's {{tenure in}} charge was short; {{he left the}} club {{less than a year}} after joining. Following Jordan's departure, Stoke opted to reappoint Lou Macari only 12 months after he had left. Despite <b>the</b> <b>optimism</b> {{surrounding}} his return, only a mid-table finish was attained in the 1994–95 season. The 1995–96 season started poorly, but the signing of striker Mike Sheron turned around the club's campaign. Stoke eventually finished fourth but were defeated in the play-off semi-final by Leicester City. The following season, 1996–97, saw Mark Stein return from Chelsea on loan, partnering Sheron in attack. The season started well, with Stoke in fourth place at Christmas, but a poor second half of the season saw the club drop to an eventual 12th place. Sheron was sold in 1997 for a club record fee of £2.5m. Macari left the club at the end of the season, his last game in charge the final league game at the Victoria Ground in a match against West Bromwich Albion.|$|E

5|$|Gallipoli {{marked the}} end for Hamilton and Stopford but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme. The {{competence}} of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and Harry Chauvel (1st Light Horse Brigade, New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command. The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest. The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies. In Mesopotamia, the Turks surrounded a British expedition at Kut Al Amara, forcing their surrender in April 1916. Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt. Defeat at the Battle of Romani and lack of materials to complete the military railway, necessary for such an operation, {{marked the end}} of that ambition. <b>The</b> <b>optimism</b> which came from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.|$|E

40|$|This article {{builds on}} earlier research, which concludes that {{societies}} cannot sustain themselves without cultures of optimism. These cultures are reproduced by {{a complex of}} ‘optimism promoters’, {{all of which can}} be seen to be engaged in a kind of unstated or ‘implicit’ cultural policy, with <b>the</b> production of <b>optimism</b> as one of its goals. The institution of religion is part of this complex. Its role in <b>the</b> production of <b>optimism</b> is <b>the</b> focus of this article, with particular reference to soteriology (theories of salvation) and eschatology. From a ‘detached’ and ‘functionalist’ perspective, it analyses how religions manufacture hope through (1) the production of meaning; (2) through their models of divine justice; and (3) through theories of ultimate destiny. These matters are discussed in relation to Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. The article concludes that <b>the</b> <b>optimisms</b> of religion are of a quite different order from those promoted by other institutions...|$|R

40|$|A model {{selection}} criterion {{based on a}} divergence or discrepancy measure is generally comprised of a goodness-of-fit term and a penalty term. The penalty term, which reflects model complexity, serves as an estimate of a quantity known as <b>the</b> expected <b>optimism.</b> Classical approaches to approximating <b>the</b> expected <b>optimism</b> often lead to simplistic penalizations. However, such approaches usually involve stringent assump-tions that may fail to hold in practical applications. Modern computational statistical methods facilitate the development of improved estimators of <b>the</b> expected <b>optimism.</b> Selection criteria based on such penalty terms often provide more realistic measures of predictive efficacy than their classical counterparts, thereby resulting in superior model determinations. To survey this methodology, we outline the general framework for discrepancy-based model selection criteria, and review computationally intensive approaches for evalu-ating complexity penalizations...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that optimism may have considerable positive effects on mental and physical health. However, only a few previous studies have explored differential effects of optimism on health and none have {{examined the effects of}} different levels of optimism. This study supports <b>the</b> importance of <b>optimism</b> on health in a sample of 238 Chinese college students and 206 American college students. Comparative results indicated that there were significant differences on measures of two levels of optimism, pessimism, and indicators of health. In general, American students were found to express more dispositional optimistic belief, better mental health, and lower state and trait stress levels than Chinese students. However, {{there was no difference in}} the level of explanatory optimism. In addition, there was no significant difference between Chinese subjects' scores of overall health and American students' scores. Chinese students demonstrate a "middle optimism" style. In addition, both optimistic styles in this study were found to be significantly related to stressful states measured by State Anxiety (Y 1) Scale and Trait Anxiety Scale (Y 2) in Chinese students. In contrast, in American samples, only <b>the</b> dispositional <b>optimism,</b> <b>the</b> big <b>optimism,</b> was found significantly but negatively related to the trait stress. In this study, <b>the</b> association between <b>optimism</b> and health [...] -either little or big optimism [...] -were not different between the two cultures, while <b>the</b> association between <b>optimism</b> and stress was quite different between the two cultures. In the Chinese students, the association between big optimism and stress was stronger than in the American students. Both moderate and mediate models were tested to clarify some of the mechanism among culture, gender, optimism/pessimism, stress and health. Culture was moderating <b>the</b> relation between <b>optimism</b> (big vs. little optimism) and three health components. Gender on the other hand, had no moderating effect in the relationship of big vs. little optimism/pessimism on any health outcomes. The prediction that stress is the moderator in <b>the</b> prediction of <b>optimism</b> on health was not supported in both cultural groups. However, either big or little optimism were found fully mediated by state or trait stress on overall health conditions as well as the physical and mental health, except that <b>the</b> little <b>optimism</b> was not found to be related to mental health. Among the American students, on <b>the</b> other hand, <b>optimism</b> as dominate predictor directly effected reports of health. Stress was not found to be a mediator in the predictive relationship of optimism and health in the American students...|$|R
