5|$|Cooley befriended Captain William Bunce, a {{retailer}} striving to keep Indians in the area, as they represented {{a source of}} cheap labor. He became involved again in local politics, this time against General Jesup, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Indians from Florida. Judge Steele, a newcomer from Connecticut, was Cooley's ally in this fight.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.|$|E

5000|$|The {{constitution}} was {{made even more}} anticlerical from 1934 to 1946, when an amendment mandating socialist education was in effect. On 13 December 1934 Article 3 now mandated socialist education, which [...] "in addition <b>to</b> <b>removing</b> <b>all</b> religious doctrine" [...] would [...] "combat fanaticism and prejudices", [...] "building in the youth a rational and exact concept {{of the universe and}} of social life".|$|R
5|$|Bart is {{visited by}} Erman Millwood, whose company makes films out of web cartoon series. Millwood offers Bart {{a chance to}} make a film {{adaptation}} of the web cartoon Angry Dad. Bart accepts, and Millwood takes him to film studio animators. Homer is soon offered the opportunity to voice Angry Dad, as the voice actor from the original Angry Dad series has dropped out of frustration of never being paid. The film is test screened to a horrible reception. Lisa convinces Bart <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> of the parts the audience did not like, thus making the Angry Dad a short film. The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short.|$|E
5|$|By this point, {{supplies}} of the Beaufighter {{and the new}} Mosquito had improved dramatically, and {{the decision was made}} <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> single-engine designs from the night fighter force during 1942. Two Defiant units did switch to the Mk. VI, but they operated for only about four months before converting to the Mosquito. Production for the AI role ended, and the electronics were converted to Monica tail warning radars for the bomber force, until the mid-1944 knowledge of the Germans' Flensburg radar detector, which spotted Monica transmissions, was revealed to the British.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} praise in pre-release showings, Sonic the Hedgehog {{was released}} to notably negative reception. Criticism {{was directed at}} the game's perceived lack of polish, with reviewers citing long loading times, a poor camera system, gameplay glitches, a complicated plot, and imprecise control. It has been considered among the worst games {{not only in the}} Sonic series but also in the video game medium. Sega delisted the game from retailers in 2010 following its decision <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Sonic games with below-average Metacritic scores to increase the value of the brand.|$|E

5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis would provide the organisation {{with a chance to}} demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.|$|E
5|$|Following these decisions, the General Assembly {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> three justices {{from their}} positions, but lacked the two-thirds majority required for impeachment. The Assembly then attempted {{to abolish the}} Court of Appeals and create a new one, beginning the Old Court-New Court controversy. The members of the existing court – Owsley, John Boyle, and Benjamin Mills – continued functioning in that role, while a new court of four pro-relief justices was organized by the legislature. For a time, both courts {{claimed to be the}} court of last resort in Kentucky, but by 1826, supporters of the Old Court won control of the legislature and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E

5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> user {{data from a}} drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E
5|$|The Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia (now the Eurasian Customs Union) {{came into}} {{existence}} on 1 January 2010. The Customs Union's priorities were the elimination of intra-bloc tariffs, establishing a common external tariff policy {{and the elimination of}} non-tariff barriers. It was launched as a first step towards forming a broader single market inspired by the European Union, with the objective of forming an alliance between former Soviet states. The member states planned to continue with economic integration and were set <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> customs borders between each other after July 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{court ruled}} in favor of conservationists and upheld the {{precedence}} of federal laws before state control of wildlife. Having violated the Endangered Species Act, Hawaii state was required <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> feral animals from the mountainside. This decision was followed by a second court order in 1981. A public hunting program removed many of the feral animals, at least temporarily. An active control program is in place, though it is not conducted with sufficient rigor to allow significant recovery of the māmane-naio ecosystem. There are many other species and ecosystems on the island, and on Mauna Kea, that remain threatened by human development and invasive species.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{positions}} available to women in the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to be lifted in 1990. In 2010 approximately 92% of employment categories and 84% of positions in the ADF were available to females as well as males. In September 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith announced that the Cabinet had decided <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> restrictions on women serving in combat positions, and that this change would come into effect within five years. This decision {{was supported by the}} CDF and the chiefs of the services. Women became able to apply for all positions other than special forces roles in the Army on 1 January 2013. This remaining restriction was removed during 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} USB1.0 specification, {{which was}} introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5Mbit/s Low Speed and 12Mbit/s Full Speed. Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the devices. The first widely used version of USB was 1.1, which was released in September 1998. The 12Mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed devices such as disk drives, and the lower 1.5Mbit/s rate for low data rate devices such as joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself. Following Apple's design decision <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> legacy ports from the iMac, many PC manufacturers began building legacy-free PCs, {{which led to the}} broader PC market using USB as a standard.|$|E
5|$|They {{were met}} by nearly 400 Insane Clown Posse fans {{standing}} outside {{in front of the}} TRL studio window, all with signs supporting the duo. Thirty minutes before the show began, Viacom security guards and New York City police officers were dispatched <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> the fans from the sidewalk. When some fans, including Robert Bruce, refused to move because it was a public street and no other individuals were asked to move, they were assaulted. All telephone requests for the video to be played were ignored, and Insane Clown Posse was never mentioned during the show. MTV later informed Island Records that the heads of the network must choose the band first before it can become eligible to be featured on TRL.|$|E

Reviewers praised its visual {{style and}} considered the game as a whole to be an improvement from prior entries, but were critical of its controls, which some claimed took time to get used to, and its inconsistent difficulty. Sega released a sequel in 2009, Sonic and the Black Knight; the two form {{what is known as}} the Sonic Storybook series. Sonic and the Secret Rings was de-listed from retailers in 2010, following Sega's decision <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Sonic titles with sub-average Metacritic scores in order to increase the value of the brand.|$|E
5|$|During the 1973–1975 biennium, {{pressure}} {{was put on}} Kappa Kappa Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of {{an equal number of}} members from Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger—Kappa Kappa Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. With the idea of a merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.|$|E
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
