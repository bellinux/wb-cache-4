Joshua Prescott stated that Óláfr {{appears to have been}} Earl Páll's main {{supporter}} in Caithness; according to Williams, Óláfr appears to have held these lands directly from the Earls of Orkney, rather than as a family possession. The saga relates of how at Duncansby, Ölvir and his party surprised Óláfr within his own house. They then set fire to the house, and burn Óláfr to death within. Ölvir and his men took all the movable property they could get their hands on, before leaving the scene. When Earl Páll heard of what has happened, he <b>takes-in</b> the slain chieftain's son, Sveinn Óláfsson. With the death of his father, Sveinn Óláfsson becomes known as Sveinn Ásleifarson—after his mother. Such house-burnings—in which individuals are burnt to death, or slain as they flee the fire—are found throughout the sagas as a part of blood feuds. The saga states that some time later, Sveinn, who has spent time in the Suðreyjar and Atholl, returned to Orkney. On his way, Sveinn he stopped at Thurso, where his accomplice, Ljótólfr, negotiated a truce between Sveinn and Frakökk's brother, Earl Óttarr.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} the {{defining}} human development challenge of the 21 st Century. Failure {{to respond to that}} challenge will stall and then reverse international efforts to reduce poverty. The poorest countries and most vulnerable citizens will suffer the earliest and most damaging setbacks, even though they have contributed least to the problem. Looking to the future, no country—however wealthy or powerful—will be immune to the impact of global warming. The Human Development Report 2007 / 2008 shows that climate change is not just a future scenario. Increased exposure to droughts, floods and storms is already destroying opportunity and reinforcing inequality. Meanwhile, there is now overwhelming scientific evidence that the world is moving towards the point at which irreversible ecological catastrophe becomes unavoidable. Business-as-usual climate change points in a clear direction: unprecedented reversal in human development in our lifetime, and acute risks for our children and their grandchildren. There is a window of opportunity for avoiding the most damaging climate change impacts, but that window is closing: the world has less than a decade to change course. Actions taken—or not <b>taken—in</b> the years ahead will have a profound bearing on the future course of human development. The world lacks neither the financial resources nor the technological capabilities to act. What is missing is a sense of urgency, human solidarity and collective interest. As the Human Development Report 2007 / 2008 argues, climate change poses challenges at many levels. In a divided but ecologically interdependent world, it challenges all people to reflect upon how we manage the environment of the one thing that we share in common: planet Earth. It challenges us to reflect on social justice and human rights across countries and generations. It challenges political leaders and people in rich nations to acknowledge their historic responsibility for the problem, and to initiate deep and early cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Above all, it challenges the entire human community to undertake prompt and strong collective action based on shared values and a shared vision. human development, climate change, sustainable development, global warming, CO 2, climate forecasting, risk, vulnerability, inequality, social justice, inter-generational equity, ecological disaster, solidarity...|$|R

We perform computational experiments on different network topologies to investigate the relationship between network resilience and traffic demand.

The instrument of the research is a questionnaire consisting of two sets each of which is assumed to provide data for one of the two-fold aims. The first set of the questionnaire is based on the “Higher-Order Thinking and Problem Solving Checklist” (Borich, 2004 : 294). “The second set of questionnaire comprises 13 statements derived from VARK- a guide to learning styles,aiming to reveal the “preferences of each learner about the ways to <b>take-in</b> and give-out information while learning ” (Fleming, 2001).

In delivering the soil samples the most important stage is a stage to pick-and-place it in the transportation (returned) capsule. The aim of this work is to develop a reloading device of the suction head to provide picking up the soil of Mars’ satellite “Phobos”. This device is designed for use {{as a part of the}} spacecraft "Phobos-Grunt". The presented device belongs to a manipulating type of devices and consists of a manipulator and a handling device. The manipulator provides picking up the Phobos surface soil samples and their placing into a capsule, which is in the block of the handling device. Upon the capsule has been filled it is reloaded from the soil intake area to the area of capsule transfer, which is provided by means of a compactly piled gas-filled shell. In operation there is a number of restrictions. The tolerable capsule opening size to <b>take-in</b> the soil samples can be up to 10 mm with 1003 cm free soil capsule volume.

We therefore assessed patients' knowledge about their ulcer healing drugs and whether the prescriptions were appropriate or not. Consecutive {{patients on}} ulcer healing drugs admitted as emergencies to the general medical <b>take-in</b> underwent a structured interview designed to assess knowledge of drugs prescribed prior to admission. Patient responses (fully correct, partially correct or incorrect) and appropriateness (appropriate, possibly appropriate or inappropriate) of the prescriptions were graded by reference to information obtained from hospital notes and/or general practitioner. Seventy-nine out of a total of 537 patients (15 %) were on ulcer healing drugs. Mean age was 64 years (range 26 - 91). Fifty-five (70 %) of these patients could be analysed for correctness and 62 (78 %) for the appropriateness. Patients gave an incorrect indication for 18 % of ulcer healing drugs but only for 10 % of non-ulcer healing drugs (P < 0. 05). Factors associated with a poorer knowledge of drugs overall, were increasing age and impaired mental test score but not the number of drugs the patient was taking. The trends were similar for ulcer healing drugs alone. Sixteen out of 62 (26 %, 95 % CI 16 - 39 %) prescriptions for ulcer healing drugs were deemed inappropriate.

All these soft skills are important to IT students as a preparation for their future career development. Unfortunately, there is no statistical {{evidence to support the}} effectiveness of the PBL implementation as claim by many researchers. Therefore, the top management of Higher Education Institution (HEI) is really concerned with the effectiveness of the Problem-based Learning (PBL) implementation of certain courses in the university. The effectiveness of the PBL implementation is actually depends on the best practices of the PBL implementation of the IT courses. Thus, this study aims to identify the factors and the relationship among factors that influence the best practices of PBL implementation of IT courses from students' perspectives. The student perception of the PBL implementation of IT courses also <b>take-in</b> consideration as one of the effective measurement in this study. The student’s perception is important to ensure the successfulness of the PBL implementation. The study involved three (3) main phases: firstly PBL implementation factors are identified, secondly, a PBL model of IT courses is constructing, and finally, the proposed PBL model is validated using statistical analysis. Four main factors are identified: PBL Course Assessment, PBL Characteristics, PBL Practices, and Students’ Perception. Based on these four factors, a PBL model is constructed. Then, based on the proposed PBL model, six hypotheses are formulated and analyzed to validate the model. The results show that all hypotheses are significantly acceptable. The result also shows that the PBL Characteristics and PBL Course Assessment factors are significantly influenced the PBL Practices and indirectly influenced the Students’ Perception of the PBL Implementation for IT courses. This PBL model can assist instructors, decision makers in enhancing the PBL learning strategy of IT courses. It is also can be tested to other courses in various educational domains in the future...|$|E
