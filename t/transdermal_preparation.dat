A novel testosterone transdermal delivery system (TDDS) was developed using a palm oil base called HAMIN (TM) (a commercial product) and tested using in vitro and in vivo skin permeability test methods. Materials and Methods: The physical characteristics of the formulation such as particle size and viscosity were determined by using Franz diffusion cell and Brookfield viscometer, respectively. In vivo skin permeability test was performed on healthy rabbits through the skin. Testosterone in serum was analyzed using the validated Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique. Results: In vitro study showed that the cumulative amount of testosterone diffused was between 40 to 1400 ngcm(- 2) {{over a period of}} five hr after application of TDDS through the artificial Strat-M (TM) membrane.

In order to alleviate these symptoms and prevent distant effects ofoestrogen deficiency, the use of continuous oestrogen therapy is recommended. Aim of the study: The aim of this work was to compare the effects of oral and transdermal hormonal replacementtherapy in patients after hystero-adnexectomy. Material and methods: The study covered a group of 80 patients, who {{were divided into two}} subgroups. Thefirst subgroup was administered a <b>transdermal</b> <b>preparation</b> with estradiol and the second one – an oral preparation. The control group consisted of 60 patients, who did not consent to the hormonal therapy (HT). Thedegree of intensity of climacteric symptoms was evaluated in each group {{at the time of the}} operation, 3 monthsand 6 months after the operation. Severity of symptoms was rated using Kuppermann scale. Results: There were no differences in the incidence of climacteric symptoms in particular degrees betweenthe two groups before the surgery. After 3 months, a decrease in the incidence of severe and moderate climacteric symptoms in patients receiving HT was observed. After 6 months, only 8 % of patients with transdermal HTand 6 % of patients with oral HT reported climacteric symptoms, in the control group patients reported a furtherincrease in complaints.

We investigated the additive effect of tulobuterol tape in adult asthma patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter trial was conducted. Male and female patients with a diagnosis of asthma requiring inhaled short-acting β 2 -agonists despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids took tulobuterol tape (1 mg or 2 mg) and corresponding placebo tapes for 4 weeks. Results: Mean morning peak expiratory flows (PEF) in the 1 and 2 mg/day groups were significantly increased from the baseline value by 23. 8 and 35. 9 L/min at week 4, respectively. The increase in mean morning PEF in the 2 mg/day group {{was significantly higher than}} that in the 1 mg/day group.

Angiographically proven two or three vessel coronary disease was present in all. After a base-line exercise test the active device was titrated to efficacy or side effects and the number of patches thereafter re-mained constant (2 - 6 patches per day; mean 3. 5). Patients were randomly allo-cated to active treatment or placebo, and further exercise tests were performed at 2 hours and 26 hours after application of the device. Patients were then crossed over after one days rest to the opposite treatment group, and exercise studies repeated. Two hours after application of transdermal nitroglycerin total exercise duration increased (mean 14. 0 minutes) compared to placebo (12. 5 minutes) and control (12. 0 minutes) (p < 0. 05). This effect was maintained at 26 hours. Exercise time to anginal threshold (angina + 1. 5 mm ST segment depression) was increased at 2 hours and 26 hours with active drug by 11 % compared to placebo and by 22 % in comparison to control.

The measurement of the pharmacodynamic response of a permeant or the determination of permeant penetration rates under finite-dose conditions includes all three types of vehicle effects, whereas under infinite-dose conditions permeant depletion does not play a significant role. Four lipophilic liquids (caprylic/capric triglyceride, isopropyl myristate, light mineral oil, and dimethicone 100) were used as vehicles. The reciprocal {{of the time of}} onset of an erythema (1 /LT) and the duration of the erythema D induced by the model compound methyl nicotinate served as response parameters. Steady-state penetration rate measurements were made with a recently developed glass chamber system. Bioavailability factors f and enhancement factors EF were determined from both methyl nicotinate penetration rates (infinite-dose conditions) and the horizontal distances between concentration-response curves (finite-dose conditions), with caprylic/capric triglyceride as the standard vehicle. Permeant depletion was quantified by dividing the enhancement factors determined under infinite-dose conditions by those under finite-dose conditions. These ratios were called depletion factors DF.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} use of hormone replacement therapy {{and the risk of}} idiopathic venous thromboembolism. DESIGN: Population based case-control study. SETTING: Population enrolled in the General Practice Research Database, United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: A cohort of 347, 253 women aged 50 to 79 without major risk factors for venous thromboembolism was identified. Cases were 292 women admitted to hospital for a first episode of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis; 10, 000 controls were randomly selected from the source cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adjusted relative risks estimated from unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio of venous thromboembolism for current use of hormone replacement therapy compared with non-users was 2. 1 (95 % confidence interval 1. 4 to 3. 2). This increased risk was restricted to first year users, with odds ratios of 4. 6 (2. 5 to 8. 4) during the first six months and 3. 0 (1. 4 to 6. 5) 6 - 12 months after starting treatment. No major risk differences were observed between users of low and high doses of oestrogens, unopposed and opposed treatment, and oral and <b>transdermal</b> <b>preparations.</b> The risk of idiopathic venous thromboembolism among non-users of replacement therapy was estimated to be 1. 3 per 10, 000 women per year.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether therapy with nitroglycerin (GTN) would lead to abnormal coronary artery responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine. Background. Nitroglycerin therapy is associated with specific biochemical changes in the vasculature that may lead to increased vascular sensitivity to vasoconstrictors. Methods. Patients were randomized to continuous transdermal GTN, 0. 6 mg/h (n = 8), or no therapy (n = 7), for 5 days prior to a diagnostic catheterization. Patients had similar risk factors for endothelial dysfunction. Quantitative angiography was performed in the morning to measure the mean luminal diameter of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in response to intracoronary acetylcholine (peak concentration, 10 − 4 mol/liter). The <b>transdermal</b> <b>preparation</b> was removed from the GTN group, and 3 h later experimental procedures were repeated. Results. In the morning, the GTN group experienced greater coronary constriction in response to acetylcholine infusion than those not receiving GTN (− 19. 6 ± 4. 2 vs. − 3. 8 ± 3. 0 %; p = 0. 01). Three hours later, the GTN group continued to display greater constriction to acetylcholine (− 24. 1 ± 5. 9 %) as compared to the non-GTN group (− 1. 8 ± 4. 8 %). When the morning and afternoon responses to acetylcholine were compared, the increase in coronary constriction in the GTN group was greater than the change observed in the non-GTN group (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. This study demonstrates that therapy with GTN causes abnormal coronary vasomotor responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine, changes that were persistent for up to 3 hours after GTN discontinuation. This nitrate-associated vasomotor dysfunction has implications with respect to the development of nitrate tolerance and the potential for adverse events during nitrate withdrawal...|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to objectively {{evaluate}} the effects of intermittent administration of transdermal nitroglycerin on effort tolerance, frequency of anginal attacks and presence of silent ischemic events that occur during normal daily activities. Background. Previous studies have shown that transdermal nitroglycerin patches reduce the incidence of anginal attacks and improve exercise capacity when given intermittently. However, no carefully controlled studies are available on the effects of these preparations (and their dosing schedule) on the occurrence of “silent” ischemic events during unrestricted daily activities. Methods. Twelve men with chronic stable angina, a positive exercise test result and significant coronary artery disease completed a randomized, double-blind, placeho-controlled trial in which patches were worn either continuously or with overnight (8 h) removal. The effects of treatment were objectively assessed by both treadmill exercise testing and 24 -h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Results. Only the intermittent dosing schedule afforded a small but significant improvement in exercise tolerance and prolonged exercise duration and time to ST segment depression. The frequency of anginal attacks was also reduced by both the continuous and intermittent treatment, but the effects on symptoms were not paralleted by a concomitant reduction in ischemic episodes re. corded during ambulatory monitoring.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients on hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) for osteoporosis prevention rather than menopausal symptom control may be asymptomatic, despite inadequate replacement and low serum oestradiol (E 2) levels. In the primary health care setting, therapeutic monitoring of HRT is not carried out routinely so that patients with serum E 2 levels inadequate to protect bone may be missed. AIM: To determine the proportion of women on <b>transdermal</b> E 2 <b>preparations</b> with serum E 2 levels insufficient to protect bone and to assess {{the value of a}} questionnaire-derived menopausal symptom score (MSS) for detecting these patients. METHOD: A cross-sectional analysis of 45 patients aged 35 - 70 years using <b>transdermal</b> E 2 <b>preparations</b> obtained from a computer register of 14500 patients in a suburban practice. One blood sample was obtained from each patient at the time the MSS questionnaire was completed. Serum E 2 concentration was measured using a fluoroimmunoassay and compared with the MSS. Levels below 150 pmol/l were considered to be insufficient to protect bone. The diagnostic accuracy of the MSS in screening for levels below 150 pmol/l was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The median (95 % CI) serum E 2 was 147 pmol/l (126 - 198 pmol/l) and levels were below 150 pmol/l in 24 out of 45 patients. There was no difference in the MSS (median, 95 % CI) between those with serum E 2 or = 150 pmol/l (9. 0, 5. 0 - 14; P = 0. 477). The degree of association between the serum E 2 and the MSS, using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, rs (95 % CI) was small and not significant (- 0. 04, - 0. 34 to 0. 26; P = 0. 398). ROC curve analysis revealed an area under the curve (95 % CI) of 0. 51 (0. 33 - 0. 68). CONCLUSIONS: More than half the women were inadequately replaced to protect against osteoporosis. Furthermore, the MSS was of no value in screening for those with low serum E 2 levels. Serum E 2 levels should be monitored in women on HRT for osteoporosis prevention and the E 2 dosage adjusted accordingly...|$|R

Access to healthcare is often more difficult here, than in with the major population centres, due to the ‘tyranny of distance’ and reduced specialist medical and allied health services available locally. This pain clinic, based at the NW Regional Hospital, opened its doors in 2005. The previous ad hoc system, provided by the anaesthetic department acute pain service, had become overwhelmed by the persistent pain workload. The catalyst for this was the well publicised withdrawal of VioxxTM (rofecoxib) in 2004, highlighting the potential long term cardiovascular adverse effects of both cyclo-oxygenase- 2 selective inhibitors (coxibs) and standard non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Quickly, opioid analgesics were replacing coxibs and NSAIDs {{for the management of}} the painful musculoskeletal degenerative changes associated with aging, as their long term safety profile was predictable. Long-term opioid management is complex, in achieving a balance between efficacy of pain relief and minimisation of harm. Efficacy of pain relief requires stable therapeutic levels of medication, which may be difficult to achieve even with long acting oral opioid preparations. Minimisation of harm requires the reduction of untoward patient effects and the prevention of opioid diversion to the community. This requires significant healthcare resources to optimise patient care. Our newly arriving patients who were being treated with transdermal opioids seemed to be following a simpler path. If patients seemed happier with these transdermal medicines, they might need less frequent healthcare access. This concept framed the study. There was no published data available on the effect of the route of opioid analgesia, on healthcare utilisation, by persistent pain patients. This was the first Australian study to measure this in a rural context. This prospective longitudinal study compared 1804 months of healthcare activity by 198 subjects using oral or transdermal opioids. Subjects recorded details of all their ‘out of home’ healthcare contacts, together with the type, route, and dosage, of their opioid medication(s). There is a personal socioeconomic cost involved in accessing healthcare, and this increases in rural areas. Pain patients may use additional analgesics with their opioid analgesics. These related issues were assessed, as any benefit from reduced healthcare activity would likely be lost if patient costs, or their need for additional analgesics, increased. The study revealed that General Practitioner contacts were reduced significantly, by one fifth, and there was a trend towards less total healthcare activity, by patients using transdermal opioids. Pharmacy visits remained unaffected, probably {{as a consequence of the}} regularly repeated dispensing of all subject medications. Their personal socioeconomic costs involved remained unchanged. This included all out of pocket healthcare and travel expenses, together with the time taken to access this healthcare. On average, the subjects spent five hours each month and had out of pocket expenses of over one hundred dollars to do this. Additional analgesic and sedative use was unchanged, but there was a trend towards reduced use of short acting opioid analgesics for ‘breakthrough’ pain. Whether some patients have individual characteristics that enhance their response to the ‘steady state’ delivery of opioid medication by the transdermal route is currently unknown. If the risk of diversion is a consideration in prescribing opioid analgesics for rural pain patients then, at present, transdermal opioids are the safer option. If this leads to a reduction in the prevalence of opioid diversion in NW Tasmania, there are considerable economic benefits, both from a reduction in self-harm, and from drug enforcement costs. In NW Tasmania, transdermal opioids do seem to offer a benefit to patients compared to oral opioids. Reducing the frequency of General Practitioner visits is a good outcome in this rural area of limited health resources. Transdermal opioids are relatively simple and safe to use, both for prescribers and patients. As the population here ages, there will be an increased requirement for safe and effective pain relief for both degenerative and malignant pain. With the further development of these <b>preparations,</b> <b>transdermal</b> matrix opioids may open the door to the further relief of suffering and the living of fulfilled lives. This study has filled a gap in the knowledge of the effective management of opioid treated CNCP patients in rural Tasmania. This may be applicable to similar rural areas in Australia and elsewhere, where healthcare resources are limited. This thesis is presented as a series of published and submitted papers.
