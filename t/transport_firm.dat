25|$|Over time ECJ {{developed}} two essential {{rules on}} which the legal order rests: direct effect and primacy. The court first ruled on the direct effect of primary legislation in a case that, though technical and tedious, raised a fundamental principle of Union law. In Van Gend en Loos (1963), a Dutch <b>transport</b> <b>firm</b> brought a complaint against Dutch customs for increasing the duty on a product imported from Germany. The {{court ruled that the}} Community constitutes a new legal order, the subjects of which consist of not only the Member States but also their nationals. The principle of direct effect would have had little impact if Union law did not supersede national law. Without supremacy the Member States could simply ignore EU rules. In Costa v ENEL (1964), the court ruled that member states had definitively transferred sovereign rights to the Community and Union law could not be overridden by domestic law.|$|E

30|$|This table {{can also}} be {{interpreted}} in dynamic terms, as the possible evolution of <b>transport</b> <b>firms,</b> from a simple material trajectory, towards more complex informational and methodological trajectories. A large share of firms, in particular small <b>transport</b> <b>firms</b> and subcontractors for large logistic providers, remain in a mainly material service trajectory. More and more <b>transport</b> <b>firms,</b> however, are forced, under pressure from their customers, to adopt {{information and communication technologies}} and to include informational service operations. A small number of large scale transport and logistics services providers evolve towards a complex methodological and informational service trajectory, some of which even contract out all of their transport operations and concentrate on the management of logistic systems.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{model that}} {{explicitly}} considers service quality, this paper focuses {{on the problem of}} whether local government should regulate price in contracting out local public transport services. In the case where price is regulated, the outcome is a lower price, higher output, and lower quality. In spite of a decrease in quality, the net consumer surplus is higher when price is regulated. Since the <b>transport</b> <b>firm's</b> profits are higher when price is not regulated, local government and <b>transport</b> <b>firms</b> never reach a ''win-win'' agreement. Consequently, which party has the legal right to determine price is highly significant. © The London School of Economics and the University of Bath 2003...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is to develop a}} {{conceptual}} framework of the role of innovation capability, operation capability and logistics performance in the <b>transport</b> <b>firms.</b> Based on resource-based view, capability plays a vital role in a firm to generate competitive advantages. This is important for achieving better performance results. Further, innovation capability is one of the dynamic capabilities, which can be deployed to extend, modify or create the ordinary capability in a firm. And operation capability in logistics is critical for <b>transport</b> <b>firms</b> to deliver value and service to customers. This paper, therefore, gives an attempt to develop a conceptual framework for investigating the relationships among innovation capability, operation capability and logistics performance. This may reveal how logistics performance is influenced by both innovation capability and operation capability. This has important implications for both managers and academics. In addition, it provides an insight into strategic management and innovation management...|$|R

Among the many driving forces behind globalisation of trade and of business trends in logistics and supply chains have been identified and looked into. Characteristic features of leading firms have been identified. The recommendations for the shipping companies comprise the development of an analytic framework consisting of two dimensions. Together, these two dimensions serve to identify central questions in global strategies of sea <b>transport</b> <b>firms.</b> The vertical dimension uses four categories developed for the report as the dimensions of change (product, time, space and actors). Against this dimension a horizontal dimension is drawn, consisting of what we see as three crucial strategy areas (marketing, logistics and Human Resource Management (HRM) for sea <b>transport</b> <b>firms.</b> It is further recommended to base the development of the analytical framework on the use of scenario technique. This is a good strategic planning method when it comes to structuring a mass of more or less conflicting development trends of varying degree of quantification...|$|R
