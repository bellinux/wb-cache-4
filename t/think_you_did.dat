2500|$|Rollins {{said that}} he had {{conducted}} a thorough internal investigation into Harris's ties to MZM in hopes of finding conclusive proof of her innocence; but when he could not, he and other advisers, including her lawyer, urged her to drop her candidacy rather than risk federal corruption charges. Although he did not believe Harris intentionally broke any laws, [...] "her story kept changing. Our great concern was that you get into trouble when you don't tell the same story twice ... Maybe you don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> anything wrong, but then maybe you start getting questioned about it and so forth, and you may perjure yourself. ... Unlike Cunningham, I don't think she set out to violate the law, but I think she was very careless. She heard whatever she wanted to hear, but we could find no evidence whatsoever that this was a project going into her district." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{right to}} sell to him," [...] said Westover, saddened {{somewhat}} by the proof Whitwell alleged of his magnanimity.|$|E
6000|$|Prosp. How can I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{remember}} hers, [...] When {{you forgot}} your own? {{did you not}} see [...] The man, whom I commanded you to shun? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Adela, <b>you</b> do; I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I <b>think</b> I am {{honest and}} open. At any rate, I {{strive to be}} so. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{understand}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|FAITH. But I {{am ready}} to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> but jest, because you smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> and {{sometimes}} I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> don't. Anyway, you don't know your fellow-woman. There was that affair of the Spaniards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, we {{will not}} have any crying this evening,' said Claude. 'I do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> me much mischief, my head ached just as much before.' ...|$|E
60|$|BENTLEY. I should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Johnny {{was rather}} rough on me, though. He told me nobody here liked me; and I was silly {{enough to believe}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> But {{that has}} nothing to do with the present situation. I want to know if you are willing to come to terms or not?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Well, if you didn't like women's basketball," [...] Phoenix coach Corey Gaines said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--certainly not. Why {{should you}} ask all this? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> love me? Come, Isabel; {{say that you}} love me. Will you call me vain if I say that I almost <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>You</b> cannot doubt about my love;--not now." ...|$|R
60|$|AND because <b>you</b> love me <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not hate me? Ha, {{since you}} love me to ecstasy it follows you hate me to ecstasy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> a good deal," [...] and Barton Pelter laughed nervously. [...] "You-- {{you are now}} in {{business}} where my uncle used to be, are you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] Kit said, laughing, [...] "you're {{generally}} frank. I'd {{rather have}} liked to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{want to see me}} off. Anyhow, I'm glad you have arrived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{suppose that}} we've ever said {{anything}} to Miss Ruth, or that we're goin' to. It's a great deal better to let her <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it all yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> I <b>think.</b> I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Come, come, Lady Dedlock, we {{must not}} fence and parry now. You know you like this girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D'you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{make enough}} {{allowance}} for feelings?" [...] asked Mr. Hewet. He had again forgotten {{what he had}} meant to say.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} reflectively, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> It doesn't matter who she is, anyway, and you haven't {{told me what}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of Mr. Sewell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} listen to me, my dear. I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> quite {{understand}} it. It {{would have been}} very odd if you had, as I never explained it to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> Dan. Well, I am {{too tired}} to tell you {{anything}} about it now, but I have one piece of news for you: Tony has come back to his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, let me git out!" [...] yelled Peleg Snuggers, but at {{that moment}} the snowball began to turn over. [...] "I'll be killed! Oh, dear, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> this a-purpose, you rascals!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> him wrong, mamma. I am sure <b>you</b> are <b>doing</b> me wrong. I {{think his}} coming was an accident, {{and that what}} he said was--an accident.' ...|$|R
60|$|A.--Well, however unjust {{you are to}} me, and to my {{neighbour}} too, I {{will not}} undeceive you at present; I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not deserve it.|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> He {{heard the}} whole story. It was brave and noble of you, it was indeed!" [...] And Vera's face showed her earnestness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you need}} not regret it," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> quite enough, and if {{anything}} of the kind occurs again I positively forbid {{you to go out}} of the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Kit, [...] "I really <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> There are matters {{about which}} we do not agree; but I believe you are too kind to let a rather ignorant {{antagonist}} get hurt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{remember}} it, auntie," [...] I said, wearied {{out with}} excitement. [...] "But I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> wrong, all the same. In {{a case like}} this, it's everybody's first duty to tell all he knows, {{in the interests of}} justice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Papa. I <b>think</b> he {{intended}} no personal disrespect {{to you when}} he preached the sermon which made the archdeacon and the dean so angry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} you really mean it," [...] said Miss Sally bitterly. [...] "Oh, I dare say <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> But <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Perhaps <b>you</b> are the {{exception}} that proves the rule." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{say that}} again I shall <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it on purpose!" [...] Delia declared. [...] "ARE you {{thinking}} of George Flack?" [...] she repeated in a moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "You look well," [...] said Mrs. Prentice. [...] "Neither of {{you seem}} to have changed much," [...] she added, looking from him to her daughter. [...] "And I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> quite well not to write. I think it was much the best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Charley, I {{may think}} as I like, you know,' she said, with {{something}} of the obstinacy of old days. 'I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> save my life, {{and all the people}} in the world won't make me think anything else; but, Charley, I have something now to tell you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{know why}} you did it, and I do not blame you," [...] said Dane. [...] "I shall most clearly {{remember}} that, when I was sick, you saved my life for me, as I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> again when you helped my comrade to forestall Rideau." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon-my word, my love, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> Mrs. Crawley injustice," [...] Sir Pitt said; {{at which}} speech Rebecca was vastly relieved. [...] "Indeed I believe her to be--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I'm {{pleased to}} have you throw the judge over, and employ me, but, all the same, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> him an injustice. He's a good, square man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{wrong in}} {{shutting}} yourself {{away from all}} human comradeship,' she said, with that good-humoured smile of hers. 'You must know that you will only grow absurdly morbid.' ...|$|R
