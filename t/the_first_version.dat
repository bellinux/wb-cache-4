The second, measuring , was composed specifically for King Alexander, {{who had also}} commissioned <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>version.</b> As part of his preparations, Jovanović studied authentic costumes and armaments {{from the time of}} the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović incited the people. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some of their faces appear in the painting.|$|E

5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with a very limited accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed from the small loft in the high choir of the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft where the other movements of the Magnificat were performed. The autograph of the E-flat major version of the Magnificat (BWV 243a) suggests that Bach intended to perform <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>version</b> of his Magnificat also without the laudes, depending on circumstances, for example on other feasts than Christmas.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>version</b> was merely {{scrolling}} around a map and entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E
5|$|Friendly {{generally}} {{approved of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>version</b> but {{believed that it}} was necessary to include information on same-sex sexual practices. When those practices were explained to him, however, he changed his mind. While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of CBS News but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War. He was replaced by Richard S. Salant, who was known for his cost-consciousness, which put the future of the documentary and the CBS Reports series in question.|$|E
5|$|Henry Cameron's platinotype {{reproductions of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>version</b> of Hope had {{circulated}} since the painting's exhibition, but {{were slow to}} produce and expensive to buy. From the early 1890s photographer Frederick Hollyer produced large numbers of cheap platinotype reproductions of the second version, particularly after Hollyer formalised his business relationship with Watts in 1896. Hollyer sold the reproductions both via printsellers {{around the country and}} directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.|$|E

A new M-85 was then designated between Mayville and Caro. This second designation was supplanted by an extended and rerouted M-24 in late 1941 or early 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{several months}} {{after the release of}} Net-2, William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz wrote {{replacements}} for those six missing files, ported BSD to the Intel 80386-based microprocessors, and called their new operating system 386BSD. They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on their own and create FreeBSD so that they could keep the operating system up to date. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>version</b> of FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E

The 1542 version was rearranged for theological reasons, covering Faith first, then Law and Prayer.|$|E
