The special universal joint is composed of a parallel mechanism with three legs as the inputs. One can rotate as a spindle; other two legs can drive a moving platform and make a drill point get an accurate position in workspace. Due to the simple mechanical structure comparing the grinder with the existing conventional CNC cutting <b>tool</b> <b>grinders,</b> it should be easy for the grinder to manufacture at a low cost. In addition, inverse kinematic equations of the special type of universal joint are derived...|$|R

50|$|A radius grinder (or radius <b>tool</b> <b>grinder)</b> is {{a special}} grinder used for {{grinding}} the most complex tool forms, and is the historical predecessor to the CNC tool and cutter grinder. Like the CNC grinder, it {{may be used for}} other tasks where grinding spherical surfaces is necessary. The tool itself consists of three parts: The grinder head, work table, and holding fixture. The grinder head has three degrees of freedom. Vertical movement, movement into the workpeice, and tilt. These are generally set statically, and left fixed throughout operations. The work table is a T-slotted X-axis table mounted on top of a radial fixture. Mounting the X axis on top of the radius table, as opposed to the other way around, allows for complex and accurate radius grinds. The holding fixtures can be anything one can mount on a slotted table, but most commonly used is a collet or chuck fixture that indexes and has a separate Y movement to allow accurate depth setting and endmill sharpening. The dressers used on these grinders are usually quite expensive, and can dress the grinding wheel itself with a particular radius.|$|E

This tool is generally single cutting edge. The installation tool is a bolt shank fixed to the rotary shaft of the positioning groove. When you need to replace the tool mechanical enclosure open, loosen all bolts to remove the tool to replace the new tool. With no cutting edge tools can extend tool life. Reduce the number of replacement tools. The second tool is mounted on the housing of the machine tool. Single cutting edge of the tool mounting clearance is small, difficult to adjust the gap. Multi-blade cutter working gap can be formed when using the wedge mounting the inlet and outlet ports of the difference. Move the material in the resulting gap wedge and promote the formation of shear extrusion processing. Quick change fixed tool so that the tool sharp edge retention, reduce heat generation.

40|$|One of {{approaches}} to protect devices from unpleasant vibrating disturbances is by employing a vibration absorber. This paper explores {{the viability of}} polysiloxane as raw material, added with rice husk silica fillers to produce a vibration absorbent sheet. The polysiloxane reinforced with rice husk sheets were made using hot compression moulding technique. The samples were tested for its density and tensile tests according to related standards. As for vibration test, a portable hand grinder was used to estimate the vibration exposure experienced by the users. The polysiloxane sheets were strapped on the tool’s handle and the vibration exposure was measured. The result shows that by applying the polysiloxane sheets on the <b>tool</b> <b>grinder</b> reduces the vibration magnitude by a maximum value of 38 percents. The longest vibration time exposure was recorded for 6. 42 hours, improved by 150 percents from the original vibration time exposure of 2. 52 hours.

This paper {{uses the}} grey {{relational}} analysis {{to find the}} optimal values of parameters of the servo drives and the controller of a five-axis CNC <b>tool</b> <b>grinder</b> {{in order to improve}} precision of grinding and accuracy of end mills. The experimental planning and design are based on the Taguchi method. There are totally six control factors in the experiments, and each factor has three levels. An L 18 orthogonal array was applied for the experiments, and each experiment was repeated three times. The grey relational approach was then employed to find the optimal values to the drives and the controller. These values were utilized for grinding a ball nose end mill of cemented tungsten carbide with two-flute and 6 mm in outside diameter. Finally, a well-known tool measuring and inspection machine was used to measure the geometric parameters of the end mill for the initial design and the optimal design. Experimental results show that the grinding time is reduced up to 6. 02 ％, and the precision of the ball nose end mill is also improved. Thus, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of grinding parameters to surface roughness {{in a case of}} grinding a high-speed endmill of cemented tungsten carbide using a five-axis CNC <b>tool</b> <b>grinder.</b> The values of surface roughness have a significant influence on wear resistance, lubricating capability, precision, noise and life of an endmill. Therefore, it can be served as a significant performance index for evaluating the grinding quality of tools. The grinding parameters effecting surface roughness most are grinding speed, feed rate, and grain mesh size. In this study, three levels are selected for each grinding parameter. The layout of experiments is obtained using the full factorial design. The results show that, among these three controllable grinding parameters, grain mesh size has the most significant influence on surface roughness, while grinding speed has the least. As grain mesh size is # 800, feed rate has no notable effect. In order to get a desirable minimum value for surface roughness, the optimal combination of grinding conditions is grinding speed of 1000 m/min, feed rate of 100 mm/min, grain mesh size of # 800. As for enhancing grinding efficiency, the desired combination of grinding conditions is grinding speed of 1000 m/min, feed rate of 400 mm/min, and grain mesh size of # 800...|$|E
