Stunt director Richard Talmadge employed Geraldine Chaplin to appear in a brief Keystone Cops insert. The film also proved to be young Anjelica Huston's first experience in the film industry as she was called upon by her father, John Huston, to cover the screen shots of Deborah Kerr's hands. The film also marks the debut of Dave Prowse, later the physical form of Darth Vader in the Star Wars series, as Frankenstein's monster, a role he would later play again in the Hammer films The Horror of Frankenstein and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell. John Le Mesurier features in the early scenes of the film as M's driver.|$|E

25|$|Physically, younger gymnasts, {{particularly}} {{those who have not}} yet gone through puberty, tend to be lighter, smaller, more pliable and flexible, which aids them in performing more complex skills and gives them a better strength-to-weight ratio. When a gymnast hits puberty, growth spurts and weight gain may affect her centre of gravity, causing mental and physical stress as she must adjust, and in some cases relearn, her moves to compensate. Smaller athletes have generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the evolving Code of Points after the 1960s. In addition, older gymnasts may be more prone to certain types of injuries caused by overuse of bones and muscles; younger gymnasts are less likely to have such problems, or more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> through pain while injured.|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{ended in}} 1952, and the pair went to Copenhagen, where Peter presented his findings.

He {{and his wife were}} again prohibited from entering Tibet, but this time they also faced the hostility of the Indian government. West Bengal authorities refused to allow him to collect more anthropometric data. The same year he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Danish Life Guards. Despite everything, Peter continued learning Tibetan and by 1954, he learned enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> without an interpreter. In mid-1953, the Prince once again left the Himalayas to head a commemorative expedition to Afghanistan in honour of Haslund-Christensen, but returned to the Himalayas within six weeks. In 1956, Peter was pleased to welcome his mother to his Kalimpong residence. She was invited by his wife, and the relations between the two women significantly improved.|$|E
25|$|Cao Cao, whose zone {{of control}} was the {{precursor}} {{to the state of}} Cao Wei, had raised an army in 189. In several strategic movements and battles, he controlled Yan Province and defeated several factions of the Yellow Turban rebels. This earned him the aid of other local militaries controlled by Zhang Miao and Chen Gong, who joined his cause to create his first sizable army. He continued the effort and absorbed approximately 300,000 Yellow Turban rebels into his army {{as well as a number}} of clan-based military groups from the eastern side of Qing Province. He developed military agricultural colonies (tuntian) to support his army. Although the system imposed a heavy tax on hired civilian farmers (40% to 60% of agricultural production), the farmers were more than pleased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with relative stability and professional military protection in a time of chaos.

25|$|Another {{tactical}} consideration led to operational innovation. Richthofen {{adopted the}} shuttle air tactic. In order to maximise support over the frontline, aircraft operated from bases {{near the front}} to keep and gain an advantage. It was very successful in the 1937 battles. Aircraft were sent in small formations to bomb frontline positions, while other groups of ground attack aircraft were en route and refuelling. This way a constant air presence was maintained over the battlefield which eroded the effectiveness and morale of the enemy. In order for this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> effectively, three or more sorties needed to be flown per day. This required {{a large number of}} personnel to set up and man forward airfields. At the operational level, the Luftwaffes logistics units had to be completely motorised to bring in fuel, ammunition and spare parts. These units had the opportunity to be tested under tough operational conditions. The experience in Spain had shown air transport units were invaluable to logistics, and with Richthofen's input, were expanded accordingly. By 1939, the Luftwaffe would have the largest, and most capable transport service in the World.|$|E

500|$|Merlin began {{production}} in March 2008; {{as many as}} three episodes were filmed at a time, and not necessarily in the correct order. Many scenes in Camelot were filmed in France at the Château de Pierrefonds, which was hand-picked by the production team. Castles in England had been looked at, but they were often in ruins and would require more computer-generated imagery (CGI) effects in post-production. A medieval-era road was built around Pierrefonds for some scenes to give the sense of a town, as the castle was in isolation. The execution scene {{was one of the first}} major scenes shot. As the production team had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with French extras, a bilingual crew was required. The cell Merlin is imprisoned in and the banquet hall at the end were both filmed in English stately homes, with real medieval architecture. Other studio filming took place in Wales.
