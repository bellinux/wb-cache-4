Despite Scully's usual skepticism, Mulder is intrigued because of what look like simian tracks left by the mystery attacker.|$|E

5000|$|The {{boundaries}} of Omaha have changed significantly since its founding, {{with the city}} growing through subdivisions and annexations. The following {{areas of the city}} were incorporated towns which have been annexed by the city of Omaha. Beechwood was located near the now-gone Florence Lake in East Omaha. It had its own school district, and the site is now occupied by several <b>trailer</b> <b>courts.</b> Benson is a neighborhood of north-central Omaha near 60th and Maple Streets; it was annexed in 1917. Dundee is a neighborhood in central Omaha near 50th and Dodge Streets. Originally a separate city, Dundee was annexed by Omaha in 1915, but the residents fought annexation in the courts until 1917. Elkhorn takes its name from the Elkhorn River and was incorporated by an act of the territorial legislature in 1889. It was annexed by Omaha on March 8, 2005 after a two-year court battle. [...] Elkhorn became part of Omaha on March 1, 2007. The original town site is near 204th St. and West Maple Road in West Omaha.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} month, May, was {{the deadliest}} {{month of the}} year in the U.S., with 35 fatalities from tornadoes—22 of which took place in a three-day span on May 26-29. The nation's only F5 tornado of the year struck near Valley Mills, Texas, on May 6, where it swept away a few barns, leaving little debris on the foundations. Engineers assigned an F5 rating to the tornado because it lofted a pickup truck for a considerable distance. An outbreak over Ohio on May 10 included an F3 tornado that flattened mobile homes in three <b>trailer</b> <b>courts</b> near Willard, inflicting six deaths and 100 injuries. Deadly F4 tornadoes killed a combined seven people in Oklahoma on May 24 and 26, respectively, with significant impacts to the community of Keefton. An outbreak sequence produced continuous tornado activity from May 26-29, with no gap between tornadoes exceeding six hours. A destructive nighttime tornado, or series of tornadoes, ravaged Jonesboro, Arkansas, on May 26, injuring nearly 300 people, but surprisingly with only three deaths. The next day, a long-tracked, violent tornado crossed almost 140 mi of central Alabama, obliterating most of the town of Brent, injuring about 200 people, and killing seven.|$|R

50|$|There is now five routes {{running through}} Kokomo. The Red Line goes south from the Downtown transit point and goes down Apperson Way {{making its way}} to Indian Heights where it circles the {{neighborhood}} on Council Ring Boulevard. The red line goes by Garden Square apartments, Terrace Towers, Maple Creast plaza on Washington Street, Marsh, Howard County BMV, and Indian Heights neighborhood. Then there is the Blue Line which goes from the Walmart area in the east to the K-Mart area in the west stopping at the transit center among other things in between. Its main attractions are Walmart, Planet Fitness, Meijers, Sam's Club, Hobby Lobby, the Markland Mall, Kroger, and K-Mart among other things along the way. Then there is the Green Line, and the Yellow Line which {{is run by the}} same bus and has a very similar path, the difference is the Yellow Line travels more central north picking up <b>trailer</b> <b>courts,</b> and apartment buildings, and then the Green Line travels more north and then east picking up for Ivy Tech College, Save-A-Lot, and Dollar General area up on Morgan Street. Then, finally, there is the Orange Line. Like the Red Line it also runs south, except south via Webster street, and ends up going west on some parts. Picks up for Kokomo High School, and doctor offices along Dixon Road. Some routes have transfer points with each other as well as the Downtown transfer point. The Orange, and Red lines transfer in front of Krogers at the Maple Creast plaza, and then the Blue and Red lines transfer on the corner of Apperson Way, and Markland Avenue at the national guard armory for the red line, then just a couple blocks down the Blue Line stops at Jay Street and Markland Avenue by the Marathon there.|$|R

2500|$|The Court {{also made}} {{assumptions}} about the business necessity of hiring permanent replacement workers which proved incorrect. Legal scholars, economists and others {{have pointed out that}} because most strikes are of an extremely short duration, employers do not need to hire replacements of any kind. Additionally, a large majority of businesses may operate {{for long periods of time}} without hiring permanent replacement workers by relying on managerial or supervisory personnel, temporary replacements, or workers loaned from other subsidiaries; contracting out work; or stockpiling inventory. The Court not only assumed that an employer needed to hire replacements in order continue operations but also that the employer must grant replacement workers permanent status to induce them to work. Not only is this assumption unwarranted, but the Court itself recognized this in later rulings. In Erie Resistor, Great Dane Trailers, and Fleetwood <b>Trailer,</b> the <b>Court</b> held that employer tactics which are [...] "inherently destructive" [...] of employee rights are enough to run afoul of the NLRA, and no legitimate business reasons is a defense. Yet, in Mackay Radio, hiring permanent replacements—perhaps the act most likely to be inherently destructive of those rights—is held not to be an infringement of the law. A few scholars bluntly conclude that there is no way to reconcile Mackay Radio with these three cases.|$|R

40|$|The law is {{a public}} affair. The {{involvement}} of psychiatrists and psychiatry in legal and judicial proceedings themselves, {{not to mention the}} ever-increasing media commentary, is an opportunity to educate the public, but it also entails the very real risk of compounding public misinformation and misgivings about our field. The American Psychiatric Association has both a professional staff Division of Public Affairs and a membership component, the Joint Commission on Public Affairs. Staff and members field queries from the public and the media, plan educational campaigns in collaboration with advocacy organizations, prepare and distribute fact sheets, media kits, and issue kits for members, brochures for the lay reader, booklets for important audiences including clergy, educators, and legislators, and many other resources. Given their critical influence on the lay-person's image and understanding of psychiatry, the participation of forensic psychiatrists in the public affairs activities of our major professional organization is not only welcome, but vital. As the <b>trailer</b> for the <b>Court</b> Television channel reminds us time and time again, the framers of the United States Consti-tution meant for trials to be open to the public. U. S. courtrooms were built with galleries for observers. Newspapers re-ported on sensational trials in great detail. Law has always been a public affair. But the advent of television cameras in court-rooms takes public scrutiny to a whole new level. And the role of forensic psy-chiatrists and psychiatry is also a matter of public discussion.

50|$|Meanwhile, another dispute pitting Hopkinson against Vehar {{had begun}} to brew.
