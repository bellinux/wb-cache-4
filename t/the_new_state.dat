5|$|In 1857, Deady {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the Oregon Constitutional Convention. The convention {{was held in the}} territorial capital of Salem to prepare the territory for statehood. He became president of the body and was influential in shaping <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> constitution, which outlawed slavery but excluded African-Americans from settling in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>state.</b> Deady successfully advocated for provisions in the document to set six-year terms for judges, four-year terms for state officers, and biennial sessions for the legislature. He also led the southern party, which opposed state education in all forms. During the debates Deady also advocated for discrimination towards Chinese immigrants and Blacks, as well as in favor for slavery in Oregon.|$|E

50|$|He was {{a member}} of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York <b>State</b> Assembly (Clinton Co.) in 1901 and 1902.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> {{legislature}} {{had also}} appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city to be <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed {{more than anything else}} to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E

5|$|Adams' popularity, however, was declining, and {{he decided}} not to run for reelection in 1797. A number of popular figures were raised as nominees, and in that year's election, Sumner won the vote with 15,000 {{out of a total of}} 25,000 votes cast against a divided opposition. On June 2 Sumner rode from his home in Roxbury {{accompanied}} by 300 citizens on horseback to the State House in Boston, where the Secretary of the Commonwealth proclaimed his governorship from the eastern balcony. Sumner was the last governor to preside in what is now called the Old State House as the seat of government was moved to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>State</b> House the following year.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H. Stuart, that sought Virginia's {{readmission}} to the Union. At issue was <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> constitution, which included disenfranchisement of many white males. The committee successfully negotiated with the Federal government to have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E
5|$|After these changes, the {{legislature}} of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> began to organize counties. Three 320-acre sites in Kiowa, Caddo and Comanche counties {{were selected for}} county seats, with Lawton designated as the Comanche County seat. The town was named for Major General Henry W. Lawton, a quartermaster at Fort Sill, who had taken part in the pursuit and capture of Geronimo. The city was opened to settlement through an auction of town lots beginning on August 6, 1901, which was completed 60 days later. By September 25, 1901, the Rock Island Railroad expanded to Lawton and was soon joined by the Frisco Line. The first city elections were held October 24, 1901.|$|E

5|$|As the {{northern}} tribal lands gradually opened to white settlement, Indiana's population rapidly increased {{and the center}} of population shifted continually northward. Indianapolis was selected to be the site of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> capital in 1820 because of its central position within the state. The city founders assumed the White River would serve as a major transportation artery; however, the waterway was too sandy for navigation. In 1825, Indianapolis replaced Corydon as the seat of government. The government became established in the Marion County Courthouse as the second state capital building.|$|E
5|$|Central America gained its {{independence}} along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence {{was signed in}} Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported {{the terms of the}} Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.|$|E

For the Soviets, the move was successful and Cho did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism as it would become {{the driving force of}} North Korean literature and arts.|$|E

5|$|East Timor's {{decolonization}} due {{to political}} instability in Portugal saw Indonesia posture to annex <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> in 1975. Just {{hours before the}} Indonesian invasion of East Timor (now Timor Leste) on December 7, 1975, Ford and Kissinger had visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta and guaranteed American compliance with the Indonesian operation. Suharto had been a key supporter of American influence in Indonesia and Southeast Asia and Ford did not desire to place pressure on the American-Indonesian relationship.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Nazi Germany annexed {{neighbouring}} Austria in the Anschluss; {{later that}} year it also annexed the still-separate from Bratislava Petržalka and Devín boroughs on ethnic grounds, as these had many ethnic Germans. Bratislava was declared {{the capital of the}} first independent Slovak Republic on March 14, 1939, but <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>state</b> quickly fell under Nazi influence. In 1941–1942 and 1944–1945, the new Slovak government cooperated in deporting most of Bratislava's approximately 15,000 Jews; they were transported to concentration camps, where most were killed or died {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
