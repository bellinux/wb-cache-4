25|$|Yemen is a {{developing}} country, and the poorest {{country in the}} Middle East. Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen was described by critics as a kleptocracy. According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International, Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed. In the absence of strong state institutions, elite politics in Yemen constituted a de facto form of collaborative governance, where competing tribal, regional, religious, and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced. The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal between three men: president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who controlled the state; Major General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who controlled the largest share of the Republic of Yemen Armed Forces; and Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar, figurehead of the Islamist Islah party and Saudi Arabia's chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players, including tribal sheikhs. The Saudi payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes' autonomy from the Yemeni government and to give the Saudi government a mechanism with which <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Yemen's political decision-making.|$|E

Mary Broh was cited with obstruction of justice when she intervened in Grace Kpaan's arrest and both were suspended by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. Intense public opinion and collateral damage from previous legislative clashes created a difficult position for President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who was away on government business when this situation developed.

[...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew we were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the complex issue of defining marriage {{through the lens}} of legal philosophy. Equal protection analysis and due process analysis are central tenets of marriage jurisprudence. The reluctance of the federal government or Supreme Court <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> decisively <b>on</b> the constitutionality of bans on same-sex marriage yields, on the state level, a legal landscape of considerable variety. Thus, this paper creates a scheme of classification to organize and understand the various political and judicial methods that states employ to define legal marriage. While some states view homosexual relationships with an eye of moral disapproval, others have contended that homosexual relationships are worthy of respect, dignity, and, ultimately, legal recognition. To evaluate {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} arguments for and against same-sex marriage I draw on a variety of resources including books on constitutional interpretation, law review papers, campaign materials and other items. After reconstructing the dominant legal strategies used in same-sex marriage litigation, and analyzing the most prominent arguments in the political arena, I argue that the courts should render unconstitutional state constitutional amendments or statutory schemes that define marriage as exclusively heterosexualon the basis that bans on same-sex marriage violate equal protection and due process guaranties found in the federal constitution and almost all state constitutions...|$|R

The first chapter reviews recent literature about literacy, identity, fandom, and popular culture, as well as describes the methods utilized within this dissertation project. Analyzing these television series and fans 2 ̆ 7 and critics 2 ̆ 7 responses to them, this dissertation argues that online communities provide a ripe space for community-building, as well as offer television show fans an opportunity <b>to</b> both <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> and potentially influence the production of contemporary television series. Finally, the dissertation makes a pedagogical turn, offering one practical application of the concepts explored throughout the earlier chapters in chapter four. As stated above, the introductory chapter reviews current scholarship on literacy, identity, fandom, and popular culture. This chapter also describes the methodology applied to the project. Chapter two opens with an analysis of representations of gender and literacy on the popular series Modern Family. The second half of this chapter discusses two groups 2 ̆ 7 attempts to effect change in the series 2 ̆ 7 production. Chapter three opens with {{an analysis of the}} television series Community, focusing on its treatment of the intersecting relationships among literacy, social class, and fandom within the series. The second half of this chapter describes series showrunner Dan Harmon 2 ̆ 7 s use of social media to interact with fans of the series, as well as the interactions among members of the Dan Harmon Sucks fan forum. Chapter four describes a pedagogical application of the ideas explored throughout the earlier chapters, focusing on three television show fan communities developed within a 300 -level English course at the University of Louisville. Finally, the conclusion brings together the concepts explored through the three body chapters and offers future directions for this project...|$|R

2500|$|Ecological fitting {{can explain}} aspects of species {{associations}} and community assembly, {{as well as}} invasion ecology. It is another mechanism, in addition to coevolution and in situ evolution (in which new phenotypes evolve and travel sympatrically), that can explain the creation and maintenance of species associations within a community. The phenomenon of ecological fitting helps <b>to</b> <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> {{some of the great}} debates in community ecology. [...] The Clementisian school of community ecology, {{based on the work of}} Frederic Clements, a plant ecologist who studied ecological succession, holds that communities are constructed by deterministic processes that assemble a 'superorganism' from the individual species present. With the removal or exchange of a species, the community would be unstable. [...] On the other hand, the Gleasonian view, promoted by Henry Gleason, who was also a plant ecologist studying successional communities, is more individualistic and emphasizes the role of random processes such as dispersal in community assembly. The Clementsian view would emphasize coevolution and strict niche fidelity as a major factor structuring communities, also known as the niche-assembly perspective, whereas the Gleasonian, or dispersal assembly view emphasizes neutral and historical processes, including ecological fitting. These views of community assembly raise the question: do species continue stable relationships over time, or do all individuals represent [...] "asymmetrical pegs in square holes"? [...] Some of these question can be answered through phylogenetic studies, which can determine when certain traits arose, and thus whether species interactions and community assembly occurs primarily through coevolution or through dispersal and ecological fitting. [...] Support exists for each, indicating that each has a varied role to play, depending on the community and on historical factors.|$|E
