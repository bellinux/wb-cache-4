5|$|Hart {{attended}} Princeton College, {{where his}} classmates included William Elliott from western Ontario. Elliott's {{father was a}} Loyalist who had resettled in Canada after the Revolutionary War. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> men were close enough that Elliot stayed with Hart's parents for a time to recover from a serious illness.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{historian}} R. Shaw-Smith {{points to}} letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits. Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on Gaius Asinius Gallus (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her), {{as well as}} toward <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> Caesars, Gaius and Lucius—instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.|$|E
5|$|When the {{two sons}} of {{the chief of the}} gods {{fell in love with a}} {{beautiful}} maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the cascades of the Columbia River Gorge.|$|E

5|$|Alonso and Arteta were {{ambitious and}} dreamed of playing {{alongside}} each other for Real Sociedad when they were older. Though they attended different schools, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> players joined forces at the local youth side Antiguoko, playing games at the weekend. Their performances {{attracted the attention of}} scouts from top Spanish sides and the young Donostiarras separated ways, ending nine years of friendly rivalry, as Alonso went to Real Sociedad and Arteta moved to Catalan giants Barcelona. Alonso's move to Real Sociedad, however, was not a companionless one, as his older brother Mikel, who had also become an adept player, had joined the club one year earlier.|$|E
5|$|Recorded dietary {{items include}} sago shoots and insects, {{and it also}} {{swallows}} small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently monogamous, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour. The only known nest was a shallow bowl {{in the top of}} a rotting tree stump that was lined with wood chips and dry leaves. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails. The estimated population of 3,500–15,000 birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to rice cultivation, and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav enthusiastically {{agreed to}} the Byzantine proposal. In August 967 or 968, the Rus' crossed the Danube into Bulgarian territory, {{defeated}} a Bulgarian army of 30,000 men in the Battle of Silistra, and occupied most of the Dobruja. According to the Bulgarian historian Vasil Zlatarski, Sviatoslav seized 80towns in northeastern Bulgaria. They were looted and destroyed but not permanently occupied. Tsar Peter I suffered an epileptic stroke when he received news of the defeat. The Rus' wintered at Pereyaslavets, while the Bulgarians retreated to the fortress of Dorostolon (Silistra). The next year, Sviatoslav left with part of his army to counter a Pecheneg attack on his capital at Kiev (incited either by the Byzantines or, according to the Russian Primary Chronicle, by the Bulgarians). At the same time, Tsar Peter sent a new embassy to Byzantium, a visit that was recorded by Liutprand of Cremona. In contrast to their previous reception, this time the Bulgarian envoys were treated with great honour. Nevertheless, Nikephoros, confident of his position, demanded harsh terms: Tsar Peter was to resign and be replaced by Boris, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> emperors, Basil and Constantine, were {{to be married to}} Bulgarian princesses, daughters of Boris.|$|E

5|$|The {{play has}} been widely adapted for TV and film. In 1960, Peter Ustinov's cold-war stage parody, Romanoff and Juliet was filmed. The 1961 film of West Side Story—set among New York gangs–featured the Jets as white youths, {{equivalent}} to Shakespeare's Montagues while the Sharks, equivalent to the Capulets, are Puerto Rican. The 1994 film The Punk uses both the rough plot outline of Romeo and Juliet and names many {{of the characters in}} ways that reflect the characters in the play. In 2006, Disney's High School Musical made use of Romeo and Juliet plot, placing <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> lovers in different high school cliques instead of feuding families. Film-makers have frequently featured characters performing scenes from Romeo and Juliet. The conceit of dramatising Shakespeare writing Romeo and Juliet has been used several times, including John Madden's 1998 Shakespeare in Love, in which Shakespeare writes the play against the backdrop of his own doomed love affair. An anime series produced by Gonzo and SKY Perfect Well Think, called Romeo x Juliet, was made in 2007 and the 2013 version is the latest English-language film based on the play. In 2013, Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed the Bollywood film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, a contemporary version of the play which starred Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in leading roles. The film was a commercial and critical success. In February 2014, BroadwayHD released a filmed version of the 2013 Broadway Revival of Romeo and Juliet. The production starred Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad. The film was released internationally in April 2014.|$|E

25|$|There were other, minor traditions {{concerning}} Cain and Abel, of both {{older and}} newer date.

25|$|In Bristol, Southey and Coleridge {{continued}} {{to flesh out}} their plans, and spoke openly of their radical ideas.

25|$|After Frederick {{returned}} to Germany, {{he began a}} close correspondence with Victoria. Behind this nascent friendship was the desire of Queen Victoria and her husband to forge closer ties with Prussia.

25|$|Following Hannele, Lawrence {{reconnected}} {{with her}} father, {{who was living}} with a chorus girl.

25|$|Manouchian wrote poetry and, with an Armenian {{friend who}} used the {{pseudonym}} of Séma (Kégham Atmadjian), founded two communist-leaning literary magazines, Tchank ("Effort") and Mechagouyt ("Culture").
