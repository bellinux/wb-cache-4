500|$|Systemic {{consequences}} were felt, as Enron's creditors {{and other}} energy trading companies suffered {{the loss of}} several percentage points. Some analysts felt Enron's failure indicated the risks of the post-September 11 economy, and encouraged traders to lock in profits where they could. The question now became how to determine the total exposure of the markets and other traders to Enron's failure. Early calculations estimated $18.7 billion. One adviser stated, [...] "We don't really know who is out there exposed to Enron's credit. I'm <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> clients {{to prepare for the}} worst." ...|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh admired Fishburne's {{ability to}} portray an {{emphatic}} and assertive figure in previous films. To Fishburne, Cheever was a [...] "smart", [...] "competent" [...] physician who often epitomized a [...] "voice of reason". Once he conferred with W. Ian Lipkin, a virologist {{and professor at}} Columbia University, the character's complexities were nonexistent for the actor. Fishburne stated, [...] "The personal stuff that I have as Ellis Cheever was <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> fiancée, soon-to-be wife, Sanaa Lathan, {{to get out of}} town, to leave, to pack up, to not talk. That's really easy. Any human being in that situation is going to do that, I think." ...|$|E

Tunis is mentioned by author Daniel Okrent in the dedication for The Ultimate Baseball Book {{as one of}} [...] "those responsible for the earliest roots of this project". Writer and editor Tad Richards says, [...] "I remember <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> mother... 'When I {{grow up to be}} a writer, and people ask me about the greatest influence on my writing career, I'm going to say John R. Tunis. Among Tunis' many childhood fans are sports writer and children's author Thomas J. Dygard, Pulitzer Prize finalist Lee Martin, journalist Charles Kuralt [...] and football legend Johnny Unitas. New York Post columnist and editor Pete Hamill picked The Kid From Tomkinsville as one of his five favorite sports novels, writing that [...] "virtually every sportswriter I know remembers reading it as a boy." [...] In Partial Payment: Essays on Writers and Their Lives, literary critic Joseph Epstein devotes one chapter, [...] "A Boy's Own Author", to Tunis. Epstein admits that re-reading many childhood favorites can be disappointing, but found upon revisiting Tunis that his books are [...] "pretty serious, and I was utterly absorbed in them".|$|E

2500|$|According to Swift, {{she wrote}} the song [...] "about an awkward {{situation}} where, well... Let me just preface by saying that I have happened to run into exes in strange places lately. This is about one of those situations where the strange place that I ran into him was an awards show. I was seated a couple of seats {{away from him and}} there was so much that needed to be said, and neither one of us was willing to say it. We were both acting like we were engaged in conversations with people that we don't even know. It was just miserable. I was <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> Mom about it later, and I said I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room. And then I was like, [...] "Gotta go. Bye!"

2500|$|Like all {{his other}} films, Bhansali {{preferred}} shooting at a studio. Bhansali says, [...] "I like to construct sets and then light it up. It {{is a part}} of my story <b>telling.</b> <b>My</b> story needs a setting and I like to create that ambiance." [...] Hence he chose Filmcity, Mumbai to shoot the movie. Before the actual filming started, Hrithik Roshan spent time with a lot of patients to understand his role better and get into the skin of his character. He revealed that he used to [...] ".. spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things. So if I have benefited from this experience so much, I am sure that when people see the film and understand the character, they will get a lot to learn".|$|E
2500|$|Though most of {{his works}} for the Broadway stage {{took the form of}} revues—collections of songs with no unifying plot—he did write a number of book shows. The Cocoanuts (1929) was a light comedy with a cast featuring, among others, the Marx Brothers. Face the Music (1932) was a {{political}} satire with a book by Moss Hart, and Louisiana Purchase (1940) was a satire of a Southern politician obviously based on the exploits of Huey Long. As Thousands Cheer (1933) was a revue, also with book by Moss Hart, with a theme: each number was presented as an item in a newspaper, some of them touching on issues of the day. The show yielded a succession of hit songs, including [...] "Easter Parade" [...] sung by Marilyn Miller and Clifton Webb, [...] "Heat Wave" [...] (presented as the weather forecast), [...] "Harlem on My Mind", and [...] "Supper Time", a song about racial violence inspired by a newspaper headline about a lynching, sung by Ethel Waters. She once said about the song, [...] "If one song can tell the whole tragic history of a race, 'Supper Time' was that song. In singing it I was <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> comfortable, well-fed, well-dressed listeners about my people...those who had been slaves and those who were now downtrodden and oppressed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E
