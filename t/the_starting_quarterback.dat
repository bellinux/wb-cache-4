5|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2006 season, Sanchez competed for <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>quarterback</b> position; once Booty, a junior, {{suffered}} severe back spasms caused by a pre-existing back condition, surgery was required and Sanchez was promoted to run the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recovered. Coaches stated Booty would be considered <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>quarterback</b> when he returned for fall practice. During the 2006 season, Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas, Stanford and Oregon. Through those three games, Sanchez completed 3 of his 7 pass attempts for 63 yards and one interception. He also saw additional action against Arizona, Michigan, and Notre Dame but he did not attempt a pass in those contests.|$|E

5|$|Sanchez entered spring {{practice}} {{after the}} 2008 {{season as the}} front-runner to take over <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>quarterback</b> position, but faced strong competition from redshirt freshman Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain, a transfer from Arkansas, {{where he had been}} the starting quarterback; Mustain, like Sanchez, was named the top quarterback in the nation upon the conclusion of high school career in 2006. By the end of spring practice, Carroll announced Sanchez would be <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>quarterback</b> heading into the fall. During the first week of fall camp, Sanchez dislocated his left kneecap during warm-ups prior to practice; trainers immediately put the kneecap back into place. After missing nearly three weeks, Sanchez was cleared to play in the opener against Virginia.

5|$|With the fifth-ranked {{defense in}} the SEC going up against the number-one ranked scoring {{defense in the}} nation, {{attention}} centered on {{the likelihood of a}} low-scoring defensive struggle. Of particular interest were the two teams' quarterbacks and how they would likely fare against such a tough defense. Georgia struggled on offense for much of the season, resulting in a battle for <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>quarterback</b> position between senior Joe Tereshinski and freshman Matthew Stafford. Though Stafford was eventually given the starting role, he struggled in his first year, completing 126of235passes (53.6%) for 1,620yards, with sixtouchdowns and 12interceptions heading into the Chick-fil-A Bowl. On {{the opposite side of the}} field, Virginia Tech would be starting redshirt sophomore Sean Glennon. Named <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>quarterback</b> at the beginning of the 2006 season, Glennon replaced Marcus Vick, who had been expelled from Virginia Tech at the end of the previous year. While not as statistically successful as Marcus Vick, Glennon still managed to lead the Hokies to their third consecutive 10-win season, and had the edge over Stafford in terms of experience.|$|E
