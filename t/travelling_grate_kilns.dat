40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{different}} degradation mechanisms of the stainless steel in a <b>travelling</b> <b>grate</b> in a Grate-Kiln iron ore pellet indurator. The <b>travelling</b> <b>grate</b> is a conveyor belt that transports green-body pellets to a rotary kiln while the pellets are being dried and pre-heated to a temperature of 900 - 1100 °C by recycled hot air. After unloading of the pellets to the rotary-kiln for further sintering, the <b>travelling</b> <b>grate</b> is cooled in room temperature while returning to the loading zone of the wet pellets. The steel was tested during thermal cycling in a test-rig, in order to simulate the influence of thermo mechanical fatigue and oxide spallation. The influence of erosion-deposition was investigated in a modified horizontal industrial combustion kiln at 800 °C, with slag and coal from production used as erosive media and combustion fuel, respectively. The influence of minor alloying additions of Mn, Si and Ti on the microstructure was explored by eight different casted alloy compositions. Isothermal heat treatments were performed at 800 °C during 200 hours on steel immersed in deposits recovered from a <b>travelling</b> <b>grate</b> in production. The three main degradation mechanisms found in this work are thermal spallation, erosion-deposition and deposit induced accelerated corrosion (DIAC). Thermal spallation of the oxide layer {{is caused by the}} thermal expansion difference between the oxide and the metal during heating and cooling. It has been found that Ti improves the spallation resistance while Si reduces it. Spallation of deposits is another cause believed to increase the degradation. Erosion-deposition appears due to simultaneous erosion and deposition of particles on the <b>travelling</b> <b>grate</b> that causes erosion or deposition depending on the amount of alkali metals in the environment. The velocity of the particles also influences erosion and deposition in the way that higher velocities increase erosion. DIAC is proposed to form on the <b>travelling</b> <b>grate</b> due to the concentration of chloride- and sulphate containing alkali metals in the deposits.  Other than these major degrading mechanisms, minor degradation mechanisms such as internal oxidation, sigma formation, carburization and sensitization towards inter-granular attack have been found inside the steel during heating. Thermo mechanical fatigue (TMF) causes intergranular cracks in the material of the <b>travelling</b> <b>grate.</b> Casting issues such as micro-segregation have also been addressed in this thesis. A few different ways to improve degradation resistance have been proposed, such as homogenization heat treatments, optimization of process parameters and inhibitor solutions. ...|$|R

In this thesis different aspects related to the thermochemical conversion of solid fuels in fluidized and fixed beds are treated, such as: the combustion temperature of a fuel particle related to the surrounding temperature in a fluidized bed combustor (FBC); the fuel loading in a FBC; a transient description of the conversion of non-spherical fuel particles; the thermochemical properties and composition of volatiles released from wood; the thermal conductivity of wood during different stages of conversion; the modelling of a grate furnace; the general combustion behaviour of a fixed bed on a reciprocating or a travelling grate; and finally, the design and construction of experimental units for investigation of combustion in a fixed bed. The main result is a number of sub models validated by comparison with measurements. The sub models are to be used to describe and understand various combustion behaviours. Besides the sub models derived, it is concluded that the generally accepted behaviour of combustion on a reciprocating or a <b>travelling</b> <b>grate</b> is not correct for wet biofuels. Measurements and supplementary modelling show that the ignition of the bed is not caused by reflection of radiation from specially designed arches in the furnace. Instead ignition takes place {{at the bottom of the}} bed, close to the surface of the grate. This is important for new designs of reciprocating and <b>travelling</b> <b>grates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Samarco {{produces}} {{iron ore}} pellets thermally processed in <b>Travelling</b> <b>Grate</b> furnaces. This process is essential {{in order to obtain}} adequate mechanical strength to the pellets transportation and operation in the reduction reactors. All the mechanical properties of the agglomerates are obtained during the stage of firing, being a decisive step to pellet quality. Therefore, the velocity distribution of gas flow within this zone must be homogeneous. For this reason, it was developed a mathematical CFD model to characterize the gas flow in the burning zone, applying the equations of conservation of momentum, mass and energy. The validation of the model was obtained by measuring the temperatures inside the furnace. It was developed a wireless communication system in order to monitor continuously the evolution of the temperatures in the furnace...|$|R
40|$|Iron ore pellets are a {{prepared}} burden material for ironmaking that are commonly sintered in a <b>grate</b> <b>kiln</b> furnace system. Deposited material can adhere in chunks to localised {{regions of the}} lining of such furnaces, causing lining depletion. Such deposits consist mainly of iron oxides, but alkali, alkaline earth and other oxides formed from disintegrated pellets and fly ash may also be present. In order to investigate methods of preventing such formations, tests have been performed using several different castables and coatings. Samples of liner castables with and without coatings, installed in an industrial furnace, were collected after 6 and 24 months in production use, and characterised using scanning electron microscopy to identify the materials, characterise morphological changes at the deposit-coating-lining interface, and to determine the active chemical reactions. An Al 2 O 3 based coating applied {{to one of the}} fields was found to be in good condition after 6 months in use, but no traces of the coating were observed after 24 months in use. A carbon phosphate based coating was not intact after 6 months in use; it was probably burned-up {{as a result of the}} oxidising atmosphere.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a thermodynamic model for the Grate-Kiln process. One application of such a process is the thermal treatment of iron ore pellets. The work has been performed in close collaboration with the iron ore producing company LKAB. The model is applied to assess the process in terms of heat and mass flows. The thermodynamic assessment is carried out on an overall basis and {{for each of the three}} main process parts: <b>grate,</b> <b>kiln</b> and cooler. The results reveal that the oxidation of the magnetite, contained in the inlet pellets, to hematite is the main heat source of the process. The heat release during the combustion of coal inside the kiln contributes to the remaining one third of the total heat supply. Half of the provided heat leaves the process as hot off gases. Thus, measures to improve the energy efficiency of the plant should focus on either reducing the mass flow of air that is heated by the process or making better use of the hot off gases. In order to shift the models usability towards quantitative application, different measures could be taken. Among these, improvements in the data for validation, and enhancements in the modelling of the chemical properties of the iron ore pellets promise the greatest benefits...|$|R

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} the potential global {{environmental impacts of}} fossil fuels used in power generation and other energy supplies are increasing worldwide. One of the methods of mitigating these environmental impacts is increasing the fraction of renewable and sustainable energy in the national energy usage. A number of techniques and methods have been proposed for reducing gaseous emissions of NO x, SO 2 and CO 2 from fossil fuel combustion and for reducing costs associated with these mitigation techniques. Some of the control methods are expensive and therefore increase production costs. Among the less expensive alternatives, cofiring has gained popularity with the electric utilities producers.

40|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{description of the}} thermal degradation and combustion of biomass materials is a very challenging problem, as its complexity occurs at several levels: (1) multi-component problem, with an intrinsic variability of biomass composition; (2) multi-phase problem since the biomass reacts both in the condensed and in the gas phase resulting {{in the formation of}} a solid bio-char, a liquid bio-oil, and a gas phase; (3) multi-scale problem since the intra and inter-phase transport phenomena need to be considered both at the particle and reactor scale; and (4) multi-dimensional problem since the overall system could evolve along several coordinates such as the particle radius, biomass bed, and time. This complexity is further enhanced by the need of a coupled and comprehensive approach of the transport phenomena and the detailed kinetic schemes both in the solid and gas phase. After a review of the multi-step kinetic model adopted for the pyrolysis of biomass particles, the homogeneous gas phase reactions, and the heterogeneous reactions of the residual char, this paper analyzes the mathematical model at the particle and reactor scale.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{series of}} experimental tests {{were carried out}} at the Sheffield municipal solid waste incinerator plant (30 MW) from September 1988 to July 1989 to investigate {{the influence of the}} design and operating parameters on the performance of the incinerator which burns domestic and commercial wastes (500 ton/day). The following measurements were made around the plant: temperature measurements, pressure measurements, flue gas composition analysis and determination of physical and chemical properties of Sheffield refuse. Several other miscellaneous measurements were also made to monitor the effect of variation of operating parameters on the performance characteristics of the incinerator. A combustion model of Essenhigh type was then employed to model the combustion processes inside the solid refuse bed on top of the <b>travelling</b> <b>grate.</b> In addition a mathematical model of the finite difference type (FLUENT) was used to predict the three dimensional reacting flows (gaseous phase) within the incinerator geometry.

As a result of the test data and the mathematical modelling of the whole process, suggestions for design improvements for the Sheffield municipal solid waste incinerator were made which will substantially increase the efficiency, reduce emissions of pollutants and reduce the maintenance costs at the plant.

This work aim at modelling and optimizing the drying zone of a <b>travelling</b> <b>grate</b> pelletizing plant and to start with, a model of velocity and temperature distribution in the up-draught drying zone is developed with aid of computational fluid dynamics. The velocity distribution in the porous bed is described by laws of fluid dynamics in porous media. The dominating heat transfer mechanism is convection and two energy equations are required since the porous media region contains both fluid and solid. Result from simulations show a rapid cooling of air due to the high specific surface area in the porous material. Conclusions are that it is possible to simulate convective heat transfer within a porous media in ANSYS CFX 10. 0. There are however some limitations when using the diffusive transport equation as the solid phase energy equation that need further investigation.

40|$|The modern semi-wet Lepol {{process of}} Portland Cement {{manufacture}} {{relies on a}} filter pressed, 13 - 15 % moisture, mix of clay/shale plus chalk/limestone, being first dried and then partially calcined on a <b>travelling</b> <b>grate.</b> The cement clinkering reaction then {{takes place in a}} shortened version of a conventional rotary kiln. A significant improvement in both process efficiency and clinker output is envisaged if a larger proportion of the calcination reaction could be removed from the kiln and transferred to the grate section. This process alteration, of course, needs extra heat and this can be supplied by some form of fuel injection to the grate chamber. Such a process modification is known as pre-calcining. The research described in this thesis involves the establishment of the fundamental aerodynamic mixing patterns which occur in real Lepol kilns, through the aid of a 1 : 24 th scale Perspex replica, backed-up by "cold" trials on a working prototype. These results were then used to develop a compatible coal fired burner system, which would deliver approximately 30 % of the total process heat requirement, direct to the grate calcination chamber. The flow regimes, exhibited in the model by polystyrene beads, suggested that approximately 20 % of Lepol grate area was not being utilised for heat transfer. Areas of slow moving gases were observed, their position coinciding with areas of alkali dust build up in the real kiln. These aerodynamic flow maldistributions were, effectively, cured by the installation of under grate baffles in the kiln model. The modification of the Lepol grate system to accommodate auxiliary pre-calcination firing proved to be a far more intractable problem. The high momentum flows required to ensure adequate burn out for conventional coal burners only succeeded in exasperating the existing aerodynamic problems. Oil or gas burners would have produced better results but would have been quite uneconomic, excepting only that very cheap waste fuels might have tipped the balance. The ultimate solution to the problem proved to be a vortex combustion chamber, fitted over the grate, as a source of clean, low momentum hot gases...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} investigation are to answer fundamental questions regarding the effectiveness of using concentrated solar energy as the sole heating source for the thermo-chemical decomposition of limestone-marble, supplied by Penrice, Angaston. Specifically, scientific analyses are used to investigate the energy requirements for the efficient manufacture of quicklime using solar thermal energy. To achieve these aims, the energy requirements for an industrial scale solar lime manufacturing system were first evaluated. The main conclusion from this analysis is that the thermal efficiency of a solar energy supplied lime manufacture system compares favourably with the best fossil fuelled system. A good heat recovery system {{as well as a}} comprehensive preheating system is recommended to minimise the energy losses from the system. A zero dimensional model was then used to determine that the most energy efficient shape for a <b>travelling</b> <b>grate</b> solar furnace is a triangular cross section. This shape maximise the exposure of the limestone to the radiant energy while minimising structural heat losses. This analytical evaluation also identified that the open area of entrance and exit openings, which allow the process materials to flow through the kiln and for the exhaust gases to escape the kiln, should be minimised. Thirty three times more heat flux is lost through these openings than through the kiln structure. Minimising the openings area therefore improves kiln thermal efficiency. This investigation then evaluated the maximum bed thickness for the limestone when using a grate bed system within the proposed solar furnace. Due to the nature of radiation it is recommended that the limestone layer be no thicker than 2. 5 times the nominal diameter of the limestone in use. This thickness optimises the exposure of the stone to the direct radiation and increases the heat transfer to the stones lower within the bed and allows for the unrestricted diffusion of CO 2 away from these stones. The investigation then experimentally quantified the effects of radiant heat flux intensity on the calcination kinetics of the Penrice, Angaston marble as a function of stone size. This experimental investigation involved comparing results from an electric muffle furnace, an atmospherically open solar radiation furnace, and an enclosed triangular shaped solar radiation furnace. The muffle furnace provided a baseline values to which the solar calcination rates could be compared. The open system solar calcination experiments showed that the preheating time of the stone is directly proportional to the illuminated surface area of the stone and the intensity of the heat flux to which it is exposed. Additionally, the reaction rate is directly proportional to the radiant heat flux, and is independent of the stone size for heat fluxes greater than 430 kW/m 2. The enclosed solar furnace experiments identified a 45 % improvement in decomposition time could be achieved by using the triangular shaped solar furnace compared to the open solar system calcination. This benefit to the calcination time is best for the more intense heat fluxes and for the larger stone sizes. The measured calcination times were similar to those found for a conventional rotary kiln. This demonstrates the practicalities of using solar radiation technology for interchange with, or as a supplementary heating source to, a combustion driven lime manufacturing industrial plant. A multi-zone two dimensional mathematical model was then used to evaluate the radiant heat exchange within the triangular solar furnace. The developed mathematical scheme provides a comprehensive package with a validated base model for future evaluations of solar furnace designs. A modified shrinking core calcination model was then developed, which uses an energy balance approach to calculate the preheating times and calcination rates for the Penrice marble exposed to various intensities of radiant heat flux. This version of the heat transfer based shrinking core model was used after considering the one sided heating of the stone from the point source radiation. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} to studypollution reduction in the manufacturing phase and heat transfer in the packed beds of iron ore pellets. CFD is a versatile tool that can be applied to study numerous problems in fluid mechanics. In the present thesis it is used, verified and validated to reveal the fluid mechanics of a couple of processes taking place during the drying and sintering of iron ore pellets. This is interesting in itself and can facilitate the optimization of the production as to product quality of the pellets, reduced energy consumption and reduction of emissions such as NOx and CO 2. The practical aim with the pollution reduction research project is to numerically study the use of Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technologies in gratekiln pelletizing plants for NOx reduction which had, to the best knowledge of the author, never been used in this context before despite that it is commonly used in cement and waste incineration plants. The investigation is done in several stages: 1) Reveal if it is possible to use the technique with the two most commonly reagents, ammonia and urea. 2) Derive a chemistry model for cyanuric acid (CA) so that this reagent also can be scrutinized. 3) Compare the reagents urea and CA in the gratekiln pelletizing process. A CFD model was developed and numerical simulations were carried out solving the flow field. A model for spray injection into the grate was then included in the model enabling a study of the overall mixing between the injected reagent droplets and the NOx polluted air. The results show that the SNCR technique with urea and CA may reduce the amount of NOx in the grate-kiln process under certain conditions while ammonia fails under the conditions investigated. The work also lays grounds for continued development of the proposed chemistry model by the adding of reactions to the RAPRENOx-process for CA as reagent, facilitating an extension to ammonia and urea as reagents. The grate-kiln plant consists of a <b>grate,</b> a rotating <b>kiln</b> and an annular cooler. The pellets are loaded onto the grate to shape a bed with a mean height of about 0. 2 m. The pellets in LKABs processes consist mainly of magnetite and different additives chosen to fit the demand from the customer. Throughout the grate a temperature gradient is formed in the bed. This gradient should be as even as possible throughout the grate to ensure an even quality of the pellets. Method to study this numerically is the second main task in this thesis. The aim is to find out how temperature distributions in the bed can be modeled and adjusted. Of special interest is how the incoming process gas, leakage, and the detailed composition of the pellet bed influence the heat transfer through the bed. To achieve the goals and create a trustful model for the heat transfer through the packed bed the model must be build up in steps. Heat transfer to a bed of iron ore pellets is therefore examined numerically on several scales and with three methods: a one-dimensional continuous model, a discrete three-dimensional model and traditional computational fluid dynamics. In a first study the convective heat transport in a relatively thin porous layer ofmonosized particles is set-up and computed with the one-dimensional continuous model and the discrete three-dimensional model. The size of the particles is only one order of magnitude smaller than the thickness of the layer. For the three-dimensional model the methodology applied is Voronoi discretization with minimization of dissipation rate of energy. The discrete model captures local effects, including low heat transfer in sections with low speed of the penetrating fluid and large velocity and temperature variations in a cross section of the bed. The discrete and continuousmodel compares well for low velocities for the studied uniform boundary conditions. When increasing the speed or for a thin porous layer however, the continuous model diverge from the discrete approach if a constant dispersion is used in the continuous approach. The influence is larger from an increase in pellet diameter to bed height ratio than from increased velocity. In a second study the discrete model is compared to simulations performed with CFD. If local values are of importance the discrete model should always be used but if mean predictions are sufficient the CFD model isan attractive alternative that is easy to couple to the physics up- and downstream the packed bed. The good agreement between the discrete and continuous model furthermore indicates that the discrete model may be used also for non-Stokian flow in the transitional region between laminar and turbulent flow, as turbulent effects show little influence of the overall heat transfer rates in the continuous model.
