5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. <b>Twenty</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E

5|$|<b>Twenty</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> the 16 Zuikaku torpedo planes {{arrived and}} split up to attack Enterprise. One group of torpedo bombers was {{attacked}} by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft purposely crashed into the destroyer , setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The torpedo carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. The fires initially seemed out of control until Smiths commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship , which helped put out the fires. Smith then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the torpedo planes.|$|E
5|$|At 07:50, Cota led {{the charge}} off of Dog Green, between WN-68 and WN-70, by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters. <b>Twenty</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> the 5th Rangers joined the advance, and blew more openings. The command party {{established}} themselves {{at the top of}} the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east. Before 09:00, small parties from F/116 and B/116 reached the crests just east of Dog White. The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers’ A and B companies, who had independently fought their way to the top between 08:00 and 08:30. They took WN-70 (already heavily damaged by naval shells), and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland. By 09:00 more than 600 American troops, in groups ranging from company sized to just a few men, had reached the top of the bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and <b>twenty</b> <b>minutes</b> depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> and possibly up to <b>twenty</b> <b>minutes</b> later; it would then take a further five to <b>twenty</b> <b>minutes</b> for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|R

25|$|Despite Lieutenant-Colonel Niemeyer's {{frank and}} pessimistic area briefings, Schmidt {{severely}} underestimated the build-up and capabilities of Soviet forces at Stalingrad following the initial Axis successes, a failing that he – unlike Paulus – subsequently {{did not attempt}} to excuse.

Many false reports of the massing of Soviet forces were received from the Romanian sector, so when Stöck radioed at 5 a.m. on 19 November that an offensive (marking the start of Operation Uranus, the Soviet encirclement of Axis forces) was about to begin, Schmidt, who was furious when disturbed by false alarms, was not informed, although he was awoken <b>twenty</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> {{when it became clear that}} this was no false alarm.|$|E
