40|$|Complex dynamic {{models of}} carbon and {{nitrogen}} {{are often used}} to investigate the consequences of climate change on agricultural production and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. These models require high temporal resolution input data regarding the timing of field operations. This paper describes the Timelines model, which predicts the timelines of key field operations across Europe. The evaluation of the model {{suggests that it is}} broadly capable of simulating the timing of field operations for a range of arable crops at different locations. Systematic variations in <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> and in the timing of the first application of N fertiliser to winter crops need to be corrected and the prediction of soil workability and trafficability might enable the prediction of ploughing and applications of solid manure in preparation for spring crops.

40|$|International audienceCotyledonary somatic embryos (SEs) of {{maritime}} pine are routinely matured for 12 weeks before being germinated and converted to plantlets. Although regeneration success is {{highly dependent on}} SEs quality, <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> is currently determined mainly {{on the basis of}} morphological features. This empirical method does not provide any accurate information about embryo quality with respect to storage compounds (proteins, carbohydrates). We first analyzed SEs matured for 10, 12 and 14 weeks by carrying out biological (dry weight, water content) and biochemical measurements (total protein and carbohydrate contents). No difference could be found between collection dates, suggesting that harvesting SEs after 12 weeks is appropriate. Cotyledonary SEs were then compared to various stages, from fresh to fully desiccated, in the development of cotyledonary zygotic embryos (ZEs). We identified profiles that were similar using hierarchical ascendant cluster analysis (HCA). Fresh and dehydrated ZEs could be distinguished, and SEs clustered with fresh ZEs. Both types of embryo exhibited similar carbohydrate and protein contents and signatures. This high level of similarity (94. 5 %) was further supported by proteome profiling. Highly expressed proteins included storage, stress-related, late embryogenesis abundant and energy metabolism proteins. By comparing overexpressed proteins in developing and cotyledonary SEs or ZEs, some (23 proteins) could be identified as candidate biomarkers for the late, cotyledonary stage. This is the first report of useful generic protein markers for monitoring embryo development in {{maritime pine}}. Our results also suggest that improvements of SEs quality may be achieved if the current maturation conditions are refined...|$|E

40|$|As long as new {{rootstocks}} {{continue to}} be developed, there will always {{the need for new}} genotypes to be controlled and evaluated. This study involves verification of selected rootstocks with reference to growth, propagation ability and other characteristics. Different rootstocks, different growth stimulators and different kinds of cuttings techniques were adopted for these experiments. Stimulators used for evaluations included: 1 % Racine (2. 5 % naphthalene acetic acid - NAA), 0. 5 % Rhizopon AA (2. 5 % indole- 3 -butyric acid - IBA) and 0. 25 % IBA in 50 % ethanol solution. There were three sets of experiments in all. In Experiment 1, the bases of cuttings were treated with the stimulators and part of them was also treated with heat before planting. Results from Experiment 1 indicated that cuttings treated with Rhizopon AA produced the best effect after heat treatment (with an overall average of 36. 9 % of rooted cuttings). Pyrodwarf (78. 7 %), Cydomalus (73. 9 %) and Pyroplus (60. 6 %) were the best performing rootstocks among the evaluated ones. In Experiment 2, we evaluated the influence of <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> the cuttings on rooting (comparisons were made between cuttings prepared in December [early] and March [late]). For BA 29 rootstock cuttings, the best performance was attained by cuttings taken in March. The difference in rooting between March and December was 43. 9 %. On the other hand, early harvested rootstocks (cuttings taken in December) for Cydomalus showed the best performance, with an 18. 7 % difference between cuttings made in December and in March. Results from other evaluated rootstocks were not significant enough. In Experiment 3, the effect of chemical (phytohormone) stimulation and heat stimulations was compared. The best result was obtained by combinations of treatments without heat stimulations, when the cuttings were stored at 5 °C and later treated with 0. 25 % IBA in 50 % ethanol solution. The least rooting results, on the other hand, were observed in heat treated cuttings, in cuttings stimulated with IBA and subsequently with heat and in cuttings treated with a 3 cm radial cut at the base. Based on our findings we cannot prove clearly that heat stimulation and the phytohormones used have beneficial effects on rooting of especially new rootstock genotypes with an unknown propagation coefficient. This means that propagation using cuttings still remains an interesting topic to be further researched...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} focused on the issues of {{economic}} evaluation of Miscanthus cultivation on agricultural land in the Czech Republic. The methodology of economic assessment is based on the calculation of minimum production cost - minimum price of heat in EUR/GJ of heat in biomass. The minimum production cost represents the threshold of economic efficiency of production for the investor and its determination utilizes an economic model capturing all processes related to the cultivation of biomass for energy purposes. Miscanthus vegetation is considered for the production of biomass for direct combustion (a so-called spring harvest after the winter). Input data used in the model come from the experimentally collected data from the research plots of Miscanthus and from the market valuation of the individual activities using 2010 prices.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 This {{thesis is}} an attempt to develop a {{theoretical}} microeconomic model which can be used to examine the short-run demand for the timeliness of farm machinery repairs. This analysis focuses on the timing of the repair after a breakdown has occurred. The nonstochastic model developed allows the incorporation of the timing of the repair as a variable input into a production function. A yield function (a function which gives the instantaneous rate of output in bushels per acre as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest)</b> is used in deriving this production function. From the production function a demand curve for the timeliness of repairs can be derived. A constrained input demand curve (CIDC) is used to examine the demand for timely repairs. A specific functional form of the yield function is used in order to allow an easier examination of how various parameters affect the CIDC. Several testable hypotheses which result from the model are presented. An attempted test of one of the hypotheses is discussed...|$|R

Berry growth and major solutes are routinely measured on a mix of randomly sampled berries, in order to characterize the advancement of ripening at the vineyard scale, and optimize <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> {{with respect to the}} specific conditions of the millesime. Most if not all knowledge on grape berry metabolism emerged from this procedure. Since berries do not ripen simultaneously, averaging induces a statistical bias leading tounderestimation of water, sugars and organic acids fluxes in individual berries. Moreover, detachment of fruits not only blocks sugar import whose speed, even underestimated, largely exceeds the measured variable, but also reverses the direction of vacuolar transport. The influence of temperature {{on the nature of the}} respiratory substrate and on global carbon balance needs to be revisited because of these two possible artefacts. This preliminary study aims at evaluating the heterogeneity of developing berries and to decipher the relations between growth, sugar storage, and malate breakdown, at the cluster and berry levels, rather than on the average population. The scattering of sugars and malic acid concentrations shows that heterogeneity among berries is maximal at veraison. Berry volume shows considerable variationwithin and between clusters and doubles during the first period of sugar accumulation, while malate disappears. Sugar accumulation then continues at a constant volume (rate?), and its concentration tends to homogenize during this process, whilemalate content is maintained at a very low value. Finally, phloem unloading completely stops and sugars concentrate as the result of shriveling, malate being totally exhausted at this stage. Preliminary results on respiration show that stopping phloem unloading would increase the O 2 demand by 25 %...|$|R

Banana plants (totaling 80) at the flowering stage were selected in an experimental plot. These plants were divided into two groups of SD infestation levels: level 1 (Severity Index at flowering 25 %). We divided each group into two treatments: a treatment with no necrotic leaf removal and a treatment with necrotic leaf removal. Fruits were harvested at the same physiological age, at 900 degree-days. Fruit quality was characterized by weight, diameter, % of ripe fruit in the field and fruit green life. Results. Our results showed that the removal of necrotic leaves causes a reduction in size parameters but leads to a strong reduction in SD effects on the fruit maturity, thereby preventing premature ripening. Banana plants whose necrotic leaves were removed produced fruit with a very long green life. Discussion. Removal of necrotic leaves allows thwarting the negative effect of SD on fruit physiology. This shows that the presence of necrosis during the last month of fruit growth is responsible for this fruit physiological modification characterized by early ripening. Conclusion. Removal of necrotic leaves one month before <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> may be a technique that can limit production losses when the infestation level by SD is high.

40|$|Sweet sorghum is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} C 4 grass noted for its improved drought tolerance and water use efficiency relative to sugarcane. Sweet sorghum is well suited for ethanol production due to a rapid growth rate, high biomass production, and {{a wide range of}} adaptation. Unlike the 12 - 18 month growth cycle of sugarcane, sweet sorghum produces a harvestable crop in three to five months. Sweet sorghum and sugarcane crops are complementary and in combination can extend the sugar mill seasons in many regions of the world to an estimated 8 months. Seasonal growth and weather patterns both optimize and restrict production of each crop to specific times of the year, however these are different for the two crops. In addition to temporally spacing <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> between crops, <b>the</b> genetic variability of maturity within the crops may also be used to extend the mill seasons; specific hybrids can be used and selected to maximize yield throughout the harvest season. Under favorable growing environments, sweet sorghum hybrids of all maturity groups produced sugar yields ranging from 2. 8 to 4. 9 MT/ha. Early/medium, late, and very late maturity hybrids planted during April, May, and June planting dates are necessary to maximize the mill season. In this study, early/medium maturity hybrids planted during April and May matured for harvest between late July and mid-August. June planting dates were unfavorable for early/medium maturity hybrids. In addition, late and very late maturity hybrids planted during April matured for harvest in late August; the additional growing season thus resulted in higher sugar yields. Timely planting of late and very late maturity hybrids in April, May, and June produce the maximum yields for harvests after mid August. Intermittent use of late and very late maturity hybrids can therefore extend sugar milling seasons into mid November if so desired...|$|R

40|$|Four of five apple cultivars (Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, McIntosh, Macoun, and Melrose) inoculated with Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 {{promoted}} {{growth of}} the bacterium in bruised tissue independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> (i. e., degree of apple ripening) or {{the source of the}} apple (i. e., tree-picked or dropped fruit). Apple harvest for this study began 4 September 1998 and ended 9 October, with weekly sampling. Throughout this study, freshly picked (< 2 days after harvest) McIntosh apples usually prevented the growth of E. coli O 157 :H 7 for 2 days. Growth of E. coli O 157 :H 7 did occur following 6 days of incubation in bruised McIntosh apple tissue. However, the maximum total cell number was approximately 80 -fold less than the maximum total cell number recovered from Red Delicious apples. When fruit was stored for 1 month at 4 °C prior to inoculation with E. coli O 157 :H 7, all five cultivars supported {{growth of the}} bacterium. For each apple cultivar, the pH of bruised tissue was significantly higher and °Brix was significantly lower than the pH and °Brix of undamaged tissue regardless of the source. In freshly picked apples, changes in the pH did not occur over the harvest season. Bruised Golden Delicious, McIntosh, and Melrose apple tissue pHs were not significantly different (tree-picked or dropped), and the °Brix values of McIntosh, Macoun, and Melrose apple tissue were not significantly different. Single-cultivar preparations of cider did not support growth of E. coli, and the cell concentration of inoculated cider declined over an 11 -day test period. The rate of decline in E. coli cell concentration in the McIntosh cider was greater than those in the other ciders tested. The findings of this study suggested that the presence of some factor besides, or in addition to, pH inhibited E. coli growth in McIntosh apples...|$|R
40|$|Vegetative {{growth rate}} is a {{physiological}} trait {{that has been}} hypothesized to be useful in the improvement of grain yield in cereal crops. Usefulness of this physiological trait in a breeding program depends upon a rapid method that allows the evaluation {{of large numbers of}} lines. In this study, the objective was to determine if the rates of growth calculated from periodic samplings could be estimated by using only one or two <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> relating to specific stages in the plant's development. Periodic samples of vegetative growth were made on 19 pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum) genotypes, plus three weedy (ssp. stenostachyum) and one wild (ssp. monodii) accession in two seasons once every 2 weeks starting at 21 days after emergence and continuing to maturity. With use of the rates calculated on these periodic samples as the actual growth rate, it was found that samples taken at either one or two <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> could be used to adequately estimate this rate. <b>The</b> two <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> were taken at either 10 days after flowering or at maturity. The rate was calculated as (vegetative dry weight at flowering + 10 days or at maturity) /(number of days to flowering + 10) ...|$|R
40|$|Lotus flowers (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) {{are sold}} as stems with {{terminal}} buds {{that are about}} to open, {{to be used in}} Buddhist religious offerings. The buds fail to open if the cut stems are placed in water. Moreover, the petals rapidly turn black. This study investigated whether this might be {{due to a lack of}} carbohydrates. The inclusion of different sugars in the vase water, together with an adequate antimicrobial compound, had no effect on petal blackening and did not promote flower opening. By contrast, cutting the buds at a slightly more mature stage of development resulted in full flower opening. However, the levels of glucose, fructose, or sucrose in the white petals were the same at <b>the</b> later <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> as at <b>the</b> earlier date; thus, this did not explain the effect of cutting at an advanced stage of development. It was concluded that a lack of sugars does not seem to explain petal blackening or a lack of flower opening in lotus flowers that are cut at the normal harvest stage (bud stage) ...|$|R
40|$|Market gardeners {{are facing}} new environmental, {{commercial}} and safety requirements {{and regulations that}} weigh heavily on their crop planting and management decisions. Producing high-quality products and simultaneously reducing the use of chemical products needs change in the multi-field planning of crops. In order to identify which cropping practice may be altered depending on each farm's characteristics, we built a rule-based model that represents how market gardeners plan cropping cycles of lettuce and endive, here denoted as salad vegetables, on a farm scale. The model is adapted to the specificities of salad vegetable crops in the Mediterranean region, in particular the combination of several cycles per year and of open field and sheltered crops. The output variables are the developed areas allocated to the different salad types and <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>harvest</b> <b>dates,</b> which are two key factors for commercialisation. The model is based on identifying the successive decision steps of growers when building their farming systems; descriptive variables are the effective surface area and period for salad cultivation, the number of salad cycles per year, the developed surface area of each salad type and <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest.</b> <b>The</b> decision-making rules leading to each descriptive variable {{are based on the}} agronomic characteristics of soil, climate and crops, farmers' strategic objectives and organisation of farm resources. The cropping decisions were recorded in 38 farms in the large market-gardening region of Languedoc-Roussillon. In the sample, the number of salad types cultivated per farm varied from 1 to 8 and the harvesting period from 3 to 7 months. Our results demonstrate that the model can explain a substantial part of this variability, 26 and 28 farms among 38, respectively, being correctly classified by the model for the two variables. The original result of this work is to enhance the generality of a similar framework built earlier for arable cropping systems. From a practical point of view, this model can be used to determine the leeway available to the farmers for the introduction of technical change in salad cropping. It could therefore be used by agricultural advisors to plan salad crops either for individual farms or on the scale of a marketing structure...|$|R
