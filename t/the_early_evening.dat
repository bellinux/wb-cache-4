5|$|The 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado (locally {{referred}} to as the May 3 tornado) was a very powerful F5 tornado in which the highest wind speeds ever measured globally, , were recorded by a Doppler on Wheels (DOW) radar. The tornado devastated southern portions of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, along with surrounding suburbs and towns during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> of May 3, 1999. Throughout its 85-minute existence, the tornado covered , destroying thousands of homes, killing 36 people (plus an additional five indirectly), and leaving US$1 billion in damage, ranking it as the fifth-costliest on record, not accounting for inflation.|$|E
5|$|The British 3rd Division {{brushed aside}} 16th Luftwaffe and {{approached}} the outskirts of Caen from the north-east. At 19:15, Meyer and Eberbach authorised {{the withdrawal of the}} 12th SS Panzer Division heavy weapons and the remnants of the Luftwaffe division across the Orne to the southern side of Caen. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> the 12th SS fought a rearguard action against elements of the 59th and 3rd Canadian divisions, as it pulled back from positions no longer considered tenable. Reports of this withdrawal came into the Anglo-Canadian command but patrols probing German positions, created a false perception that no withdrawal was taking place.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the French Republic {{in the early spring}} of 1793, the French Revolutionary Wars were already a year old. The French Navy was already suffering from the upheavals of the French Revolution and the consequent dissolution of the professional officer class, while the Royal Navy had been at a state of readiness since the summer of 1792. During the early months of the war the French Navy focused heavily on raiding and disrupting British commerce and deployed frigates on raiding operations against British commercial shipping. In the English Channel, two of the most successful raiders were the frigates Réunion and Sémillante, based in Cherbourg on the Cotentin Peninsula. These frigates would make short cruises, leaving Cherbourg in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> and returning in the morning with any prizes they had encountered during the night.|$|E
5|$|British {{forces were}} ordered {{withdrawn}} {{a few days}} later. The evacuation (Operation Alphabet) began in the north {{on the night of}} 3/4 June, and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 Squadron and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 823 Squadron for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. This {{was the first time that}} high performance monoplanes without tailhooks had been landed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> Hare {{took the}} stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> {{at around}} 5pm, Malone {{was killed in}} his {{headquarters}} trench by friendly fire, either from supporting artillery or possibly naval gunfire. Reinforcements, {{in the form of}} the Otago Battalion and two squadrons of the Wellington Mounted Rifles arrived later that evening, and the remnants of Malone's battalion withdrew, having suffered 690 men killed or wounded of its original complement of 760. Malone, along with 300 of his men, has no known grave. Two days later, Chunuk Bair, now held by British units, was lost to the Turks. With the battalion out of the line, a memorial service for Malone was held on 21 August. The service was attended by nearly all of the surviving men of the battalion. Malone was also mentioned in despatches for his leadership during the August offensive.|$|E
5|$|Loire and Sémillante {{had escaped}} from the battle into Black Sod Bay, where they hoped to hide until they had a clear passage back to France. However, late on 15 October, a British frigate {{squadron}} under James Newman-Newman rounded the southern headland of the bay, forcing the French ships to flee to the north. Pressing on sail in pursuit, Newman ordered HMS Révolutionaire to focus on Sémillante whilst he pursued Loire in HMS Mermaid, accompanied by the brig HMS Kangaroo under Commander Edward Brace. Loire and Sémillante separated to divide their pursuers; Mermaid and Kangaroo lost track of Loire in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> and Sémillante evaded Révolutionaire after dark.|$|E

5|$|The 1899 New Richmond Tornado was an {{estimated}} EF5 tornado which formed on <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> of June 12, 1899 and tore a 45-mile long path of destruction through St. Croix, Polk and Barron counties in west-central Wisconsin, leaving 117 people dead, {{twice as many}} injured and hundreds homeless. The worst devastation wrought by the tornado was at the city of New Richmond, Wisconsin, which took a direct hit from the storm. Over half the town was left in ruins by the tornado, which also caused lesser damage to several other communities in the area. More than $300,000 (USD) ($ in today's dollars) in damage was reported. Today, it ranks as the ninth deadliest tornado in United States history, {{as well as the}} deadliest ever recorded in Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Cruiser Squadron was tasked {{to protect}} Allied {{merchant}} shipping from commerce raiders in the Caribbean {{and along the}} East Coast of North America and Craddock dispersed his ships shortly before the war began on 4 August 1914 in a futile search for the two German warships known {{to be in the}} area. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> of 6 August, Bristol spotted the German light cruiser , but failed to inflict any significant damage before engine problems allowed the German ship to disengage behind her own smoke. Later in the month, Bristol began patrolling off the northern coast of Brazil in an unsuccessful attempt to find the German ships. The ship was detached to continue to patrol the Brazilian coast and did not join Craddock's ships as they searched for the East Asia Squadron off the Chilean coast in October.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm that}} would produce the EF5 Greensburg tornado began forming after 5:00 pm CDT (2200 UTC) {{in the northeastern}} corner of the Texas Panhandle, and went through phases in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> across the Oklahoma Panhandle with a few {{isolated}} tornadoes. It slowly organized itself as it moved northeast through portions of Oklahoma, and then into Kansas. The first tornado warning with this cell was issued at 8:35 pm CDT (0135 UTC) for Clark County, Kansas, and the tornado first touched down at about 9:00 pm CDT (0200 UTC). Several storm chasers captured {{the formation of a}} tornado southwest of Greensburg around 9:20 pm CDT (0220 UTC).|$|E

5|$|Tornado watches {{were also}} issued for the Lower Great Lakes in the {{afternoon}} hours, and supercells began to track across southern Michigan in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening.</b> Two tornadoes touched down in Michigan and caused damage to farm structures. Further east, severe thunderstorms caused scattered wind damage and large hail across Pennsylvania and New York. Two-inch-diameter hail was reported in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. An isolated supercell moved across Central New York {{throughout much of the}} afternoon, producing golf ball-sized hail in Syracuse, and spawned a very brief EF1 tornado in Verona Mills, causing primarily tree damage. Another tornado in Gilbertsville caused significant damage to an athletic field at a school.|$|E
5|$|Within the BWCAW are {{hundreds}} of prehistoric pictographs and petroglyphs on rock ledges and cliffs. The BWCAW {{is part of the}} historic homeland of the Ojibwe people, who traveled the waterways in canoes made of birch bark. Prior to Ojibwe settlement, the area was sparsely populated by the Sioux, who migrated westward following the arrival of the Ojibwe. It is thought that the Hegman Lake Pictograph located on a large overlooking rock wall on North Hegman Lake were most likely created by the Ojibwe. The pictograph appears to represent Ojibwe meridian constellations visible in winter during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> knowledge of which may have been useful for navigating in the deep woods during the winter hunting season. The Grand Portage Indian Reservation, just east of the BWCAW at the community of Grand Portage, is home to a number of Ojibwe to this day.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> of 23 November 1963, at {{a market}} in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed {{to get into the}} Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

5|$|Advancing northward over land, the once-powerful {{hurricane}} weakened, with {{somewhat higher}} atmospheric pressures and winds of less severity reported at Charleston, South Carolina. Paralleling the coast while situated inland, it hastened quickly toward the north, swiftly passing through North Carolina and {{arriving in the}} Chesapeake Bay region by 13October. Southeasterly gusts persisted as the storm continued its northerly progression inland along {{the course of the}} East Coast of the United States. After reaching Washington, D.C., in the early morning, it arrived near New York City by sunrise, and transited across Boston during the afternoon of 13October. The storm likely underwent an extratropical transition by the time it arrived in New York state, elongating linearly east-to-west. The gale's winds swept toward the southeast with a brief hiatus in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening.</b> As it neared New England, it produced little precipitation yet intense gusts, which peaked at force9-strength in the vicinity of New Bedford, Massachusetts. The cyclone's diameter over New England, at its largest point, reached , accompanied by Category2-force winds. The system was last sighted on the morning of 14October, rapidly weakening as it meandered into the Canadian Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|By 09:00 hours, the II SS Panzer Corps {{had broken}} through the Soviet first belt of defence along its entire front. While probing {{positions}} {{between the first}} and second Soviet defensive belts, at 13:00, the 2nd SS Panzer Division's vanguard came under fire from two T-34 tanks, which were destroyed. Forty more Soviet tanks soon engaged the division. The 1st Guards Tank Army clashed with the 2nd SS Panzer Division in a four-hour battle, resulting in the Soviet tanks withdrawing. However, the battle had bought enough time for units of the 23rd Soviet Guards Rifle Corps, lodged in the Soviet second belt, to prepare itself and be reinforced with additional anti-tank guns. By <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening,</b> 2nd SS Panzer Division had reached the minefields that marked the outer perimeter of the Soviet second belt of defence. The 1st SS Division had secured Bykovka by 16:10. It then pushed forward towards the second belt of defence at Yakovlevo, but its attempts to break through were rebuffed. By the end of the day, the 1st SS Division had sustained 97 dead, 522 wounded, and 17 missing and lost about 30 tanks. Together with the 2nd SS Panzer Division, it had forced a wedge far into the defences of the 6th Guards Army.|$|E
5|$|The 9th SS Panzer Division {{spent the}} day {{attempting}} to force the British lines between Rauray and the Odon. Supplemented by Panzergrenadiers of the 2nd SS Panzer Division and following a preliminary bombardment, tanks and infantry of 9th SS Panzer advanced behind a smoke screen and broke through the outer British defences. The Germans were stopped by secondary positions in front of Rauray and on high ground to the south-east, although some troops penetrated as far as Haut du Bosq. Further German attacks throughout the day, were met with intense artillery fire and made no progress, in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>evening</b> a British counter-attack with Sherman and flame-throwing Churchill Crocodile tanks restored the original front line. The attacks were costly for both sides, thirty German tanks were claimed destroyed, mostly by the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, troops of the 12th SS Panzer Division had been repulsed during the morning and artillery fire halted attacks from other formations.|$|E
