25|$|There {{was a war}} scare in May 1906 {{when the}} Turks {{occupied}} an old Egyptian fort {{at the head of}} the Gulf of Aqaba. Wilson noted that Grierson (Director of Military Operations) and Lyttelton (“absolutely incapable … positively a dangerous fool”) had approved the proposed scheme for military action, but neither the Adjutant-General nor the Quartermaster-General had been consulted. Repington wrote to Esher (19 Aug 1906) that Wilson was an “intriguing impostor” and “a low-class schemer whose sole aptitude is for worshipping rising suns – an aptitude expressed by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> in more vulgar language”. On 12 September 1906 Army Order 233 finally set up a General Staff to supervise education and training and to draw up war plans (Wilson had drafted an Army Order late in 1905, but it had been held up by disputes over whether staff officers should be appointed by the Chief of the General Staff as Wilson preferred or by an eleven-man selection board).|$|E
500|$|Plumb is reticent about {{discussing}} his accomplishments, but colleagues {{have referred to}} him as the [...] "ultimate team member" [...] who could be counted on to {{be at the top of}} his game and a consistent performer. As team captain at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, he was noted for helping his teammates understand everything that was going on around them. His athleticism and personal courage have been praised by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> such as Michael Page, chef d’equipe for the 1986 US World Championship team, who recounted how Plumb medaled at the competition despite three broken ribs. Plumb admits to being completely focused on riding and [...] "not a social person", with former coach Jack le Goff saying that [...] "horses are his only reason for being on earth".|$|E

500|$|Due to his immense {{popularity}} {{during his}} lifetime, Holmes was {{often called upon}} to produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once wrote that he was [...] "a florist in verse, and what would people say / If I came to a banquet without my bouquet?" [...] As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, [...] "very little... survives the occasions that produced it". Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, as well as one who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be [...] "a poet of sentiment and passion. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> only as a comic lyricist, as the libellous laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, would be surprised at the clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions".|$|E
500|$|Henry married Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont in February 1575, {{two days}} after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a {{political}} marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal nuncio Salviati observed, [...] "it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring... physicians and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> well {{say that he has}} an extremely weak constitution and will not live long." [...] As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, Francis, Duke of Alençon, known as [...] "Monsieur", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion. Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.|$|E

6000|$|A CRITICISM OF BROWNING. Comparatively {{few people}} {{appreciate}} the force, the daring, {{the vitality of}} Browning, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> best are least inclined to formulate a favorable criticism.
