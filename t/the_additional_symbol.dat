Such connections, in comparison to seven symbol codes, require substantially more energy to complete a functional wormhole – much more than any standard dialing method can provide. In the first instance, opening an intergalactic wormhole is shown to exceed the total power generation capacity of the SGC at the time. O'Neill fashioned an additional power source using spare parts and the liquid naquadah power core of a staff weapon. A fully charged Zero Point Module (ZPM) can provide enough power for regular travel between galaxies. The 8th chevron is a key element in the Stargate Atlantis series, allowing travel to the Pegasus Galaxy.|$|E

The technique makes use of maximum-likelihood sequence estimation of the transmitted phases rather than symbol-by-symbol detection as in conventional {{differential detection}}. As such the performance of this multiple symbol detection scheme fills the gap between conventional (two-symbol observation) differentially coherent detection of MPSK and ideal coherent of MPSK with differential encoding. The amount of improvement gained over conventional differential detection depends {{on the number of}} phases, M, and <b>the</b> number of <b>additional</b> <b>symbol</b> intervals added to the observation.

5000|$|By default, kepatihan {{notes are}} assumed all {{to have the}} same duration. Deviations from these regular rhythms are noted in two ways. Beams or lines (overscores) above notes {{indicate}} half the standard duration (although this is an area of notation that is often inaccurate in practice). A dot (pin) in the place of a note indicates the continuation of the previous note, not a rest. In vocal parts the figure 0 represents a rest, but rests are not written in instrumental parts, because the instruments normally play continuously and any rests are part of the basic playing style of <b>the</b> instrument. <b>Additional</b> <b>symbols</b> are needed for some instruments; for example, melismas and slurred bowing are noted by lines above or underneath the numbers. Strokes on colotomic instruments are indicated by diacritical marks over or around the kepatihan numbers. There are numerous sets of such marks in use; for example, one set (not an agreed standard) uses a circle for gong ageng, parentheses for gong suwukan, ^ for kenong, ˇ for kempul, + for ketuk, and [...] - [...] for kempyang. All or some of these marks may be omitted, as they can usually be determined from the form (bentuk).|$|R
2500|$|Scholars {{postulate}} {{that this}} practice {{may have been}} derived from cheironomic hand-gestures, the ekphonetic notation of Byzantine chant, punctuation marks, or diacritical accents. Later adaptations and innovations included {{the use of a}} dry-scratched line or an inked line or two lines, marked C or F showing the relative pitches between neumes. Consistent relative heightening first developed in the Aquitaine region, particularly at St. Martial de Limoges, {{in the first half of}} the eleventh century. Many German-speaking areas, however, continued to use unpitched neumes into <b>the</b> twelfth century. <b>Additional</b> <b>symbols</b> developed, such as the custos, placed at the end of a system to show the next pitch. Other symbols indicated changes in articulation, duration, or tempo, such as a letter [...] "t" [...] to indicate a tenuto. Another form of early notation used a system of letters corresponding to different pitches, much as Shaker music is notated.|$|R
40|$|Frequency domain {{equalization}} (FDE) {{of continuous}} phase modulations (CPM) has been thoroughly investigated lately. To enable this low-complexity FDE, all known techniques use a cyclic prefix (CP). However, using a training sequence (TS) of known symbols {{instead of a}} CP offers some advantages: <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> known <b>symbols</b> {{can be used to}} improve synchronization and channel estimation, with the same performance of a CP. Nevertheless, using a TS for CPM-FDE is not trivial because the memory in a CPM waveform has {{to be taken into account}} to guarantee cyclicity and phase continuity after insertion of the TS into a block of input symbols. In this paper, we therefore propose a technique for constructing a TS for CPMFDE. Simulation results in a 60 GHz environment show that the proposed technique satisfies all requirements. The 60 GHz case is chosen because CPM with FDE has recently been proposed for communications at 60 GHz and the latest IEEE and ECMA standards for these frequencies mandate the use of a TS rather than a CP. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} an algorithm for {{the alignment}} of protein- coding sequences accounting for frameshifts. The main specificity of this algorithm {{as compared to}} previously published protein-coding sequence alignment methods is {{the introduction of a}} penalty cost for frameshift ex- tensions. Previous algorithms have only used constant frameshift penal- ties. This is similar to the use of scoring schemes with affine gap penalties in classical sequence alignment algorithms. However, the overall penalty of a frameshift portion in an alignment cannot be formulated as an affine function, because it should also incorporate varying codon substitution scores. The second specificity of the algorithm is its search space being the set of all possible alignments between two coding sequences, under the classical definition of an alignment between two DNA sequences. Previous algorithms have introduced constraints on the length of <b>the</b> alignments, and <b>additional</b> <b>symbols</b> for <b>the</b> representation of frameshift openings in an alignment.

40|$|Design and {{performance}} of LDPC codes extended with parity-check symbols from a larger alphabet Abstract — This paper describes a method for constructing a certain class of LDPC codes over mixed integer residue rings. These codes are essentially extended LDPC codes where <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> redundant <b>symbols</b> come from a larger alphabet. In particular, we address the effects that zero divisors as edge weights in the Tanner graph of LDPC codes over Zq have, from the pseudocodeword perspective. First, we show that weighting certain edges of a Tanner graph with zero divisors of Zq can {{reduce the number of}} pseudocodewords arising from its finite degree covers. Second, we prove that in adding a redundant row to a given parity-check matrix, the smaller the number of zero divisors it contains, the more effective it is in constricting the corresponding fundamental polytope. Moreover, we argue that cycles of length four are not bad provided {{at least one of the}} four corresponding edge weights is a zero divisor. The culmination of these findings is a procedure for judiciously adding redundant check nodes to the Tanner graph representation of a mixedalphabet code such that significant performance improvements under iterative decoding may be obtained.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{construction}} of a family of erasure correcting codes for distributed storage systems that achieve low repair bandwidth and low repair complexity. The construction is based on two classes of codes, where the primary goal of the first class of codes is to achieve a good fault tolerance, while the second class of codes aims at reducing the repair bandwidth and the repair complexity. The repair procedure is a two-step procedure where parts of the failed node are repaired in the first step using the first code. The downloaded symbols during the first step are cached in the memory and used to repair the remaining erased data <b>symbols</b> at no <b>additional</b> read cost during the second step of the repair process. The first class of codes is based on maximum distance separable (MDS) codes modified using piggybacks, while the second class of codes is designed to reduce <b>the</b> number of <b>additional</b> <b>symbols</b> that need to be downloaded to repair the remaining erased symbols.
