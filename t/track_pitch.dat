[...] 80 minute CD-R discs marginally violate the Red Book physical format specifications, and longer discs are noncompliant. [...] CD-RW discs have lower reflectivity than CD-R or pressed (non-writable) CDs and for this reason cannot meet the Red Book standard (or come close). [...] Some hardware compatible with Red Book CDs may have difficulty reading CD-Rs and, because of their lower reflectivity, especially CD-RWs. [...] To the extent that CD hardware can read extended-length discs or CD-RW discs, it is because that hardware has capability beyond the minimum required by the Red Book and Yellow Book standards (the hardware is more capable than it needs to be to bear the Compact Disc logo).|$|E

50|$|The larger storage {{capacity}} of a DVD-R compared to a CD-R is achieved through smaller pit size and smaller <b>track</b> <b>pitch</b> of the groove spiral which guides the laser beam. Consequently, more pits can be written on the same physical sized disc. In order to write smaller pits onto the recording dye layer, a red laser beam with a wavelength of 640 nm (for general use recordable DVD, versus a wavelength of 780 nm for CD-R) is {{used in conjunction with}} a higher numerical aperture lens. Because of this shorter wavelength, DVDs use different dyes from CDs to properly absorb this wavelength.|$|E
50|$|Playing times beyond 74 minutes are {{achieved}} by decreasing <b>track</b> <b>pitch</b> (the distance separating the track as it spirals the disc) {{in violation of}} strict Red Book standards. However, most players can still accommodate the more closely spaced data if it is still within Red Book tolerances. Current manufacturing processes allow an audio CD to contain up to 80 minutes (variable from one replication plant to another) without requiring the content creator to sign a waiver releasing the plant owner from responsibility if the CD produced is marginally or entirely unreadable by some playback equipment. In current practice, maximum CD playing time has crept higher by reducing minimum engineering tolerances.|$|E

Because every label pixel is constructed by 132 consecutive tracks, higher image sharpness and contrast is obtained compared to DiscT@2.Each visible pixel is about 40μm × 100μm (w × l) at the inner radius up to 100μm × 100μm (w × l) at the outer radius.

30|$|Many signal {{processing}} {{methods have been}} applied {{to the problem of}} multiharmonic frequency tracking in quasiperiodic signals. Especially, the <b>pitch</b> <b>tracking</b> in the speech signal analysis {{is one of the most}} common applications of multiharmonic frequency <b>tracking.</b> <b>Pitch</b> detection/tracking algorithms can be roughly categorized into three groups: time-domain methods such as zero-crossing, frequency-domain methods, and time-frequency-domain methods. All <b>pitch</b> <b>tracking</b> methods apply the frame-by-frame analysis due to the nature of human voice [1]. Recently Tabrikian et al. proposed the maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability <b>pitch</b> <b>tracking</b> method using harmonic model [2]. They implemented the MAP estimator by a dynamic programming procedure based on measurement collected over several frames. However, these frame-by-frame based algorithms are always not applicable especially when a local signal stationarity cannot be assumed. There are other methods that have been applied to track rhythmicity (harmonic components) in nonstationary quasiperiodic signals based on adaptive schemes [3]. The advantage of using these adaptive schemes is that one can track rhythmicity (frequencies) recursively as signal samples are acquired.|$|R

50|$|By using custom {{formatting}} and load/save routines (sometimes {{included in}} third-party DOSes, see below), {{all of the}} mechanically possible 40 tracks can be used. The reason Commodore decided {{not to use the}} upper five tracks by default (or at least more than 35) was the bad quality of some of the drive mechanisms which did not always work reliably at the highest tracks. So by reducing the number of tracks used and thus capacity, it was possible to further reduce cost - in contrast to single-density drives used e.g. in IBM PC computers of the day which save 180 kB on one side (by using a 40-track format). The 1983 Apple FileWare minifloppy drives use double-sided media, higher <b>track</b> <b>pitch,</b> and variable motor speed to achieve a storage capacity of 871 kB, or 435 kB per side.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid {{approach}} for cochannel speech segregation. HMM (hidden Markov model) {{is used to}} <b>track</b> the <b>pitches</b> of 2 talkers. The resulting <b>pitch</b> <b>tracks</b> are then enriched with the prominent <b>pitch.</b> The enriched <b>tracks</b> are correctly grouped using pitch continuity. Medium frame harmonics are used to extract the second pitch for frames with only one pitch deduced using the previous steps. Finally, the <b>pitch</b> <b>tracks</b> are input to CASA (computational auditory scene analysis) to segregate the mixed speech. The center frequency range of the gamma tone filter banks is maximized to reduce the overlap between the channels filtered for better segregation. Experiments were conducted using this hybrid approach on the speech separation challenge database and compared to the single (non-hybrid) approaches, i. e. signal processing and CASA. Results show that using the hybrid approach outperforms the single approaches.

5000|$|While a DVD uses a 650 nm red laser, Blu-ray Disc uses a 405 nm [...] "blue" [...] laser diode. Note {{that even}} though the laser is called [...] "blue", its color is {{actually}} in the violet range. The shorter wavelength can be focused to a smaller area, thus enabling it to read information recorded in pits that are less than half the size of those on a DVD, and can consequently be spaced more closely, resulting in a shorter <b>track</b> <b>pitch,</b> enabling a Blu-ray Disc to hold about five times the amount of information that can be stored on a DVD. The lasers are GaN (gallium nitride) laser diodes that produce 405 nm light directly, that is, without frequency doubling or other nonlinear optical mechanisms. Conventional DVDs use 650 nm red lasers, and CDs use 780 nm near-infrared lasers.|$|E
5000|$|The minimum [...] "spot size" [...] {{on which}} a laser can be focused is limited by {{diffraction}} and depends on the wavelength of {{the light and the}} numerical aperture of the lens used to focus it. By decreasing the wavelength, increasing the numerical aperture from 0.60 to 0.85, and making the cover layer thinner to avoid unwanted optical effects, designers can cause the laser beam to focus on a smaller spot, which effectively allows more information to be stored in the same area. For Blu-ray Disc, the spot size is 580 nm. This allows a reduction of the pit size from 400 nm for DVD to 150 nm for Blu-ray Disc, and of the <b>track</b> <b>pitch</b> from 740 nm to 320 nm.
