50|$|PSTM can be {{combined}} with both ESTM and AFM in order to simultaneously record optical, conductive, and topological information of a sample. This experimental apparatus, published by Iwata et al., allows the characterization of semiconductors such as photovoltaics, {{as well as other}} photo-conductive materials. The experimental configuration utilizes a cantilever consisting of a bent optical fiber sharpened to a <b>tip</b> <b>diameter</b> of less than 100 nm, coated with an ITO layer, and a thin Au layer. Hence, the fiber probe acts as the AFM cantilever for force sensing, is optically conductive to record optical data, and electrically conductive to record current from the sample.

50|$|Because the {{compression}} of each stage is ~10, each stage {{closer to the}} outlet is considerably smaller than the preceding inlet stages. This has two consequences. The geometric progression tells us that infinite stages could ideally fit into a finite axial length. The finite length {{in this case is}} the full height of the housing as the bearings, the motor, and controller and some of the coolers can be installed inside on the axis. Radially, to grasp as much of the thin gas at the entrance, the inlet-side rotors would ideally have a larger radius, and correspondingly higher centrifugal force; ideal blades would get exponentially thinner towards their tips and carbon fibers should reinforce the aluminium blades. However, because the average speed of a blade affects pumping so much this is done by increasing the root diameter rather than the <b>tip</b> <b>diameter</b> where practical.|$|E
5000|$|Intracellular {{recording}} involves {{measuring voltage}} and/or current across the membrane of a cell. To make an intracellular recording, {{the tip of}} a fine (sharp) microelectrode must be inserted inside the cell, so that the membrane potential can be measured. Typically, the resting membrane potential of a healthy cell will be -60 to -80 mV, and during an action potential the membrane potential might reach +40 mV.In 1963, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their contribution to understanding the mechanisms underlying the generation of action potentials in neurons. Their experiments involved intracellular recordings from the giant axon of Atlantic squid (Loligo pealei), and were among the first applications of the [...] "voltage clamp" [...] technique.Today, most microelectrodes used for intracellular recording are glass micropipettes, with a <b>tip</b> <b>diameter</b> of < 1 micrometre, and a resistance of several megohms. The micropipettes are filled with a solution that has a similar ionic composition to the intracellular fluid of the cell. A chlorided silver wire inserted into the pipet connects the electrolyte electrically to the amplifier and signal processing circuit. The voltage measured by the electrode is compared to the voltage of a reference electrode, usually a silver chloride-coated silver wire in contact with the extracellular fluid around the cell. In general, the smaller the electrode tip, the higher its electrical resistance, so an electrode is a compromise between size (small enough to penetrate a single cell with minimum damage to the cell) and resistance (low enough so that small neuronal signals can be discerned from thermal noise in the electrode tip).|$|E

5000|$|This {{technique}} {{was developed by}} Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann who received the Nobel Prize in 1991. Conventional intracellular recording involves impaling a cell with a fine electrode; patch-clamp recording takes a different approach. A patch-clamp microelectrode is a micropipette with a relatively large <b>tip</b> <b>diameter.</b> The microelectrode is placed next to a cell, and gentle suction is applied through the microelectrode to draw {{a piece of the}} cell membrane (the 'patch') into the microelectrode tip; the glass tip forms a high resistance 'seal' with the cell membrane. This configuration is the [...] "cell-attached" [...] mode, and it can be used for studying the activity of the ion channels that are present in the patch of membrane.If more suction is now applied, the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced, leaving the electrode sealed {{to the rest of the}} cell. This [...] "whole-cell" [...] mode allows very stable intracellular recording. A disadvantage (compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes) is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode, and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted. A variant of this technique, the [...] "perforated patch" [...] technique, tries to minimise these problems.Instead of applying suction to displace the membrane patch from the electrode tip, it is also possible to make small holes on the patch with pore-forming agents so that large molecules such as proteins can stay inside the cell and ions can pass through the holes freely. Also the patch of membrane can be pulled away from the rest of the cell. This approach enables the membrane properties of the patch to be analysed pharmacologically.|$|E
50|$|Microneurography {{is based}} on {{tungsten}} needle electrodes which are inserted through the skin and into a nerve. Anaesthetics are not required because surprisingly the procedure is not very painful. The tungsten microelectrodes have a shaft diameter of 100-200 μm, a <b>tip</b> <b>diameter</b> of 1-5 μm, and they are insulated to the tip with an epoxy resin. Electrode impedance varies between 0.3 and 5 MΩ at 1 kHz as measured initially. However, the impedance tends to decrease during experiment and is usually below 1 MΩ while impulses are recorded. Nerve discharges are determined by voltage differences between the intra-neural electrode and a reference needle electrode in the vicinity. The 2 electrodes are connected to an amplifier with a high input impedance and an appropriate band-pass filtering, often 500 to 5000 Hz. Signals are monitored {{on a computer screen}} and stored on a hard disc for off-line analysis. Any peripheral nerve that can be reached may be a target for microneurographical recordings, although so far only arm, leg, and facial nerves have been exploited. In order to locate the nerve, electrical stimulation through a needle electrode or ultrasonic monitoring is often used. Weak electrical shocks are delivered either through the recording electrode or through a separate stimulation needle while neural response is observed, either a muscle twitch or a cutaneous sensation reported by the subject.In ultrasonic monitoring a linear, high frequency ultrasound probe is used.The microelectrode is then inserted 1-2 cm from the probe, ideally in a 90° angle to the ultrasonic beam. This generates the best wave reflection and image. Ultrasonic approach accurately locates the depth of the nerve and identifies surrounding anatomical structures of interest, such as blood vessels and bony structures, which may affect the placement of a microelectrode. A particular advantage is that the ultrasonic approach visualizes the electrode and the nerve at the same time, thereby facilitating electrode manipulation to reach the nerve. Once the electrode tip is in the nerve, small adjustments are required, first, to penetrate the sheath of an individual fascicle and, second, to take the tip to contact nerve fibers of the kind you are interested to explore, be it multi-unit sympathetic activity or single unit activity of either a myelinated afferent or a small unmyelinated fibres. The search procedure requires considerable skill and patience as it may be very tedious particularly with small nerves or nerves located deep below the skin surface.|$|E
