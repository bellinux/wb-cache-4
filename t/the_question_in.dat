5|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> the 1980 referendum, in {{an attempt}} to build a broad coalition, had sought only the {{authority}} to negotiate sovereignty with the Canadian government, and promised a second referendum to ratify the results of any negotiation. Parizeau believed a second referendum was unnecessary and would only encourage the remainder of Canada to use delaying tactics. The draft initial Act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> {{the case}} was whether Al-Kateb's {{continued}} detention was lawful.

25|$|In 2007 HKCEE Chinese Language Paper 2 (Writing), Question 2 'Lemon Tea' was {{suspected}} to be leaked beforehand since a tutor, Siu Yuen from King's Glory Education Centre gave his students a sample article {{of a similar}} title, 'Iced Lemon Tea', well before the exam.

25|$|Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia {{referenced}} Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), in {{laying out}} the question presented in the instant case. In Bruton, the Court held that a defendant was deprived of his rights under the Confrontation Clause if a confession by his codefendant was introduced in their joint trial, {{regardless of whether the}} jury received instructions only to consider it against the confessor.

25|$|The {{county council}} debated {{conversion}} of the line to standard gauge in 1910, and issued a request to the government. It considered <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> 1912, and granted funding for preliminary surveys. After petitioning from most municipal councils and various commercial interests in 1913, Parliament agreed to the funding in April 1914. A railway committee was established, and Drammen District proposed that its lines be converted. By the time the issue had reached Parliament in 1923, a {{conversion of the}} Vestfold Line {{had fallen out of}} the plans. However, several of the surrounding railways were converted to standard gauge.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} its organisation, the electoral roll {{is one of the}} main points in contention, since this is managed by the National Institute of Statistics, an {{autonomous}} organisation placed under the jurisdiction of the government of Spain. To access its data, polls must have been authorised by the Spanish Congress, something which is out of <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> this case. Without an undisputed access to the electoral roll, the results may be deemed unreliable. Similar difficulties could be met when it comes to the electoral commission to be formed for monitoring the polling and results.|$|E

Even though the majority sought to avoid a split by offering to continue the debate and to allow proportional representation of the minority on the party's governing National Committee, Shachtman, Burnham, and their supporters resigned from the SWP to launch their own organization, again called the Workers Party.|$|E

25|$|These {{different}} influences (Ionian and Athenian) {{mean that}} even today {{the identification of}} the statue is not possible. However, according to some stylistic and technical criteria, the statue belongs to Attic sculpture of the Archaic period (thick hair, receding chin, almond shaped eyes) while undergoing Ionian influence (chiselled rounding, softened facial lines) which increased {{at the end of the}} sixth century. It must however be noted that the Ionian elements are in the majority, notably the typically Ionian long-sleeved chiton, the Ionian himation and the polos decorated with lotus flowers and palmettes. However the material, Pentalic marble from north of Athens, and the rigorous composition settle <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> favour of an Attic origin.|$|E

Johnson called for an inquiry and demanded the end of heavy whipping. Johnson was in a minority of 32 Conservative MPs to support an increase in the Parliamentary salary in May 1954; the issue caused some concern among his constituents but the executive council of Kemptown (Brighton) Conservative Association passed a unanimous vote of confidence in him.|$|E

25|$|Archduke Franz Ferdinand became heir {{presumptive}} (Thronfolger) {{to the throne}} of Austria-Hungary in 1896, after the deaths of his cousin Rudolf (in 1889) and his father Karl Ludwig. The relationship between him and Franz Joseph {{had always been a}} fairly contentious one, which was further exacerbated when Franz Ferdinand announced his desire to marry Countess Sophie Chotek, a match that was out of <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> the mind of the emperor, as Sophie was merely of nobility as opposed to being of dynastic rank. Although the emperor was receiving letters from members of the imperial family throughout the fall and winter of 1899 importuning him to relent, Franz Joseph stood his ground. He finally gave his consent in 1900; however, the marriage was to be morganatic and any children of the marriage would be ineligible to succeed to the throne. The couple were married on 1 July 1900 at Reichstadt. The emperor did not attend the wedding, nor did any of the archdukes. After that, the two men disliked and distrusted each other.|$|E
