5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E
50|$|To test <b>the</b> {{hypothesis}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> {{were found}} in bats, biological samples were collected from bats using nonlethal, minimally invasive procedures, each including a veterinarian and an experienced wildlife biologist. It was discovered that bats became infected, replicated <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> and survived <b>the</b> infection.|$|R
30|$|We {{could show}} that in {{simultaneously}} double infected cells, while the oncolytic effect of <b>the</b> stronger <b>virus</b> will be dominant, both <b>viruses</b> do induce <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> specific cell death. These effects are completely complementing each other. Furthermore we could show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> can replicate {{at the same time}} in the cells.|$|R
50|$|In January 1985, {{a number}} of more-detailed reports were {{published}} concerning LAV and HTLV-III, and by March it was clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> were <b>the</b> same, were from the same source, and were the etiological agent of AIDS.|$|R
5|$|A {{breakthrough}} came in 1948 when {{a research}} group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human {{tissue in the}} laboratory. This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948 Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed {{that there were a}} few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it to the remaining test tubes, on the off chance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful.|$|E
5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E
5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{treating}} RNA viruses such as poliovirus with ribavirin produce results consistent with <b>the</b> idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> mutated too frequently to maintain {{the integrity of the}} information in their genomes. This is termed error catastrophe.|$|R
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{available to}} date suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> {{have been present}} in bats {{for some time and}} had spread to camels by the mid 1990s. <b>The</b> <b>viruses</b> appear to have spread from camels to humans in the early 2010s.

5|$|Cole {{arrives in}} Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then {{hospital}}ized {{in a mental}} hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views. Cole is interviewed {{by a panel of}} doctors, and he tries to explain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> outbreak has already happened, and nobody can change it. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but he disappears moments later, and wakes up back in his own time. Cole is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield of World War I where he is shot in the leg, and then he is suddenly transported to 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed {{that one of}} the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the {{neurological}} {{phase of}} infection {{is thought to}} be an accidental diversion of the normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus enters the CNS are poorly understood. Three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain its entry. All theories require primary viremia. The first hypothesis predicts that virions pass directly from the blood into the central nervous system by crossing the blood–brain barrier independent of CD155. A second hypothesis suggests that the virions are transported from peripheral tissues that have been bathed in the viremic blood, for example muscle tissue, to the spinal cord through nerve pathways via retrograde axonal transport. A third hypothesis is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is imported into the CNS via infected monocytes or macrophages.|$|E

5|$|Patrick Malahide as Mr. Landry. He {{is part of}} {{a company}} which specialises in {{pharmaceutical}} research, which Whitaker was also once a part of; the pair would meet occasionally over a satellite video link to discuss further advancements. The group, following the details on a mysterious postcard, finds Landry, who admits <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is a genetically-engineered attempt to discover a universal cure for all known forms of influenza; it failed and escaped into the populace, creating the pandemic. Landry plans to take Peter Grant to a place where civilisation had been established months before, but is offered the newly created vaccine as an alternative.

5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E

5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} first {{identified}} in rodents collected in 2004 {{as part of}} a survey of wild mammals at Playa de Oro in Manzanillo, Colima, western Mexico. The discovery was published in 2008 by Yong-Kyu Chu and colleagues. Among 600 small mammals, antibodies against the hantavirus Sin Nombre virus were found in 23 individuals (out of 358 studied) of Oryzomys couesi, a rice rat that was the most common species found, six (out of 87) of the cotton rat Sigmodon mascotensis, and one (out of 77) of the pygmy mouse Baiomys musculus. In addition, twelve O.couesi and one S.mascotensis yielded hantavirus RNA. Viruses were found in males more often than in females. Because the amino acid sequences in sequenced parts of the virus's genome differed by as much as 7 to 10% from closely related hantaviruses, Chu and colleagues identified the virus found at Playa de Oro as a new species, called Playa de Oro virus or OROV. Although the authors could not prove <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> fulfilled all the criteria for identifying a new virus species, they argued that it was likely that it did fulfill those criteria. It is currently treated as a probable species in the Hantavirus genus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe H 5 N 1 avian {{influenza}} virus outbreak among zoo tigers in mid-October 2004, with 45 animals dead, indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{avian influenza}} <b>virus</b> could cause lethal infection {{in a large}} mammalian species apart from humans. In this outbreak investigation, six H 5 N 1 isolates were identified and two isolates (A/Tiger/Thailand/CU-T 3 / 04 and A/Tiger/Thailand/CU-T 7 / 04) were selected for whole genome analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the 8 gene segments showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> clustered within <b>the</b> lineage of H 5 N 1 avian isolates from Thailand and Vietnam. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> displayed polybasic amino acids at the cleavage site, identical {{to those of the}} 2004 H 5 N 1 isolates, which by definition are highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). In addition, sequence analyses revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> isolated from tigers harbored few genetic changes compared with <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> having infected chicken, humans, tigers and a leopard isolated from the early 2004 H 5 N 1 outbreaks. Sequence analyses also showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tiger H 5 N 1 isolated in October 2004 was more closely related to the chicken H 5 N 1 isolated in July than that from January.

40|$|A {{workshop}} was organised {{to ascertain}} the current situation with regard to morbillivirus infections in aquatic animals. The great interest generated by the discovery of these new virus infections in 1988 has to some extent abated but much high quality research has continued in this field as the workshop showed. There is some serological evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> have continued to circulate in most areas since the initial epizootics. As to their origin, it appears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most likely source of the European seal morbillivirus (PDV- 1) is the North Atlantic and Artic seal populations.
