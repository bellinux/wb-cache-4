5000|$|A claim {{right is}} a right which entails that another person {{has a duty to}} the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing {{something}} to or for the claim holder, such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a claim to that service or product (another term is <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>action).</b> In logic, this idea can be expressed as: [...] "Person A has a claim that person B do something if and only if B has a duty to A to do that something." [...] Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like [...] "life, liberty, and property"; these rights impose an obligation upon others not to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the nature of {{assignment}} as it relates to contractual debts and contractual rights in general, before addressing problems presented by non-assignment clauses. 1 The assignment of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> sits precariously between contract law and property law and non-assignment clauses cannot properly be understood without an appreciation of this hybrid character of assignment. 2 Non-assignment clauses pose the question whether and in what circumstances contractual rights are items of property. They also demand an examination of the doctrine of privity of contract and a response to the question whether one contracting party has the right unilaterally to vary the contract. Finally, non-assignment clauses set two primary values at odds with each other, namely freedom of contract and the free alienation of items of property. To a significant extent, the practical problems presented by non-assignment clauses will diminish when expected secondary legislation nullifying non-assignment clauses in the field of receivables (or book debts) comes into force, 3 but some of the leading cases do not involve receivables and the subject therefore continues to merit attention for practical as well as for theoretical reasons...|$|R

Background In August 2013, the former Queensland Government engaged the Commercial and Property Law Research Centre (the Centre) at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) {{to conduct an}} independent and broad - ranging review of Queensland's property laws. The purpose of this review is to identify options for reducing red tape, unnecessary regulation and property law duplication A co re element of the review includes the options for the modernisation, simplification, clarification and reform of the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) in light of case law, the operation of other related legislation and changes in practice. The review also includes {{a range of issues}} involving community titles schemes arising under the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997 (Qld). The following papers reviewing seller disclosure and the PLA have been released by the Department of Justice and Attorney - General: • Issues Paper: Seller Disclosure in Queensland; • Interim Report: Seller Disclosure in Queensland; • Issues Paper 1 – Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) – Sales of Land and Other Provisions; • Issues Paper 2 – Property Law Act 1974 (Q ld) – Part 8 Leases & Tenancies; • Issues Paper 3 – Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) – Incorporeal Hereditaments, Rights of Way, Powers of Appointment & Perpetuities; • Issues Paper 4 – Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) – Mortgages, Co - ownership, Encroachment and Mistake; and • Issues Paper 5 – Property Law Act 1974 (Qld) - Equitable Interests and <b>Things</b> <b>in</b> <b>Action,</b> Corporations, Voidable Dispositions, Unregistered Land, De Facto Relationships; and Miscellaneous.

50|$|The {{way this}} actor is written, the {{selection}} of the next input token and the actual copying of the token to the output is one atomic step. Suppose one wants to rewrite that actor to perform these two <b>things</b> <b>in</b> two distinct <b>actions.</b> The actor would then execute in two stages—in the first, it would wait for a token on input S. Once it read that token it would, depending on its value wait for a data token on either A or B. Once that arrived, it would copy it to the output, and go back to waiting for a token on S.The following actor IterSelect is written in that way. Its state variable state is used to select the action that is waiting for input, depending on whether the variable is 0, 1, or 2. Initially, by making 0 the initial value of state, IterSelect waits for input on S, and then it proceeds as described above.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt} Conventional {{approaches}} to learning hinge on the presentationof knowledge and skills. Then again, knowledge is revealedthrough methods of questioning amid risk, confusion,and opportunity. Reginald Revans, the originator of actionlearning, recommended {{that one should}} keep away from experts with prefabricated answers. Rather, people shouldbecome aware of their lack of knowledge and be preparedto explore their ignorance with suitable questions and helpfrom others: finding the right questions rather than the right answers is important, and it is one’s perception of a problem, one’s evaluation of {{what is to be}} gained by solving it, and one’s estimation of the resourcesavailable to solve it that supply the springs of human action. Action learning is an educational process by which a person studies his or her own actions and experience to improveperformance. Put simply, it is about solving problems and getting <b>things</b> done. <b>In</b> <b>action</b> learning, a smallgroup of 5 – 8 persons (called action learning set) meets regularly for a day or half a day over at least 6 months and works collectively on a problem faced in ongoing practice. The action learning set helps a “presenter”work on a problem through supportive but challenging questioning. It encourages a deeper understanding of theissues involved, a reflective reassessment of the problem, and an exploration of ways forward. (Action learningrequires that actions be agreed {{at the end of each}} meeting.) By so doing, it provides a structured way of workingthat provide the discipline we often need to learn from what we do and improve practice as a result...|$|R
40|$|A new {{perspective}} in {{the sociology of}} religion brings to light the possibility of continuing operation of religiosity {{in the process of}} secularization. This study examined this 2 ̆ 2 counter-secularization 2 ̆ 2 thesis with respect to Neo-Confucianism in Korea. It traced the historical process through which a non-secular regime of Neo-Confucianism was established and then disorganized. It then compared the religious situation before and after the disorganization of a Neo-Confucian dynasty of Korea (1392 - 1910). ^ It is found that Neo-Confucian orientation, as it was formulated during the last dynasty of Korea, is operating with vigor among modern Koreans. It is operating, among other <b>things,</b> <b>in</b> their economic <b>actions.</b> An introversion of religious system has been taking place in Korean society. It is also found that the seed of introversion was present in Neo-Confucianism itself. ^ While the secularization of Korea validates the various counter-secularization themes, including introversion, diffusion, and manifestation, it differs from its Western counterpart in that it has received a trauma of foreign occupation in its infantile stage. Because of the trauma, the imposed secular regime from the West has failed to get into the core of the Korean religious system. ...|$|R
