Her passengers were a cross-section of Edwardian society, from millionaires such as John Jacob Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim, to poor emigrants from countries as disparate as Armenia, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Syria and Russia seeking a new life in America.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} and billing <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> McKay's fifth prize-fight. Since his defeat {{at the hands}} of Byrne two-and-half years earlier McKay had fought and won just three matches, earning him £180, while Byrne had earned £200. Both men were promised £200 for the match whatever its outcome. McKay had earned £100 for his previous fight against Paul Spencer, the most he had ever received; the promised payment was a huge improvement in his fortunes.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic {{defeated}} Nadal for {{the first}} time at the French Open in straight sets. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> Nadal's second defeat at the French Open, seeing him drop to No. 10 in the rankings.

5|$|In 1929 Wu {{graduated}} {{at the top}} of her class, and {{was admitted}} to the National Central University in Nanjing.

5|$|In 1941, Frisch {{moved to}} London {{to work with}} Chadwick and his cyclotron. Frisch built a Clusius tube there to study the {{properties}} of uranium hexafluoride.

5|$|On June 27, 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker {{spacecraft}} passed within 1,212km of Mathilde while {{moving at}} a velocity of 9.93km/s.

However, only one hemisphere of Mathilde was imaged during the fly-by. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> the third asteroid to be imaged from a nearby distance, following 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida.|$|E

5|$|The Russians avoided Napoleon's {{objective}} of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance {{was made at}} Smolensk in August; the Russians were defeated {{in a series of}} battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.|$|E

Generally, however, the term Ivalice {{is also used to}} refer to the conceptual setting, rather as one might say the Medieval world of Europe and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|As Harry learns {{more about}} his great enemy, the love lives of the main {{characters}} start to become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister Ginny that Hermione had previously kissed Viktor Krum, Ron shuns her. Harry's attempts to repair things between the two fail, resulting in Ron going out with Lavender Brown and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees {{the two of them}} walking out of the boys dormitories together. However, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> because she hadn't noticed Harry walking ahead of them. Harry develops feelings for Ginny, but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Quidditch victory Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship, with Ron's reluctant consent.|$|E

5|$|At 0000UTC on January17, Météo-France (MFR) {{upgraded}} {{the disturbance}} to a tropical depression, and six hours later upgraded the system further to Tropical Storm Dina. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and {{later that day}} initiated advisories about 425km (265mi) south of Diego Garcia. Dina quickly intensified, and its T-numbers using the Dvorak technique increased by 0.5 every six hours during the storm's development phase. An eye began developing late on January17, and at 1200UTC on January18, MFR upgraded Dina to a tropical cyclone, or {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> 36hours after it was first classified as a tropical disturbance, which is much less than the five days most tropical cyclones take. About three hours earlier, the JTWC had also upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{were made}} in 1876, {{introducing}} more elaborate uniforms for commissioned officers based on those worn by the 13th Hussars, with similarly militaristic uniforms for the other ranks, using gold braid to distinguish the non-commissioned officers. These uniforms were initially of rather low quality, as the government had contracted out the work to prison convicts. The winter uniforms comprised grey overcoats with fur caps and moccasins, although the police preferred wearing warmer buffalo coats, which were available until the herds died out. In 1886, the hussar-style uniforms were replaced by a simpler dragoon version, and dark-blue undress uniforms introduced. In the 1880s, blue pea jackets made from pilot cloth became popular among the police {{as part of their}} winter outfit, and were officially issued from 1893 onwards. There were continual attempts to produce a consistent uniform across the force, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> ever partially successful due to the multiple government suppliers who each produced slightly different variants.|$|E
5|$|Considering its inexperience, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade {{was given}} a {{complicated}} role in the Battle of Bardia. While the 2/6thInfantry Battalion made a demonstration on the right, the 2/5thInfantry Battalion, reinforced by part of the 2/7thInfantry Battalion, attempted to follow up the 16thInfantry Brigade's attack, with {{the remainder of the}} 2/7th in reserve. The brigade had to move in four directions at once. The plan soon went wrong, as the 2/5th in particular suffered a series of mishaps. By nightfall, Colonel Frank Berryman, the divisional chief of staff, had reached the conclusion that the 17thInfantry Brigade had become too tired and disorganised for further effort. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> partly due to enemy action; the rest was attributable to Berryman's own plan, which had dispersed the brigade and provided it with inadequate armoured and, in the final stages, artillery support. Savige also bore some of the blame, for failing to ensure that his subordinates understood and carried out the plan.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to the Netherlands in September 1939 as the Second World War threatened. He remained {{at a hotel in}} Amsterdam for several months and moved to the village of Laren in 1940. Throughout 1941, van Meegeren issued his designs, which he published in 1942 as a large and luxurious book entitled Han van Meegeren: Teekeningen I (Drawings nr I). He also created several forgeries during this time, including The Head of Christ, The Last Supper II, The Blessing of Jacob, The Adulteress, and The Washing of the Feet—all in the manner of Vermeer. On 18 December 1943, he divorced his wife, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> a formality; the couple remained together, but a large share of his capital was transferred to her accounts as a safeguard against the uncertainties of the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
5|$|Initially the new {{regiment}} {{was equipped}} with Churchill tanks, although <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> a temporary measure until Centurion tanks could be acquired. However, due to the perceived unsuitability of the Churchill and the late arrival of the new platform, the regiment was not deployed as part of Australia's commitment to the Korean War, although a number of officers served on exchange with British and US formations and the unit provided machine-gunners and signalers to Australian infantry battalions as reinforcements. The first Centurions finally began arriving in June 1952, with the regiment receiving 39 tanks. With the numbers of regular personnel steadily growing, {{it was possible to}} raise Regimental Headquarters, Headquarters Squadron and B Squadron, and the regiment was fully raised by 8 September 1952 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Graham.|$|E
