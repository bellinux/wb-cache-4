Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers continued to arrive for several weeks as they made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean in small sailboats. By mid-June, it was back up to strength. Several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|The 20th Battalion was {{evacuated}} to Egypt, {{having lost}} over half its original complement of personnel during the Greece and Crete campaigns. After {{a short period}} of rest, Kippenberger set about bringing the battalion back up to strength. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers, separated from the battalion for various reasons during the previous two months while in Greece and Crete, continued to arrive for several weeks as they made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean by various means, including small sailboats. By mid-June, the battalion was at full strength and several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{entered the}} village by 16:30. Lieutenant Colonel Borislav Đukić, {{in command of}} the Tactical Group-1 tasked with capture of Kijevo and the {{commanding}} officer of the JNA 221st Motorised Infantry Brigade, reported that the village was secured by 22:30. The Croatian police fled Kijevo in three groups via Mount Kozjak towards Drniš. The remaining Croatian population left after the artillery had destroyed much of their settlements. The retreating groups were pursued by the Yugoslav Air Force jets as they made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Kozjak. Radio Television Belgrade reporter Vesna Jugović recorded these events. Krajina units commanded by Martić acted in concert with JNA to take command of the area.|$|E

50|$|On October 11, 1863, the 6th U.S. Cavalry {{was caught}} in an exposed {{position}} near Brandy Station and engaged by superior numbers of Confederate cavalry.

60|$|And it {{was most}} amazingly lucky that Lydie had given up her absurd ideas about that Stuart prince, and had thus helped those English {{millions}} to find <b>their</b> <b>way</b> comfortably <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Channel, {{into the pockets of}} His Majesty the King of France, and of one or two others, including her own doting father.|$|R
5|$|Pushing <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Bunga and Buiem Rivers, the 2/23rd {{fanned out}} through Apo village while {{maintaining}} {{contact with the}} 2/17th Infantry Battalion by signal cable. Around the Burep River, the 2/23rd was held up by the terrain {{and as a result}} the commander decided to halt and form a battalion defensive position. A platoon under Sergeant Don Lawrie was pushed forward near the mouth of the river as a protection measure to provide early warning. On 6 September, a company of Japanese attacked the 2/23rd's main defensive position south of the Singaua Plantation on the western side of the Buiem River, alongside a company from the 2/24th Battalion. Having been alerted by Lawrie's platoon who had sent back two runners, the battalion was able to repel the attack, although numerous casualties were inflicted on the 2/23rd and the 2/17th by Japanese mortars. The Japanese company, numbering about 60 men, subsequently fell back towards Lawrie's platoon near the Bunga. Positioned on the Japanese line of retreat, the Australian platoon was subjected to six attacks. These were fended off {{over the course of the}} afternoon, and by evening, as heavy rain began to fall, the Australian platoon was able to break contact and withdraw back to the 2/23rd's main defensive position.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} wintered in Belgium, {{but early}} in 1918 {{was transferred to}} the Somme again in response to the German Spring Offensive. In late March and into April, they defended the line around Villers-Bretonneux as the Allies fought to defend the vital railhead of Amiens, before providing support to the 6th Brigade's attack on Ville-sur-Ancre in May. A brief lull followed in June and July as the Allies attempted to regain the initiative, during which the 28th was involved in a minor action around Morlancourt. On 8 August, the Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive during which the 28th Battalion was initially engaged around Villers-Bretonneux. It was there, {{on the first day of}} the offensive, that Lieutenant Alfred Gaby, performed the deeds that led to him becoming the 28th Battalion's first, and only, Victoria Cross recipient. A series of advances followed as the Allies exploited their initial success and sought to break the Hindenburg Line. In late August, the Australian 2nd Division advanced to the Somme River, and on 29 August, as the 7th Brigade attacked around Biaches, the 28th was assigned the task of capturing the AmiensPeronne railway bridge. The following day, they forced <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river around Peronne, and during the subsequent Battle of Mont St QuentinPeronne, they joined the 7th Brigade's advance towards Aizecourt-le-Haut. They continued fighting until early October 1918 when they were withdrawn from the line, just after an attack on the Beaureviour Line, around the village of Estrees.|$|E

25|$|Still, {{at least}} 900 Jewish {{refugees}} made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> border to Sweden.

6000|$|... "We {{may need}} it again," [...] he said briefly. Malchus placed his own clothes upon it and threw over his {{shoulders}} the bernous which Nessus had brought. He then mounted the steps with him, the gate was closed and the bolt shot, and they then made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> stables. It was still perfectly dark, though a very faint light, low in the eastern sky, showed that ere long the day would break.|$|R
60|$|They made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> Gaiety, where Selingman {{was a very}} {{conspicuous}} {{figure in}} {{the largest and most}} conspicuous box.

25|$|By 25 November, {{the three}} Groupements converged on Thakhek, {{approximately}} 135 kilometers north of Savannakhet. They continued north toward Paksan, some 190 kilometers further. On 5 December, they blasted <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Nam Kading (Kading River) {{just south of}} Paksan without opposition. At the same time, PARU Team C and Bataillon Volontaires 32 (Volunteer Battalion 32) shifted eastward to their flanking position at Khamkeut.|$|E
25|$|After fifty minutes, {{the hole}} was large enough to drag the {{patients}} through, and the men– save Privates Waters and Beckett, who hid in the wardrobe (Waters was wounded and Beckett died of assegai wounds)– were now in the last room, being defended by Privates Robert Jones and William Jones.

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century it was reckoned that Younger’s was producing a quarter of all Scotland's beer. The company’s overseas trade had grown so rapidly that 80,000 barrels a year were leaving the London stores alone for sixty overseas-based agencies. Cargoes were being carried from Leith to Belgium which became a principal market; private customers included the Czar of Russia and his household; and deliveries were finding <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> world to destinations ranging alphabetically from Alexandria to Zanzibar.|$|E

25|$|Although French and English inventors {{modified}} the velocipede into the high-wheel bicycle, the French were {{still recovering from}} the Franco-Prussian war, so English entrepreneurs put the high-wheeler on the English market, and the machine became very popular there, Coventry, Oxford, Birmingham and Manchester being the centers of the English bicycle industry (and of the arms or sewing machine industries, which had the necessary metalworking and engineering skills for bicycle manufacturing, as in Paris and St. Etienne, and in New England). Soon bicycles found <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> English Channel. By 1875, high-wheel bicycles were becoming popular in France, though ridership expanded slowly.|$|E

25|$|The Caribbean is a {{focal area}} for many hurricanes within the Western Hemisphere. A series of low {{pressure}} systems develop off the West coast of Africa and make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean.

The Caribbean hurricane season as a whole lasts from June through November, {{with the majority of}} hurricanes occurring during August and September. On average around 9 tropical storms form each year, with 5 reaching hurricane strength. According to the National Hurricane Center 385 hurricanes occurred in the Caribbean between 1494 and 1900.|$|E
25|$|In The Return of the King, Sam single-handedly rescued Frodo from Cirith Ungol and, {{dressed in}} {{scavenged}} Orc-armour, the two {{began to make}} <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> plateau of Gorgoroth. They finally arrived, against all odds, at Mount Doom, {{the only place where}} the Ring could be destroyed. However, Gollum had secretly followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life out of pity, and turned his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature and followed Frodo.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} conflicts related to the Civil War in California occurred on November 29, 1861, at Minter Ranch, in the hills just south and west of the San Jose Valley, where Warner's Ranch and the military post of Camp Wright was located. Dan Showalter's party of secessionists, like some others, were attempting to avoid the post and make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> desert to join the Confederate Army in Texas. They were pursued from Temecula by a Volunteer Cavalry patrol from the camp, intercepted and captured without shots being fired. Later after being imprisoned at Fort Yuma, Showalter {{and the others were}} released after swearing loyalty to the Union, but they {{made their way to the}} Confederacy later.|$|E

This later led some to question the decision to blow the bridge, arguing that the river itself did not offer much of an obstacle to the Japanese, and that more harm than good was achieved, as it resulted in the stranding of two brigades and delayed the Japanese capture of Rangoon by ten days at most.|$|R
60|$|Several {{shots were}} fired at the party as they made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> to <b>the</b> end of the field, where the tall stalks of maize were still standing, though the corn had been {{gathered}} weeks before. As soon {{as they reached the}} shelter they separated, each crawling through the maize until they arrived within fifty yards of the house. There were, as the sheriff had said, many stumps still standing, and each ensconced himself behind one of these, and began to reply to the fire that the defenders kept up whenever they saw a movement among the cornstalks.|$|R

But one thing he could say: he had been no man's enemy but his own; every dollar, every cent had gone to pay his debts; he had come out with clean hands. He said all this, and much more, to Mr. Sewell the summer after he sold out, when the minister and his wife stopped at Lapham on <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>across</b> from <b>the</b> White Mountains to Lake Champlain; Lapham had found them on the cars, and pressed them to stop off.|$|R
