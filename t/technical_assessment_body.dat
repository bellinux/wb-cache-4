Since 1994, it has published the Construction Products Lists (Bauregellisten) on behalf of the Länder. In 1998, Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik granted the first European technical approval in Europe. In 2007, DIBt was recognised by the Land of Berlin and the Land of Brandenburg as Structural Safety Control Authority (Bautechnisches Prüfamt). In 2008, it took over the coordination of the market surveillance of CE marked products and since 2014, it has been the [...] "joint market surveillance authority of the Länder". In 2012, DIBt was designated as the sole <b>Technical</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Body</b> in Germany, as well as the notifying authority in accordance with the new Construction Products Regulation. Upon publication of the revised Energy Saving Ordinance (Energieeinsparverordnung) in November 2013, DIBt also became responsible for registering energy performance certificates and inspection reports for air-conditioning systems, as well as for carrying out electronic random checks.|$|E

40|$|Encryption is used {{to convert}} an email message to an {{unreadable}} format thereby securing patient privacy during the transmission of the message across the Internet. Two available means of encryption are: public key infrastructure (PKI) {{used in conjunction with}} ordinary email and secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) used by secure web-mail applications. Both of these approaches have advantages and disadvantages in terms of viability, cost, usability and compliance. The aim of this study was develop an instrument to identify the most appropriate means of encrypting email communication for telemedicine. A multi-method approach was used to construct the instrument. <b>Technical</b> <b>assessment</b> and existing <b>bodies</b> of knowledge regarding the utility of PKI were analyzed, along with survey results from users of Queensland Health 2 ̆ 7 s Child and Youth Mental Health Service secure web-mail service. The resultant decision support model identified that the following conditions affect the choice of encryption technology: correspondent 2 ̆ 7 s risk perception, correspondent 2 ̆ 7 s identification to the security afforded by encryption, email-client used by correspondents, the tolerance to human error and the availability of technical resources. A decision support model is presented as a flow chart to identify the most appropriate encryption for a specific email-based telemedicine service. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press.
