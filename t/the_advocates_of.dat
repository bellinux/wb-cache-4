5|$|Desha {{gradually}} became more conservative {{after his return}} to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy. He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe's request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large standing army provided <b>the</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> a larger federal government with an excuse to increase taxes, and proposed that the standing army should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 7565. The version of the bill passed by the Senate, however, required a standing army of 15,000 men. The legislation was referred to a conference committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. <b>The</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} {{paleontology}} have {{also contributed to}} the development of evolutionary theory. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson published Tempo and Mode in Evolution, which used quantitative analysis to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, non-directional, patterns predicted by <b>the</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> evolution driven by natural selection and genetic drift rather than the linear trends predicted by earlier advocates of neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis. This integrated paleontology into the modern evolutionary synthesis. In 1972 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.|$|E

5|$|After Preston won an FA Cup {{match against}} Upton Park in 1884, the Londoners protested, seeking the result to be {{overturned}} due to professionalism in the Preston ranks. This sparked {{a series of}} events which threatened to split the FA. Under Sudell's instruction, Preston withdrew from the competition. Fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum, to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the north, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. At the FA conference called to discuss the issue, Sudell {{was a member of the}} committee. He argued passionately for the acceptance of professionalism, but met opposition from southern-based amateur clubs, who viewed sport solely as a pastime. Backed by figures such as the more moderate but influential William McGregor of Aston Villa, <b>the</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> professionalism won the day and secured its acceptance. However, each club was permitted to only pay players who had been born or who had lived within six miles of the home stadium for at least two years.|$|E
5|$|The most {{decorated}} room in {{the building}} is the Sala Nobile (Noble Hall) on the first floor, which was originally a courthall, and which is now used as a meeting room. Here the judge and the nominated College of Advocates sat on a bench, which itself was a platform, wearing typical silk gown clothing of the period. The advocates on the bench were nominated and removed {{at the discretion of}} the Grand Master. When Malta was a British colony a similar short lived system was adopted, on 14 August 1832, known as the King's Counsel. The bench consisted of <b>the</b> <b>Advocates</b> <b>of</b> the King, and survived seven years. This room has coats-of-arms of the Castellani depicted on the upper side of the walls. There are 105 coats-of-arms, belonging to the Castellani from 1609 to the last in 1798, after which the position was abolished.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> this anti-systematic {{interpretation}} {{do not see}} {{a contradiction}} between Plato's criticism of writing {{and the notion that}} he communicated his entire philosophy to the public in writing. They believe his criticism was aimed only at the kind of writing that expresses dogmas and doctrines. Since the dialogues are not like this but instead present their material in the guise of fictional conversations, Plato's criticism does not apply.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> the Tübingen School have intensively {{examined}} the scattered evidence and {{testimony in the}} sources in order to reconstruct the principles of Plato's unwritten doctrines. They see in these teachings the core of Plato's philosophy and have reached a fairly settled picture of their fundamentals, though many important details remain unknown or controversial. A notable feature of the Tübingen paradigm is the contention that the unwritten doctrines are not unrelated to the written doctrines, rather there is a close and logical connection between them.|$|E
25|$|It is debated when Plato {{held his}} public lecture 'On the Good.' For <b>the</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> the Tübingen {{interpretation}} this {{is connected with}} {{the question of whether the}} unwritten doctrines belong to Plato's later philosophy or were worked out relatively early in his career. Resolving this question depends in turn upon the long-standing debate in Plato studies between 'unitarians' and 'developmentalists.' The unitarians maintain that Plato always defended a single, coherent metaphysical system throughout his career; developmentalists distinguish several different phases in Plato's thought and hold that he was forced by problems he encountered while writing the dialogues to revise his system in significant ways.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{disagreement}} amongst <b>the</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> {{different approaches to}} problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the Encyclopedia uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing {{an increasing number of}} people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.|$|E

25|$|A {{member of}} the non-emancipated Jewish-Romanian community, Lazăr Șăineanu stood for the Haskalah ideas, and opted in favor of Jewish {{assimilation}} into the Romanian mainstream. His repeated requests for naturalization were eventually unsuccessful, but propelled him {{to the center of}} a political conflict which opposed the antisemitic current to <b>the</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> tolerance. In 1901, Șăineanu and his family quit the Kingdom of Romania and resettled in France, where the scholar lived until his death. Becoming known for his pioneering work to the study of Middle French and his investigations into the origins of argot, as well as for his critical essays on 16th century writer François Rabelais, he was a recipient of the Institut de France's Volney Prize for 1908. The son in law of publisher Ralian Samitca, Șăineanu was survived by his brother Constantin, a noted lexicographer, journalist and polemicist.|$|E
25|$|The biggest bone of {{contention}} between <b>the</b> <b>advocates</b> <b>of</b> the 'modern' orthographies and the 'traditionalist' orthographies {{is the use}} of w and y to show the semi-vowels. In general native speakers in literacy classes seem to find y and w very difficult to learn, and that u and i are the 'logical' letters to use. Syllabification of words by untrained speakers suggests that u and i are really the underlying sounds. Thus, a word like dhaudhai 'mainland, continent' syllabifies as dha-u-dha-i, not dhau-dhai. In songs, the glide-u/i can also be given full syllable status. Historical considerations also point to the semi-vowels often being vocalic rather than consonantal. Thus, lagau, the genitive of laag 'place' is in underlying form +ngu>; the full form of the genitive ending -ngu is only retained where the nominal has a monosyllabic stem (see the section on Nominal Morphology). Similarly, verbal nouns end in -i, e.g. lumai, stem luuma- 'search, look for, seek, hunt'. The mid-19th century to early 20th century records of Kauaraigau Ya show that the verbal noun ending was previously -ri (thus lumari), where the -r- was presumably the rhotic glide rather than the rhotic tap/trill.|$|E
