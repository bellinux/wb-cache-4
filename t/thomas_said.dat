25|$|A TV {{dinner is}} a prepackaged, frozen or chilled meal {{generally}} {{in an individual}} package. It requires little preparation, oven baked or microwaveable, and contains all the elements for a single-serving meal in a tray with compartments for the food. Carl A. Swanson of C.A. Swanson & Sons is generally credited for inventing the TV dinner. Retired Swanson executive Gerry <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> he conceived the idea after the company found itself with a huge surplus of frozen turkeys because of poor Thanksgiving sales.|$|E

25|$|Wright, {{who was one}} of Thomas' {{subordinates}} at the EEOC {{until he}} fired her, told Senate Judiciary Committee staff that Thomas had repeatedly made comments to her much like those he allegedly made to Hill, including pressuring her for dates, asking her the size of her breasts, and frequently commenting on the anatomy of other women. Wright said that after she turned down Thomas for a date, Thomas began to express discontent with her work and eventually fired her. <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> that he fired Wright for poor performance and for using a homophobic epithet.|$|E
25|$|Other {{former colleagues}} testified on Thomas's behalf. Nancy Altman, who shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education, testified that she heard {{virtually}} everything <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> {{over the course}} of two years, and never heard any sexist or offensive comment. Altman did not find it credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct alleged by Hill, without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it. Senator Alan K. Simpson questioned why Hill met, dined, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.|$|E
25|$|Decades later, editor Stan Lee {{and writer}} Roy Thomas decided {{to add a}} new team member to the superhero-team series The Avengers. Thomas wanted {{to bring back the}} Golden Age Vision, but Lee was set on {{introducing}} an android member. Thomas ultimately compromised by using a new, android Vision. The second Vision first appeared in The Avengers #57 (Oct. 1968). Thomas wanted the character to be white as befitting his ghostly name, but printing limitations of the time would have rendered him colorless, with un-inked paper where his skin should be. He settled on red as he did not want Vision to be green like the Hulk or blue like the Atlanteans. The character has been compared with Spock from Star Trek, but <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> that he was barely aware of the TV series at the time. He acknowledged being influenced by the Adam Link character by Otto Binder, one of the first robots treated as a sympathetic character rather than as a mechanical tool.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> {{that he would not}} have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because the man told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC, <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> that Morris and Beesley had been [...] "very adamant" [...] that the series had finished. On his co-stars, he added [...] "There is a bond there that I think would be a stupid thing to waste. You don't get that bond very often with other performers and we do have it and it's a valuable thing".|$|E
500|$|... "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] also marks Hannigan's {{third and}} final guest {{appearance}} on the show. Hannigan was open to appearing in another episode, but she was unsure whether or not her busy schedule would allow it. She also felt that the character's arc {{had come to a}} natural close in this episode. In an interview, Rob <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> that due to her busy schedule, it was difficult to write an episode featuring Hannigan. On Hannigan's role in the episode and her future availability, Thomas commented: ...|$|E

500|$|Like the show, The Stick of Truth satirizes {{political}} and social issues including abortion, race relations, anal probes, drug addiction, sex, extreme violence, and poverty. Creative consultant Jordan <b>Thomas</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The way we looked at [...] was if this moment was a hot button for the audience, should we make it worse, because [...] love to push boundaries and their default response was definitely not to back down, but the really healthy counterbalance was, can we make it funnierand the answer was often yes".|$|E
500|$|Although the season's {{plan was}} changed very little, <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> that Logan became {{a much bigger}} {{character}} than anticipated. Thomas attributed this to Jason Dohring being an engaging performer, and the crew wanting to write scenes for him. While the budget for each episode was around $1.7 million, an extra $400,000 was spent for the finale. Filming was extended by one full day with the first unit and an extra three days of filming with the second unit. Thomas promised {{that there would be}} [...] "more action than you've ever seen on Veronica Mars." ...|$|E
500|$|The finale concludes the storyline of Lilly Kane's murder, as Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) finally {{discovers the}} {{identity}} of the murderer after investigating the mystery with her father Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) throughout the season. <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> that the finale was more ambitious than the average episode, requiring a larger budget and more filming than usual. [...] "Leave It to Beaver" [...] was watched by 2.99 million American viewers on its original airing. Critical reaction to the episode was generally positive, and several critics praised Thomas' use of red herrings.|$|E

I think Veronica and Lilly {{saying goodbye to}} each other is {{what people want to}} see. As much as who killed Lilly Kane." [...] For the finale, Thomas promised [...] "80 percent total satisfaction. People will know who killed Lilly Kane. And there won't be that twist at the end that 'perhaps they didn't do it.' I'm not going to be leaving people like that. However, {{at the end of the}} episode, it gives us a pretty big cliffhanger {{question}} as well." ...|$|E
500|$|When it was renewed for {{a second}} season, Veronica Mars became the lowest-rated show in network history to be renewed and the only UPN drama from the 2004-05 {{television}} season to be renewed. Starting in the second season, Veronica Mars was moved to Wednesday nights, placing it in direct competition with ABC's popular Lost. Rob <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> that, [...] "I wish the juggernaut that is Lost wasn't our direct competition." [...] At the same time, Veronica Mars was placed after UPN's America's Next Top Model. On {{the date of the}} airing of this episode, Bell and Thomas talked to The New York Times, where Thomas commented, [...] "We let Veronica say things that, if you get all day to think about it, would be the perfect retort." ...|$|E
500|$|... 13 Assassins was {{produced}} through Toshiaki Nakazawa's film outfit, Sedic International, and Jeremy Thomass Recorded Picture Company. Nakazawa had previously worked with director Takashi Miike on The Bird People in China and Andromedia (both in 1998), Yakuza Demon (2003), and Sukiyaki Western Django (2007). At {{the start of}} production, <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> he was pleased to be working again with [...] "wonderful Japanese filmmakers like Toshiaki Nakazawa and Takashi Miike, whose work speaks for itself as being amongst the most successful and innovative coming from Japan". Nakazawa replied {{that he would like}} Thomas [...] "to wear a sword also, and with one more assassin, together we will send out the fourteen assassins over there".

500|$|Thomas {{described}} Amanda Seyfried, who {{portrayed the}} murdered Lilly Kane, as [...] "the biggest {{surprise of the}} year". When casting a series regular, {{he was able to}} see all the best actors in town, mainly because they all wanted to be a series regular. When casting Lilly Kane, who would only appear from time-to-time as [...] "the dead girl", Thomas did not receive the same standard of actors. <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> that he had [...] "never had a more cut and dry audition" [...] than he did with Seyfried. He said that she was [...] "about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw, she was just spectacular". He continued by saying that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Veronica Mars {{features}} a different [...] "case of the week" [...] each episode, and the season-long mystery of Lilly Kane's murder. In addition {{to developing a}} separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues {{that would lead to}} the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned {{from the beginning of the}} season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production. <b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> that at the beginning of the season, [...] "I know the broad strokes, I know who did it, I know how it was done, I know the big arcs, but we're always filling in the details. Those are week to week. It's a week to week challenge in the writers room figuring out how much information we want to dole out to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Thomas</b> <b>said</b> {{after the}} race that his victory {{demonstrated}} that he could compete with the top stage racers in the world. He said that Henao's presence had been crucial to his victory and that, before the stage, he had chosen a 54-tooth chainring to help him chase back on if he was dropped on the final climb. He {{also said that he}} owed Gallopin [...] "a few beers" [...] for his assistance in chasing back to the leading groups on the final stage. Gallopin, meanwhile said that he had been happy to contribute to the chase of the second group on the final stage in order to have both a man in the leading group and in the chasing group. He added that he was also glad to help Thomas as the two men were friends and exchanged text messages whenever Thomas's Wales played Gallopin's France at rugby.|$|E
