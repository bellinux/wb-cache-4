5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>aorta.</b> From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the <b>thoracic</b> <b>aorta,</b> and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E

Two groups (CA, cold-acclimated for 12 weeks at 5 °C; WA, warm-acclimated for 12 weeks at 24 °C) of 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. After anesthesia, the <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortae</b> (4 mm long) were isolated and the vascular tension was measured with a force transducer. The dose-response relations for aortic responses to norepinephrine (NE), phenylephrine (PE) and acetylcholine (Ach) were determined and compared between the CA and the WA groups. In the CA rats, the <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortae</b> became more sensitive to Ach-induced vasorelaxation. The vascular sensitivities to NE- or PE-induced contraction in the <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortae</b> were lowered.

40|$|Objective—Castration of male apolipoprotein E–deficient (apoE/) mice reduces {{angiotensin}} II (Ang II) –induced {{abdominal aorta}} aneurysms (AAAs) {{to that of}} female mice. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether this reduction is attributable to androgen-mediated regulation of aortic Ang II type 1 A receptors (AT 1 aR). Methods and Results—AT 1 aR mRNA abundance in the AAA-prone region of abdominal aortas was 8 -fold greater compared to <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> of male but not female mice. AT 1 aR mRNA abundance decreased after castration in abdominal but not <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> of male mice. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 0. 16 mg/d) administration to castrated male mice restored AT 1 aR mRNA abundance in abdominal aortas but had no effect in <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas.</b> DHT also increased AT 1 aR mRNA abundance in abdominal aortas from female mice. Castrated male or female apoE/ mice were administered DHT during infusion of saline or Ang II (1000 ng/kg/min for 28 days). DHT administration did not alter serum cholesterol concentrations, lipoprotein distributions, or atherosclerotic lesion areas in either male or female mice. However, administration of DHT increased AAA incidence in male (27 % placebo versus 75 % DHT) and female mice (28 % placebo versus 64 % DHT).

25|$|Transoesophageal Doppler {{includes}} two main technologies; transoesophageal echocardiogram —which is primarily used for diagnostic purposes, and oesophageal Doppler monitoring—which is primarily {{used for the}} clinical monitoring of cardiac output. The latter uses continuous wave Doppler to measure blood velocity in the descending <b>thoracic</b> <b>aorta.</b> An ultrasound probe is inserted either orally or nasally into the oesophagus to mid-thoracic level, {{at which point the}} oesophagus lies alongside the descending <b>thoracic</b> <b>aorta.</b> Because the transducer is close to the blood flow, the signal is clear. The probe may require re-focussing to ensure an optimal signal. This method has good validation, is widely used for fluid management during surgery with evidence for improved patient outcome, and has been recommended by the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Oesophageal Doppler monitoring measures the velocity of blood and not true Q, therefore relies on a nomogram based on patient age, height and weight to convert the measured velocity into stroke volume and cardiac output. This method generally requires patient sedation and is accepted for use in both adults and children.|$|E

Recently, endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (ECNOS), which generates nitric oxide and mediates EDR, was cloned, and ECNOS mRNA expression {{was reported to be}} modified by various cytokines, lipoproteins, and shear stress. To investigate the expression of ECNOS mRNA and protein in atherosclerotic arteries with impaired EDR, <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> isolated from Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits were examined by using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.

40|$|<b>Thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> {{isolated}} from dogs were evaluated {{to determine the}} correlation between the depth of an intimal tear and the progression of aortic dissection. <b>Thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> obtained from 99 adult mongrel dogs were used. An intimal tear (aortic pocket) was created on the aortic wall and the aorta was connected in series to a closed circuit (150 mmHg/ 100 mmHg and 60 beats/min). The progression of the dissection was most notable in the aortic pocket prepared in the first one-third of the external media (87. 5 %). There was no correlation however between the width of the pocket and the progression of dissection. Examinations of samples from surgical patients have shown that dissection usually progresses at the same site. This has been attributed to the diseased media. Our results demonstrated that dissection occurred almost always at the same site without any medial changes suggesting that whether dissection develops or not likely depends upon whether the intimal tear reaches the first one-third of the external media or not...|$|R

Methods: All animals were implanted with a novel thoracic aortic stent-graft via femoral artery. Blood sample was collected at pre-operation and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after implantation for hematological examination. Moreover, tissues from randomly selected 4 dogs were subjected to histopathological analysis with the optical microscope after stent-grafts were implanted for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months respectively. The experimental period lasted for more than 2 years. Results: A total of 9 stent-grafts were successfully implanted in the canine <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> and no migration or deformation occurred.

The histological structure and mechanical characteristics of the infrarenal aorta {{differ from those of}} the <b>thoracic</b> <b>aorta.</b> The diameter decreases from the root to the aortic bifurcation, and the wall of the infrarenal aorta also contains a lesser proportion of elastin.

Higher intraluminal pressure in patients with arterial hypertension markedly contributes to the progression of the pathological process. Suitable hemodynamic conditions may be linked to specific intraluminal thrombus (ILT) patterns along the aortic lumen, which in turn may affect AAA's development.|$|E

40|$|Stem {{cells are}} one of the most {{fascinating}} areas of biology today, and since the discover of an adult population, i. e., adult Stem Cells (aSCs), they have generated much interest especially for their application potential as a source for cell based regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. aSCs have been found in different tissues including bone marrow, skin, intestine, central nervous system, where they reside in a special microenviroment termed “niche” which regulate the homeostasis and repair of adult tissues. The arterial wall of the blood vessels is much more plastic than ever before believed. Several animal studies have demonstrated the presence of cells with stem cell characteristics within the adult vessels. Recently, it has been also hypothesized the presence of a “vasculogenic zone” in human adult arteries in which a complete hierarchy of resident stem cells and progenitors could be niched during lifetime. Accordingly, it can be speculated that in that location resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with the ability to differentiate in smooth muscle cells, surrounding pericytes and fibroblasts are present. The present research was aimed at identifying in situ and isolating MSCs from <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> of young and healthy heart-beating multiorgan donors. Immunohistochemistry performed on fresh and frozen human <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> demonstrated the presence of the vasculogenic zone between the media and the adventitial layers in which a well preserved plexus of CD 34 positive cells was found. These cells expressed intensely HLA-I antigens both before and after cryopreservation and after 4 days of organ cultures remained viable. Following these preliminary results, we succeeded to isolate mesenchymal cells from multi-organ <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> using a mechanical and enzymatic combined procedure. Cells had phenotypic characteristics of MSC i. e., CD 44 +, CD 90 +, CD 105 +, CD 166 +, CD 34 low, CD 45 - and revealed a transcript expression of stem cell markers, e. g., OCT 4, c-kit, BCRP- 1, IL 6 and BMI- 1. As previously documented using bone marrow derived MSCs, resident vascular wall MSCs were able to differentiate in vitro into endothelial cells in the presence of low-serum supplemented with VEGF-A (50 ng/ml) for 7 days. Under the condition described above, cultured cells showed an increased expression of KDR and eNOS, down-regulation of the CD 133 transcript, vWF expression as documented by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, qPCR and TEM. Moreover, matrigel assay revealed that VEGF induced cells were able to form capillary-like structures within 6 hours of seeding. In summary, these findings indicate that <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> from heart-beating, multi-organ donors are highly suitable for obtaining MSCs with the ability to differentiate in vitro into endothelial cells. Even though their differentiating potential remains to be fully established, it is believed that their angiogenic ability could be a useful property for allogenic use. These cells can be expanded rapidly, providing numbers which are adequate for therapeutic neovascularization; furthermore they can be cryostored in appropriate cell banking facilities for later use...|$|R

A further group of rats was subjected to a sham operation where only the abdominal aorta was injured, and another group of rats was used as controls. Each animal was continuously labeled with 3 H-thymidine (6. 7 Ci/mM, 10 microCi/hr) for 7 days, at which time they were killed and the aortas perfusion-fixed with aldehydes. Sections of each aorta were processed for autoradiography. The <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> from animals subjected to the nylon filament injury showed no intimal thickening, but there was {{a significant increase in the}} thymidine index of the medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as compared with aortas from sham operation or control animals (1. 02 % +/- 0. 44 % versus 0. 19 % +/- 0. 13 % versus 0. 15 % +/- 0. 12 %). This experiment showed that continuous administration of 3 H-thymidine permitted the detection of a small but significant increase in replication rates that could not be detected by the standard bolus administration of 3 H-thymidine, and that selected loss of endothelium with minimal trauma to the vessel wall caused SMC proliferation without intimal thickening.

40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} {{arterial hypertension}} (IPAH) is increasingly diagnosed in elderly patients who also have {{an increased risk of}} comorbid atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE-/-) mice develop atherosclerosis with severe PAH when fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and have increased levels of endothelin (ET) - 1. ET- 1 receptor antagonists (ERAs) are used for the treatment of PAH but less is known about whether ERAs are beneficial in atherosclerosis. We therefore examined whether treatment of HFD-ApoE-/- mice with macitentan, a dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist, would have any effect on both atherosclerosis and PAH. ApoE-/- mice were fed chow or HFD for 8 weeks. After 4 weeks of HFD, mice were randomised to a 4 -week treatment of macitentan by food (30 mg/kg/day dual ETA/ETB antagonist), or placebo groups.

This initial increase at 6 weeks in WCs was characterized by invreased concentrations of nonesterified saturated fatty acids. By 6 months of age, WC celiac cushions had greater concentrations of each lipid class except hydrocarbon than did SR cushions. This initial lipid accumulation was accompanied by ultrastructural changes within the arterial wall, which included the presence of extracellular, vesiclelike structures and extensive accumulation of basal lamina-like material between cells.

Abnormal endothelium-dependent relaxation is observed both in humans and in animal models of diabetes mellitus and decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) is thought to be involved in this defect. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) alters vascular reactivity of diabetic vessels. METHODS: Vascular reactivity was first assessed in <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> and carotid arteries from nine alloxan-induced diabetic (plasma glucose, 26. 5 +/- 1. 2 mmol/l; HbA 1 c, 6. 4 +/- 0. 3 %) and nine control rabbits (plasma glucose, 11. 1 +/- 1. 3 mmol/l; HbA 1 c, 2. 1 +/- 0. 1 %). Vascular reactivity was next examined in <b>thoracic</b> <b>aortas</b> of diabetic animals after ex vivo transduction with replication-deficient adenovirus encoding gene for eNOS (AdeNOS) or beta-galactosidase (Ad beta gal). RESULTS: After 10 weeks of hyperglycaemia, endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was impaired in diabetic aorta, but was normal in carotid arteries from diabetic rabbits. In contrast, responses of both vessels to calcium ionophore and nitric oxide donor were normal. Histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase and immunohistochemistry for eNOS showed transgene expression in the endothelium and adventitia in Ad beta gal and AdeNOS transduced vessels, respectively. During submaximum contractions with phenylephrine, relaxations to low concentrations of acetylcholine (3 x 10 (- 8) to 10 (- 7) mol/l) were augmented in AdeNOS transduced diabetic vessels.
