Thirteen male participants ran over an embedded force platform at 4. 0 m/s in the four different footwear conditions. Lower extremity kinematics were quantified via an eight-camera motion analysis system and tibial accelerations were obtained using a distally mounted accelerometer. Differences between footwear were investigated using one-way, repeated measures ANOVA. The findings confirmed that instantaneous loading rate and peak tibial acceleration were significantly larger in the barefoot (274. 19 BW/s and 5. 72 g) and minimalist (302. 91 BW/s and 5. 31 g) conditions in relation to the conventional (112. 37 BW/s and 4. 55 g) footwear. In addition it was also shown that ankle angle at footstrike was significantly more plantarflexed in the barefoot (− 8. 70 °) and minimalist (−. 92 °) conditions compared to the conventional (5. 09 °) and cross-fit (2. 16 °) conditions.

Lower limb kinematics were collected using an 8 camera motion capture system allowing patellofemoral kinetics to be quantified using a musculoskeletal modelling approach. Differences in patellofemoral kinetic parameters were examined using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. The results showed the peak patellofemoral force and pressure were significantly larger in conventional (4. 70 ± 0. 91 BW & 13. 34 ± 2. 43 MPa) and maximalist (4. 74 ± 0. 88 BW & 13. 59 ± 2. 63 MPa) compared to minimalist footwear (3. 87 ± 1. 00 BW & 11. 59 ± 2. 63 MPa). It was also revealed that patellofemoral force per mile was significantly larger in conventional (246. 81 ± 53. 21 BW) and maximalist (251. 94 ± 59. 17 BW) as compared to minimalist (227. 77 ± 58. 60 BW) footwear.

40|$|During {{atmospheric}} re-entry, intense heating of {{the shock}} layer leads to vibrational excitation, dissociation and even ionization {{of the gas}} near {{the forefront of the}} spacecraft, while further downstream, recombination reactions occur. These so called “high-temperature effects” may have a substantial impact on the forces and heat loads imposed on the vehicle. A well-known example is the “pitch-up anomaly” observed during the first Space Shuttle orbiter re-entry: An unforeseen increase of the pitching moment, which was later attributed mainly to high-temperature effects, necessitated the body flap to deflect twice the predicted amount to maintain a trimmed flight. The latest campaign at the High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel Göttingen (HEG) is presented. Its goal is to perform accurate measurements of lift, drag and pitching moment on blunt cones and determine the impact of high-temperature effects on these parameters. During previous experiments at JAXA’s HIEST shock tunnel, differences in the axial force coefficient between measurement and numerical prediction as well as indications of a possible pitch-up effect were found for high enthalpy flows around these geometries. This study aims to investigate whether these observations are facility-dependent or can be reproduced and attributed to high-temperature effects. The second objective is to assess and further improve the accuracy of the employed short-duration force measurement techniques. For <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study,</b> two <b>comparatively</b> light-weight, spherically blunted cone models with varied nose radii were manufactured and positioned in the test section via a detachable support that left them unrestrained after nozzle flow startup (free-flight technique). Experiments were conducted at different angles of attack for low and high enthalpy flow conditions. Forces and moments were measured using two different approaches simultaneously: The first technique derives lift, drag and pitching moment from a high-speed video record of the model movement using an optical tracking algorithm, while the second uses readings of accelerometers mounted inside the model. These approaches are described in detail and first results of both measurement techniques are contrasted with one another and with numerical CFD calculations obtained using the DLR TAU Code. Finally, an outlook is given on how these results relate to the HIEST experiments...|$|R
40|$|Machining of Nimonic C- 263 {{has always}} been a {{challenging}} task owing to its hot strength, low thermal conductivity, tendency to work harden and affinity towards tool material. Although coated tool has good potential to overcome some of these challenges, selection of coated tool with appropriate deposition technique is of immense significance. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> attempts to <b>comparatively</b> evaluate various performance measures during machining of Nimonic C- 263 such as surface roughness, chip characteristics, cutting temperature and tool wear with particular emphasis on different modes of tool failure for commercially available multi component coated inserts deposited using chemical vapour deposition (CVD), physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques. Furthermore, performance of uncoated tool was analyzed with respect to PVD and CVD coated tools. Results were also discussed for different cutting speeds (51, 84, 124 m/min) and feed rates (0. 1, 0. 14, 0. 2 mm/rev), and constant depth of cut (1 mm) along with the progression of machining durations (t). Severe plastic deformation and chipping of cutting edge and nose, abrasive nose and flank wear along with formation of built-up-layer (BUL) were identified as possible mechanism behind tool failure. The best machining performance was noted under a low and medium cutting speed of 51 m/min and 84 m/min respectively with PVD multilayer coated tool. In addition, influence of coolant that is under food and MQL environment was studied in comparison with dry machining using best performing PVD coated tool. It was {{interesting to note that the}} performance of PVD coated tool was comparable and sometimes even superior that of uncoated tool given under flood and MQL environment. Therefore, use of PVD multilayer coated tool under dry machining can be degraded as environment friendly technique for machining nickel based super alloy such as Nimonic C- 263...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Financial reporting fraud is a concern for investors, regulators, external auditors, and the public. Although the responsibility for fraud detection lies upon management and those charged with governance, external auditors are likely to come under scrutiny if fraud scandals come to light. Despite the audit regulators efforts in fighting fraud, evidence from prior literature revealed that external auditors still need guidance in assessing and responding to fraud risks. Hence <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> aims at helping external auditors properly assess {{and respond to the}} risk of financial reporting fraud in an effort to increase the likelihood of detecting it. In order to achieve this, <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> sought to explore the significance of various fraud factors in assessing the risks of financial reporting fraud and examined how external auditors could assess these fraud factors. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> also explored <b>the</b> likely motivations behind management fraud, the impact of management motivations on the financial statements, and how external auditors could assess the impact of management motivations. The data for <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> was collected from external auditors working at various audit firms in Egypt via the use of mixed research methods, namely through an online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The findings of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> revealed that management motives are the most significant factor in assessing the risk of financial reporting fraud. Hence <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> suggests that external audit should be viewed in terms of management motivations rather than just the audit of financial statements figures and disclosures. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> offers detailed guidance to external auditors in this area. The findings of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> also revealed that management integrity is a significant factor in assessing the risk of financial reporting fraud and that rationalisation of fraud should be assessed as part of management integrity rather than a separate fraud risk factor. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> found that fraud perpetrators capabilities are equally significant to the opportunity to commit fraud factor yet it is currently ignored by the audit standards and thus should be assessed as part of opportunity to commit fraud. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> was <b>the</b> first to explore financial reporting fraud and the extent by which external auditors comply with ISA 240 in the Egyptian context. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> offered recommendations to external auditors, audit firms, audit regulators, and the Egyptian government on how to combat financial reporting fraud.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the impact of {{fabrication}} processes on the localized corrosion behavior of Alloy 22 (N 06022). The four fabrication processes that were analyzed are: (1) Surface stress mitigation of final closure weld, (2) Manufacturing of the mockup container, (3) Black annealing of the container and (4) Use of different heats of Alloy 22 for container fabrication. Immersion and Electrochemical tests performed in the laboratory are generally aggressive and do not represent actual repository environments in Yucca Mountain. For example, to determine the intergranular attack in the heat affected zone of a weldment, tests are conducted in boiling acidic and oxidizing solutions according to ASTM standards. These solutions are used to compare the behavior of differently treated metallic coupons. Similarly for electrochemical tests many times pure sodium chloride or calcium chloride solutions are used. Pure chloride solutions are not representative of the repository environment. (1) Surface Stress Mitigation: When metallic plates are welded, for example using the Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) method, residual tensile stresses may develop {{in the vicinity of the}} weld seam. Processes such as Low Plasticity Burnishing (LPB) and Laser Shock Peening (LSP) could be applied locally to eliminate the residual stresses produced by welding. In this study, Alloy 22 plates were welded and then the above-mentioned surface treatments were applied to eliminate the residual tensile stresses. The aim of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>study</b> was to <b>comparatively</b> test the corrosion behavior of as-welded (ASW) plates with the corrosion behavior of plates with stress mitigated surfaces. Immersion and electrochemical tests were performed. Results from both immersion and electrochemical corrosion tests show that the corrosion resistance of the mitigated plates was not affected by the surface treatments applied. (2) Behavior of Specimens from a Mockup container: Alloy 22 has been extensively tested for general and localized corrosion behavior both in the wrought and annealed condition and in the as-welded condition. The specimens for testing were mostly prepared from flat plates of material. It was important to determine if the process of fabricating a full diameter Alloy 22 container will affect the corrosion performance of this alloy. Specimens were prepared directly from a fabricated container and tested for corrosion resistance. Results show that both the anodic corrosion behavior and the localized corrosion resistance of specimens prepared from a welded fabricated container were the same as from flat welded plates. That is, rolling and welding plates using industrial practices do not hinder the corrosion resistant of Alloy 22. (3) Effect of Black Annealing Oxide Scale: The resistance of Alloy 22 to localized corrosion, mainly crevice corrosion, has been extensively investigated in the last few years. This was done mostly using freshly polished specimens. At this time it was important to address the effect an oxide film or scale that forms during the high temperature annealing process or solution heat treatment (SHT) and its subsequent water quenching. Electrochemical tests such as cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) have been carried out to determine the repassivation potential for localized corrosion and to assess the mode of attack on the specimens. Tests have been carried out in parallel using mill annealed (MA) specimens free from oxide on the surface. The comparative testing was carried out in six different electrolyte solutions at temperatures ranging from 60 to 100 C. Results show that the repassivation potential of the specimens containing the black anneal oxide film on the surface was practically the same as the repassivation potential for oxide-free specimens. (4) Heat-to-Heat Variability [...] Testing of Ni-Cr-Mo Plates with varying heat chemistry: The ASTM standard B 575 provides the range of the chemical composition of Nickel-Chromium-Molybdenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) alloys such as Alloy 22 (N 06022) and Alloy 686 (N 06686). For example, the content of Mo is specified from 12. 5 to 14. 5 weight percent for Alloy 22 and from 15. 0 to 17. 0 weight percent for Alloy 686. It was important to determine how the corrosion rate of welded plates of Alloy 22 using Alloy 686 weld filler metal would change if heats of these alloys were prepared using several variations in the composition of the elements even though still in the range specified in B 575. All the material used in this report were especially prepared at Allegheny Ludlum Co. Seven heats of plate were welded with seven heats of wire. Immersion corrosion tests were conducted in a boiling solution of sulfuric acid plus ferric sulfate (ASTM G 28 A) using both as-welded (ASW) coupons and solution heat-treated (SHT) coupons. Results show that the corrosion rate was not affected by the chemistry of the materials within the range of the standards...|$|R
