5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Walternate's machine has been detected by the Fringe division and Fauxlivia {{and her team}} go to investigate. When Walternate tells them to stand down, Fauxilivia asks him about her recent mission to the prime universe and <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>that</b> she recovered. Walternate admits {{to her that the}} machine has been activated, having sacrificed his own son Peter to allow Fauxlivia's son to live. Fauxlivia becomes distressed at Walternate's actions, and later returns to Liberty Island to obtain the devices to allow her to cross to the prime universe, but is caught before she can use them. Walternate locks her away, seeing her as a traitor to his cause.|$|E

National Geographic quoted him about <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>that</b> the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public. The same year, Technology Review quoted Romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies, and the Toronto Star quoted him regarding President Obama's 2011 State of the Union address. In 2012 in The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman cited Romm on the connection between drought and Climate change, and The Atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the Democrats to discuss climate change. National Geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear, and Current TV's Bill Press interviewed Romm about record-breaking heat.|$|E

The Bene Gesserit try over many generations through selective breeding to produce such a being. A Kwisatz Haderach is given abilities different from those of a Reverend Mother. During the spice agony, there are two areas of the soul that the acolyte may visit — <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>that</b> gives, and <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>that</b> takes; a Reverend Mother cannot access the memories of her male ancestors, and is terrified by the psychic space within her that the masculine memories inhabit.
