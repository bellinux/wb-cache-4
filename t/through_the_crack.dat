25|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 November 1888, {{the day of the}} annual Lord Mayor's Day celebrations, Kelly's {{landlord}} John McCarthy sent his assistant, ex-soldier Thomas Bowyer, to collect the rent. Kelly was six weeks behind on her payments, owing 29 shillings. Shortly after 10:45a.m., Bowyer knocked on her door but received no response. He reached <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> in the window, pushed aside a coat being used as a curtain and peered insideâ€”discovering Kelly's horribly mutilated corpse lying on the bed.|$|E

[...] through time and space to draw the Doctor in. They also send through a truth field so that when the Doctor arrives he will say his real name, with the field making sure it's the real one, which will be a signal for them to return. As [...] "half the universe" [...] are at Trenzalore waiting for this, the Eleventh Doctor refuses as it will restart the Time War. When a very old and frail Doctor goes to meet his demise {{at the hands of the}} Daleks, Clara Oswald begs the Time Lords <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> to intervene, and the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> before closing it, changing the Doctor's future and allowing him to defeat the Daleks and save Trenzalore.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the visible gap length {{may be used as}} a {{physical}} parameter when correlating pressure difference to volume flow rate (or air velocity) <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> between floorboards and can be termed <b>the</b> Equivalent <b>Crack</b> Length. <b>The</b> <b>crack</b> widths, which previously have been determined separately from the edge effect coefficient and the laminar flow coefficient, were significantly different. When analysed graphically they can be shown to correlate by an empirical relationship. A generalised equation is proposed that, in conjunction with the empirical relationship, allows predictions to be made of the volume flow rate <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> between floorboards for a known pressure difference...|$|R
