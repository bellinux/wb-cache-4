5|$|O'Neill's tenure lasted {{just six}} months; he {{resigned}} after {{a dispute with}} chairman Robert Chase over Chase's refusal <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> O'Neill to spend significant sums on strengthening the squad. According to O'Neill, the tipping point was the refusal of Chase <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> the purchase of Dean Windass. Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in new players and consequently was to blame for relegation.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the EU {{directive}} 80/181/EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009. This was backed up by requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> metric-only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries. Opinion in the United States was split – a bill <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> metric-only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the Food Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|In August 1943, {{recruiting}} {{policies were}} changed <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> SPARS to marry {{men of the}} USCG without having to resign. The USCG would continue to accept applicants who were married to men in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, but would not accept {{a woman who was}} already married to an enlisted man or an officer serving in the USCG. However, women could join the SPARS if their husbands were enrolled as temporary members of the reserve. In November 1943, the marriage policy with respect to recruits was changed further <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> women who were wives of cadets, warrant officers, or enlisted men of the USCG to enlist or be commissioned in the SPARs. The ban remained on women whose husbands were commissioned officers in the USCG with the rank of ensign or above.|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{tested in}} this study, {{carried out on}} elderly Italian women with recent hip fracture, {{was to assess the}} extent to which the effect of a condition of being overweight/obese on short-term functional recovery as evaluated by the “time <b>to</b> <b>permitted</b> load” could be explained by a mediator variable (type of hip fracture). We studied 727 women aged 60  years or over with a recent low trauma surgically treated hip fracture and for whom an information on post-surgery complications and on the time <b>to</b> <b>permitted</b> load was available. To assess for mediation, the statistical analyses were carried out following the procedure described by Baron and Kenny. In this study, 46  % of women with hip fracture presented a time <b>to</b> <b>permitted</b> load of ≥ 10  days. The women with a post-surgery time <b>to</b> <b>permitted</b> load of ≥ 10  days showed a significantly higher proportion of trochanteric fracture localization (72. 1 vs 42  %), of total overweight/obesity (46. 5 vs 36. 8  %) and of post-surgery complications (38. 8 vs 18. 8  %). The mediating effect of hip fracture localization on the association between overweight/obesity and the time of permitted load was demonstrated and confirmed in a multivariate logistic regression model. This study, carried out using a “mediator” statistical analysis, suggests that in elderly women with hip fracture being overweight/obese is associated with a slower short-term functional recovery as evaluated by the time <b>to</b> <b>permitted</b> load and that this association is mediated by the trochanteric localization of hip fracture...|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} self-extracting revolvers (such as the Webley service revolvers or the Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolver), the Enfield Mk I/Mk II was {{complicated}} to unload, having an Owen Jones selective extraction/ejection system {{which was supposed}} to allow the firer to eject spent cartridges, whilst retaining live rounds in the cylinder. The Enfield Mk I/Mk II had a hinged frame, and when the barrel was unlatched, the cylinder would move forward, operating the extraction system and allowing the spent cartridges to simply fall out. The idea was that the cylinder moved forward far enough <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> fired cases to be completely extracted (and ejected by gravity), but not far enough <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> live cartridges (i.e., those with projectiles still present, and thus longer in overall length) from being removed in the same manner.|$|E
