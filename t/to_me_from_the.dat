5|$|O you, Son, who, {{concealed}} in your mother's womb, you gather together peoples by your Father's act – for I perchance {{am able to}} compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God, because, glorious one, the glittering stars show (you) to the world; and I ask, after the close of my life, that you grant <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of the honour (I have) attained.|$|E
500|$|The {{audience}} {{reception of}} Jonas Quinn was sparked with controversy over Michael Shanks' {{departure from the}} show. When rumors began late in 2001 that Showtime would also not be renewing StargateSG-1 after its fifth season, panicking fans rallied to save the show and Daniel's character, starting massive write-in campaigns and setting up websites such as the [...] "Save Daniel Jackson" [...] site. The SciFi Channel eventually ordered a sixth season of the show, but the character of Jonas continued to be distrusted by loyal fans, who were concerned that Daniel's death might cause the SG-1 team to lose its moral compass. Robert C. Cooper summarized that [...] "there's been {{quite a bit of}} ire directed by fans towards Daniel's replacement" [...] after the airing of [...] "Meridian", but he hoped that the character would grow on fans eventually. Producer Joseph Mallozzi claimed at the beginning of season 6 to still get the [...] "odd incoherent rambling death threat passed along <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> [...] site".|$|E

2500|$|As a {{child the}} young Fyodor Dostoyevsky was deeply {{impressed}} by Radcliffe. In Winter Notes on Summer Impressions (1863) he writes, [...] "I {{used to spend}} the long winter hours before bed listening (for I could not yet read), agape with ecstasy and terror, as my parents read aloud <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> novels of Ann Radcliffe. Then I would rave deliriously about them in my sleep." [...] A number of scholars have noted elements of Gothic literature in Dostoyevsky's novels, and some have attempted to show direct influence of Radcliffe's work.|$|E
2500|$|The commandment against murder can {{be viewed}} as a legal issue {{governing}} human relationships, noting that the first four commandments relate strongly to man's duty to God and that the latter six commandments describe duties toward humans. [...] The commandment against murder can also be viewed as based in respect for God himself. [...] Since man is made in God's image, the shedding of innocent blood is viewed as a direct offense against God.

And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand." [...] (ESV) ...|$|E

A restless {{wanderer}} shall you be on the earth." [...] 13 And Cain said to the Lord, [...] "My punishment is too great to bear. 14Now that You have driven me this day from the soil I must hide from Your presence, I shall be a restless wanderer on the earth and whoever finds me will kill me." [...] 15And the Lord said to him, [...] "Therefore whoever kills Cain shall suffer sevenfold vengeance." [...] And the Lord set a mark upon Cain so that whoever found him would not slay him." ...|$|E
