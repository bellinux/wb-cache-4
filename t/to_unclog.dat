40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The hyporheic zone plays a {{key role}} in hydrological exchange and biogeochemical processes in streambed sediments. The clogging of sediments caused by the deposition of particles in the bed of streams and rivers can decrease sediment permeability and hence greatly affect hyporheic microbial processes. 2. The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of sediment clogging on hyporheic microbial processes in three French rivers (the Usses, Drome and Isere). In each river, microbial abundance and activity were studied at three depths (10, 30 and 50 cm) in the sediment at one unclogged (high porosity) and one clogged site (low porosity). 3. The results showed that the sediment clogging had inconsistent effects on microbial processes in the three rivers. Increases (Usses) or decreases (Drome and Isere) in both aerobic and anaerobic processes were detected at the clogged sites compared <b>to</b> <b>unclogged</b> sites. These results suggest that microbial changes because of the sediment clogging are mainly mediated by the residence time of water within the hyporheic sediments. 4. A single model predicting the effect of clogging on hyporheic microbial processes cannot be applied generally to all rivers because the degree of clogging creates heterogeneous effects on flow rates between surface and interstitial waters. As a consequence, the influence of heterogeneous clogging on surface water-hyporheic exchanges needs to be evaluated by water tracing and hydraulic modelling to determine the links between microbial processes and hydraulic heterogeneity induced by clogging in hyporheic sediments...|$|R

Creosote, which is the by-product of the incomplete burning of wood (typically due to chronic combustion-air insufficiency), is extinguished by the chain reaction caused by the chimney bombs. Chimney bombs work by first being dropped directly down a chimney, where upon contact with the flue bottom and heat of the fire, they explode, thereby releasing the powder. Then, the natural chimney draft will carry the dry chemical powder up the shaft of the chimney, thus coating the creosote and eventually neutralizing the fire. Use of multiple chimney bombs may be necessary, depending on how severe the fire is. Chimney bombs can also be effective if they are opened and then dropped down the chimney.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to achieve an efficient and cheap methods to remove H 2 S from the factories emissions. Four serial cylinders are designed, 40 cm in height and 15 cm in diameter each. They are filled with bivalve seashells with 63 % porosity which contains Thiobacillus thioparus bacteria to the maximum height of 27. 5 cm. By mixing phosphoric acid and sodium sulfide, H 2 S gas is released and its concentration is measured as mg m - 3 before injecting into the cylinders. A permanent measuring instrument is equipped to control the gas coming out of the cylinders. In order to prevent the outdoor environment from pollution, first the gas is sent through two activated carbon columns and then sent through a ferrous chloride scrubber. Finally it is burnt directly by flames. There were 550 sample readings in 15 weeks. The changes in the discharge of the air which carries the gas are considered between 1 - 12 L min - 1 and the concentration of the influent pollutant is considered between 1 - 140 mg m - 3. Also the humidity in the atmosphere is fixed between 77 - 93 % and the optimum temperature required for growing of the microorganisms is retained between 20. 5 - 30 ° C. After feeding the system for three weeks the efficiency started to increase so {{that by the end of}} the final week of {{this research}} the efficiency reached to 90 % with the discharge of 6 L min - 1 of the carrier gas. The results achieved from this research show that because of not using Filamentous bacteria, clogging did not occur in the biological system in biofilters.

40|$|International audienceTriggering {{large-scale}} {{motion by}} imposing vibrations {{to a system}} can be encountered in many situations, from daily-life shaking of saltcellar <b>to</b> silo <b>unclogging</b> or dynamic earthquakes triggering. In the well-known situation of solid or granular friction, the acceleration of imposed vibrations has often been proposed as the governing parameter for the transition between stick-slip motion and continuous sliding. The threshold acceleration for the onset of continuous slip motion or system unjamming is usually found {{of the order of}} the gravitational acceleration. These conclusions are mostly drawn from numerical studies. Here, we investigate, in the laboratory, granular friction by shearing a layer of grains subjected to horizontal vibrations. We show that, in contrast with previous results, the quantity that controls the frictional properties is the characteristic velocity, and not the acceleration, of the imposed mechanical vibrations. Thus, when the system is statically loaded, the typical acceleration of the vibrations which trigger large slip events is much smaller than the gravitational acceleration. These results may be relevant to understand dynamic earthquake triggering by small ground perturbations. Granular assemblies are athermal systems, often used as paradigms to study the dynamics of industrial or natural processes, such as fault gouge and earthquake nucleation 1 – 6. When submitted to mechanical vibrations, granular media can behave as thermalized fluids when the vibrations are large enough, or remain in a solid-like state for small enough vibrations. Such a transition between jammed and unjammed states has been reported to occur when the peak-acceleration characterizing the vibration is of the order of the gravitational acceleration 7,...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{controlling}} the liquid level in the mold of a continuous casting process is considered. Essentially, the system operates in two different modes: (a) {{one in which the}} system is affected only by small-amplitude high-frequency disturbances, and (b) one in which the system is affected by a comparatively large disturbance related <b>to</b> an abrupt <b>unclogging</b> phenomenon. <b>To</b> cope with the first situation, the control system must exhibit a narrow bandwidth, whereas the second situation requires a much larger bandwidth. The two conflicting requirements lead naturally to the design of two distinct controllers and a switching rule that activates either controller according to the operating condition. Due to the time-varying nature of the resulting control system, the controllers should be properly realized to guarantee stability; to this purpose, a recent result on switching systems [15] is invoked. Since the sudden switching between controllers can cause controller and actuator output bumps, a soft switching policy that still ensures stability is also proposed. Simulations and laboratory experiments carried out on an electronic analogue of the process show the effectiveness of the suggested control schemes...|$|R

40|$|In this {{experimental}} work on granular materials, we study {{the stability of}} arches blocking the exit of a silo against external vibrations. When a group of particles flow through a bottleneck, they are prone to spontaneously developing clogs, even if the orifice size {{is greater than the}} particles. This is due to the formation of arrangements of mutually stabilizing sets of grains that appear at the bottleneck, which are called arches. To restore the flow, those arches must be shattered by an external perturbation. This study aims at investigating this process. An arch collapses because one particle is separated from the others. A detailed analysis reveals that the main factor determining the arch stability is the angle between one grain and its neighbours, Ø: the arches preferably break at the bead with maximum angle, Ømax. The acceleration needed to break an arch is called Gamma. The experiments show that the higher the maximum angle, the easier it is to break the arch. This relationship is the same regardless of the orifice size, the rate of the acceleration ramp and the material of which particles are made. Although Gamma seems to depend on other properties of the arch, this relationship is indirect and is only due to the influence of these properties on Ømax. Furthermore, for the cases where max in the arch is above 180 º -which are called defects- we have introduced a simple model that resorts to the forces in the arch to explain the observed behaviour. The study of the time that an arch can resist to a constant vibration shows that its distribution has a power-law tail, indicating that there is no characteristic time scale. Depending on the value of the exponent alpha, a clogged state (if alpha> 2) or unclogged state (if alpha> 2) can be defined. Thus, a transition from a clogged <b>to</b> an <b>unclogged</b> state may be obtained by increasing the intensity of the vibration Gamma, enlarging the outlet size or reducing the layer of grains above the clogging arch. In other words, the clog is hindered if the opening is enlarged, the compatible load is diminished or the incompatible load is increased. This knowledge could be the starting point for further research on other systems that get clogged...|$|R
