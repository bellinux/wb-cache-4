In this work, the <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-linking</b> of the 6 FDA-DAM:DABA at temperatures much below the glass transition temperature (∼ 387 °C by DSC) was demonstrated. This sub-Tg cross-linking capability enables extension to asymmetric structures useful for large scale membranes. The resulting polymer membranes were characterized by swelling in known solvents for the un-cross-linked materials, TGA analysis, and permeation tests of aggressive gas feed stream at higher pressure. The annealing temperature and time clearly influence the degree of cross-linking of the membranes, and results in a slight difference in selectivity for membranes under various cross-linking conditions.

This work focuses on the further functionalization of L-aspartic acid based PEAs, scaffold fabrication and cross-linking of the scaffold to improve morphological stability. Photo-cross-linkable and thermally cross-linkable PEAs were synthesized successfully and characterized.

It is a carbohydrate polymer {{derived from}} the deacetylation of the chitin component of the shells of crustacean; hence, it is a renewable material widely available as a byproduct of the food industry. Owing to its extremely interesting properties, chitosan has been extensively applied to textile fibers to confer various functional properties such as • antimicrobial activity with a green chemistry approach for aesthetic, hygienic, and medical applications; • antifelting properties for wool fabrics; • increasing uptake of ionic dyes in dyeing processes; • removal of dyes and other organic pollutants from wastewaters; • removal of heavy metal ions from contaminated wastewaters.

The POSS additives were functionalized with maleamic acid or aminophenyl groups as ligands to enable selective hydrogen bonding with the PEO chains. The selective interaction of the additives with the PEO chains caused microphase separation of the block copolymer leading to formation of well-ordered morphologies as evidenced by small-angle X-ray scattering. Further addition of the additive induced transitions between cylindrical and spherical morphologies. While both ligands induced order, the maleamic acid ligand enabled higher levels of incorporation of POSS cages into the PEO phases of the composite.

Toward this goal, PMMA-co-CPO- 3 and two cross-linkable polymers (PCC 1 -CPO- 3 and PCC 2 -CPO- 3) were first prepared and characterized by a modified Teng and Man technique performed in transmission. These first series of polymers were not compatible with the applied poling conditions because an irreversible film degradation was systematically observed at a temperature significantly lower than the cross-linking temperature. Consequently, a second series of polymers was prepared, in which the cross-linking temperature was decreased by functionalizing acetylenic moieties with ester electron withdrawing groups, which decrease the activation energy of the thermal Huisgen cyclo-addition. These new polymers were stable until the cross-linking reaction, and they exhibit bulk electro-optic coefficients (r 33) until 41 pm/V at 1. 5 μm. Furthermore, it was shown that the Huisgen cross-linking reaction is compatible with such push–pull polyene-based chromophores, and it systematically enhances the stability of the electro-optic activity because chromophore orientation was maintained up to 96 °C against 70 °C for the same uncross-linked polymer...|$|R
30|$|For {{application}} in a DMFC, polymer electrolyte membrane {{needs to have}} a low methanol crossover. The commonly used Nafion membrane has relatively high methanol permeability. Chitosan has been employed as a promising polymeric matrix for DMFC application considering its low cost, desirable alcohol barrier property and proton conductivity as well as adequate <b>thermal</b> stability after <b>cross-linking</b> [26, 92]. In its dry state, chitosan has a very low electrical conductivity. The addition of salts leads to the formation of complex between salts and chitosan matrix, and also enhancement of its amorphous nature [93]. Plasticization is able to increase the amorphous content and thus improves the conductivity of a solid polymer electrolyte [94]. Cross-linking is proposed to reduce crystallinity of chitosan membrane and simultaneously enhance the ionic transport [95]. Chitosan is hydrophilic and consequently has a high degree of swelling. An excessively high level of water uptake increases the fragility of the membrane and makes it less durable in fuel cells. To overcome the disadvantage of loss in mechanical strength in the wet state, chitosan is blended with tough polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) [96]. Mat, et al. fabricated a polymer electrolyte composite membrane that comprises of chitosan, PVA and calcium oxide (CaO). These results indicate that chitosan-PVA-CaO composite membranes have excellent methanol barrier properties which in turn make them feasible for DMFC applications [3].|$|R

However, collagen tissue-engineered implants are hereto still lacking in mechanical strength. Attempts to create stiffer scaffolds have resulted in increased brittleness of the material, reducing the versatility of the original component. The hypothesis behind this research is that the introduction of an elastic element in the scaffold will enhance the mechanical properties of the collagen-based scaffolds, as elastin does in the ECM to prevent irreversible deformation. In this study, an elastin-like polymer (ELP) designed and synthesized using recombinant DNA methodology is used with the view to providing increased proteolytic resistance and increased functionality to the scaffolds by carrying specific sequences for microbial transglutaminase cross-linking, endothelial cell adhesion, and drug delivery. Evaluation of the effects that cross-linking ELP-collagen has on the physicochemical properties of the scaffold such as porosity, presence of <b>cross-linking,</b> <b>thermal</b> behavior, and mechanical strength demonstrated that the introduction of enzymatically resistant covalent bonds between collagen and ELP increases the mechanical strength of the scaffolds in a dose-dependent manner without significantly affecting the porosity or thermal properties of the original scaffold.

During heating of w/o emulsions containing 10 % (w/v) WPI proteins {{in the water}} phase, the emulsions displayed turbid-transparent-turbid phase transitions, which is ascribed to {{the change in the}} size of the protein-containing water droplets caused by <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-linking</b> between denatured protein molecules. The transparent stage indicated the formation of WPI NPs. WPI NPs of different sizes were obtained by varying the mixing speed. WPI NPs of 200 - 500. nm were selected to prepare o/w Pickering emulsions because of their good stability against coalescence. By Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy, it was observed that WPI NPs were closely packed and distributed at the surface of the emulsion droplets. By measuring water contact angles of WPI NPs films, it was found that under most conditions WPI NPs present good partial wetting properties, but that at the isoelectric point (p. I) and high ionic strength the particles become more hydrophobic, resulting in less stable Pickering emulsion. Thus, at pH above and below the p. I of WPI NPs and low to moderate ionic strengths (1 - 10. mM), and with a WPI NPs concentration of 2 % (w/v), a stable Pickering emulsion can be obtained. The results may provide useful information for applications of WPI NPs in environmentally friendly and food grade applications, notably in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. </p...|$|E

40|$|Polyhydroxyamide (PHA) and polymethoxyamide (PMeOA) are {{fire-retardant}} (FR) thermoplastic polymers {{and have}} been found to be useful as an additive for imparting fire retardant properties to other compatible, thermoplastic polymers (including some elastomers). Examples of compatible flammable polymers include nylons, polyesters, and acrylics. Unlike most prior additives, PHA and PMeOA do not appreciably degrade the mechanical properties of the matrix polymer; indeed, in some cases, mechanical properties are enhanced. Also, unlike some prior additives, PHA and PMeOA do not decompose into large amounts of corrosive or toxic compounds during combustion and can be processed at elevated temperatures. PMeOA derivative formulations were synthesized and used as an FR additive in the fabrication of polyamide (PA) and polystyrene (PS) composites with notable reduction (> 30 percent for PS) in peak heat release rates compared to the neat polymer as measured by a Cone Calorimeter (ASTM E 1354). Synergistic effects were noted with nanosilica composites. These nanosilica composites had more than 50 -percent reduction in peak heat release rates. In a typical application, a flammable thermoplastic, thermoplastic blend, or elastomer that one seeks to render flame-retardant is first dry-mixed with PHA or PMeOA or derivative thereof. The proportion of PHA or PMeOA or derivative in the mixture is typically chosen to lie between 1 and 20 weight percent. The dry blend can then be melt-extruded. The extruded polymer blend can further be extruded and/or molded into fibers, pipes, or any other of a variety of objects that may be required to be fire-retardant. The physical and chemical mechanisms which impart flame retardancy of the additive include inhibiting free-radical oxidation in the vapor phase, preventing vaporization of fuel (the polymer), and cooling through the formation of chemical bonds in either the vapor or the condensed phase. Under thermal stress, the cyclic hydroxyl/ methoxy component forms polybenzoxazole (PBO) in a reaction that absorbs heat from its surroundings. PBO under <b>thermal</b> stress <b>cross-links,</b> forming a protective char layer, which thermally insulates the polymer.

40|$|This work is {{composed}} of three parts. Part 1 is {{about the relationship between}} the <b>cross-linking,</b> <b>thermal</b> stability and char formation. For a long time people have believed that <b>cross-linking</b> improves the <b>thermal</b> stability of polymers and renders a polymer less burnable than a non-cross-linked polymer. From the study of cross-linked polydienes, {{it has been shown that}} the cross-linking regions do have a better thermal stability than non-cross-linking counterparts, but the cross-linking may lower the thermal stability of non-cross-linking regions. Also the cross-linking structures rather than the numbers of cross-linking determine the char formation. Part II studies the thermal degradation of poly(vinyl chloride) in the presence of a second polymer such as polystyrene. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the stabilizing mechanism of polystyrene on the thermal degradation of poly(vinyl chloride). The traditional explanation was through hydrogen that the changes in the physical state and Friedel-Crafts reactions contribute to the stabilizing action of polystyrene. Part III addresses the thermal degradation of poly(sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate) by TGA/FTIR, NMR, and other techniques. The goals of this work are to examine the possibility of sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate as a char-former and understand its thermal degradation pathway and potential use as a flame retardancy additive in polystyrene.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{stability}} of a virus-like particle (VLP) {{is an important}} consideration for its use in nanobiotechnology. The icosahedral capsid of the RNA bacteriophage PP 7 is cross-linked by disulfide bonds between coat protein dimers at its 5 -fold and quasi- 6 -fold symmetry axes. This work determined {{the effects of these}} disulfides on the VLP's thermal stability. Results Measurements of the thermal denaturation behavior of PP 7 VLPs in the presence and absence of a reducing agent show that disulfide cross-links substantially stabilize them against thermal denaturation. Although dimers in the capsid are linked to one another by disulfides, the two subunits of dimers themselves are held together only by non-covalent interactions. In an effort to confer even greater stability a new cross-link was introduced by genetically fusing two coat protein monomers, thus producing a "single-chain dimer" that assembles normally into a completely cross-linked VLP. However, subunit fusion failed to increase the thermal {{stability of}} the particles, even though it stabilized the isolated dimer. As a step toward gaining control of the internal composition of the capsid, conditions that promote the assembly of PP 7 coat protein dimers into virus-like particles in vitro were established. Conclusion The presence of inter-dimer disulfide bonds greatly stabilizes the PP 7 virus-like particle against <b>thermal</b> denaturation. Covalently <b>cross-linking</b> the subunits of the dimers themselves by genetically fusing them through a dipeptide linker sequence, offers no further stabilization of the VLP, although it does stabilize the dimer.

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of two parts. In Part I, Cross-Linking of Polystyrene by Friedel-Crafts Chemistry, Polystyrene has been copolymerized with 4 -vinylbenzyl alcohol, 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) styrene, and 4 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) styrene {{and it has been}} shown that <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-linking</b> of these copolymers is dependent upon the alcohol content. When the alcohol content is low, no <b>thermal</b> <b>cross-linking</b> is observed. When various phosphate esters are present as catalysts with these low alcohol content copolymers, cross-linking is observed at temperatures of about 250 °C but not at lower temperatures. Cross-linking enhances the thermal stability of the copolymers. There is little difference in the thermal stability of all three copolymers and their blends with the phosphate additives. Finally, various difunctional compounds have been prepared to investigate the possibility of functionalized polystyrene formed in an extruder. In part II, The Flame Retardancy of Polymer-Clay Nanocomposites, various organic modifiers have been synthesized and their modified clays were obtained. The polymer-clay nanocomposites (PCN) were prepared from in-situ polymerization of monomer with organic modified clay. The structures of nanocomposites were measured by x-ray diffraction, XRD, and transmission electron microscopy, TEM, or atomic force microscopy, AFM. Both intercalated and exfoliated polymer nanocomposites have been obtained. The nanocomposites greatly improve thermal stability of polymer and show higher flame retardancy through Cone Calorimetry. Structural affinity between monomer and the organic group of modified clay is an important factor in preparing well-dispersed nanocomposites. For example, the benzyl-containing clay is better for polystyrene, but not good for poly (methyl methacrylate). In addition to the char barrier mechanism proposed by Gilman, paramagnetic effect also contributes to the thermal stability and flame retardancy of nanocomposites. The mechanical properties of nanocomposites are much better than those of pure polymer, such as strength, modulus, etc. The mechanism of clay exfoliation in nanocomposites has been proposed, and possible techniques to form exfoliated nanocomposites have been discussed...|$|E

While the expressed full-length S glycoprotein was exclusively cell associated, a truncation of S by excluding the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains {{resulted in the}} expression of an endoplasmic reticulum-localized glycoprotein (gp 160) as well as a Golgi-specific form (gp 170) which was ultimately secreted into the cell culture medium. Chemical <b>cross-linking,</b> <b>thermal</b> denaturation, and size fractionation analyses suggested that the full-length S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV forms a higher order structure of ∼ 500 kDa, which is consistent with it being an S homotrimer. The latter was also observed in purified virions. The intracellular form of the C-terminally truncated S protein (but not the secreted form) also forms trimers, but with much less efficiency than full-length S. Deglycosylation of the full-length homotrimer with peptide N-glycosidase-F under native conditions abolished recognition of the protein by virus-neutralizing antisera raised against purified virions, suggesting the importance of the carbohydrate in the correct folding of the S protein. These data should aid in the design of recombinant vaccine antigens {{to prevent the spread of}} this emerging pathogen...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Polymer {{coatings}} often contain degradation-susceptible regions, and corrosion of {{the metallic}} substrate can occur directly underneath these regions. In this paper, the microstructure of model coating materials is investigated using {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM). Specifically, AFM is used to study heterogeneity in thin film blends of polystyrene (PS) and polybutadiene (PB) {{as a function of}} annealing time at 80 °C. PS/PB blend films with thicknesses of approximately 250 nm are prepared by spin casting from solutions onto silicon substrates. Both topographic and phase imaging in tapping mode AFM are performed on these films under ambient conditions and at different force levels using a silicon tip. For certain force levels, phase imaging provides good contrast between the phase-separated PS and PB regions, primarily because of the large compliance difference between the two materials. This contrast decreases with increasing annealing time because <b>thermal</b> oxidation causes <b>cross-linking</b> in PB, and thus, the compliance of the PB region increases toward that of PS. Nanoscale indentation measurements are then made on the observed phase-separated regions to identify these regions as PS- and PB-rich and to better understand the influence of relative surface stiffness on the phase images. Cast and free-standing films of pure PS and pure PB are also studied as a function of annealing time using AFM, contact angle measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Results from studies of the individual PS and PB films are related to the AFM results for the blend films. The use of phase imaging for cure monitoring of polymers and for studies of chemically heterogeneous polymer systems is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|As a {{response}} to the growing concern linked to the anthropogenic contribution to global climate change due to carbon emission, a large amount of research is now focused to develop new technologies for its capture prior to the release in the atmosphere. Amongst the various methodologies, gas separation membranes occupy an ever-growing share of the separation technologies. In particular, facilitated transport membranes (FTMs) are gaining an exponentially large interest in the research community. These films rely on a reversible reaction between a target component in the gas feed and functionalized groups embedded in the membrane matrix. Throughout this work different kinds of FTMs have been synthesized and tested, in order to gain insight on their permeation properties. A first part of the work was dedicated to the study of Polyvinyl alcohol based membrane, which were functionalized in two different ways: by the grafting of amine functionalized molecule to the polymeric chain and by the addition of nanoparticles provided with amine moieties. Subsequently, the main study presented in this thesis concerned the synthesis of selective films, resulted by the blending of polyvinylamine (for the functionality) and nanocellulose (for the structural support). Various ratios of the two components where explored at different degrees of humidity and good results were achieved, maxing the CO 2 /N 2 selectivity at 211 the CO 2 /CH 4 one at 122 at 35 °C. When swelling at high humidity was observed, several polymer modification were employed to tackle the issue, ranging from chemical <b>cross-linking,</b> <b>thermal</b> treatment and polymer purification. This allowed to increase the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity up to 410 at 35 °C and minimize swelling. Overall, it was possible to synthesize performing amine based fixed site facilitated transport membranes for the separation of carbon dioxide and find new methods for the improvements of their characteristics...|$|R
