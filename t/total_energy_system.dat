Three such systems, the Improved Wind Furnace System and the Wind Driven Total Energy Systems, Types I and II, for the supply of energy to electrical, space heating and domestic hot water loads are considered for New England residential and farm applications. These systems are studied {{with the aid of}} an interactive digital computer simulation (WDTEST) and an economics program (WSDECO). Although the programs incorporate some idealizations, they represent a necessary preliminary investigation of the total system and its components. The computer models are designed to be general enough to allow for wide variations of loads, component sizes, working fluids and energy costs, but specific enough to approach an optimum design point based on maximum energy efficiency or minimum total system costs. 	Results indicate that the Wind Driven <b>Total</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>System,</b> Type II model requires the least amount of auxiliary energy input to the system for all three residential and farm settings considered.

Various configuration options [...] types of technologies and existence of components have been incorporated in the generic system.

In addition, one needs to ask how energy demand should be satisfied securely and economically, as well as environmentally benignly, over the next decades. This study investigates the possible future configuration of energy and CO 2 -related infrastructure in Asia and Eurasia, using a large-scale energy system model, which minimises inter-temporally the sum of the discounted <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> costs until the year 2050. The model explicitly involves intra-regional transportation networks of fuels and recovered CO 2 among approximately 100 nodes in Asia and Eurasia. The preliminary results indicate that long distance natural gas pipelines will be developed extensively in Asia and Eurasia, and that issuing carbon taxes of a few hundred dollars per ton of carbon enhance substantially the consumption of natural gas in electricity generation sectors, as a substitute fuel for coal. Such carbon taxes will make CO 2 sequestration economically viable while increasing the cumulative amount of CO 2 sequestration up to 15 gigatons (Gt) of CO 2. energy transportation infrastructure; Asia; CO 2 recovery and disposal; energy system model; linear programming. ...|$|E

This conversion {{can be achieved}} for example, by replacing electrical heating with DH and compression cooling with heat-driven absorption cooling. Conversion to DH must, however, always be an economically attractive choice for an industry. In this paper the effects for industries and the local DH supplier are analysed when pricing DH by marginal cost in combination with industrial energy efficiency measures. Energy audits {{have shown that the}} analysed industries can reduce their annual electricity use by 30 % and increase the use of DH by 56 %. When marginal costs are applied as DH tariffs and the industrial energy efficiency measures are implemented, the industrial energy costs can be reduced by 17 %.

40|$|We use the MESSAGE {{model to}} examine {{multiple}} dimensions {{of sustainable development}} for three Asian regions {{in a set of}} scenarios developed for the Asian Modelling Exercise. Using climate change mitigation {{as a starting point for}} the analysis, we focus on the interaction of climate and energy with technology choice, energy security, energy access, and air pollution, which often have higher policy priority than climate change. Stringent climate policies drive the future energy supply in Asia from being dominated by coal and oil to a more diversified system based mostly on natural gas, coal with CCS, nuclear and renewable energy. The increase in diversity helps to improve the energy security of individual countries and regions. Combining air pollution control policies and universal energy access policies with climate policy can further help to reduce both outdoor and indoor air pollution related health impacts. Investments into the energy system must double by 2030 to achieve stringent climate goals, but are largely offset by lower costs for O&M and air pollution abatement. Strong focus on end-use efficiency also helps lowering overall total costs and allows for limiting or excluding supply side technologies from the mitigation portfolio.
