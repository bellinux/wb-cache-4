He quickly accepted, and on 26 September 2003 it was officially announced <b>that</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who would be returning to BBC One, produced in-house at BBC Wales in 2004 for transmission in 2005.|$|E
25|$|According to {{journalist}} Ivan Tolstoi, the British MI6 and the American CIA lent a hand {{to ensure}} <b>that</b> <b>Doctor</b> Zhivago was submitted to the Nobel Committee in the original Russian. According to Tolstoi, this was done so that Pasternak could win the Nobel prize and harm the international credibility of the Soviet Union. He repeats and elaborates upon Feltrinelli's claims that the CIA operatives had photographed a manuscript of the novel and secretly printed {{a small number of}} books in the Russian language. More recently, Anna Sergeyeva-Klyatis wrote that the first Russian edition of Doctor Zhivago, which was a pirated version with numerous typographical errors and omissions, was actually initiated by the Central Association of Postwar Émigrées, in response to a growing demand among Russian émigrés.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} format <b>that</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who had {{undergone}} in Season 22 (45-minute episodes, {{moving back to}} one episode per week on Saturday evenings) had been reasonably successful, with ratings around the 6–8 million mark. As such, the production team began preparations for Season 23 in the same format, {{with a total of}} 13 episodes spread over six stories, with five 2-episode serials and one of 3 episodes. A number of storylines were submitted, with six eventually being commissioned between September 1984 and February 1985. However, in February 1985, the BBC announced that, as a cost-cutting measure owing to the costs of several large projects (not least of which was the launch of EastEnders), Season 23 was being put back from its planned transmission in January 1986 to the following September, which would be a different financial year.|$|E

Lee destroys Mariah's white slavery ring and drives her out of town shortly after her (Lee's) arrival in Bete Noire.

25|$|In {{its early}} years, {{samizdat}} defined {{itself as a}} primarily literary phenomenon which included the distribution of poetry, classic unpublished Russian literature, and famous 20th century foreign literature. Literature {{played a key role}} in the existence of the samizdat phenomenon. For instance, the USSR's refusal to publish Boris Pasternak's epic novel, Doctor Zhivago, due to its focus on individual characters rather than the welfare of the state, led to the novel's subsequent underground publication. The fact <b>that</b> <b>Doctor</b> Zhivago contained no overt messages of dissidence highlighted the clumsiness of the state's censorship process, which caused a shift of readership away from state-published material. Likewise, the circulation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's famous work detailing the horrors of the gulag system, The Gulag Archipelago, promoted a samizdat revival during the mid-1970s. However, because samizdat by definition placed itself in opposition to the state, samizdat works became increasingly focused on the state's violation of human rights, before shifting towards politics.|$|E
