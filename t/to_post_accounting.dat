The results were set forth on slips which were turned into the office, where the time as shown was <b>posted</b> <b>to</b> the <b>accounts</b> of the various orders to which it belonged. This, as can well be seen, was a loose system, for the reason that the workman's sense of time was frequently not well developed, and there was neither incentive nor necessity for accuracy. Since there was no definite check on the workman's movements, his record would often show that he [...] "knocked off" [...] at 12:30 P.M., when {{as a matter of fact}} he quit work at 12:20 P.M., and loitered around the toilet room or engaged in conversation with other workmen for the extra ten minutes which had been charged by him to the work just finished.|$|R

5000|$|To the consumer, a debit {{transaction}} {{is perceived as}} occurring in real-time; i.e. the money is withdrawn from their account immediately following the authorization request from the merchant, which in many countries, is the case when making an online debit purchase. However, when a purchase is made using the [...] "credit" [...] (offline debit) option, the transaction merely places an authorization hold on the customer's account; funds are not actually withdrawn until the transaction is reconciled and hard-posted to the customer's account, usually a few days later. However, the previous sentence applies {{to all kinds of}} transaction types, at least when using a card issued by a European bank. This is in contrast to a typical credit card transaction; though it can also have a lag time of {{a few days before the}} transaction is <b>posted</b> <b>to</b> the <b>account,</b> it can be many days to a month or more before the consumer makes repayment with actual money.|$|R
5000|$|On August 19, 2013, it was {{reported}} that a Facebook user from Palestinian Autonomy, Khalil Shreateh, found a bug that allowed him <b>to</b> <b>post</b> material <b>to</b> other users' Facebook Walls.

Following this, Shreateh contacted Facebook's security team with the proof that his bug was real, explaining in detail what was going on. Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a $500+ fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market. However, it {{was reported}} that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee, Facebook originally told him that [...] "this was not a bug" [...] and dismissed him. Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook, but they dismissed him yet again. On the third try, Shreateh used the bug <b>to</b> <b>post</b> a message <b>to</b> Mark Zuckerberg's Wall, stating [...] "Sorry for breaking your privacy ... but a couple of days ago, I found a serious Facebook exploit" [...] and that Facebook's security team was not taking him seriously. Within minutes, a security engineer contacted Shreateh, questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system. Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh's account and fixed the bug after several days. However, in a move that was met with much public criticism and disapproval, Facebook refused to pay out the 500+ fee to Shreateh; instead, Facebook responded that by <b>posting</b> <b>to</b> Zuckerberg's <b>account,</b> Shreateh had violated one of their terms of service policies and therefore [...] "could not be paid." [...] Included with this, the Facebook team strongly censured Shreateh over his manner of resolving the matter. In closing, they asked that Shreateh continue to help them find bugs.|$|R
