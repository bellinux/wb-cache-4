Averaged over a ten-year period from 1988 to 1998, {{the number of}} railway accidents taking place at level crossings was recorded as 2,595, or 66.3% of all railway accidents during that period.

It began operating in Denmark and running trains from Sweden to Germany during January 2008. In 2009 Hector rail started to haul a passenger train, for Veolia.|$|E
50|$|The {{contract}} for {{the operation of the}} Hellweg network was closed on 14 July 2008. It covers a volume of 5.6 million <b>train-km</b> per year and is valid for ten years. The contractors are Nahverkehrsverbund Paderborn-Höxter (Paderborn-Höxter local transport, nph), Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (Rhine-Ruhr transport association, VRR), VerkehrsVerbund OstWestfalenLippe (Ostwestfalen-Lippe transport association, VVOWL), Zweckverband Ruhr-Lippe (Ruhr-Lippe purpose association, ZRL) and Zweckverband SPNV Münsterland (Münsterland public transport association, ZVM) as public transport authorities and Eurobahn as operator.|$|E

5000|$|Vectus {{operated}} {{a total of}} 2.4 million <b>train-km</b> per year, using 10 Alstom Coradia LINT 27 diesel railcars and 18 Alstom Coradia LINT 41 railcars. All vehicles were built in 2004 and were identical to the class 640 and 648 railcars of Deutsche Bahn. After the delivery of the first railcars, some ran on the Limburg-Wiesbaden line and other routes {{in the summer of}} 2004. [...] In addition Vectus had three Stadler GTW diesel railcars that it acquired from its parent company, HLB, in compensation for three LINT 27 railcars it transferred to HLB.|$|E

As a result, Regional-Express services RE 17 and 57 and Regionalbahn services RB 52, 53 and 54 {{might have had a}} new operator. Some improvements are to be made on trains for the carriage of the disabled and there will be more space for bicycles, more guards, ticket machines on the trains rather than on the platforms, as well as improved connections in Menden (to Dortmund) and Schwerte (to Münster). It will involve about 5.6 million train-kilometres a year, at a cost of €9-10 per <b>train-km,</b> a total cost of about €50 to 55 million. Because the operation of the network is to be contracted for a period of 12 years, it will be worth more than €600 million.|$|E

40|$|The National Rail Administration is {{analysing}} {{how different}} levels and designs of freight rail user fees influence {{the demand for}} rail transport. Changes in demand are calculated {{with the help of}} price elasticities. These elasticities are mainly related to the total transport costs, where rail user fees are one part. The Swedish rail user fees (that include different components for wear and tear, safety etc.) are among the lowest in Europe and correspond to about five percent of the freight transport costs. In our literature review, we did not find studies explicitly related to elasticities for freight rail user fees. The elasticities that we found have transport costs (or prices) as independent variable and the majority has tonne-km as dependent variable. The elasticities lie in the range of - 0. 9 to - 1. 7. Regardless if one calculates the demand effect in tonnes, tonne-km or <b>train-km</b> in principle all elasticities in the literature are higher in absolute terms than 0. 4, which is the elasticity that the National Rail Administration applies today for all commodity groups and train types...|$|E
40|$|As a {{regulatory}} authority for transportation of radioactive materials, the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) ensures that packages designed to transport {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) meet current regulations. 10 CFR Part 71 provides the regulatory requirements for the certification of transportation packages for SNF and high-level radioactive waste. SNF transportation packages {{are expected to be}} designed to endure a fully engulfing fire, as prescribed in 10 CFR Part 71, Section 73. The purpose of the study described in this report was to support NRC in determining the different types and frequency of railway accidents involving severe, long duration fires that could impact rail transport of SNF. Train accident data were examined from both the Federal Railroad Administration and Department of Transportation—Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration databases. This study focused on accidents where hazardous material was released from multiple train cars. From this study, the frequency of occurrence of a severe fire was estimated at 6. 2 × 10 − 4 accidents per million freight <b>train-km</b> [1 × 10 − 3 accidents per million freight train-mi]. None of the accidents examined involved a reported release of radioactive material exceeding the limits set in 10 CFR Part 71. In addition to calculating the frequency, the trends associated with sever...|$|E
40|$|Fatal train {{collisions}} and derailments {{are important}} events. They are well documented in Great Britain, mainly {{due to the}} work of HM Railway Inspectorate over many decades. However, there are no comprehensive data on fatal train accidents in Europe, even though the railways of Europe may have much to learn from each other, and rail safety regulation is currently tending to move from the level of national governments towards the institutions of the European Union. Given the public interest in railway accidents, the many fatal collisions and derailments are reported in the press. Furthermore, there are now available long runs of electronically searchable newspaper archives, notably in Britain of The Times. This makes it possible to explore the possibility of constructing and analysing a dataset of European fatal railway accidents based on press reports. The following three tasks are necessary to do this. (1) Defining search terms and using these to extract accounts of relevant railway accidents; (2) Estimating the numbers of accidents and fatalities that are missing from these press reports by country; (3) Using the results to analyse the comparative safety performance of Great Britain and other European railways. This paper presents the results of an exploratory study of doing this. The number of fatal collisions and derailments resulting in fatalities to train occupants in the EU 15 plus Switzerland and Norway in 1967 to 2005 is estimated to have been about 700, of which 450 were reported in the English press, and 250 were not. Of these, about 90 occurred in Great Britain. The fatal accident rate per <b>train-km</b> has fallen substantially over the period both in Britain and in the rest of Europe. <br/...|$|E
