40|$|An {{analysis}} of monthly mean, zonally averaged temperatures from the lower-stratospheric channel of the microwave sounding unit (MSU- 4) shows {{that on the}} month-to-month time scale, there is nearly complete compensation between temperature changes in the tropics and in the extratropics. For the annual cycle the MSU- 4 data show a similar compensation between temperatures in the tropics and those in high latitudes, with only a small residual variation in the global mean. The tropics are coldest in January and warmest in July, compensating for the warmer wintertime <b>temperatues</b> in the Northern Hemisphere compared {{to those in the}} Southern Hemisphere. These out-of phase temperature variations betwen the tropics and extratropics are interpreted as the signature of an annual cycle in the strength of the wave-driven, Lagrangian mean meridional circulation, which warms the high-latitude winter hemisphere and cools the tropics. The observed phase of the annual cycle in tropical lower-stratospheric temperatures is thus determined by the stronger orographic and thermal forcing of the wintertime planetary waves in the Northern Hemisphere, which drives a stronger Lagrangian mean meridional circulation. In the absence of fluctuations in the global mean diabatic heating, the compensation would be complete and the globally averaged temperature would be constant. The small annual cycle in the globally averaged temperature in the MSU- 4 data is nearly in phase with the annual cycle in the tropics and is consistent with the annual cycle in diabatic heating by ozone...|$|R

40|$|A {{broadband}} coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) system {{optimized for}} single shot measurements in turbulent flames is described. The CARS spectrometer incorporates an intensified photodiode array (IPDA) with a P 46 -phosphor based intensifier that {{is shown to}} have {{an order of magnitude}} less image persistence than P 20 -phosphor based IPDAs, and thus largely eliminates the temperature errors that can result from this image persistence. The low and high signal nonlinearity of IPDAs incorporating both P 20 and P 46 phosphor based intensifiers is described. The CARS signal is dispersed with a single element concave holographic diffraction grating, which is fiber-optically coupled. To provide the necessary dynamic range (approximately 1000 : 1) to handle CARS spectra whose temperatures can vary from 300 K to adiabatic flame temperatures a fiber-optic splitter was employed and the nonlinearity of the IPDA detectors characterized. A method of determining the nonlinearity was developed that was convenient and the fiber-optic link was shown to provide a stable calibration of this nonlinearity. The problem of dye laser spectral drift, which is particularly severe in a long duration experiment, was addressed by constructing a compact high resolution spectrometer to continuously monitor the dye laser. The dye laser center frequency was maintained constant by manually adjusting an intracavity tuning filter. The accuracy of this technique and its effect on CARS derived <b>temperatues</b> was evaluated. The standard method of determining the instrument function by fitting to 295 K air spectra was compared to other methods and its use was shown to result in an uncertainty of less than 0. 5 % in CARS derived temperatures. The operation of this CARS instrument was demonstrated in a turbulent diffusion flame. The varying composition of these flames was accounted for by fitting C, tha ratio of the nitrogen mole fraction to the total third order nonlinear susceptibility.

Salinity: The specific growth rate was maximal at approximately 22 ‰, and decreased differentially with increasing or decreasing salinities.

40|$|Bulk) {{metallic}} glasses ((B) MGs) {{are known to}} exhibit the highest yield strength of any metallic material (up to 5 GPa), and show an elastic strain at ambient conditions, which is about ten times larger than that of crystalline materials. Despite these intriguing mechanical properties, BMGs are not used as structural materials in service, so far. The major obstacle is their inherent brittleness, which results from severe strain localization in so-called shear bands. MGs fail due to formation and propagation of shear bands. A very effective way to attenuate the brittle behaviour is to incorporate crystals into the glass. The resulting BMG composites exhibit high strength as well as plasticity. Cu-Zr-Al-based BMG composites are special to that effect, since they combine high strength, plasticity and work-hardening. They are comprised of the glass and shape-memory B 2 CuZr crystals, which can undergo a deformation-induced martensitic transformation. The work-hardening originates from the martensitic transformation and overcompensates the work-softening of the glass. The extent of the plasticity of BMG composites depends on the volume fraction, size and particularly {{on the distribution of}} the B 2 CuZr crystals. Nowadays, it is very difficult, if not impossible to prepare BMG composites with uniformly distributed crystals in a reproducible manner by melt-quenching, which is the standard preparation method. Flash-annealing of BMGs represents a new approach to overcome this deficiency in the preparation of BMG composites and is the topic of the current thesis. Cu 46 Zr 46 Al 8 and Cu 44 Zr 44 Al 8 Hf 2 Co 2 BMGs were flash-annealed and afterwards investigated in terms of phase formation, crystallization kinetics and mechanical properties. Flash-annealing is a process, which is characterized by the rapid heating of BMGs to predefined temperatures followed by instantaneous quenching. A temperature-controlled device was succesfully developed and built. The Cu-Zr-Al-based BMGs can be heated at rates ranging between 16 K/s and about 200 K/s to <b>temperatues</b> above their melting point. Rapid heating is followed by immediate quenching where cooling rates of the order of 1000 K/s are achieved. As a BMG is flash-annealed, it passes the glass-transition temperature, Tg, and transforms to a supercooled liquid. Further heating leads to its crystallization and the respective temperature, the crystallization temperature, Tx, divides the flash-annealing of BMGs into two regimes: (1) sub-Tx-annealing and (2) crystallization. The structure of the glass exhibits free volume enhanced regions (FERs) and quenched-in nuclei. Flash-annealing affects both heterogeneities and hence the structural state of the glass. FERs appear to be small nanoscale regions and they can serve as initiation sites for shear bands. Flash-annealing of Cu-Zr-Al-based BMGs to temperatures below Tg leads to structural relaxation, the annihilation of FERs and the BMG embrittles. In contrast, the BMG rejuvenates, when flash-annealed to temperatures of the supercooled liquid region (SLR). Rejuvenation is associated with the creation of FERs. Compared to the as-cast state, rejuvenated BMGs show an improved plasticity, due to a proliferation of shear bands, which are the carrier of plasticity in MGs. Flash-annealing enables to probe the influence of the free volume in bulk samples on their mechanical properties, which could not be studied, yet. In addition, B 2 CuZr nanocrystals precipitate during the deformation of flash-annealed Cu 44 Zr 44 Al 8 Hf 2 Co 2 BMGs. Deformation-induced nanocrystallization does not occur for the present as-cast BMGs. Flash-annealing appears to stimulate the growth of quenched-in nuclei, which are subcritical in size and can also dissolve, once the BMG is heated to temperatures in the SLR. Rejuvenation represents a disordering process, whereas the growth of quenched-in nuclei is associated with ordering. There is a competition between both processes during flash-annealing. The ordering seems to lead to a “B 2 -like” clustering of the medium range of Cu 44 Zr 44 Al 8 Hf 2 Co 2 BMGs with increasing heating duration. So far, there does not exist another method to manipulate the MRO of BMGs. If Cu 44 Zr 44 Al 8 Hf 2 Co 2 BMGs are flash-annealed to temperatures near Tx, most likely compressive resiudal stresses develop near the surface, which is cooled faster than the interior of the BMG specimen. They hinder the propagation of shear bands and increase the plasticity of flash-annealed BMGs in addition to rejuvenation and deformation-induced nanocrystallization. If BMGs are heated to temperatures above Tx, they start to crystallize. Depending on the exact temperature to which the BMG is flash-annealed and subsequently quenched, one can induce controlled partial crystallization. Consequently, BMG composites can be prepared. Both Cu-Zr-Al-based BMGs are flash-annealed at various heating rates to study the phase formation {{as a function of the}} heating rate. In addition, Tg and Tx are identified for each heating rate, so that a continuous heating transformation diagram is constructed for both glass-forming compositions. An increasing heating rate kinetically constrains the crystallization process, which changes from eutectic (Cu 10 Zr 7 and CuZr 2) to polymorphic (B 2 CuZr). If the Cu-Zr-Al-based BMGs are heated above a critical heating rate, exclusively B 2 CuZr crystals precipitate, which are metastable at these temperatures. Thus, flash-annealing of Cu 46 Zr 46 Al 8 and Cu 44 Zr 44 Al 8 Hf 2 Co 2 BMGs followed by quenching enables the preparation of B 2 CuZr BMG composites. The B 2 precipitates are small, high in number and uniformly distributed when compared to conventional BMG composites prepared by melt-quenching. Such composite microstructures allow the direct observation of crystal sizes and numbers, so that crystallization kinetics of deeply supercooled liquids can be studied as they are flash-annealed. The nucleation kinetics of devitrified metallic glass significantly diverge from the steady-state and at high heating rates above 90 K/s transient nucleation effects become evident. This transient nucleation phenomenon is studied experimentally for the first time in the current thesis. Once supercritical nuclei are present, they begin to grow. The crystallization temperature, which depends on the heating rate, determines the crystal growth rate. At a later stage of crystallization a thermal front traverses the BMG specimen. In levitation experiments, this thermal front is taken as the solid-liquid interface and its velocity as the steady-state crystal growth rate. However, the thermal front observed during flash-annealing, propagates through the specimen about a magnitude faster than is known from solidification experiments of levitated supercooled liquids. As microstructural investigations show, crystals are present in the whole specimen, that means far ahead of the thermal front. Therefore, it does not represent the solid-liquid interface and results from the collective growth of crystals in confined volumes. This phenomenon originates from the high density of crystals and becomes evident during the heating of metallic glass. It could be only observed for the first time in the current thesis due to the high temporal resolution of the high-speed camera used. The heating rate and temperature to which the BMG is flash-annealed determine the nucleation rate and the time for growth, respectively. The size and number of B 2 CuZr crystals can be deliberately varied. Thus mechanical properties of B 2 CuZr BMG composites can be studied as a function of the volume fraction and average distance of B 2 particles. Cu 44 Zr 44 Al 8 Hf 2 Co 2 BMG specimens were flash-annealed at a lower and higher heating rate (35 K/s and 180 K/s) to different temperatures above Tx and subsequently subjected to uniaxial compression. BMG composites prepared at higher temperatures show a lower yield strength and larger plastic strain due to the higher crystalline volume fraction. They not only exhibit plasticity in uniaxial compression, but also ductility in tension as a preliminary experiment demonstrates. Furthermore, nanocrystals precipitate in the amorphous matrix of BMG composites during deformation. They grow deformation-induced from quenched-in nuclei, which are stimulated during flash-annealing. In essence, flash-annealing of BMGs is capable of giving insight into most fundamental scientific questions. It provides a deeper understanding of how annealing affects the structural state of {{metallic glasses}}. The number and size of structural heterogeneities can be adjusted to prepare BMGs with improved plasticity. Furthermore, crystallization kinetics of liquids can be studied as they are rapidly heated. Transient nucleation effects arise during rapid heating of BMGs and they cannot be described using the steady-state nucleation rate. Therefore, an effective nucleation rate was introduced. Besides, the flash-annealing process rises the application potential of BMGs. The microstructure of BMG composites comprised of uniformly distributed crystals and the glass, can be reliably tailored. Thus, flash-annealing constitutes a novel method to design the mechanical properties of BMG composites in a reproducible manner for the first time. BMG composites, which exhibit high strength, large plasticitiy and as in the case of B 2 CuZr BMG composites as well work-hardening behaviour, can be prepared, so that the intrinsic brittleness of monolithic BMGs is effectively overcome...|$|R

However, in reality, the viscosity of engine oil is also affected {{by age and}} it has been proven in earlier studies through the viscosity model of the UKM Equation (ηUKM). In this mathematical model, the viscosity of the engine oil is manipulated by the factors of <b>temperatue</b> and time. Both of this factors relies fully on laboratory data. Based on this hypothesis, a model of the viscosity which is based on a mathematical model have been developed whereby the technical temperature factor value and technical time factor are obtained through engine oil’s technical data such as the density, viscosity index and kinematic viscosity; technical parameter displayed in technical statements of every engine oil. This model is named the viscosity model of viscosity index numerical order (ηVIno) and the estimation of viscosity obtained through the ηVIno was found to not exhibit any significant deviation from the actual viscosity of the oil...|$|E

By {{taking into account the}} different behavior of such a collective vibrational mode in both strong and fragile glasses as well as in glass-forming materials, we were able to determine the Widom line that characterizes supercooled bulk water within the frame of the liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) hypothesis. The peak frequency and width of the BP correlated with the water polymorphism of the LLPT scenario, allowing us to distinguish the “low-density liquid” (LDL) and “high-density liquid” (HDL) phases in deeply cooled bulk water.
