2500|$|The {{design and}} {{contents}} of U.S. passports {{changed over the}} years. [...] Prior to World War I the passport was typically a large (11 x 17 inch) diploma, with a large engraved seal of the Department of State at the top, repeated in red wax at the bottom, the bearer's description and signature on the left, and {{his name on the}} right above space for data such as [...] "accompanied by his wife," [...] all in ornate script. [...] In 1926, the Department of State introduced the type III passport. This had a stiff red cover, with a window cutout through which the passport number was visible. That style of passport contained 32 pages. American passports had green covers from 1941 until 1976, when the cover was changed to blue, as part of the U.S. bicentennial celebration. Green covers were again issued from April 1993, until March 1994, and included a special one-page tribute to Benjamin Franklin in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the United States Consular Service. [...] Currently blue passports, with the pages showing historical and natural scenes of the U.S., are issued. [...] Initially a U.S. passport was issued for two years, although by the 1950s on application by the holder a passport could be stamped so that this time was extended without reissue. [...] In the succeeding decades the initial lengths for adult applicants were extended to three, five, and eventually to ten years, the current standard. [...] At this <b>time</b> <b>stamping</b> for a further extension is not allowed.|$|E

6000|$|No {{one took}} it up. It {{was a mere}} truism. Nothing under canvas could be {{expected}} to make a port on such an idle night of dreamy splendour and spiritual stillness. We would have to glide idly to and fro, keeping our station within the appointed bearings, and, unless a fresh breeze sprang up with the dawn, we would land before sunrise on a small islet that, within two miles of us, shone like a lump of frozen moonlight, to [...] "break a crust and take a pull at the wine bottle." [...] I was familiar with the procedure. The stout boat emptied of her crowd would nestle her buoyant, capable side against the very rock--such is the perfectly smooth amenity of the classic sea when in a gentle mood. The crust broken and the mouthful of wine swallowed--it was literally no more than that with this abstemious race--the pilots would pass the <b>time</b> <b>stamping</b> their feet on the slabs of sea-salted stone and blowing into their nipped fingers. One or two misanthropists would sit apart, perched on boulders like manlike sea-fowl of solitary habits; the sociably disposed would gossip scandalously in little gesticulating knots; and there would be perpetually one or another of my hosts taking aim at the empty horizon with the long, brass tube of the telescope, a heavy, murderous-looking piece of collective property, everlastingly changing hands with brandishing and levelling movements. Then about noon (it was a short turn of duty--the long turn lasted twenty-four hours) another boatful of pilots would relieve us--and we should steer for the old Phoenician port, dominated, watched over from the ridge of a dust-gray, arid hill by the red-and-white striped pile of the Notre Dame de la Garde.|$|E

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>stamps</b> in videos play an {{important}} role in video clustering and retrieval. For digital camcorders, <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> is separately stored in the video stream using some specific bytes, thus it can be accessed easily. However, for analog camcorders, <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> is superimposed on the video frame and mixed into the video data, thus we cannot extract it directly. Furthermore, extraction of <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> in home videos is much harder than that of ordinary videotext due to the poor quality of the video. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> detection and recognition system for analog home videos. To deal with the special difficulties, we propose two approaches, which can remarkably improve the overall system performance. The final outputs are shot boundaries with the corresponding time indices, which are detected and recognized by the proposed system. These results can be used as metadata for further video processing...|$|R
