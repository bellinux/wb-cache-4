2500|$|As {{at the end}} of March 2010, Land Registry {{records show}} only one of the 24 flats sold had been {{completed}} on, giving rise to concerns that the developer might have released misleading information. An editorial in the SCMP said greater transparency for property deals is needed: [...] "Unusual sales transactions at 39 Conduit Road [...] call for closer scrutiny of the property market by the authorities. It does not appear that the developers have broken any law. But [...] have given rise to allegations they were seeking to manipulate the market." [...] A reply from Henderson to the Lands Department of 24 March, which said it had entered into a verbal agreement with the 24 buyers to extend the <b>transaction</b> <b>date</b> for two to four months, subject to further extension, was not considered satisfactory by the Finance Committee of Legislative Council, which pressed the Lands Department to summon senior management of Henderson Land to explain in person why the sales of 24 flats in the development could not be completed five months after they were purportedly sold. Following the response, which was not made public, the Lands Department made a second request for more information from the developer; a four-page response was received, in which Henderson explained it allowed the buyers, all unconnected with Henderson, to extend the transaction deadline after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a notice on 23 October to banks to reduce lending to finance purchase of luxury homes. The Standard reported that the Lands Department remain unsatisfied with why there was only oral agreement on the deferrals.|$|E

Even though the credit card company will publish the exchange rate used for conversion on the statement, they do not disclose the exchange rate used to convert a transaction at the time of payment. Both Visa and MasterCard state that the rates they publish in advance of a transaction posting to a cardholder's statement are indicative, since the rates they use for conversion correspond to the date and time they process the transaction, as opposed to the actual <b>transaction</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Authorization hold (also card authorization, preauthorization, or preauth) is the {{practice}} within {{the banking industry}} of verifying electronic transactions initiated with a debit card or credit card and holding this balance as unavailable until either the merchant clears the transaction, also called settlement, or the hold [...] "falls off." [...] In the case of debit cards, authorization holds can fall off the account, thus rendering the balance available again, anywhere from one to eight business days after the <b>transaction</b> <b>date</b> depending on the bank's policy. In the case of credit cards, holds may {{last as long as}} thirty days, depending on the issuing bank.|$|E

30|$|The {{rationale}} behind the Event Detection Validity Assessment {{is that if}} the detected event dates in fact represent dates with high informational value, there should be more information published on or around the detected event dates than on other <b>transaction</b> <b>dates.</b>|$|R
30|$|Results {{satisfying}} the above criteria indicate {{that according to}} the presented rationale and for the specified criteria values, substantial information must have been impounded on the selected company’s stock price. Therefore, {{for the purposes of}} current research, the relevant <b>transaction</b> <b>dates</b> are regarded as Event Dates.|$|R
5000|$|On 16 April 2011, Thomas R. DiBenedetto's through [...] "DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC" [...] (incorporated in Delaware, {{which he}} owned 25%) and UniCredit bought 67.1% shares of A.S.

50|$|There were a {{total of}} six N-Series {{partnership}} transactions in which the RTC placed 2,600 loans with an approximate book value of $2.8 billion and a DIV of $1.3 billion. A total of $975 million of CMBS bonds were issued for the six N-Series transaction, representing 60% of the value of N-Series trust assets as determined by the competitive bid process (the value of the assets implied by the investor bids was substantially greater than the DIV values calculated by the RTC). While the original bond maturity was 10 years from the transaction, the average bond was retired in 21 months from the <b>transaction</b> <b>date,</b> and all bonds were retired within 28 months.|$|E

As part of every [...] "handgun ammunition" [...] transfer, AB 962 {{would have required}} vendors to record and maintain, for a time period no less than five years: the <b>transaction</b> <b>date,</b> the ammunition brand and caliber, the processor's name, as well as the purchaser's driver license number, signature, name, right thumbprint, residential address, phone number, and date of birth. The bill also aimed to stop felony gang crimes by making it a misdemeanor to possess ammunition while associating with a criminal street gang.|$|E
30|$|There were 20, 708 {{announcements}} retrieved for the 185 stocks {{included in}} the sample on 695 distinct dates. 149 announcements were published on ten distinct <b>dates</b> with no <b>transactions</b> performed. Finally, there were no <b>transaction</b> <b>dates</b> with no published announcements. Oddly enough, announcements seem to be increasing from Monday through Friday.|$|R
50|$|Julie L. Gerberding sold 38,368 {{shares of}} her Merck stock {{on the open}} market in a <b>{{transaction}}</b> <b>dated</b> Friday, May 8th. The stock was sold at an average price of $60.99, for a total transaction of $2,340,064.32.

50|$|The {{journaling}} format {{consists of}} a sequence of transactions, or updates. An update contains 4 types of blocks: a transaction header block, a sequence of data blocks, a corresponding sequence of fragment tables, and a sequence of index blocks. A transaction header block contains the <b>transaction</b> <b>date</b> and a pointer skipping over the data blocks to allow the archive index to be read quickly. The data blocks contain a sequence of file fragments compressed together. The fragment tables give the size and SHA-1 hash of each fragment. The index blocks contain a list of edits to the global archive index. An edit is either a file update or a file deletion. An update includes a file name, last modified date, attributes, {{and a list of}} fragment pointers into the current and previous transactions. Fragments may be shared by more than one file. A deletion does not remove any data from the archive, but rather indicates that the file is not to be extracted unless the archive is rolled back to an earlier date.|$|E
5000|$|When a {{transaction}} is made, the card holder is offered a paper or electronic transaction record containing {{information about the}} purchase. This includes: transaction amount, transaction number, <b>transaction</b> <b>date</b> and time, transaction type (deposits, withdrawal, purchase or refund), type of account being debited or credited, card number, identity of the card acceptor (organization/store address) {{as well as the}} identity of the terminal (company name from which the machine operates). The use of debit cards in 2014 increased by 18% from the 2011 total volume of Canadian Payment Methods. As for credit cards, it increased by 26% from the 2011 total volume of Canadian Payment Methods. These two types of payment methods combined make up for more transactions than cash. Card transaction data has increased through the expansion of payment channels available to customers. Additionally, incentive and reward programs have increased the use of electronic cards for their benefits. The use of contactless and e-commerce payment has also allowed for a growth in card transaction data to increase due to the simplicity of the transaction. The use of Interact Debit transactions have increased rapidly in the last 6 years according to Interact Debit statistics. However, Canada has a lower rate debit use transactions by inhabitant in comparison to the United States, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, and Great Britain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a non-steady state general equilibrium {{foundation for the}} transactions demand for money going back to Baumol (1952) and Tobin (1956). In our economy, money competes against real capital as a store of value. We prove existence of a monetary general equilibrium in which both real capital and at money are voluntarily held over time. The demand for money is generated by xed transactions costs. More precisely, we assume that households have two physically separated accounts. On the rst account they nance consumption and might want to hold money over time. On the second account households receive their wages, hold claims on capital and earn interest income from renting capital to rms. Every transfer of wealth between the two accounts requires xed resources. In equilibrium, households space apart the <b>transaction</b> <b>dates</b> in time. Between these <b>transaction</b> <b>dates,</b> money is held as a store of value on the rst account for transactions purposes. The number of periods over which money is held is endogenous and the nonconvexity {{of the problem is}} explicitly taken into account...|$|R
30|$|Out of the 663 <b>transaction</b> <b>dates</b> {{included}} in the original sample of transactions, from 1 / 1 / 2006 to 31 / 8 / 2008, there are Detected Event Dates on 279 different dates. Moreover, Observation Dates created within the − 20 to + 20 timeframe range from 16 / 2 / 2006 to 22 / 9 / 2008. There are 678 working days within this period {{and there are also}} 678 announcement Observation Dates.|$|R
30|$|On an Event Date, stock {{performance}} should exceed previous performance. Thus, {{using the}} Equivalent Stock Price {{as a proxy}} of stock performance, it could be stated that the Equivalent Stock Price on an Event Date should be higher than previous ones. To determine ‘previous,’ a Maximum Equivalent Price selection window (days) criterion was created (Fig. 2). It was arbitrarily set to 60 days {{for the purposes of}} evaluation. According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (Fama [1970]) and under the assumption that the Greek Stock Market is efficient (Dasilas [2007]), information is immediately reflected on stock prices. So, the Abnormal Return on an event date should be higher than any other observed abnormal return on neighboring <b>transaction</b> <b>dates.</b> To define how many <b>transaction</b> <b>dates</b> would be taken into consideration a Positive Abnormal Return selection window (days) was implemented (Fig. 2). It was set to 40 days, meaning that the abnormal return on an Event Date should be higher than any other abnormal return for a period of 20 transaction days before and 20 transaction days after the Detected Event Date. A selection of a different time period is always possible, but selecting a much wider time period would question the relevance of observations to the Detected Event Date.|$|R
30|$|Next, to dissociate the {{observed}} abnormal return on a selected {{date with a}} general market run-up, a Maximum Index Return selection window (days) criterion was created (Fig. 2). The observed abnormal return should not coincide with the highest value of the General Market Index (GI) return (IR) within a timeframe. This timeframe was arbitrarily set to 20 transaction days around the examined <b>transaction</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E
30|$|At this point, it {{was obvious}} that there was a {{concentration}} of Abnormal Returns that satisfied the above set criteria around a potential event date, maybe because of insider trading activity. In order to distinguish which one of the neighboring transaction dates might in fact be an event date, stock price {{could be used as a}} proxy. Yet instead of using stock prices, which would have to be adjusted for dividends and splits, an Equivalent Stock Price was calculated having one as base price on the first <b>transaction</b> <b>date</b> and calculated on each date using the already adjusted daily change.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} analyse {{the stock price}} effects of block {{transactions}} and the disclosure thereof for Dutch firms. The authors measure a significant positive price effect for block purchases directly around the <b>transaction</b> <b>date,</b> but not for block sales. The authors do not measure a significant price effect for the disclosures of block transactions. The authors find two opposing effects about the agency role of large shareholders. In particular, while the authors find that the market reacts positively {{to the entrance of}} a new block holder, the authors also measure a negative reaction to the purchase of large blocks...|$|E

30|$|At this point, {{it has to}} be {{mentioned}} that the whole Insider Trading Observation process is based on the detection of <b>transaction</b> <b>dates</b> on which {{there seems to be a}} significant informational impounding on stock prices. Consequently, the validity of the results is only speculative, unless there can be a juxtaposition of the detected events with actual events. To perform such juxtaposition, one has to search for news about the selected stock around the detected event date, comprehend their importance and evaluate their relevance to the detected event.|$|R
30|$|Researchers in {{watermarking}} domain {{have focused}} their works on two fundamental issues: watermark detection and watermark decoding (extraction). In the latter, usually {{referred to as}} multibit watermarking, a full decoding is carried out to extract the hidden message, which can be an ownership identifiers, <b>transaction</b> <b>dates,</b> a serial numbers, and so forth. Such a watermarking {{can be found in}} fingerprinting, steganography, and the protection of intellectual property rights. In multibit watermarking, errors may occur when extracting the hidden message. Error probability {{can be used as a}} measure of the watermarking system performance.|$|R
40|$|Based on the German {{regulatory}} framework, {{we provide}} a more detailed picture about the information disclosure process surrounding the announcement of major shareholdings of hedge funds in listed companies. We separate price and volume effects between three event dates: the <b>transaction</b> <b>date</b> when the investor reaches a notifiable threshold, the announcement date when potential insiders (the target firm and the regulator) get advance information, and the publication date when the information is officially released to the public. The separation {{makes it possible to}} analyze information and price pressure effects in some detail. The paper also documents the extent and nature of delays in hedge funds’ notification behavior...|$|E

30|$|The event {{detection}} process may, {{and possibly}} should, be performed {{using a different}} set of parameters according to the specific characteristics of each stock. However, for the sake of evaluation of this process, event detection was performed for all stocks included in the selected sample for a fixed set of parameters. It was assumed, thus, that to characterize a <b>transaction</b> <b>date</b> as an Event Date, there should be observed on that day: (a) a Real Return of more than 3  %, (b) an Abnormal Return of more than 3  %, (c) the Abnormal Return should be higher than any of those observed 20 days before and 20 days after the specific date. Moreover, (d) the price of the stock should be, on that day, higher than any other observed during the last 60 transaction dates; and finally, (e) the Index Return should not coincide with the highest value of the last 20 transaction dates.|$|E

(All of these contradict the conclusions of Priest, 2010). I’ll conclude with open questions about the role of marketplace institutions and the timing of transactions...|$|R

40|$|Checks {{remained}} local payments instruments throughout {{virtually the}} entire nineteenth century. Their significant use in interregional <b>transactions</b> <b>dates</b> only to the 1890 s. We explain their lagged spatial diffusion by the evolution of centralized payments institutions to coordinate transactions among myriad banks, not real technological changes to "annihilate" distance. The pivotal institutions were large correspondent banks, especially in New York. After the Civil War, New York funds constituted a national settlement medium, and the concentration of bankers' balances in New York yielded liquidity and other externalities smoothing the flow of check payments.
