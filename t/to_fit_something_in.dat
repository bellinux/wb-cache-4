Now I just want to concentrate on doing really good bespoke work and on making my own contribution to the history of the Row". When being interviewed by The Daily Telegraph in 2013, she observed: [...] "Women know how to make men look good in suits - most men consult their wives or girlfriends or mistresses... Women are accepted in medicine and in law; why not tailoring? I hope equality will become so not an issue that soon we won't be able to believe that it ever was." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this essay}} I {{investigate}} how the Roman colonization (around 50 BC to 400 AD) affected the Celtic religion. I inquire which operators that were behind these changes {{and under what}} circumstances they happened. I take a closer look on three places in Gaul and one place and one area in Britain. In my study of these places I see that it was the elite of the Celtic societies who together and under pressure from Rome made these changes. The religion and gods did not change; instead the ritual ceremonies changed <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into <b>something</b> that Rome thought was right. The places I study also show that there were differences in the religious places depending whether they were located in a city or in the country...|$|R

50|$|Just using a basic {{understanding}} of the alliterative verse can give a clue as to what the word might be. The type lines are also used to determine the lost words if only one or two words are miising, and the place of the alliterator and the stressed syllables is known. Extrapolating can find a word that may fit into the missing fragment. A knowledge of paleography and the scribe’s penmanship is also useful; words that would be too long or too short <b>to</b> make <b>something</b> <b>fit</b> can be ruled out.|$|R

[...] Kobe, who moved to Italy at age 6 because of his father playing basketball there, stated that the AAU has been [...] "treating basketball players like cash cows for everyone to profit off of". Steve Kerr has also spoken out against the AAU as well, stating that the AAU's structure devalues winning, with many teams playing about as many as four times a day and some players changing teams as early as from one morning to an afternoon the same day. Kerr also states that [...] "The process of growing as a team basketball player — learning how to become part of a whole, how <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into <b>something</b> bigger than oneself — becomes completely lost within the AAU fabric." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a typology for purchasing groups. In the typology, five main forms of cooperative purchasing are distinguished based on seven main dimensions. The forms are positioned in a matrix {{according to two}} distinguishing dimensions. These two dimensions are the ‘influence by all members on the group activities’ and the ‘number of different group activities’. Underlying the two-dimensional matrix, there are five other dimensions that do not distinguish all forms from each other, but further detail the forms of cooperative purchasing. The typology {{can serve as a}} guideline for purchasing groups when a suitable organisational form needs to be chosen. In a suitable form, the dimensions of a group fit together. For all groups, it is recommended to find this best <b>fit.</b> This is <b>something</b> <b>in</b> which the typology may help. The paper concludes by emphasising the importance of clearly defining and positioning studied forms, because different forms imply different research models and have different advantages, disadvantages, and critical success factors...|$|R

6000|$|... § 5. There {{is a case}} of {{causation}} {{which calls}} for separate notice, as it possesses a peculiar feature, and presents a greater degree of complexity than the common case. It often happens that the effect, or one of the effects, of a cause, is, not to produce of itself a certain phenomenon, but <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>something</b> else for producing it. In other words, there {{is a case of}} causation in which the effect is to invest an object with a certain property. When sulphur, charcoal, and nitre are put together in certain proportions and in a certain manner, the effect is, not an explosion, but that the mixture acquires a property by which, in given circumstances, it will explode. The various causes, natural and artificial, which educate the human body or the human mind, have for their principal effect, not to make the body or mind immediately do any thing, but to endow it with certain properties—in other words, to give assurance that in given circumstances certain results will take place in it, or as consequences of it. Physiological agencies often have for the chief part of their operation to predispose the constitution to some mode of action. To take a simpler instance than all these: putting a coat of white paint upon a wall does not merely produce in those who see it done, the sensation of white; it confers on the wall the permanent property of giving that kind of sensation. Regarded in reference to the sensation, the putting on of the paint is a condition of a condition; it is a condition of the wall’s causing that particular fact. The wall may have been painted years ago, but it has acquired a property which has lasted till now, and will last longer; the antecedent condition necessary to enable the wall to become in its turn a condition, has been fulfilled once for all. In a case like this, where the immediate consequent in the sequence is a property produced in an object, no one now supposes the property to be a substantive entity “inherent” in the object. What has been produced is what, in other language, may be called a state of preparation in an object for producing an effect. The ingredients of the gunpowder have been brought into a state of preparation for exploding as soon as the other conditions of an explosion shall have occurred. In the case of the gunpowder, this state of preparation consists in a certain collocation of its particles relatively to one another. In the example of the wall, it consists in a new collocation of two things relatively to each other—the wall and the paint. In the example of the molding influences on the human mind, its being a collocation at all is only conjectural; for, even on the materialistic hypothesis, it would remain to be proved that the increased facility with which the brain sums up a column of figures when it has been long trained to calculation, {{is the result of a}} permanent new arrangement of some of its material particles. We must, therefore, content ourselves with what we know, and must include among the effects of causes, the capacities given to objects of being causes of other effects. This capacity is not a real thing existing in the objects; it is but a name for our conviction that they will act in a particular manner when certain new circumstances arise. We may invest this assurance of future events with a fictitious objective existence, by calling it a state of the object. But unless the state consists, as in the case of the gunpowder it does, in a collocation of particles, it expresses no present fact; it is but the contingent future fact brought back under another name.|$|R

6000|$|Strether, at his glass, {{finished}} dressing; consulting that witness moreover on {{this last}} opinion. WAS he looking preternaturally <b>fit?</b> There was <b>something</b> <b>in</b> it perhaps for Chad's wonderful eye, {{but he had}} felt himself for hours rather in pieces. Such a judgement, however, was after all but a contribution to his resolve; it testified unwittingly to his wisdom. He was still firmer, apparently--since it shone in him as a light--than he had flattered himself. His firmness indeed was slightly compromised, as he faced about to his friend, by the way this very personage looked--though the case would of course have been worse hadn't the secret of personal magnificence been at every hour Chad's unfailing possession. There he was in all the pleasant morning freshness of it--strong and sleek and gay, easy and fragrant and fathomless, with happy health in his colour, and pleasant silver in his thick young hair, and the right word for everything on the lips that his clear brownness caused to show as red. He had never struck Strether as personally such a success; {{it was as if}} now, for his definite surrender, he had gathered himself vividly together. This, sharply and rather strangely, was the form in which he was to be presented to Woollett. Our friend took him in again--he was always taking him in and yet finding that parts of him still remained out; though even thus his image showed through a mist of other things. [...] "I've had a cable," [...] Strether said, [...] "from your mother." ...|$|R
