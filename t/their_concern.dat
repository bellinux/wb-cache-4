5|$|In late October 2010, {{in order}} to protest the {{government}} over the language policy in Tibetan area, the Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC) used the games as a channel to voice <b>their</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{arguments of}} the protesters were <b>their</b> <b>concern</b> about making wildlife species, such as the Chalkhill Blue butterfly, extinct, putting a highly visible scar on the landscape, and that they believed the new motorway would not adequately resolve traffic problems.|$|E
5|$|Internet venues {{unrelated}} to medical issues {{have also been}} the audience for such cases. A member of an online fan club for the musical Rent divulged numerous illnesses that caused her to slip {{in and out of}} comas, prompting some cast members to send sympathy cards. When other fan club members expressed <b>their</b> <b>concern,</b> even purchasing airline tickets to visit the sick woman, she reported that she had immediately improved.|$|E
50|$|The Birth of Merlin {{possesses}} a three-level plot, a structure common in plays of its era. On the first level, the main plot, {{the characters are}} royal and <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> are those of statecraft and national welfare; in the second-level plot, the characters are aristocratic and genteel and <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> are those of personal values and personal fulfilment; and {{on the level of}} the comic subplot, the characters are common and <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> are largely sensual.|$|R

5|$|On November 19, the British {{flotilla}} was captured, but Carleton narrowly escaped {{and made}} his way to Quebec City. Montgomery's kind treatment toward the captured British prisoners caused several officers to express <b>their</b> <b>concern.</b> Montgomery saw this as a challenge to his authority and this, along with the lack of discipline in the army, caused Montgomery to threaten resignation. Letters from Washington in which Washington also expressed his troubles with the discipline of troops convinced Montgomery to continue his command.|$|E
5|$|The case drew {{international}} attention and criticism, with organizations including the United Nations, the World Medical Association, Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Council of Nurses, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch expressing <b>their</b> <b>concern</b> over the health workers' military trials and sentences. An independent commission {{organized by the}} King of Bahrain concluded in November 2011 {{that many of the}} detained health workers had been subject to torture and abuse while in police detention.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not {{initially}} investigate; no crime had been committed, and the morals of ministers were not <b>their</b> <b>concern.</b> Although the relationship {{lasted only a}} few weeks it became public knowledge in 1962. Keeler attempted to publish her memoirs in the Sunday Pictorial in January 1963 but Profumo, still insisting that he had done nothing wrong, forced them to back down with threats of legal action should the story be published.|$|E

5|$|The {{show has}} {{frequently}} {{been criticized for}} perpetuating negative stereotypes about Italian Americans. Several major organizations have voiced <b>their</b> <b>concern</b> that The Sopranos presents a very distorted and harmful stereotype of Italian Americans and their cultural values, including the National Italian American Foundation, Order Sons of Italy in America, Unico National, and the Italic Institute of America.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{marriage}} had been strained from the beginning, Teresa Cristina continued striving to {{be a good}} wife. Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty, along with the birth of children, softened PedroII's attitude. The two discovered shared interests, and <b>their</b> <b>concern</b> for and delight in their children created a sense of family happiness. That they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued. After the birth of their first son in February 1845, the Empress bore children in July 1846, July 1847, and July 1848—named Afonso, Isabel, Leopoldina and Pedro, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Australian and New Zealand Governments, at {{the request}} of Pacific Island nations, sent defence representatives into the South-West Pacific region to assess {{surveillance}} and maritime patrol requirements. The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed <b>their</b> <b>concern</b> about the need for a suitable naval patrol force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide suitable patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to island nations in the region. The Pacific Patrol Boat Systems Program Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN procurement organisation.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian High Command {{warned the}} French and British of <b>their</b> <b>concerns.</b> They {{feared that the}} Dyle plan would put not just the Belgian {{strategic}} position in danger, but also the entire left wing of the Allied front. King Leopold and General Raoul Van Overstraeten, the King's Aide de Camp, warned Gamelin and the French Army Command of <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> on 8 March and 14 April. They were ignored.|$|R
5|$|On 1 March 1927, Joseph Berchtold {{transferred}} {{leadership of}} the SS to Heiden, who was his acting deputy. Berchtold had become disillusioned by the SA's authority over the SS. As head of the SS, Heiden also {{found it difficult to}} function under the larger and more powerful SA. Under Heiden's leadership a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA ranks. Heiden further demanded that the men under his command were not to be involved in party matters which were none of <b>their</b> <b>concern.</b> His intention was to create a small elite unit and obtain higher quality recruits.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine Israelite Mutual Association {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} with a car bomb on July 18, 1994, which killed eighty-five people. It was the most destructive terrorist attack {{in the history of}} Latin America. The attack was universally condemned and 155,000 people manifested <b>their</b> <b>concern</b> in a demonstration at the Congressional plaza; but Menem did not attend. The legal case stayed unresolved during the remainder of Menem's presidency. Menem had suggested, in the first press conference, that former Carapintada leaders may be responsible of the attack, but this idea was rejected by the minister of defense several hours later. The CIA office in Buenos Aires initially considered it a joint Iranian-Syrian attack, but some days later considered it just an Iranian attack. Menem and Mossad also preferred this line of investigation. As a result of the attack, the Jewish community in Argentina had increased influence over Argentine politics. Years later, the prosecutor Alberto Nisman charged Menem with covering up a local connection to the attack, as the local terrorists may have been distant Syrian relatives of the Menem family. However, Menem was never tried for this suspected cover up, and on 18 January 2015, Nisman was found dead of a gunshot to his head at his home in Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Constantine I (r. 306–337) {{preferred}} chariot {{racing to}} gladiatorial combat, which he considered a vestige of paganism. However, {{the end of}} gladiatorial games in the Empire {{may have been more}} the result of the difficulty and expense that came with procuring gladiators to fight in the games, than the influence of Christianity in Byzantium. The Olympic Games were eventually ended by Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) in 393, perhaps in a move to suppress paganism and promote Christianity, but chariot racing remained popular. The fact that chariot racing became linked to the imperial majesty meant that the Church did not prevent it, although gradually prominent Christian writers, such as Tertullian, began attacking the sport. Despite the influence of Christianity in the Byzantine Empire, venationes, bloody wild-beast hunts, continued as a form of popular entertainment during {{the early days of the}} Empire as part of the extra entertainment that went along with chariot racing. Eventually, Emperor Leo (r. 457–474) banned public entertainments on Sundays in 469, showing that the hunts did not have imperial support, and the venationes were banned completely by Emperor Anastasius (r. 491–518) in 498. Anastasius was praised for this action by some sources, but <b>their</b> <b>concern</b> seems to be more for the danger the hunts could put humans in rather than for objections to the brutality or moral objections. There continued to be burnings and mutilations of humans who committed crimes or were enemies of the state in the hippodrome throughout the Byzantine Empire, as well as victory celebrations and imperial coronations.|$|E
