5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Directive</b> Principles of State Policy, {{embodied}} in Part IV of the Constitution, are directions {{given to the}} state to guide {{the establishment of an}} economic and social democracy, as proposed by the Preamble.

The state is expected to keep these principles in mind while framing laws and policies, even though they are non-justiciable in nature. <b>The</b> <b>Directive</b> Principles may be classified under the following categories: ideals that the state ought to strive towards achieving; directions for the exercise of legislative and executive power; and rights of the citizens which the State must aim towards securing.|$|E

40|$|Almost {{the entire}} Wadden Sea {{area has been}} {{designated}} by Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands as a Special Protection Area under <b>the</b> Wild Birds <b>Directive</b> and as a Special Area of Conservation under <b>the</b> Habitats <b>Directive.</b> <b>The</b> new Water Framework Directive will, eventually, also have consequences for the area. What are the consequences of EU Directives aimed at protecting the Wadden Sea area? Provide these Directives effective protection against harmful activities? These questions have been dealt with through a case study on the decision-making process with regard to mechanical cockle fisheries in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea in 2004. Also, data obtained from other European research projects into the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>Directives</b> have been analyzed. These studies indicate that especially the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives can be very effective tools for legal protection of the area. Especially case law by the European Court of Justice has rendered <b>the</b> <b>Directives</b> strong teeth. <b>The</b> <b>Directives</b> offer opportunities to protect the area, without neglecting economic interests, although the effectiveness still very much depends on {{the political will to}} take <b>the</b> <b>Directives</b> seriously, and/or on NGOs that go to court, invoking the provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Directives.</b> According to some, <b>the</b> <b>Directives</b> are too effective!

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Directive</b> Principles {{have been}} used to uphold the Constitutional {{validity}} of legislations in case of a conflict with the Fundamental Rights. Article 31C, added by the 25th Amendment in 1971, provided that any law made to give effect to <b>the</b> <b>Directive</b> Principles in Article 39(b)–(c) would not be invalid {{on the grounds that they}} derogated from the Fundamental Rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 31. The application of this article was sought to be extended to all <b>the</b> <b>Directive</b> Principles by the 42nd Amendment in 1970, but the Supreme Court struck down the extension as void on the ground that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles have also been used together in forming the basis of legislation for social welfare. The Supreme Court, after the judgement in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has adopted the view of the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles being complementary to each other, each supplementing the other's role in aiming at the same goal of establishing a welfare state by means of social revolution. Similarly, the Supreme Court has used the Fundamental Duties to uphold the Constitutional validity of statutes which seeks to promote the objects laid out in the Fundamental Duties. These Duties have also been held to be obligatory for all citizens, subject to the State enforcing the same by means of a valid law. The Supreme Court has also issued directions to the State in this regard, with a view towards making the provisions effective and enabling a citizens to properly perform their duties.|$|E

The wealth effects differ at both the country and firm level. <b>The</b> <b>directives</b> have differential impacts on firms depending on the firms' characteristics and those of the market they operated in prior to <b>the</b> <b>directives.</b> Regression results indicate that <b>the</b> second <b>directives</b> have impacted firms in protected markets negatively, especially those with higher debt and higher returns on assets. At the time of <b>the</b> third <b>directives,</b> insurance firms benefited, even those in previously protected markets, indicating that firms may have positioned themselves in preparation for the liberalization of the laws.

5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued <b>the</b> <b>directive</b> to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In the European Union, animal {{sources are}} governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which {{requires}} lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported {{and is not a}} wild animal or a stray.

In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.|$|E
