40|$|Abstract. <b>Turner’s</b> {{logic of}} {{universal}} causation {{is a general}} logic for nonmonotonic reasoning. It has its origin in McCain and <b>Turner’s</b> causal action theories which have been translated to propositional logic and logic programming with nested expressions. In this paper, we propose {{to do the same}} for <b>Turner’s</b> logic, and show thatTurner’s logic can actually be mapped to McCain and <b>Turner’s</b> causal theories. These results can be used to construct a system for reasoning in <b>Turner’s</b> logic. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To study {{prevalence}} of <b>Turner's</b> syndrome in Denmark {{and to assess}} validity of prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN [...] Study of data on prenatal and postnatal <b>Turner's</b> syndrome in Danish Cytogenetic Central Register. SUBJECTS [...] All registered <b>Turner's</b> syndrome karyotypes (100 prenatal cases and 215 postnatal cases) during 1970 - 93. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prevalence of <b>Turner's</b> syndrome karyotypes among prenatally tested fetuses and <b>Turner's</b> syndrome among liveborn infants. RESULTS [...] Among infant girls, {{prevalence of}} <b>Turner's</b> syndrome was 32 / 100, 000. Among female fetuses tested by amniocentesis, prevalence of <b>Turner's</b> syndrome karyotypes was 176 / 100, 000 (relative risk of syndrome, 6. 74 compared with prevalence among untested pregnancies). Among female fetuses tested by chorion villus sampling, prevalence of syndrome karyotypes was 392 / 100, 000 (relative risk, 16. 8). We excluded prenatal tests referred because of results of ultrasound scanning: among fetuses tested by amniocentesis revised relative risk was 5. 68, while revised relative risk among fetuses tested by chorion villus sampling was 13. 3. For 29 fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of possible <b>Turner's</b> syndrome, pregnancy was allowed to continue and 24 children were live born. Thirteen of these children were karyotyped postnatally, and diagnosis of <b>Turner's</b> syndrome had to be revised for eight, seven being normal girls and one boy. This gives tentative predictive value of amniocentesis in diagnosing <b>Turner's</b> syndrome of between 21 % and 67 %. There was no significant relation between mother's age and risk of <b>Turner's</b> syndrome. CONCLUSIONS [...] Discrepancy between prenatal and postnatal prevalence of <b>Turner's</b> syndrome challenges specificity of prenatal examination in diagnosing <b>Turner's</b> syndrome...|$|R

Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when <b>Turner</b> would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. <b>Turner</b> later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from <b>Turner.</b> Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. <b>Turner</b> and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying.
