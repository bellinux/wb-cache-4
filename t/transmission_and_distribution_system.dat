500|$|The {{performance}} of Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie's power grid during 1998 Ice Storm {{raised questions about}} the fundamental concept, vulnerability, and reliability of the grid. Critics noted that the power generation facilities were located approximately [...] away from population centres and that {{there was a lack of}} local power stations around Montreal, which is served by only six 735kV feeder lines. In addition, the 735kV transmission system received scorn from the public and the media. The power transmission grid was said to concentrate power transmission on only a few 735kV lines, such as those that run from James Bay to Montreal. Out of the six 735 feeder lines in Montreal, five of them form a loop called the [...] "ring of power" [...] around the city. When the ring failed on January 7, 1998, roughly 60% of Greater Montreal's power supply was offline. Hydro-Québec's large above-ground <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> was considered to be exposed to natural disasters, although the cost of undergrounding the grid was prohibitive.|$|E

Telephone service remained working after the storm, due to most lines being underground. Strong waves washed away a few coastal roads in the northern portion of the island, leaving them temporarily closed. The waves surpassed the seawall at Apra Harbor, damaging the road and infrastructure of the seaport; many boats were washed ashore after breaking from their moorings. Strong winds damaged a radar system and lights along the runway of the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, though most airport facilities received light damage. Andersen Air Force Base also sustained heavy damage, with hundreds of downed trees and many facilities left damaged. Across Guam, damage was estimated at [...] About 100people were injured, but the typhoon caused no deaths on the island.|$|E

40|$|Combined <b>Transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Systems</b> (CoTDS) {{simulation}} {{for power}} systems requires development of algorithms and software that are numerically stable {{and at the}} same time accurately simulate dynamic events that can occur in practical systems. The dynamic behavior of <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> are vastly different, especially with the increased deployment of distribution generation. The time scales of simulation can be orders of magnitude apart making the combined simulation extremely challenging. This has led to increased research in applying co-simulation techniques for integrated simulation of the two systems. In this paper, a rigorous mathematical analysis on convergence of numerical methods in co-simulation is presented. Two methods for co-simulation of CoTDS are proposed using parallel and series computation of the <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> Both these co-simulation methods are validated against total system simulation in a single time-domain simulation environment. The series computation co-simulation method is shown to have better numerical stability at larger integration time steps. The series computation co-simulation method is additionally validated against commercial EMTP software and the results show remarkable correspondence. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

40|$|<b>Transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> dynamic co-simulation is a {{practical}} and effective approach to leverage existing simulation tools for <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> to simulate dynamic stability <b>and</b> performance of <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> in a systematic manner. Given that these tools are developed as stand-alone programs and there are inherent differences between them, interface techniques become critical to bridge them. Two important unsolved questions are: 1) which interface technique is better and should be used, and 2) how the modeling and simulation capabilities in these tools that are available and can be exploited for co-simulation should be considered when selecting an interface technique. To address these questions, this paper presents a comparative study for different interface techniques that can be employed for T and D dynamic co-simulation. The study provides insights into {{the pros and cons}} of each interface technique, and helps researchers make informed decisions on choosing the interface techniques.
