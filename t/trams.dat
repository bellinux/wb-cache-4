5|$|A £40 million {{contract}} to build 27 Urbos 3 <b>trams,</b> sufficient for phase 1a and (unbuilt) 1b lines, {{was awarded to}} CAF. When the line was cut back to York Place, only 17 <b>trams</b> would be needed. An unsuccessful attempt was made in 2011 to lease ten <b>trams</b> to Transport for London for use on Tramlink.|$|E
5|$|After the nationalization, {{the company}} started a {{renovation}} {{process of the}} infrastructure and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started going with a loss. Five new <b>trams</b> were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at the depot at Holtet, with used equipment {{from some of the}} older <b>trams.</b> An additional nine new <b>trams</b> were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional <b>trams</b> were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow <b>trams</b> had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors were made while switching from the one supply to the other. In addition, all the <b>trams</b> were custom-built with extra equipment with limited spare parts. All the <b>trams</b> delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt supply. The depot was expanded in 1952.|$|E
5|$|From 1908 to 1909, {{a hundred}} {{electric}} <b>trams</b> were manufactured by Duncan & Fraser of Adelaide {{at a cost}} of approximately £100 each. Up to its last tram purchase in 1953, the MTT commissioned over 300 electric <b>trams,</b> some of which have been kept in service for over seventy-five years. TransAdelaide, the publicly owned company now operating Adelaide <b>trams,</b> began introducing a new type of tram in January 2006 {{in the form of the}} Bombardier Flexity Classic.

50|$|A <b>tram</b> {{accident}} is any accident {{involving a}} <b>tram.</b> Alternatively, any accident involving a <b>tram</b> or a <b>tram</b> {{system may be}} considered a <b>tram</b> accident. The latter definition is more commonly used in public safety studies.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Oslo Sporveier was {{in need of}} new <b>trams</b> to operate on their network. Except for 40 {{articulated}} SL79-trams that had been delivered between 1982 and 1990, the company had several series of non-articulated <b>trams</b> with trailers that were built before 1960. The largest series were 13 SM53s, 11 rebuilt SM83s and 28 trailers, in addition to 34 SM91s that had been bought used from the Gothenburg Tramway in 1991. Oslo Sporveier considered several possibilities for new <b>trams,</b> including ordering additional SL79s, purchasing motorized trailers for SL79, purchasing new low-floor <b>trams,</b> purchasing <b>trams</b> from ČKD Tatra, purchasing the 11 used TT Class 8 <b>trams</b> from Trondheim, rebuild the SL79s with an additional section or purchasing used articulated <b>trams</b> from abroad. Purchasing used material and rebuilding the SL79s was quickly rejected. A non-articulated Tatra tram was tested in Oslo during January 1991.|$|E
5|$|Lothian Buses' {{services}} have been integrated with Edinburgh <b>Trams,</b> since the <b>trams</b> commenced operation in 2014 – both {{are owned by}} the council, and Lothian Buses services interchange with the <b>trams</b> at various locations. The now closed guided busway element of Fastlink formed part of phase 1a of the tram permanent way.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Sporveier had {{previously}} bought all their new <b>trams</b> custom-made. For the 1995 order, the company instead wanted {{to purchase a}} pre-designed tram. The company {{for a long time}} considered purchasing <b>trams</b> along with Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, who were needing new rolling stock for two light rail systems in Stockholm, Sweden. Three existing <b>trams</b> were tested in Oslo during 1995, and several <b>trams</b> were also tested in Stockholm.|$|E

5|$|Until 1958, <b>trams</b> {{formed a}} network {{spanning}} most of Adelaide, {{with a history}} dating back to 1878. Adelaide ran horse <b>trams</b> from 1878 to 1914 and electric <b>trams</b> from 1909, but has primarily relied on buses for public transport since 1958. Electric <b>trams</b> and trolleybuses were Adelaide's main public transport throughout {{the life of the}} electric tram network. All <b>trams</b> except the Glenelg tram were closed in the 1950s. The Glenelg tram remains in operation and was upgraded and extended in 2007-2010.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, {{deliveries}} were delayed, and in June all <b>trams</b> {{were taken}} out of service for three weeks to modify the gearboxes. In October, ten of thirteen <b>trams</b> {{were taken out}} of service due to radial run-out. The problem was large enough that some <b>trams</b> got a new radial run-out the day after they were fixed. From 6 January 2001, SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, and from 6 February, on the Ekeberg Line. However, the latter still had too short platforms.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, the {{rationing}} {{of petroleum}} fuels gave {{a boost to}} ridership on the electric tramways. To handle the massive increase in ridership, the <b>trams</b> were equipped with two conductors. The single-centre-door solution that worked excellently before the war became a bottle-neck as the <b>trams</b> became packed with riders. Lack of parts, particularly for the British Vickers motors, caused long waits for defective vehicles at the depots. From 1942, the Kolsås Line was transferred to terminate at Nationaltheatret in the city centre, and the Class B was operated along the Lilleaker Line from the west. <b>Trams</b> 164–166 were sent to Düsseldorf in Germany, but were never used because the city lacked balloon loops and the <b>trams</b> were too wide.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{additional}} <b>trams</b> {{were built}} by Strømmen as series two. The first vehicle was delivered on 4 August 1989 {{and was taken}} into service on 11 October, while the last was put into service on 27 August 1990. These were numbered 126 through 140. From 7 September 1990 to 1 February 1991, tram 140 was used on the tramway in Chemnitz, Germany. Following this delivery, all lines of the tramway used SL79, although there were still many other <b>trams</b> needed to supplement the new <b>trams.</b> During the summer of 1995, tram no. 137 was used on the Djurgården Line of the heritage tramway in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to a labor dispute about privatizing {{the operation of the}} tramway and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all <b>trams</b> and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E
5|$|From 1915, Summer Hill {{was served}} by <b>trams</b> from Hurlstone Park. <b>Trams</b> left New Canterbury Road {{and went down}} Prospect Road, then swung right onto Smith Street.

5|$|In 1960, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} {{gradually}} close the tramway. New <b>trams</b> had been delivered in 1958, {{and it was}} decided that lines would only be closed as <b>trams</b> were naturally retired. At the time Oslo Sporveier had 421 vehicles. By 1974, the company had 163 vehicles, of which 100 were powered <b>trams,</b> 43 were trailers and 20 were working trailers. Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, the political climate changed, and in 1977 the city council decided to not close the tramway anyway. Between 1978 and 1981, ten tram vehicles were bought from the Gothenburg Tramway.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, two <b>trams</b> were {{involved}} in an accident and sent to Firema for reparations. However, the company filed for bankruptcy, and as of October 2010 the <b>trams</b> were still not repaired or returned to Oslo. In 2010, Commissioner for Environmental Affairs and Transport Jøran Kallmyr (Progress Party) stated that the SL95 <b>trams</b> were being considered for replacement, {{at the same time}} as the much older SL79. Problems with the units included excessive noise, excessive amount of time out of order, rust, cracks in the axles, and increased wear to the infrastructure because they weighed too much. All except two of the SL95 <b>trams</b> were temporarily grounded on 29 April 2013 when it was discovered that rust had damaged the joints between the articulated sections on several <b>trams.</b>|$|E

These were delivered in 1939, with 20 (class E) being used by Oslo Sporveier mainly on the Kjelsås Line, but also on other services. The remaining 20 <b>trams</b> (class B) were leased to Bærumsbanen, that used them on the Kolsås and Østensjø Lines, and later on the Ekeberg Line.|$|E
