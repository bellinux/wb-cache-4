30|$|Polymer {{flooding}} is {{a popular}} enhanced oil recovery method because of its impact on improvement of sweep efficiency. Polymers are non-Newtonian fluids with different behavior at different flow rates. At high shear rate, they reveal shear-thinning behavior, which is the apparent viscosity reduction by increasing shear rate. However, higher shear rate let them become dilatant. Consequently, an increase in shear rate contributes to increase in apparent viscosity and thus decreases the well injectivity of polymer. Hydraulic fracturing reduces mechanical shearing {{in the vicinity of}} the wellbore and plays an important role in feasibility of polymer flooding scenarios due to injectivity enhancement and lowering shear rate. A <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>simulator</b> was used to construct a synthetic model of the reservoir with no-flow boundary condition. Results show that induced hydraulic fractures improve recovery factor of homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs due to an increase in injectivity of polymer flooding, although in vertically heterogeneous reservoirs, induced fractures are not very effective. The results also show that the induced fractures are more successful in reservoirs with viscous oil.|$|E

40|$|Many {{operators}} of steamdrive projects {{will reduce the}} heat injection rate as the project matures. The major benefit of this practice {{is to reduce the}} fuel costs and thus extend the economic life of the project. However, there is little industry consensus on whether the heat cuts should take the form of: (1) mass rate reductions while maintaining the same high steam quality, or (2) steam quality decreases while keeping the same mass rate. Through the use of a commercial three-phase, <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>simulator,</b> the oil recovery schedules obtained when reducing the injected steam mass rate or quality with time were compared under a variety of reservoir and operating conditions. The simulator input was validated for Kern River Field conditions by using the guidelines developed by Johnson, et at. (1989) for four steamflood projects in Kern River. The results indicate that for equivalent heat injection rates, decreasing the steam injection mass rate at a constant high quality will yield more economic oil than reducing the steam quality at a constant mass rate. This conclusion is confirmed by a sensitivity analysis which demonstrates the importance of the gravity drainage/steam zone expansion mechanism in a low-pressure, heavy oil steamflood with gravity segregation. Furthermore, the impact of discontinuous silts and nonuniform initial temperatures within the steamflood zone was studied, indicating again that a decreasing mass rate injection strategy is a superior operating practice...|$|E

In order to investigate underwater manipulator operations maneuvered by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), this paper develops a virtual underwater manipulator and its carrier, the ROV, via the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>simulator</b> “Webots” to animate operational tasks. The ROV model refers to the structure of a typical ROV which operates below the ocean&# 39;s surface down to 1000  m, while the graphical and kinematic models of the manipulator refer to a master-slave servo hydraulic manipulator with 7 functions, consisting of six degrees of freedom (DOFs) and a parallel gripper for manipulations.

40|$|Multistage {{collectors}} {{are commonly}} used in travelling wave tubes (TWTs), klystrons, gyrotrons and inductive output tubes (IOTs). A dc beam transfers some of its energy to the input RF wave during its travel through the interaction circuit. The purpose of a collector is to recover {{most of the remaining}} dc power from the spent beam and thereby increase both the collector and the overall efficiency. Secondary electrons play a detrimental role in collector performance. Use of the asymmetric collector geometries and application of a magnetic field in the collector region have proved to be effective in recapturing the secondaries. A fully <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>simulator</b> LKOBRA (MF) – the mainframe version of Lancaster KOBRA, has been developed at Lancaster University; this is capable of simulating multistage collectors including the effects of secondary electron emission and magnetic field. It is based on KOBRA 3 -INP 1 but has been modified and improved together with the pre- and post-processors of the package. Efficiency is an important parameter in space applications of microwave tubes so it is always desirable to optimise the collector performance to maximise the overall tube efficiency. As a first step the potentials at the collector electrodes are optimised to achieve the maximum possible theoretical efficiency. A computer code based on the well-known enumerative technique has been developed for this purpose. In the next step the geometry of the collector electrodes is optimised using an automated design package that is based on a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm creates a new geometry through a search procedure that works from a population of possible geometries. A new set of geometries is generated using three basic operators namely reproduction, crossover and mutation. The collector efficiency is used as the fitness parameter in the genetic algorithm that produces a new population of geometries.
