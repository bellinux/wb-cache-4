25|$|A legal {{challenge}} was {{filed in the}} Superior Court of Essex County, contesting the fine imposed for a citizen's failure <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>health</b> insurance {{as well as the}} fine imposed for a failure to provide information on a tax return as to whether that citizen had health insurance. The judge dismissed the case upon a motion filed by an assistant to Attorney General Martha Coakley for failure to state a case upon which relief can be granted. A petition for a writ of mandamus to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), ordering Essex Superior Court to vacate this dismissal on procedural grounds, the failure to provide trial by jury in a dispute over property as requested by the plaintiff, was denied by Associate Justice Spina. An appeal was then filed with the Massachusetts Appeals Court. A later petition for a writ of mandamus with the SJC was also denied, this time by Chief Justice Ireland. The Appeals Court then heard the appeal and declined to send the case back to Essex Superior Court for trial by jury based on their belief that no facts needed to be determined and therefore trial by jury in this case was not a protected right under either the US or Massachusetts Constitutions. The SJC declined to hear any further appeals.|$|E
500|$|On {{the dawn}} of the final month of campaigning, Barr {{appeared}} on National Public Radio, and discussed his political positions, including those on health care, a topic that had rarely been discussed by Barr {{over the course of his}} campaign. Barr gave his shortest response to the issue, saying that [...] "everybody ought to be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>health</b> care, but that's up to them..." [...] and went on to say that [...] "the government could be...reducing and removing the onerous regulations that actually prevent people from being able to afford health care." [...] Close to the end of the campaign, Barr's polling numbers remained stagnant. An Associated Press-GfK poll from late October placed the candidate at 1% nationally, the same figure he had stood at three weeks previously.|$|E
500|$|Corzine {{had long}} insisted that state {{employees}} must bear {{part of the}} cost of their health benefits after retirement. As of July 1, 2007, in agreements with the Communications Workers of America, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, active State employees in those unions (as well as certain other non-union employees) are now required to contribute 1.5% of their salary to offset health care costs. State and local employees’ contributions to the two largest pension systems increased by 10%, from 5% to 5.5% of their annual salaries and increased the retirement benefit age for new public employees, from 55 to 60 years. In 2008, Corzine approved a law that increased the retirement age from 60 to 62, required that government workers and teachers earn $7,500 per year to qualify for a pension, eliminated Lincoln's Birthday as a state worker holiday, allowed the state to offer incentives not to take health insurance and required municipal employees work 20 hours per week <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>health</b> benefits.|$|E

2500|$|McCain {{is against}} {{publicly}} funded health care, universal health care, or health coverage mandates. Instead, he favors tax credits {{of up to}} $5,000 for families <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>health</b> insurance. His plan focuses on enhancing competition {{in the health care}} industry as a way to lower costs. To that end, McCain favors the Health Care Choice Act, which would allow citizens to purchase health insurance nationwide instead of limiting them to in-state companies, and to buy insurance through any organization or association they choose as well as through their employers or buying direct from an insurance company. In an October 2007 statement, McCain said: [...] "In health care, we believe in enhancing the freedom of individuals to receive necessary and desired care. We do not believe in coercion and the use of state power to mandate care, coverage or costs." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} in {{gaining access to}} certain medicines and treatments has led to healthcare playing an increasing role in Cuba's burgeoning black market economy, sometimes termed [...] "sociolismo". According to former leading Cuban neurosurgeon and dissident Dr Hilda Molina, [...] "The doctors in the hospitals are charging patients under the table for better or quicker service." [...] Prices for out-of-surgery X-rays have been quoted at $50 to $60. Such [...] "under-the-table payments" [...] reportedly {{date back to the}} 1970s, when Cubans used gifts and tips in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>health</b> benefits. The harsh economic downturn known as the [...] "Special Period" [...] in the 1990s aggravated these payments. The advent of the [...] "dollar economy", a [...] legalization of the dollar which led some Cubans to receive dollars from their relatives outside of Cuba, meant that a class of Cubans were able to obtain medications and health services that would not be available to them otherwise.|$|E
