40|$|A common way of {{organizing}} Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointers (WIMP) interfaces is to group tools into tool containers, providing one visual representation. Common tool containers include toolbars and menus, {{as well as}} more complex tool containers, like Microsoft Office’s Ribbon, Toolglasses, and marking menus. The location of tool containers has been studied extensively in the past using Fitts’s Law, which governs selection time; however, selection time is only one aspect of user performance. In this thesis, I show that <b>tool</b> <b>container</b> location affects other aspects of user performance, specifically attention and awareness. The problem investigated in this thesis is that designers lack an understanding of the effects of <b>tool</b> <b>container</b> location on two important user performance factors: attention and group awareness. My solution is to provide an initial understanding of the effects of <b>tool</b> <b>container</b> location on these factors. In solving this problem, I developed a taxonomy of <b>tool</b> <b>container</b> location, and carried out two research studies. The two research studies investigated <b>tool</b> <b>container</b> location in two contexts: single-user performance with desktop interfaces, and group performance in tabletop interfaces. Through the two studies, I was able to show that <b>tool</b> <b>container</b> location does affect attention and group awareness, and to provide new recommendations for interface designers...|$|E

40|$|Efficient robot {{operation}} {{requires the}} use of specialized end effectors or tools for tasks. In spacecraft applications, the microgravity environment precludes {{the use of}} gravitational forces to retain the tools in holding fixture. As a result of this, a retention mechanism which forms a part of the <b>tool</b> storage <b>container</b> is required. A unique approach to this problem has resulted in the development of an end effector exchange mechanism that meets the requirements for spaceflight applications while avoiding the complexity usually involved. This mechanism uses multiple latching cams both on the manipulator and in the <b>tool</b> storage <b>container,</b> combined with a system of catch rings to provide retention in both locations and the required failure tolerance. Because of the cam configuration the mechanism operates passively, requiring no electrical commands except those needed to move the manipulator into position. Similarly, it inherently provides interlocks to prevent the release of one cam before its opposite number is engaged...|$|R

40|$|The {{last three}} years have {{witnessed}} many maritime accidents (like “Costa Concordia”, “Mol Comfort”, “MV Smart”, etc), which led to serious consequences including the loss of human life and asset and environment pollution. In order to mitigate loss, maritime emergency response requires time-saving. So, a fast numerical tool {{is very important for}} supporting decision making and related engineering work in emergency case. Currently, most fast numerical modeling method is either by manually laboriously building or requires 3 D or 2 D AUTO CAD drawing, which is very difficult to obtain in emergency situation. Thus this thesis is aiming to propose a fast numerical method based on limited information from emergency situation. Based on the fast numerical model, structural analysis, weight estimation, etc, can be assessed, thus supporting decision making and engineering work. In consistent with the emergency situation, global longitudinal bending strength is analyzed based on the fast numerical model in the present work. This thesis is divided into 3 parts: rapid numerical method and a corresponding numerical <b>tool</b> for <b>container</b> ship; verification of this numerical tool in global structural response and longitudinal ultimate bending strength assessment for container ship; longitudinal ultimate strength assessment for other types of structure like OT, BC, FPSO, etc. Firstly, in this thesis, a global data structure for storing ship geometric information from available drawings after emergency situation is developed in this thesis. Based on this data structure, a rapid numerical modeling method is developed in the present work. Then, a corresponding rapid numerical <b>tool</b> in <b>container</b> ship is produced. Secondly, the fast numerical tool is validated in structural response of global FE model of container ship. And the failure mechanism of container ship under sagging is investigated by both numerical model and analytical model. Based on it, the longitudinal ultimate bending moment is obtained by the generated fast numerical model. Finally, for other type of ship structures like OT, BC, FPSO, etc, the failure mode of the structure under pure bending is investigated by nonlinear finite element analysis. Based on the failure mode, a simplified method for assessing ultimate bending moment by NLFEM is proposed and validated with experiment result and ISSC benchmark study. This validated fast numerical <b>tool</b> for <b>container</b> ship can be used for structural analysis, structural weight estimation etc, and thus supporting engineering in emergency case. And the generic fast numerical method can be further applied for other types of ship structure, like OT, BC, FPSO etc. A corresponding simplified NLFEM method can be used for assessing maximum bending capacity and thus supporting lifting engineering work.

40|$|A major {{robotics}} {{opportunity for}} NASA {{will be the}} Mars Rover/Sample Return Mission which could be launched {{as early as the}} 1990 s. The exploratory portion of this mission will include two autonomous subsystems: the rover vehicle and a sample handling system. The sample handling system {{is the key to the}} process of collecting Martian soils. This system could include a core drill, a general-purpose manipulator, <b>tools,</b> <b>containers,</b> a return canister, certification hardware and a labeling system. Integrated into a functional package, the sample handling system is analogous to a complex robotic workcell. Discussed here are the different components of the system, their interfaces, forseeable problem areas and many options based on the scientific goals of the mission. The various interfaces in the sample handling process (component to component and handling system to rover) will be a major engineering effort. Two critical evaluation criteria that will be imposed on the system are flexibility and reliability. It needs to be flexible enough to adapt to different scenarios and environments and acquire the most desirable specimens for return to Earth. Scientists may decide to change the distribution and ratio of core samples to rock samples in the canister. The long distance and duration of this planetary mission places a reliability burden on the hardware. The communication time delay between Earth and Mars minimizes operator interaction (teleoperation, supervisory modes) with the sample handler. An intelligent system will be required to plan the actions, make sample choices, interpret sensor inputs, and query unknown surroundings. A combination of autonomous functions and supervised movements will be integrated into the sample handling system...|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} of the first permanent surpluses are associated with tribal groups who {{are more or less}} settled in one territory, and stored foodstuffs.

In addition, a secure surplus product makes possible population growth, i.e. less starvation, infanticide, or abandonment of the elderly or infirm.
