More direct evidence for the involvement of the anterior <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> in memory processes emerges from two experiments with rats that examined performance of a spatial test of working memory, delayed nonmatching-to-position. The first study revealed that neurotoxic lesions of the anterior <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> and radiofrequency lesions of the fornix both produce equivalent performance deficits. In contrast, lesions of the mamillary bodies were without effect. A second study showed that lesions of the fornix and removal of the hippocampus produced very similar deficits.

Methods: Fifty-two patients with IGE characterized by generalized tonic-clonic seizures and 67 healthy controls {{were involved in the}} study. The three-dimensional high-resolution T 1 -weighted MRI data were acquired for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, and resting-state blood-oxygenation level functional MRI data were acquired for functional connectivity analysis. The <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> of bilateral medial dorsal nucleus (MDN) and pulvinar, as detected with decreased gray matter volumes in patients with IGE through VBM analysis, were selected as seed regions for functional connectivity analysis.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} shown that <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> can be automatically segmented using diffusion tensor images (DTI) {{under the assumption}} that principal fiber orientation is similar within a given nucleus and distinct between adjacent nuclei. Validation of these methods, however, is challenging because manual delineation is hard to carry out {{due to the lack of}} images showing contrast between the nuclei. In this paper, we present a novel gray-scale contrast for DTI visualization that accentuates voxels in which the orientations of the principal eigenvectors are changing, thus providing an edge map for the delineation of some <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The method uses the principal fiber orientation computed from the diffusion tensors computed at each voxel. The three-dimensional orientations of the principal eigenvectors are represented as five dimensional vectors and the spatial gradient (matrix) of these vectors provide information about spatial changes in tensor orientation. In particular, an edge map is created by computing the Frobenius norm of this gradient matrix. We show that this process reveals distinct edges between large nuclei in the thalamus, thereby making manual delineation of the <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> possible. We briefly describe a protocol for the manual delineation of <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> based on this edge map used in conjunction with a registered T 1 -weighted MR image, and present a preliminary multi-rater evaluation of the volumes of <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> in several subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{anterior}} <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei,</b> {{a central}} component of Papez’ circuit, are generally {{assumed to be}} key constituents of the neural circuits responsible for certain categories of learning and memory. Supporting evidence for this contention is that damage to either of two brain regions, the medial temporal lobe and the medial diencephalon, is most consistently associated with anterograde amnesia. Within these respective regions, the hippocampal formation and the anterior <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> (anteromedial, anteroventral, anterodorsal) are the particular structures of interest. The extensive direct and indirect hippocampal-anterior thalamic interconnections {{and the presence of}} theta-modulated cells in both sites further support the hypothesis that these structures constitute a neuronal network crucial for memory and cognition. The major tool in understanding how the brain processes information is the analysis of neuronal output at each hierarchical level along the pathway of signal propagation coupled with neuroanatomical studies. Here, we discuss the electrophysiological properties of cells in the anterior <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> with an emphasis on their role in spatial navigation. In addition, we describe neuroanatomical and functional relationships between the anterior <b>thalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> and hippocampal formation...|$|R

50|$|The {{thalamus}} {{has multiple}} functions. It may {{be thought of}} as a kind of hub of information. It is generally believed to act as a relay between different subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. In particular, every sensory system (with the exception of the olfactory system) includes a <b>thalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> that receives sensory signals and sends them to the associated primary cortical area. For the visual system, for example, inputs from the retina are sent to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn projects to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. The thalamus is believed to both process sensory information as well as relay it—each of the primary sensory relay areas receives strong feedback connections from the cerebral cortex.Similarly the medial geniculate nucleus acts as a key auditory relay between the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and the primary auditory cortex. The ventral posterior nucleus is a key somatosensory relay, which sends touch and proprioceptive information to the primary somatosensory cortex.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{function of the}} pars compacta is motor control, though the substantia nigra's role in motor control is indirect; electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra does not result in movement, due to mediation of the striatum in the nigral influence of movement. The pars compacta sends excitatory input to the striatum via D1 pathway that excites and activates the striatum, resulting in the release of GABA onto the globus pallidus to inhibit its inhibitory effects on the <b>thalamic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> This causes the thalamocortical pathways to become excited and transmits motor neuron signals to the cerebral cortex to allow the initiation of movement, which is absent in Parkinson's disease. However, lack of pars compacta neurons has a large influence on movement, {{as evidenced by the}} symptoms of Parkinson's. The motor role of the pars compacta may involve fine motor control, as has been confirmed in animal models with lesions in that region.|$|E
