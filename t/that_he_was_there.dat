Mac, Max and Logan finish their report, but the {{professor}} cuts Logan off in the middle and dislikes it. Leo becomes a deputy again, while Vinnie enters the Sheriff’s office and states his intention to run against Keith in the special election.|$|E
5|$|Union forces hastily {{attempted}} {{to destroy the}} vital salt works. They destroyed about {{one third of the}} boiling kettles and most evaporating sheds. They also damaged portions of the Virginia & Tennessee railroad. But they failed to destroy or damage the actual salt wells. General Stoneman claimed a victory and retreated out of Virginia before Confederate forces could completely surround him. Carpenter's role is strangely missing from letters and other documents that simply note <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> Within three months, the saltworks were back in full production. Carpenter later wrote a long letter home about this battle and how his men responded.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Royal Governor Robert Dinwiddie sent militia Major George Washington to the Ohio Country (a {{territory}} that was claimed by {{several of the}} British colonies, including Virginia) as an emissary in December 1753, to tell the French to leave. Saint-Pierre politely informed Washington <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> pursuant to orders, that Washington's letter should have been addressed to his commanding officer in Canada, {{and that he had}} no intention of leaving.|$|E

Antonio tries {{to pay for}} Angellica, but Pedro steps up and declares <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> first. They fight. Willmore and Blunt enter and break them up. Pedro challenges Antonio to a duel the next day over Angellica. Antonio accepts; Pedro exits.|$|E
25|$|From Senafe, Merewether {{sent out}} two letters from Lieutenant-General Napier: one to Emperor Tewodros, {{demanding}} {{the release of}} the hostages (which Rassam intercepted and destroyed, afraid this ultimatum might enrage Tewodros against the prisoners); the other to the people of Ethiopia, proclaiming <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> purely to free the captives and that he had hostile intentions only towards those who sought to oppose him. Napier arrived at Zula on 2 January 1868, and put the finishing touches on his plan of advance before leaving on 25 January for Senafe.|$|E
500|$|The {{people of}} Falmouth had mixed {{reactions}} {{to the presence of}} the British fleet. [...] Some recognized the Canceaux and believed there was no danger; but militia members remembering Thompson's War were more suspicious. [...] The next day was windless: Mowat kedged the ships into the inner harbor and anchored them near the town. [...] He sent one of his lieutenants ashore with a proclamation stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to [...] "execute a just punishment" [...] for the town's state of rebellion. He gave the townspeople two hours to evacuate.|$|E

500|$|MacArthur has a contested legacy. In the Philippines in 1942, he {{suffered}} a defeat that Gavin Long described as [...] "the greatest {{in the history of}} American foreign wars." [...] Despite this, [...] "in a fragile period of the American psyche when the general American public, still stunned by the shock of Pearl Harbor and uncertain what lay ahead in Europe, desperately needed a hero, they wholeheartedly embraced Douglas MacArthur—good press copy <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>There</b> simply were no other choices that came close to matching his mystique, not to mention his evocative lone-wolf stand—something that has always resonated with Americans." ...|$|E
500|$|Through threadbare clues and supposition, mostly centred {{around a}} {{relatively}} wealthy couple that perished during a plague, {{believed to be}} his parents, Lochner {{is thought to have}} come from Meersburg, near Lake Constance. Georg and Alhet Lochner were citizens and died there in 1451. A [...] "Stefan" [...] is referred to as [...] "Stefan Lochner of Constance" [...] in two documents dated 1444 and 1448. However, there is no archival evidence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> and his style bears no trace of the art in that region. There are no further records of him or his family in the town except for a mention of Lochners (a fairly uncommon name) in the village of Hagnau, two kilometers from Meersburg.|$|E
2500|$|After final safety checks, the new mosque {{received}} a temporary certificate of occupancy on August 7, 2012, during Ramadan. The building opened on August 10 for Friday prayers. Although there were concerns about public safety, the occasion passed off peacefully. A single opponent {{turned up in}} an [...] "I Love Jesus" [...] hat and told reporters <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to [...] "represent the Christians".|$|E

2500|$|Although the 1938 West Wall {{confrontation}} is well documented, {{based on}} remarks by witnesses and other contemporaries (and several secondary sources), {{the second time}} von Wietersheim and Hitler fought openly can only be discerned from a paragraph in OKW chief Wilhelm Keitel's memoirs, who reports <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> when von Wietersheim again disapproved of Hitler's war plans, this time for the much more drastic goal of attacking Poland: ...|$|E
2500|$|Virginia colonial Lieutenant Colonel George Washington {{was sent}} by Governor Robert Dinwiddie to travel from Williamsburg to Fort LeBeouf in the Ohio Territory (a {{territory}} claimed by several of the British colonies, including Virginia) as an emissary in December 1753, to deliver a letter.

2500|$|Verdelot {{may have}} been killed in the siege of Florence (1529–1530) or in the {{simultaneous}} plague that ravaged the city, since there is no definite evidence that he was alive after 1530. <b>That</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> during the siege has been considered likely on the evidence of one of his motets, composed around that time, Congregati sunt inimici nostri. [...] In this work, texts from Ecclesiasticus are woven together with the Antiphon for Peace, [...] "Da pacem Domine", which is used as a cantus firmus.|$|E

2500|$|The director's cut {{has updated}} controls, {{stereoscopic}} 3D, updated HD visuals, PlayStation Move support, downloadable content including various pre-order bonuses, and additional scenarios written by Suehiro. It adds a frame {{story of an}} elderly Zach narrating the plot of Deadly Premonition to his granddaughter, Michelle Louise Morgan. The extended ending shows the elderly Zach entering the alternate reality, where he is warmly greeted by the inhabitants. York reassures him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> {{every step of the}} way and tells him about a new case involving an outbreak of illness in New Orleans. After asking his opinion on the case, York tells him [...] "it's time to wake up", and Louise can be heard off-screen informing her mother that he has disappeared and wondering where he could have gone to.|$|E
2500|$|On December 10, 1994 Judge Belfi ruled Ferguson was {{competent}} to stand trial. Belfi said he based his decision {{in part on}} his conversations with Ferguson in the courtroom, including Ferguson's concern over Governor Pataki's promise to sign a death-penalty bill. Belfi strongly advised Ferguson against defending himself, but Ferguson said he intended to defend himself. Kuby said of the decision, [...] "What we will have now is a complete circus. A crazy man cannot defend himself. Mr. Ferguson, evidence to the contrary, believes he is not guilty and that someone else killed all those people aboard the train." [...] Kuby continued, [...] "Without a psychiatric defense, Ferguson has no defense. There was no doubt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> that he fired the weapon, {{that he would have}} fired it more if he had not been wrestled to the ground. There is no doubt that Colin Ferguson, if sane, was guilty." ...|$|E
2500|$|His speech {{surprised}} the liberal attendees like André Duran-Angliviel, his sister Eve Fichet, journalist using the nickname Eve Nohelle, the unionist Joachim Durel and the lawyer Mohamed Noomane. Durel criticized Bourguiba's thinking and wrote in Tunis socialiste that [...] "Everything worked well {{and there he}} was talking about Tunisian personality. As if there even were a Tunisian personality! But we are dealing with a mix of Arabs, Muslims, Jews, Maltese, French...". Bourguiba, in response, was opposed to Durel's thinking as he demonstrated by his articles in L'Étendard tunisien. The controversy that followed opposed, for nearly a month, Bourguiba and Durel, who was astonished that Bourguiba ended up with a French woman. Bourguiba then wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to raise their son as a proper Tunisian, according to their country's culture and education. In 1973, Bourguiba testified on this controversy that had been his political start: ...|$|E

2500|$|Gandalf calls Tom Bombadil {{the eldest}} being in existence; this is {{evidenced}} by his Sindarin name Iarwain Ben-adar (Eldest and Fatherless). Dwarves called him Forn (Old Norse, meaning [...] "Ancient" [...] or [...] "Belonging to the distant past"; in Icelandic it can also mean that he has magical abilities), Men Orald (compare to Dutch oeroud and German uralt, [...] "ancient, very old"). All these names apparently mean [...] "Eldest". Treebeard calls himself the eldest living being of Middle-earth and says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> before anyone else. However, Tolkien remarked in another context: [...] "Treebeard is a character in my story, not me; and though {{he has a great}} memory and some earthy wisdom, he {{is not one of the}} Wise, and there is quite a lot he does not know or understand." [...] The apparent discrepancy has also been explained by Tolkien deliberately mirroring the self-contradictory textual traditions of real-world medieval texts.|$|E
2500|$|But a whole {{generation}} of journalists and activists were influenced greatly by Seldes. Long-time Washington Post columnist Colman McCarthy said, [...] "He was a reporter who didn't worry about being objective. He worried about what he would choose to write. I'm always amused when they call somebody 'one-sided'. Seldes offered one side – the side you weren't getting elsewhere". Nader said of Seldes, [...] "He was like a doctor. He reported about disease in the political economy, and the gross inequities of power, and the abuses and the exploitation. I {{always wanted to be a}} crusading lawyer, and he gave me some materials to contemplate crusading about." [...] Journalist Nat Hentoff said, [...] "He took what should be the most honorable term in journalism – muckraking – and made it work again. A lot of journalists of his generation and the generation or two that followed, did more, took risks, because [...] was the model. And the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> made them feel like whores if they didn't do more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Concurrent {{with the}} succès de scandale, both Buñuel and the film's leading lady, Lya Lys, {{received}} offers of interest from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and traveled to Hollywood at the studio's expense. While in the United States, Buñuel associated with other celebrity expatriates including Sergei Eisenstein, Josef Von Sternberg, Jacques Feyder, Charles Chaplin and Bertolt Brecht. [...] All that was required of Buñuel by his loose-ended contract with MGM {{was that he}} [...] "learn some good American technical skills", but, after being ushered off the first set he visited because the star, Greta Garbo, did not welcome intruders, he decided {{to stay at home}} most of the time and only show up to collect his paycheck. [...] His only enduring contribution to MGM came when he served as an extra in La Fruta Amarga, a Spanish-language remake of Min and Bill. [...] When, after a few months at the studio, he was asked to watch rushes of Lili Damita to gauge her Spanish accent, he refused and sent a message to studio boss Irving Thalberg stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> as a Frenchman, not a Spaniard, and he [...] "didn't have time to waste listening to one of the whores". [...] He was back in Spain shortly thereafter.|$|E

On one occasion, Wilson redesigned a bedroom to resemble a prison cell, complete with a mural depicting prisoners. On several occasions, his designs have reduced the homeowners to tears. Wilson has said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> to make an interesting, entertaining show, and the homeowner's wishes are secondary.|$|R
