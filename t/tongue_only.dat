2500|$|The general inferiority of seventeenth-century {{literature}} {{to that of}} the preceding age has been blamed on the new royal absolutism, the Portuguese Inquisition, the Index, and the exaggerated humanism of the Jesuits who directed higher education; nevertheless, had a man of genius appeared he would have overcome all obstacles. In fact letters shared in the national decline. The taint of Gongorism and Marinism attacked all the Seiscentistas, as may be seen in the [...] "Fenix Renascida", and rhetoric conquered style. The Revolution of 1640 restored a Portuguese king to the throne, but could not undo the effects of the sixty years personal union with the Spanish crown. The use of Spanish continued among the upper class and was preferred by many authors who desired a larger audience. Spain had given birth to great writers for whom the Portuguese forgot the earlier ones of their own land. The foreign influence was strongest in the drama. The leading Portuguese playwrights wrote in Spanish, and in the national <b>tongue</b> <b>only</b> poor religious pieces and a witty comedy by D. Francisco Manuel de Mello, [...] "Auto do Fidalgo Aprendiz", were produced. The numerous Academies which arose with exotic names aimed at raising the level of letters, but they spent themselves is discussing ridiculous theses and determined the triumph of pedantry and bad taste. Yet though culteranismo and conceptismo infected nearly everyone, the century did not lack its big names.|$|E

I have renounced the dear {{intercourse}} of my kind; compelled my <b>tongue</b> <b>only</b> to utter, {{like that of a}} spy, the knowledge which my ear had only collected as a base eavesdropper. This I have done for years--for years--and all for the sake of your private applause--and the hope of vengeance on a woman, who, if she did ill in murdering my father, has been bitterly repaid by nourishing a serpent in her bosom, that had the tooth, but not the deafened ear, of the adder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fellow {{is devoted}} to me, body and soul!" [...] Captain Mitchell was given to affirm; and though nobody, perhaps, could have {{explained}} why it should be so, it was impossible on a survey of their relation to throw doubt on that statement, unless, indeed, one were a bitter, eccentric character like Dr. Monygham--for instance--whose short, hopeless laugh expressed somehow an immense mistrust of mankind. Not that Dr. Monygham was a prodigal either of laughter or of words. He was bitterly taciturn when at his best. At his worst people feared the open scornfulness of his <b>tongue.</b> <b>Only</b> Mrs. Gould could keep his unbelief in men's motives within due bounds; but even to her (on an occasion not connected with Nostromo, and in a tone which for him was gentle), even to her, he had said once, [...] "Really, it is most unreasonable to demand that a man should think of other people {{so much better than}} he is able to think of himself." ...|$|E

Trees grew there out of mud, arched upon lean and high roots, and many muddy waterways ran all whither into darkness, under the trees. Here we lost the sun. We {{followed the}} winding channels between the trees, and where we could not row we laid hold of the crusted roots and hauled ourselves along. The water was foul, and great glittering flies tormented us. Morning and evening a blue mist covered the mud, which bred fevers. Four of our rowers sickened, and were bound to their benches, lest they should leap overboard and be eaten by the monsters of the mud. The Yellow Man lay sick beside the Wise Iron, rolling his head and talking in his own <b>tongue.</b> <b>Only</b> the Bird throve. She sat on Witta's shoulder and screamed in that noisome, silent darkness. Yes; I think it was the silence we most feared.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{sometimes}} spoke, with {{a certain}} zeal, of my starting a Periodical: Why not lift up some kind of war-flag against the obese platitudes, and sickly superstitious aperies and impostures of the time? But I had to answer, [...] "Who will join it, my friend?" [...] He seemed to say, [...] "I, for one;" [...] and there was occasionally a transient temptation in the thought, but transient only. No fighting regiment, with the smallest attempt towards drill, co-operation, commissariat, or the like unspeakable advantages, could be raised in Sterling's time or mine; which truly, to honest fighters, is a rather grievous want. A grievous, but not quite a fatal one. For, failing this, failing all things and all men, there remains the solitary battle (and were it by the poorest weapon, the <b>tongue</b> <b>only,</b> or were it even by wise abstinence and silence and without any weapon), such as each man for himself can wage while he has life: an indubitable and infinitely comfortable fact for every man! Said battle shaped itself for Sterling, as we have long since seen, chiefly in the poetic form, in the singing or hymning rather than the speaking form; and in that he was cheerfully assiduous according to his light. The unfortunate Strafford is far on towards completion; a Coeur-de-Lion, of which we shall hear farther, [...] "Coeur-de-Lion, greatly {{the best of all}} his Poems," [...] unluckily not completed, and still unpublished, already hangs in the wind.|$|E
60|$|This kind {{of taste}} hardly differs from touch or burning. The {{sensibility}} of {{the tip of}} the tongue is only a very slight modification of the sensibility possessed by the skin generally, and especially by the inner folds over all delicate parts of the body. We all know that common caustic burns us wherever it touches; and it burns the <b>tongue</b> <b>only</b> in a somewhat more marked manner. Nitric or sulphuric acid attacks the fingers each after its own kind. A mustard plaster makes us tingle almost immediately; and the action of mustard on the tongue hardly differs, except in being more instantaneous and more discriminative. Cantharides work in just the same way. If you cut a red pepper in two and rub it on your neck, it will sting just as it does when put into soup (this experiment, however, is best tried upon one's younger brother; if made personally, it hardly repays the trouble and annoyance). Even vinegar and other acids, rubbed into the skin, are followed by a slight tingling; while the effect of brandy, applied, say, to the arms, is gently stimulating and pleasurable, somewhat {{in the same way as}} when normally swallowed in conjunction with the habitual seltzer. In short, most things which give rise to distinct tastes when applied to {{the tip of the}} tongue give rise to fainter sensations when applied to the skin generally. And one hardly needs to be reminded that pepper or vinegar placed (accidentally as a rule) on the inner surface of the eyelids produces a very distinct and unpleasant smart.|$|E
5000|$|A subapical {{consonant}} is a consonant made by {{contact with}} {{the underside of the}} tip of the <b>tongue.</b> The <b>only</b> common subapical articulations are in the postalveolar to palatal region, which are called [...] "retroflex." ...|$|R

50|$|In post-war Yugoslavia, the {{existence}} of a Banat Bulgarian minority was formally recognized, but they were not given the same rights as the larger Bulgarian minority in eastern Serbia.

50|$|According to {{the latest}} census of 2009, around 53% of the {{population}} of Belarus consider the Belarusian language to be their mother <b>tongue,</b> however, <b>only</b> about 23% of the respondents say they speak it at home.The language is labelled as vulnerable by UNESCO, which is reflected on its Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger.|$|R
60|$|I {{had never}} been used with such {{expressions}} from a lady's <b>tongue,</b> the <b>only</b> two ladies I had known, Mrs. Campbell and my mother, being most devout and most particular women; and I suppose my amazement must have been depicted in my countenance, for Mrs. Ogilvy burst forth suddenly {{in a fit of}} laughter.|$|R
30|$|Mother tongues are the {{foundation}} of the culture that is exploited in the creative economies (Kristeva [2010]). The mother <b>tongues</b> provide not <b>only</b> the language but the socio-cultural practices that go into performance art and dance. It is, therefore, essential to ground the knowledge of a mother tongue in the knowledge of the culture that it is embedded in. Any community that wants to exploit the mother tongues in creative economies must of necessity view the mother tongues positively. According to Deane ([2006]), people want to make informed choices regarding their mother tongues. They want to make use of their mother <b>tongues</b> not <b>only</b> for education but also for the transmission of social change, persuasion, entertainment and mobilization.|$|R

50|$|For non-sibilant sounds, the {{relevant}} variations in tongue shape can be adequately {{described by the}} concept of secondary articulation, in particular palatalization (raising of {{the middle of the}} tongue), velarization (raising {{of the back of the}} tongue) and pharyngealization (retracting of the root of the <b>tongue).</b> Usually, <b>only</b> one secondary articulations can occur for a given sound.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{majority}} of Russians and Moldovans declared the language of their ethnicity as their mother <b>tongue,</b> <b>only</b> roughly half of Ukrainians did so, while the other half indicated Russian as their native language. The Bulgarians also tend to use Russian more than Bulgarian, especially in public. The above numbers reflect the declared ethnicity, not the native language. The most common spoken language in everyday public use in Budjak is Russian.|$|E
50|$|In the {{township}} in 2011, the vast majority, 93.8%, {{of the population}} spoke solely English as their mother <b>tongue.</b> <b>Only</b> 2.4% reported speaking only French and 3.4% reported speaking only a non-official language as their mother tongue. This is a contrast from national percentages which are 68.2% for English only and 25.7% for non-official languages only as a mother tongue. Multiple responses were given by 0.4% of the population.|$|E
50|$|Coronal consonants are consonants {{articulated}} {{with the}} flexible front {{part of the}} <b>tongue.</b> <b>Only</b> the coronal consonants {{can be divided into}} apical (using the tip of the tongue), laminal (using the blade of the tongue), domed (with the tongue bunched up), or subapical (using the underside of the tongue) as well as a few rarer orientations, such as postalveolar, as only the front of the tongue has such dexterity. Coronals have another dimension, grooved, to make sibilants in combination with the orientations above.|$|E

50|$|Belarus's two {{official}} {{languages are}} Russian and Belarusian; Russian {{is the main}} language, used by 72% of the population, while Belarusian, the official first language, is spoken by 11.9%. Minorities also speak Polish, Ukrainian and Eastern Yiddish. Belarusian, although not as widely used as Russian, is the mother tongue of 53.2% of the population, whereas Russian is the mother <b>tongue</b> of <b>only</b> 41.5%.|$|R
50|$|A laminal {{consonant}} is a phone {{produced by}} obstructing the air passage with {{the blade of}} the tongue, the flat top front surface just behind {{the tip of the}} tongue on the top. It contrasts with an apical consonant, produced by creating an obstruction with the tongue apex (<b>tongue</b> tip) <b>only.</b> The distinction applies only to coronal consonants, which use the front of the tongue.|$|R
