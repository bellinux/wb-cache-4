5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the fa√ßade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but others argue {{that they were not}} completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E

When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, his insistence that he had slept on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> met with disbelief. Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.|$|E
5|$|The {{chapter house}} has 40sedilia lining its walls, {{and may have}} {{originally}} provided seating for more when it was the meeting room for the abbey community. In 1714 it was refurbished to become a library, and its floor was raised by about 1m (3ft). Its east end was damaged in the Bristol riots of 1831, requiring considerable restoration, {{and at that time}} or later the library furnishings were removed. In 1832, when <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> lowered again, a Saxon stone panel depicting the Harrowing of Hell was found underneath. The discovery of the stone provides strong evidence that there was a church or shrine on the site before Robert Fitzharding founded the Abbey in 1140.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> structure's {{interior}} <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> {{also made}} precast concrete. However, <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> almost made of more than-traditional materials. [...] Late {{in the design}} process, GSA accountants estimated {{that the cost of}} precast concrete for <b>the</b> <b>flooring</b> would <b>be</b> exceptionally high, and GSA threatened to change the architectural plans. But after extensive discussions between GSA and Breuer, GSA relented. The plans were let to bid as designed, and <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> fabricated for significantly less than estimated.|$|R
50|$|From {{the fourth}} to <b>the</b> {{eleventh}} <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> main building, there are 196 rooms. <b>The</b> eleventh <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> especially designed for business rooms; <b>the</b> tenth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> non-smoking and <b>the</b> twelfth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> for presidential suites.|$|R

5|$|The {{church has}} a total length of , {{including}} the atrium. It was mostly built of rectangular limestone blocks sparingly joined with mortar. Inside the apse, the mortar is red-coloured. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> covered by marble and stone tiles glued {{on top of}} red mortar in the narthex and white mortar elsewhere. Red and yellow bricks and pieces of bricks {{were used for the}} atrium, the arches, and possibly the dome; some brick pieces were used to fill spaces between the stones on the walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{houses of}} medieval peasants were of poor quality {{compared}} to modern houses. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> normally of earth, {{and there was}} very little ventilation or sources of light in the form of windows. In addition to the human inhabitants, a number of livestock animals would also reside in the house. Towards the end of the medieval period, however, conditions generally improved. Peasant houses became larger in size, and it became more common to have two rooms, and even a second floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of a mound, so the {{northern}} side of the basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the {{interior}} has {{a mixture of}} timber boarded and concrete <b>floors</b> on <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> and timber boarded <b>floors</b> on <b>the</b> first <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> interior walls of <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> rendered masonry and the internal walls of <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> mostly rendered masonry with some timber boarded partitioning. The ceilings of <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> rendered plaster and plasterboard and the ceilings on <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> timber boarded. Generally, {{the interior}} of <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> has <b>been</b> altered both in finish and planning and the interior of <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> more intact.

Turfing is a fusion of miming and gliding that places heavy {{emphasis}} on storytelling (through movement) and illusion.

5|$|An Early Classic tomb was {{inserted}} under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; {{it had been}} tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when {{the roof of the}} tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones of four or more individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge was a {{double-leaf}} deck-girder {{bascule bridge}} in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States, that spanned the Pequonnock River and connected Grand Street and Artic Street. It {{was one of}} three movable bridges planned by the City of Bridgeport in 1916 {{at the request of the}} War Department during World War I. Construction was completed in 1919, but the delays surrounding the construction went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in case of Edward DeV. Tompkins, Inc. vs. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The court ruled in favor of Tompkins and awarded damages equal to the contract. In 1936, the bridge had excessive settling and required the replacement of its southeast pier. As part of the repairs, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> replaced with a steel grate on I-beam floor. In 1984, the eastern approach span was replaced and the northwest trunnion post was reconstructed. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and dismantled in 1999.|$|E
50|$|Floors: Similarly, {{unlike most}} Japanese {{universities}} {{built around the}} same period, <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> set with cut marble reflecting the architect's concept that those floors would absorb heat better and keep cooler temperatures in the summertime. Further, <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> have convex surface, or the edges of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> sloped so that cleaning would be easier.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum is}} a three-story building. <b>The</b> first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lobby, {{entrance}} and administrative {{offices of the}} museum. <b>The</b> second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> handover gifts exhibition gallery and the special exhibition gallery. <b>The</b> third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> auditorium.|$|R

5|$|The {{ground was}} lowered by a full {{story on the}} south and east sides of the station, exposing what had {{formerly}} been the basement to improve access for taxis and private automobiles. A marquee to shelter arriving and departing passengers spanned the seven central bays of the lower level, with a more ornate version on {{the north end of the}} pedestrian tunnel. The lower waiting room was expanded, a ticket office constructed, and a larger staircase to the main waiting room was built. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> covered with terrazzo and green marble, with white marble wainscoting on the walls. Three bays were added to the west wing for additional functional space, removing direct track access from the ramp. Cast iron streetlights with the PRR Keystone motif in their base were located around the driveway and grounds.|$|E
5|$|To save money, many sets, {{particularly}} interiors, were redresses {{of existing}} sets. The Enterprise bridge was reconfigured {{to stand in}} for the Grissom, with the chairs reupholstered and the central computer consoles moved to modify the floor plan. An Earth bar and the Klingon medical bay were redresses of the Enterprise sickbay. The Klingon bridge was a set that Nimoy appropriated from another production. Many blinking consoles were rented from a props company rather than being fabricated. The Enterprise bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better. The most drastic change was made to Spock's quarters. Nimoy had felt the previous grey color scheme did not express a Vulcan style, and had it brightened with yellows and oranges.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E

50|$|Raised <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} inaccessible {{for inspection}} so surveillance {{can be accomplished}} there. If <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> part of <b>the</b> air handling system, probe microphones or fiber-optic microphones can <b>be</b> effective. If <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> continuous, <b>the</b> high sound attenuation of the material makes surveillance with vibration detectors more advantageous since the stiff metal plates respond to speech. Although vibration maskers can <b>be</b> attached to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> plates, <b>the</b> preferred protection is to use speaker maskers under <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{most of the}} 4th century, the Christian {{community}} was small, poor, and carried no influence in the city. The church was insignificant and its members {{were not allowed to}} hold political office. However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed and idol worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government. Paganism continued and Christians were still persecuted in the city, forcing St. Porphyrius to undertake more measures. As a result of his persuasion, Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406. (Note that according to MacMullen it is likely that Porphyrius did not even exist.) Persecution against Christians did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously. A large 6th century synagogue with a mosaic tile floor depicting King David was discovered in Gaza. An inscription states that <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> donated in 508‚Äì509 CE by two merchant brothers. Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the Sinai Peninsula. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy of rhetoric, including 6th-century scholar Procopius of Gaza. The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in this century.|$|E
5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo {{his part of the}} scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. The mattress that Merlin magically moves across <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; {{it was one of the}} most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} each room is {{interpreted}} {{based primarily on}} its design. As a result, there can be some ambiguity in what individual chambers were used for. Each floor was divided into three chambers, {{the largest in the}} west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts.
