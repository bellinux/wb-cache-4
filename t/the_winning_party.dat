5|$|Istanbul {{has voted}} for <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party</b> in general {{elections}} since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general and local election. The city's electorate has also {{voted for the}} AKP government's constitutional reforms proposed during the 2007 and 2010 constitutional referenda. Turkish President and former AKP Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected Mayor of İstanbul in the 1994 local elections as the Islamist Welfare Party candidate with 25.1% of the vote, winning due to a vote split between the mainstream centrist parties. Conservative parties traditionally find support in older districts with high population densities such as Bağcılar, Fatih, Sultanbeyli and Esenler. The opposition Kemalist center-left Republican People's Party (CHP), currently the second major political force in both İstanbul and the country, gets most of its support from more rural districts such as Silivri, Çatalca and Sarıyer. Urban districts such as Beşiktaş, Bakırköy, Şişli and Kadıköy have returned {{strong support for the}} CHP in past elections. The CHP are generally strongest in the west, where newer residential developments are taking place. İstanbul has 39 districts, more than any other province in Turkey. Since İstanbul is Turkey's largest city and has usually voted {{in the same way as}} the country as a whole, it is largely perceived in Turkish politics that <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party</b> of an election is essentially decided by İstanbul's electorate. Political parties thus allocate substantial amounts of electoral campaign funds and to winning control of the İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Due to its electoral importance, İstanbul has reported the largest and most serious cases of electoral fraud in recent elections, including the 2014 local elections.|$|E

25|$|The Slovak head {{of state}} and the formal head of the {{executive}} is the president (currently Andrej Kiska), though with very limited powers. The president is elected by direct, popular vote under the two-round system for a five-year term. Most executive power lies {{with the head of}} government, the prime minister (currently Robert Fico), who is usually the leader of <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party,</b> but he/she needs to form a majority coalition in the parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the president. The remainder of the cabinet is appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.|$|E

The Liberals stole it back in 1993, but the Reform party and its successor the Canadian Alliance took it over with a strong win in 2000. However, the riding remained split three ways between the Liberals, the new Conservative Party and the NDP.

500|$|The usual {{tradition}} {{was for the}} leading figure of <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party</b> to be offered the position of Secretary of State, the most senior Cabinet post. [...] Seward was that man and around December 12, the vice president-elect, Maine Senator Hannibal Hamlin, offered Seward the position on Lincoln's behalf. [...] At Weed's advice, Seward was slow to formally accept, doing so on December 28, 1860, though well before Inauguration Day, March 4, 1861. Lincoln remained in Illinois until mid-February, and he and Seward communicated by letter.|$|E
500|$|In 1924 {{the wreck}} {{was the subject}} of a salvage dispute between two sets of salvors, both seeking to recover a reputed £2 million worth of gold coins from it (£100 million in 2012 prices). This was {{resolved}} in the English court decision The Tubantia [...] P 78, and remains the leading authority under English law as to when a salvor takes possession of a sunken shipwreck. <b>The</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party,</b> war hero Sydney Vincent Sippe, spent three years and £100,000 trying to access the gold, but abandoned the attempt after concluding that it was too dangerous for divers to recover it.|$|E
500|$|... "Sleepers" [...] was {{developed}} because the producers {{wanted to do}} a Tesla-centric episode, as they view him as one of their favorite characters. [...] "Haunted" [...] rounds Druitt to [...] "something unexpected." [...] The producers were aware that Druitt became more insane the more he teleports, and they wanted to find an explanation why, hence the creation of the energy creature. [...] "Kali" [...] was designed as a somewhat [...] "faith versus science" [...] episode, with faith as <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party,</b> because any host to the macri would need a spiritual understanding to it; the cult of Kali are religious, so they would make suitable hosts, but Edward Forsythe is a believer of science, and would not make a suitable host as he does not share the cult's understanding. In the original draft, Magnus would fall ill, but that later changed to Will before the episode was filmed. Some episodes in the season originally followed a different order. [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] was originally going to be the fourth episode, while [...] "Hero" [...] would become the tenth. [...] "Sleepers" [...] would also be in an earlier slot. However, the order changed, partially due to availability issues with Jonathon Young for [...] "Sleepers". The writers were also working on a Bigfoot-centric episode, where he returns to his home. However, before it could be written, the networks were unhappy with the idea.|$|E

2500|$|In many jurisdictions, {{after making}} the award, the {{tribunal}} will {{order that the}} losing party pays the legal costs of <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party,</b> and this may include the arbitrator's fees.

2500|$|Where {{preferential}} {{voting is}} used for the election of an assembly or council, parties and candidates often advise their supporters on their lower preferences, especially in Australia where a voter must rank all candidates to cast a valid ballot. This can lead to [...] "preference deals", a form of pre-election bargaining, in which smaller parties agree to direct their voters in return for support from <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party</b> on issues critical to the small party. However, this relies on the assumption that supporters of a minor party will mark preferences for another party based on the advice that they have been given.|$|E

2500|$|Two players (or two teams) play each hole as a {{separate}} contest {{against each other in}} what is called match play. The party with the lower score wins that hole, or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is [...] "halved" [...] (or tied). The game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other. In the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played, the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead, and the remainder of the holes are not played. For example, if one party already has a lead of six holes, and only five holes remain to be played on the course, the match is over and <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party</b> is deemed to have won [...] "6 & 5". At any given point, if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining, the party leading the match is said to be [...] "dormie", and the match is continued until the party increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes, thereby winning the match, or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player's opponent winning all remaining holes. When the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played, it may be continued until one side takes a one-hole lead.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2011 elections, Portas's {{opposition}} strategies {{paid off}} and the CDS-PP achieved its best result in 30 years: 11.7% of the total vote. <b>The</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party,</b> the PSD, needed the CDS-PP to reach a parliamentary majority and the two parties formed a coalition government. By his own choice, Portas became Minister of State and of Foreign Affairs and secured two more minister slots for the CDS-PP, including the Minister of Agriculture position for his youthful female protegée Assunção Cristas, who would five years later succeed Portas in the CDS-PP party's leadership. As minister, Portas chose (and relished) devoting himself fully to performing his official functions, in particular traveling abroad. He made his priority what he called [...] "economic diplomacy", meaning the generation through diplomacy of business opportunities abroad for Portuguese companies. To that effect, he wrestled control of the Portuguese Foreign Investment and Trade Agency (AICEP) from the Ministry of Economics. In 2013, to attract foreign investments, Paulo Portas instituted [...] "golden visas" [...] {{to make it possible}} for non-EU foreigners to obtain Portuguese residency if they invested at least 500,000 euros in Portuguese real estate. By focusing on his duties as Minister of Foreign Affairs, he also managed to distance himself from the difficult decisions related to Portugal's economic austerity program. More than once he kept silent or expressed his disagreement with unpopular measures taken by the government to which he belonged, and on 2 July 2013 he abruptly resigned in protest at the appointment of a Finance Minister (Maria Luís Albuquerque) he did not approve of, a decision he called [...] "irrevocable" [...] but that he subsequently revoked (see below).|$|E

All the beauties of Felicia (by which name I distinguish our beloved England) stood in the gallery, waving their kerchiefs at each turn of the game, and cheering the winners by their plaudits. After which noble sport we were refreshed by a suitable banquet, whereat it pleased the noble Urania (being the unmatched Countess of Pembroke) to accommodate me with her fan for the cooling my somewhat too much inflamed visage, to requite which courtesy, I said, casting my features into a smiling, yet melancholy fashion, O divinest Urania! receive again that too fatal gift, which not like the Zephyr cooleth, but like the hot breath of the Sirocco, heateth yet more that which is already inflamed.

6000|$|I cannot {{tell whether}} my Lord Grey meant, by {{offering}} conditions which the Spaniards would not accept, {{to force them}} into fighting the quarrel out, and so save himself the responsibility of deciding on their fate; or whether his mere natural stubbornness, {{as well as his}} just indignation, drove him on too far to retract: but the council of war which followed was both a sad and a stormy one, and one which he had reason to regret to his dying day.

They already outnumbered the English; and some fifteen hundred of Desmond's wild Irish hovered in the forests round, ready to side with <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>party,</b> or even to attack the English at the least sign of vacillation or fear. They could not carry the Spaniards away with them, for they had neither shipping nor food, not even handcuffs enough for them; and as Mackworth told Winter when he proposed it, the only plan was for him to make San Josepho a present of his ships, and swim home himself as he could. To turn loose in Ireland, as Captain Touch urged, on the other hand, seven hundred such monsters of lawlessness, cruelty, and lust, as Spanish and Italian condottieri were in those days, was as fatal to their own safety as cruel to the wretched Irish. All the captains, without exception, followed on the same side. [...] "What was to be done, then?" [...] asked Lord Grey, impatiently. [...] "Would they have him murder them all in cold blood?" ...|$|E
