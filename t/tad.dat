40|$|International audienceBackground: In higher eukaryotes, {{the genome}} is {{partitioned}} into large "Topologically Associating Domains" (<b>TADs)</b> {{in which the}} chromatin displays favoured long-range contacts. While a crumpled/fractal globule organization has received experimental supports at higher-order levels, the organization principles that govern chromatin dynamics within these <b>TADs</b> remain unclear. Using simple polymer models, we previously showed that, in mouse liver cells, gene-rich domains tend to adopt a statistical helix shape when no significant locus-specific interaction takes place. Results: Here, we use data from diverse 3 C-derived methods to explore chromatin dynamics within mouse and Drosophila <b>TADs.</b> In mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESC), that possess large <b>TADs</b> (median size of 840 kb), we show that the statistical helix model, but not globule models, is relevant not only in gene-rich <b>TADs,</b> but also in gene-poor and gene-desert <b>TADs.</b> Interestingly, this statistical helix organization is considerably relaxed in mESC compared to liver cells, indicating {{that the impact of}} the constraints responsible for this organization is weaker in pluripotent cells. Finally, depletion of histone H 1 in mESC alters local chromatin flexibility but not the statistical helix organization. In Drosophila, which possesses <b>TADs</b> of smaller sizes (median size of 70 kb), we show that, while chromatin compaction and flexibility are finely tuned according to the epigenetic landscape, chromatin dynamics within <b>TADs</b> is generally compatible with an unconstrained polymer configuration. Conclusions: Models issued from polymer physics can accurately describe the organization principles governing chromatin dynamics in both mouse and Drosophila <b>TADs.</b> However, constraints applied on this dynamics within mammalian <b>TADs</b> have a peculiar impact resulting in a statistical helix organization...|$|R

40|$|Producción CientíficaTo {{estimate}} the attributable and targeted avoidable deaths (ADs; <b>TADs)</b> of outdoor air pollution by ambient particulate matter (PM 10), PM 2. 5 and O 3 according to specific WHO methodology. Design: Health impact assessment. Setting: City of Valladolid, Spain (around 300 000 residents). Data sources: Demographics; mortality; pollutant concentrations collected 1999 – 2008. Main outcome measures: Attributable fractions; ADs and <b>TADs</b> {{per year for}} 1999 – 2008. Results: Higher <b>TADs</b> estimates (shown here) were obtained when assuming as ‘target’ concentrations WHO Air Quality Guidelines instead of Directive 2008 / 50 /EC. ADs are considered relative to pollutant background levels. All-cause mortality associated to PM 10 (all ages) : 52 ADs (95 %CI 39 to 64); 31 <b>TADs</b> (95 %CI 24 to 39). All-cause mortality associated to PM 10 ( 30 years) : 326 ADs (95 % CI 217 to 422); 231 <b>TADs</b> (95 % CI 153 to 301). Cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality associated to PM 2. 5 (> 30 years) : ▸ Cardiopulmonary: 186 ADs (95 % CI 74 to 280); 94 <b>TADs</b> (95 % CI 36 to 148). ▸ Lung cancer : 51 ADs (95 % CI 21 to 73); 27 <b>TADs</b> (95 % CI 10 to 41). All-cause, respiratory and cardiovascular mortality associated to O 3 (all ages) : ▸ All-cause: 52 ADs (95 % CI 25 to 77); 31 <b>TADs</b> (95 % CI 15 to 45). ▸ Respiratory: 5 ADs (95 % CI − 2 to 13); 3 <b>TADs</b> (95 % CI − 1 to 8). ▸ Cardiovascular: 30 ADs (95 % CI 8 to 51); 17 <b>TADs</b> (95 % CI 5 to 30). Negative estimates which should be read as zero were obtained when pollutant concentrations were below counterfactuals or assumed risk coefficients were below one. Conclusions: Our estimates suggest a not negligible negative impact on mortality of outdoor air pollution. The implementation of WHO methodology provides critical information to distinguish an improvement range in air pollution control. INTRODUCTION Numerous epidemiological studies conducte...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{tricyclic}} antidepressants (<b>TADs)</b> {{on a variety}} of pineal functions was assessed. <b>TADs</b> affected the uptake of ³H- 5 HT into bovine pineal slices within a particular concentration range of these drugs, DESI, CLOMI and IMI appeared to inhibit uptake slightly, within a limited concentration range. Surprisingly, DESI appeared to be a relatively potent 5 HT uptake inhibitor. The 5 -HT re-uptake system in the pineal probably differes from that in brain tissue. <b>TADs</b> had a marked effect on the metabolism of ³H- 5 HT in the rat pineal, in an organ culture system, MEL and N-acetylserotonin synthesis increased for the first 11 days and thereafter a slight decrease was observed. HTOH and HIAA also showed an initial increase followed by a slight decrease in synthesis. The synthesis of MTOH and MIAA was decreased. The possibility that <b>TADs</b> could affect HIOMT and SNAT synthesis and thereby change the metabolic pattern of 5 -HT was investigated. <b>TADs</b> appeared to stimulate SNAT initially and thereafter a slight decrease from peak activity was observed. This is probably due to stimulation followed by development of subsensitivity of β-receptors, HIOMT activity also appeared to be affected by <b>TADs.</b> The existence of two types of HIOMT is suggested. There is a possibility that these changes in the metabolism of 5 -HT could be implicated in the mechanism of action of <b>TADs.</b> KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 53 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{investigation}} {{showed the}} existence of correlations between the architectural features of mammalian interphase chromosomes and the compositional properties of isochores. This result prompted us to compare maps of the Topologically Associating Domains (<b>TADs)</b> and of the Lamina Associated Domains (LADs) with the corresponding isochore maps of mouse and human chromosomes. This approach revealed that: 1) <b>TADs</b> and LADs correspond to isochores, i. e., isochores are the genomic units that underlie chromatin domains; 2) the conservation of <b>TADs</b> and LADs in mammalian genomes is explained by the evolutionary conservation of isochores; 3) chromatin domains corresponding to GC-poor isochores (e. g., LADs) show not only self-interactions but also intrachromosomal interactions with other domains also corresponding to GC-poor isochores even if located far away; in contrast, chromatin domains corresponding to GC-rich isochores (e. g., <b>TADs)</b> show more localized chromosomal interactions, {{many of which are}} inter-chromosomal. In conclusion, this investigation establishes a link between DNA sequences and chromatin architecture, explains the evolutionary conservation of <b>TADs</b> and LADs and provides new information on the spatial distribution of GC-poor/gene-poor and GC-rich/gene-rich chromosomal regions in the interphase nucleus...|$|R

40|$|We discuss here {{a series}} of {{testable}} hypotheses concerning the role of chromosome folding into topologically associating domains (<b>TADs).</b> Several lines of evidence suggest that segmental packaging of chromosomal neighborhoods may underlie features of chromatin that span large domains, such as heterochromatin blocks, association with the nuclear lamina and replication timing. By defining which DNA elements preferentially contact each other, the segmentation of chromosomes into <b>TADs</b> may also underlie many properties of long-range transcriptional regulation. Several observations suggest that <b>TADs</b> can indeed provide a structural basis to regulatory landscapes, by controlling enhancer sharing and allocation.
