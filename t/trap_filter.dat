40|$|Over {{exploitation}} {{of fossil fuels}} and ill effect of global warming has forced human civilisation in search of new sustainable energy resources. Renewable energy resources like hydro, solar, wind, biomass etc., are environmental friendly energy resources. One such renewable energy resource is Wind Energy. The growth of offshore wind farms is increasing, with it {{the problems associated with}} electrical generation. Harmonics is one such problem faced by the Offshore Wind Power System. Harmonics are injected into the power system primarily through power electronic converters and are amplified by harmonic resonances in the power system. It is of utmost importance to electrical engineers to produce harmonic pollution less power to the customers. Harmonic mitigation structures are used to mitigate harmonic frequencies. Passive filter is one such and major harmonic frequency mitigation structure. This thesis deals with optimization of passive filters in a wind power plant. The objective of the thesis is to analyse harmonics that are present in the wind power system, design passive filters to eliminate or control the harmonic distortions and optimize these filters on various and possible parameters. A test case system Anholt Offshore Wind Farm was taken into consideration and the wind power system was modelled in MATLAB Simulink. The harmonics present in the system was analysed. LCL filter was designed to mitigate harmonic frequencies and optimization of LCL filter components on factors like attenuation factor, acceptable total and individual voltage and current harmonic distortion, fundamental frequency losses and reactive power capability was conducted. The optimum LCL filter parameters was found out to give acceptable total harmonic distortion of voltage waveform dictated by IEC standards. Further modelling and design second order high pass filter, third order high pass filter, C-Type filter, Switching frequency <b>trap</b> <b>filter,</b> C-Type with switching frequency <b>trap</b> <b>filter</b> and resonance <b>trap</b> <b>filter</b> were designed and modelled in the simulation platform. Optimization of all these filters was conducted based on quality factor, acceptable total and individual voltage harmonic distortion dictated by IEC standards, fundamental frequency losses and reactive power capability. The results of the optimized filter was tabulated an it was found that C-Type filter with switching frequency <b>trap</b> <b>filter</b> gave the optimum results. All these filter design was conducted at wind turbine level. At wind farm level reactive power compensation was established, harmonic distortion monitoring and harmonic resonance monitoring was done, and the result show that C-Type with witching frequency <b>trap</b> <b>filter</b> gave the optimum results. It can also be seen that different passive filters operate more efficiently at different harmonic frequency ranges...|$|E

The LCL+Trap filter design is highly dependent on the electrical network characteristics; hence the distribution system of the plant is introduced in the paper to take into account its effects on the tuning parameters. The proposed LCL+trap filter topology arises as a successful alternative solution for the conventional LCL filter topology, thanks to its improved filtering capability while ensuring a reduced filter size.

40|$|NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) {{has been}} {{involved}} in the research and development of high speed flywheel systems for small satellite energy storage and attitude control applications. One research and development area has been the minimization of the switching noise produced by the pulsed width modulated (PWM) inverter that drives the flywheel permanent magnet motor/generator (PM M/G). This noise can interfere with the flywheel M/G hardware and the system avionics hampering the full speed performance of the flywheel system. One way to attenuate the inverter switching noise is by placing an AC filter at the three phase output terminals of the inverter with the filter neutral point connected to the DC link (DC bus) midpoint capacitors. The main benefit of using an AC filter in this fashion is the significant reduction of the inverter s high dv/dt switching and its harmonics components. Additionally, common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) voltages caused by the inverter s high dv/dt switching are also reduced. Several topologies of AC filters have been implemented and compared. One AC filter topology consists of a two-stage R-L-C low pass filter. The other topology consists of the same two-stage R-L-C low pass filter with a series connected <b>trap</b> <b>filter</b> (an inductor and capacitor connected in parallel).

40|$|Pulmonary {{insufficiency}} due to microembolism caused {{with the}} perfusate during extracorporeal circulation {{has become a}} renewed problem. To counter this point the author investigated the effect of 180 μ nylon mesh filter and various microfilters. 1) Three types of new extracorporeal microfilters - 40 μ polyester, Dacron-wool and Polyesterure-thane- were tested in a closed circuit. Polyesterurethane and Dacron-wool filters removed {{a large amount of}} blood platelets and showed good filtration. Using 40 μ polyester filter a slight increase of CK and plasma hemoglobin level was shown compared with other microfilters. In the case of 40 μ polyester filter the pressure gradient across the filter was minimal. Hence the 40 μ polyester filter was chosen for clinical application. 2) Compaired with the 180 μ nylon and the 40 μ polyester filter which were of the same surface area, the 40 μ polyester filter showed much increrse of plasma hemoglobin level in experimental perfusion. 3) Influence of 40 μ polyester filter for fresh blood was not so great in the animal experiment, which was done by inserting the 40 μ polyester filter into the descending aorta. Namely platelet count and pressure gradient across the filter were not as varied during the perfusion for 3 hours. 4) In the animal experiments femoro-femoral bypass was carried out for 3 hours using 4 groups of mongrel dogs. Lung biopsy showed the 4 th group (using the artificial 180 μ lung filter, 180 μ air <b>trap</b> <b>filter</b> and the 40 μ polyester filter) gave the best results, and the first group (using the artificial 180 μ lung filter only) showed the lowest results. The applicability of double filtration (180 μ+ 180 μ filter) and microfiltration was clearly indicated. 5) In clinical application a 40 μ polyester filter was inserted into the coronary suction line. During cardiac surgery, lung biopsies and blood examination were clone, showing that over 1 hour of extracorporeal circulation with the 40 μ polyester filter group compared with the no 40 μ filter group gave better results-minimal elevation of GPT, LDH, CK and a decrease of blood platelets.

40|$|AbstractConclusionIn {{a series}} of 442 {{patients}} undergoing carotid angioplasty or stenting the overall neurologic complication rate was 2. 5 %, and complications related to the cerebral protection device occurred in 4 of 442 patients (0. 9 %). SummaryThe authors studied complications related to cerebral protection devices during angioplasty or stenting of the extracranial carotid artery in 442 patients who underwent percutaneous angioplasty or stenting of the extracranial carotid artery. Fifty-seven {{percent of the patients}} had no symptoms. Six different cerebral protection devices were used during this study. The three most commonly used devices were the Johnson & Johnson-Cordis Angioguard Filter (37. 8 %), the Boston Scientific FilterWire EX (25. 1 %), and the EV 3 Microvena <b>Trap</b> <b>Filter</b> (18. 9 %). The procedure was successfully performed in 440 of 442 patients, with no periprocedural deaths. In 342 patients stents were placed. Three hundred thirty-nine of the stents were self-expanding. Predilation was performed with coronary balloons in 167 patients. The in-hospital stroke and death rate and 30 -day ipsilateral stroke and death rate was 1. 1 %. Neurologic complications included four intracranial hemorrhages, one major stroke, four minor strokes, four transient ischemic attacks, and six instances of transient neurologic symptoms resulting from intolerance of occlusive protection devices, for a total neurologic complication rate of 2. 5 %. The overall procedure-related complication rate was 3. 4 %. There were four cerebral protection device–related complications, including one carotid dissection resulting in occlusion, one trapped guide wire requiring operative removal, and two instances of limited dissection. In the retrieved protection devices, 69 % demonstrated visible plaque debris captured by the device. CommentThe data add to the growing trend of routine use of protection devices for carotid artery stenting. In an editorial accompanying this article, Drs Eckert and Zeumer, from Hamburg, Germany, note that the use of cerebral protection devices has occurred in conjunction with increased operator experience and improvements in guide wires, stents, and periprocedural anticoagulation regimens. While cerebral protection devices may contribute to improved results with carotid artery angioplasty or stenting, other facets of the procedure are also evolving and being improved...|$|E

40|$|Although a disk-type fly ash filter {{has shown}} a good {{performance}} in trapping gaseous cesium, it has difficulty in charging filters into a filter container and discharging waste filters containing radioactive cesium from a container by remote action. To solve {{the difficulty of the}} disk-type fly ash filter, five types of granule filters, including a ball type, tube type, and sponge-structure type have been made. Among them, the best filter type was chosen through simple crucible tests. The five types of granule filters packed into containers were loaded into five alumina crucibles of 50 cc. Five grams of CsNO 3 was used as a gaseous cesium source. They were then placed in a muffle furnace and heated to 900 °C and maintained for 2 hours.
