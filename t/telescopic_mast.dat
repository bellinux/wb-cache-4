25|$|SS Wandle was a British coastal collier {{owned and}} {{operated}} by the proprietors of Wandsworth gas works in south-west London. She was a flatiron, meaning that she had a low-profile superstructure, hinged funnel, hinged or <b>telescopic</b> <b>mast</b> and folding wheelhouse to enable her to pass under low bridges on the tidal River Thames upriver from the Pool of London. She was in service from 1932 to 1959 and survived a number of enemy attacks in the Second World War.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} plans {{called for}} open anti-aircraft mounts, {{but the experience}} of the existing monitors in the first battles on the Danube against Serbia demonstrated that the mounts needed protection from small arms fire, so armoured barbettes were added. These modifications prevented the crew in the conning tower from viewing directly aft of the ship, so a [...] high rectangular platform was placed on top of the conning tower that afforded a view aft. To avoid any increase in her draught from these modifications, her hull was lengthened. Due to the urgent need for the ship to be put into service, the planned <b>telescopic</b> <b>mast</b> was not installed, and an alternative mast was constructed using angle iron lattice. Enns was launched on 29 July 1914 and commissioned on 17 October 1914.|$|E

Company command versions were fitted with two R123M/R-173 additional radios and also carried a 10m <b>telescopic</b> <b>mast.</b> Battalion and regiment command versions were fitted with two R123M/R-173 additional radios and the R-130M that uses the 10m mast when its erected. In NATO code T-72K was represented by three different designations: T-72K1, T-72K2 and T-72K3 which represented the company command version, battalion command version and regiment command version.|$|E

2500|$|The hull was flat-sided and deep. Its {{underside}} had two steps; {{in front}} of the first the hull bottom was a hollow V in section and behind it a flat V. There was a little water rudder behind the rear step. Pilot and mechanic sat side-by-side in an open cockpit, with gunner's positions ahead of them and at the trailing edge. [...] Alternatively, the Robbe could be configured to carry four passengers, one in a forward cabin, two in a central one and one more im a rear cabin, or to carry goods or post. The hull was divided into seven watertight compartments to preserve buoyancy. An unusual feature of each gunner's cockpit was a duralumin, <b>telescopic</b> <b>mast.</b> If, in an emergency the Robbe alighted without power, these could each be extended and a simple, triangular sail raised to reach safety. [...] At the rear the tail was conventional, with a blunted rectangular fin and small unbalanced rudder. The high aspect ratio horizontal tail, again rectangular apart from blunted tips, was mounted well up the fin and strut-braced to the upper fuselage. Like the rudder, the elevators were unbalanced.|$|E

Burntisland's first flatiron was hull 119, [...] as the 932 GRT coastal collier Wandle for the Wandsworth, Wimbledon and Epsom District Gas Company. From 1923 to 1946 Burntisland built a further 11 colliers for the same customer, which from 1932 was called the Wandsworth and District Gas Company.|$|R
50|$|Manchester Liners was {{established}} on 3 May 1898, {{to provide a}} fortnightly transatlantic service between the Port of Manchester and North America, via the Manchester Ship Canal. Its first purpose-built ship, Manchester City, launched on 27 October 1898, was designed to suit {{the dimensions of the}} canal, and was fitted with <b>telescopic</b> <b>masts</b> to allow it to pass under the bridges along the canal. The success of its inaugural trip to Halifax, Nova Scotia, encouraged Manchester Liners to order seven more ships to the same design. The company continued to operate vessels registered in Manchester for more than 80 years, until 1985.|$|R

Mastsystem International, current Cobham Mast Systems have been granted an export license to export some <b>telescopic</b> <b>masts</b> from Finland to Israel. The process to receive export licenses to Israel has been criticized as politically unpredictable, enough for customers to lose interest. For example, a Mastsystem International spokesperson noted in October 2010 that they were denied permit {{from the end of}} 2008 to summer 2009.

25|$|The climate was estranged until Scottish {{businessman}} Sir Thomas Lipton {{became the}} financial backer for the Royal Ulster Yacht Club's 1899 challenge. William Fife {{was chosen to}} design the challenging yacht because of past success in American waters. The yachts increased yet again in size, and this time Herreshoff fitted a <b>telescopic</b> steel <b>mast</b> to his defender Columbia, but his largest contribution was to recruit Scottish-American skipper Charlie Barr. The latter had helmed Fife designs in Yankee waters before, and he had shown perfect coordination with his hand-picked Scandinavian crew. Barr successfully helmed Columbia to victory, and Lipton's noted fair play provided unprecedented popular appeal to the sport and to his tea brand.|$|R
