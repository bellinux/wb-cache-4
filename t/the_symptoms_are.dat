5|$|Some advise {{to avoid}} {{physical}} exercise {{if there are}} symptoms such as fever, widespread muscle aches or fatigue. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} excess thyroid hormone {{typically}} {{respond to the}} administration of a non-selective beta blocker, such as propranolol (as most of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> driven by increased levels of adrenaline {{and its effect on}} the β-adrenergic receptors). Subsequent attacks may be prevented by avoiding known precipitants, such as high salt or carbohydrate intake, until the thyroid disease has been adequately treated.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.|$|E
25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> not present at all; scores of 2 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> slightly present; scores of 3 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> severe; and scores of 6 suggest <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|R
5000|$|The scale {{includes}} {{a checklist of}} 32 possible symptoms of hypomania, each rated yes or no. The rating [...] "yes" [...] would mean <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> present or this trait is [...] "typical of me," [...] and [...] "no" [...] would mean that <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> not present or [...] "not typical" [...] for the person.|$|R
50|$|However, Brad Sparks contends that, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> {{somewhat similar}} to those caused by ionizing radiation, the rapidity of onset was only consistent with a massive dose that would have meant certain death in a few days. Since all of the victims lived for years after the incident, Sparks suggests the cause of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>was</b> some kind of chemical contamination, presumably by an aerosol.|$|R
5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of {{symptoms such as}} anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, {{in the absence of}} the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E
5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E
5|$|Some have {{suggested}} the syndrome {{may be an}} inability by beekeepers to correctly identify known diseases such as European foulbrood or the microsporidian fungus Nosema apis. The testing and diagnosis of samples from affected colonies (already performed) makes this highly unlikely, as <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> fairly well known and differ from what is classified as CCD. A high rate of Nosema infection was reported in samples of bees from Pennsylvania, but this pattern was not reported from samples elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|The person ceases {{producing}} <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> as soon {{as there}} no longer exists any construction of reality in which <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> necessary to have.|$|R
25|$|In one patient, <b>the</b> POIS <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> so severe, that {{he decided}} to undergo {{castration}} in order to relieve them. <b>The</b> POIS <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> cured by <b>the</b> castration.|$|R
50|$|As stress has a {{physical}} {{effect on the}} body, some individuals may not distinguish this from other more serious illnesses. Individuals experiencing stress {{are less likely to}} see medical care for a <b>symptom</b> if <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> ambiguous (e.g. headache) and they are currently experiencing stress. If <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> unambiguous however (e.g. a breast lump), and the onset of the stressor is recent, individuals are motivated to seek care as usual.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E
40|$|MELAS {{is a rare}} {{mitochondrial}} disorder. We report {{two cases}} in Irish males where the characteristics were evident, but the diagnosis not made for a considerable period of time. In one of <b>the</b> cases <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> presumed secondary to prematurity. In <b>the</b> other <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>were</b> presumed secondary to epilepsy and he had three respiratory arrests secondary to benzodiazepine administration.

40|$|A case of {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) {{is presented in}} which <b>the</b> chief <b>symptom</b> <b>was</b> obsessive musical imagery. Such musical obsessions are not described in standard texts of psychiatry or phenomenology, or in articles on OCD; nor are they considered in diagnostic procedures for OCD. Either <b>the</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>is</b> rare, or it is unnoticed because of low clinical awareness...|$|R
50|$|Envenomation {{with the}} male venom {{produced}} mostly <b>the</b> same <b>symptoms,</b> although <b>the</b> onset of <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>was</b> a little delayed. The female venom also produces <b>the</b> same <b>symptoms,</b> but far less severe.|$|R
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E

25|$|Lymphoma {{may present}} with certain nonspecific symptoms; if <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> persistent, an {{evaluation}} {{to determine their}} cause, including possible lymphoma, should be undertaken.|$|E

25|$|Probable neurosarcoidosis can be {{diagnosed}} if <b>the</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> suggestive, {{there is evidence}} of central nervous system inflammation (e.g. CSF and MRI), and other diagnoses have been excluded. A diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis is not essential.|$|E
25|$|Altitude {{sickness}} usually occurs {{following a}} rapid ascent and {{can usually be}} prevented by ascending slowly.

25|$|A complicating {{factor is}} the endemic spread of swine {{vesicular}} disease (SVD) in Taiwan. <b>The</b> <b>symptoms</b> <b>are</b> indistinguishable from FMD, which {{may have led to}} previous misdiagnosing of FMD as SVD. Laboratory analysis was seldom used for diagnosis, and FMD may thus have gone unnoticed for some time.|$|E
40|$|Fifty {{patients}} with confirmed non-ulcer dyspepsia {{were enrolled in}} the study. They consisted of 32 males and 18 females aged between 18 - 80 years.
