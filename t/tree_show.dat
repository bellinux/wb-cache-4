2500|$|Pictorial {{representations}} of the Jesse <b>Tree</b> <b>show</b> a symbolic tree or vine with spreading branches to represent the genealogy in accordance with Isaiah's prophecy. The 12th-century monk Hervaeus expressed the medieval understanding of the image, based on the Vulgate text: [...] "The patriarch Jesse belonged to the royal family, {{that is why the}} root of Jesse signifies the lineage of kings. As to the rod, it symbolises Mary as the flower symbolises Jesus Christ." [...] In the medieval period, when heredity was all-important, much greater emphasis than today was placed on the actual royal descent of Jesus, especially by royalty and the nobility, including those who had joined the clergy. Between them, these groups were responsible for much of the patronage of the arts.|$|E
2500|$|Choosing a {{place like}} Naqsh-e Rustam, which is {{mausoleum}} of Achaemenid shahs, for carving and inscribing, {{the site of the}} temple of Anahita in Istakhr and the existence of the names of some Achaemenid shahs as ancestors in the legendary Sasanian family <b>tree</b> <b>show</b> the existence of an inclination toward the Achaemenids in the early Sasanian period. There are many proofs in Middle Persian and Arabic-Persian writings that show the Sasanians' aggressive confrontation with Rome in order to return to the magnificent past status in the west and it had been assumed that the glory was taken by the Romans. About that, Al-Tabari has mentioned that Ardashir claimed and announced that he had risen to take the revenge of Darius III, who had been defeated and killed by Alexander III of Macedon. Roman historians like Herodian and Cassius Dio have also mentioned reports about [...] "the Sasanians' desire to return to the magnificence and kingdom of the Achaemenids"; these reports of Roman historians show that the Romans had understood the goals of the Sasanian foreign policy well; though they did not have a decent understanding of the change and transformation in the royal Iranian continuum. It {{should be noted that the}} place of Alexander, who was known as a nemesis of Iran, in the thought of the Sasanians' desire for return at the time was simultaneous and aligned with the idea of [...] "following and honoring Alexander" [...] in the Roman emperors; Caracalla called himself [...] "the second Alexander" [...] and [...] "Severus Alexander" [...] honored him. Kettenhofen, Robin and Heuse believe that the class of Greek-Roman sources that have reported the Sasanians' familiarity with the Achaemenids and their desire for return to and extension of the Achaemenid lands had propagative applications and should be interpreted in the frame of the Roman empire thoughts. But what is clear is Ardashir's and later his son Shapur's claim of Roman lands. Daryee believes that the cause of Ardashir and Shapur's wars with Rome was to accommodate their territorial ideals with traditions; he believes that the Sasanians' claim of Asian lands as their fathers' legacy had a mythical basis and originated from the mythical story of Fereydun dividing the world between his sons (Salm, Tur and Iraj); in that myth, Fereydun grants the reign of Turan to Tur and Rome to Salm and Iran, which is the best land in the world, to Iraj; the brothers become envious of the latter and the world goes under war. Thus, the Sasanians considered themselves Iraj's children and the Romans Salm's heirs by a mythical view. Daryee adds that only by that way the Sasanians' territorial claims, which are mentioned in Cassius Dio and Herodian's works, can be understood. He believes that the Sasanians' territorial claims were basically different from those of the Achaemenids.|$|E

50|$|Another study {{takes a look}} at {{coevolution}} as {{a primary}} driver of change and diversification in the yucca moth and the Joshua tree, more commonly known as the yucca palm. The researchers tested this hypothesis by setting up a differential selection of two species of yucca moths and two corresponding species of yucca palms which they pollinate. The study showed floral traits involving pollination evolved substantially more rapidly than other flower features. The study then looks at phylogeny and determines that coevolution is the major evolutionary force behind diversification in the yucca palms when pollinated moths were present. The researchers of the Joshua <b>tree</b> <b>show</b> that setting up phylogenetic patterns using maximum likelihood techniques, can be a powerful tool to analyze the divergence in species (Godsoe 2008).|$|E

5000|$|The Huge Kaani (Sea Trumpet) Tree in Maroshi {{is noted}} in history for various reasons. It {{is a living}} tribute to Sultan Mohamed Thakurufaanu who freed the country from {{the reign of the}} Portuguese. It is also the largest tree {{of its kind in the}} country, and {{probably}} the oldest as well. It is said that Mohamed Thakurufaanu received a lot of help from the renowned Maroshi Raaveribe ( [...] toddy-tapper) in his fight for national independence. It was his job to mend and maintain the sail of the Kalhuoffunmi - the ship used in the 'battle' and supply water to the vessel every time it docked at Maroshi, which was an important port during this fight. This tree still growing in the island is the one that grew from the Kaani staff that Raaveribe hoisted some 400 years ago to keep the huge sails of Kalhuoffunmi. Although some of the gigantic branches of the <b>tree</b> <b>show</b> signs of being attacked by 'giant saws', this is a historical monument that has been preserved over time. Also, signs of the passage through which the vessel went in and out of the kulhi (a lake-like enclosure of water) in the island is still quite obvious.|$|E
5000|$|Ardashir had a {{remarkable}} {{role in developing}} the royal ideology. He tried to announce himself as a Mazda worshiper connected to god and owner of divine khvarenah. The claim of his royal eligibility as a rightful newcomer from the line of mythical Iranian shahs and the propagations attributed to Ardashir against the eligibility {{and the role of}} the Parthians in the Iranian history sequence confirms the excellent place that the Achaemenid legacy had in the minds of the first Sasanian shahanshahs; though the consensus is that the Sasanians probably did not know much about the Achaemenids and the status. On the other hand, Shahbazi believes that the first Sasanian shahanshahs were familiar with the Achaemenids and their succeeding shahanshahs turned to the Kayanians deliberately. About that, Daryee adds that the Sasanians knowingly ignored the Achaemenids in order to be able to attribute their origins to the Kayanians; and that is why they applied the holy historiography. In that method, the social familiarity and bureaucracy did not matter and the court propagated its custom history by the help of the religious system. In order to remark his victories, Ardashir carved pictures in Firuzabad, Naqsh-e Rustam and Naqsh-e Rajab; on his picture in Naqsh-e Rustam, Ardashir and Ahura Mazda are opposite to each other on horsebacks and the bodies of Artabanus V and Ahriman are visualized under the nails of Ardashir and Mazda's horses. It can be deduced from the picture that Ardashir believed or wanted others to believe that his reign over the land that is called [...] "Iran" [...] in inscriptions is designated by the Lord. The word [...] "Iran" [...] was previously used in Avesta and as [...] "the name of the mythical Aryan land". In Ardashir's period, the title [...] "Iran" [...] was applied to the geography under Sasanian rule. The thought of [...] "Iran" [...] was accepted by both Zoroastrian and non-Zoroastrian societies in the whole empire and the collective memory of the Iranians has continued and survived until the modern period today in different stages and various layers of the Iranian society. What is clear is that the concept [...] "Iran" [...] has had a religious application too and has later ended in the formation of its political face meaning a collection of lands.Choosing a place like Naqsh-e Rustam, which is mausoleum of Achaemenid shahs, for carving and inscribing, the site of the temple of Anahita in Istakhr and the existence of the names of some Achaemenid shahs as ancestors in the legendary Sasanian family <b>tree</b> <b>show</b> the existence of an inclination toward the Achaemenids in the early Sasanian period.

In the book, the thought that has been reflected is the relation of Sasan, the ancestor of the Sasanian house, with Darius's descendants on one hand and the local Persian kings on the other hand; though in the fifth century, the Sasanians attributed their lineage to the mythical kings of Avesta or Kayanians; and its proof is the addition of the prefix [...] "Kay" [...] to the aliases of the Sasanian shahanshahs.|$|E
