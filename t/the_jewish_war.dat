At the same time Alexander, as a proven {{commander}} with experience of Jewish affairs, was sent by Vespasian to join Titus as his chief of staff and adviser, second only to Titus himself. By April 70, Jerusalem was under siege by four legions, and even after the city walls were overcome, the defenders held out in the Temple. Alexander, the offspring of a pious Jewish family, whose own father had donated the gold and silver for the Temple gates, now found himself in a position of command against his former brothers in that very sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|Issues arose {{after the}} {{erection}} of the memorial concerning the names {{inscribed on the}} Cenotaph. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton men, {{and a number of}} women, who had died during the war and these had been inscribed on the Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument various relatives approached the committee requesting that additional names be added; after a newspaper campaign in the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, Kimber agreed to this and 203 additional names were inscribed in 1921. Another name was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>war</b> dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: one in ten adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. Following the final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, which featured a prominent Christian cross, Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial and only one Jewish name was finally inscribed on it.|$|E

25|$|Louis Feldman {{states that}} it is {{significant}} that the passages on James, John and the Testimonium are found in the Antiquities and not in <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>Wars,</b> but provides three explanations for their absence from <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>Wars.</b> One explanation is that the Antiquities covers the time period involved at a greater length than <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>Wars.</b> <b>The</b> second explanation is that during the gap between the writing of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>Wars</b> (c. 70 AD) and Antiquities (after 90 AD) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the Antiquities. Another explanation is that the passages were added to the Antiquities to highlight the power of the Pharisees, but he considers the last explanation less likely than the others.|$|R

25|$|The twenty-year {{gap between}} the writing of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>Wars</b> and <b>the</b> Antiquities has also been used to {{explain some of the}} {{differences}} in tone between them. Clemens Thoma provides an explanation for this based on the observation that Josephus may have learned of the details of the actions of Annanus in the twenty-year {{gap between the}} writing of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>Wars</b> and <b>the</b> Antiquities, and thus avoided a positive tone when writing of Ananus in the Antiquities.|$|R

2500|$|John Painter {{states that}} the {{difference}} in the context for <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>Wars</b> and <b>the</b> Antiquities may also account for some of the differences in tone between them, e.g. when writing of Ananus [...] in a positive tone in <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>Wars</b> <b>the</b> context was Ananus' prudence in avoiding a war and hence Josephus considered that a positive aspect. However, when writing in the Antiquities about the actions of Ananus which resulted in his demotion from the High Priesthood, the context required the manifestation of a negative aspect of Ananus' character.|$|R
25|$|A final {{argument}} from silence relates to Josephus' own writings and questions {{the authenticity of}} Testimonium {{based on the fact}} that it has no parallel in <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>War,</b> which includes a discussion of Pontius Pilate at about the same level of detail.|$|E
25|$|The {{references}} {{found in}} Antiquities have no parallel texts {{in the other}} work by Josephus such as <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>War,</b> written twenty years earlier, but some scholars have provided explanations for their absence, such as that the Antiquities covers a longer time period and that during the twenty-year gap between {{the writing of the}} Jewish Wars (c. 70 CE) and Antiquities (after 90 CE) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the Antiquities.|$|E

However, in his later work, Jewish Antiquities, Josephus emphasizes the tyrannical authority that many scholars have come to associate with Herod's reign.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{arguments}} against {{the authenticity of the}} James passage has been that in the Jewish Wars Josephus portrays the High Priest Ananus in a positive manner, while in the Antiquities he writes of Ananus in a negative tone.

25|$|After the {{assassination}} of Caligula in 41, Agrippa {{was involved in the}} struggle over the accession between Claudius, the Praetorian Guard, and the Senate. How big a part Agrippa played is uncertain; the various sources differ. Cassius Dio simply writes that Agrippa cooperated with Claudius in seeking rule. Flavius Josephus gives us two versions. In <b>The</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>War,</b> Agrippa is presented as only a messenger to a confident and energetic Claudius. But in The Antiquities of the Jews, Agrippa's role is central and crucial: he convinces Claudius {{to stand up to the}} Senate and the Senate to avoid attacking Claudius. After becoming Emperor, Claudius gave Agrippa dominion over Judea and Samaria and granted him the ornamenta consularia, and at his request gave the kingdom of Chalcis in Lebanon to Agrippa's brother Herod of Chalcis. Thus Agrippa became one of the most powerful kings of the east. His domain more or less equaled that which was held by his grandfather Herod the Great.|$|E
