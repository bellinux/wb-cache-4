5|$|Cats are obligate carnivores: their {{physiology}} {{has evolved}} to efficiently process meat, {{and they have}} difficulty digesting plant matter. In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein. Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce <b>taurine,</b> with <b>taurine</b> deficiency causing macular degeneration, wherein the cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible blindness.|$|E
5|$|When {{taken up}} into the human body from the diet, the 20 {{standard}} amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle. Glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis. Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp and Val) are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food. In addition, cysteine, <b>taurine,</b> tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential amino-acids in children (though <b>taurine</b> is not technically an amino acid), because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. Dietary exposure to the non-standard amino acid BMAA has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.|$|E
5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels {{of several of the}} digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized <b>taurine</b> and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies. However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> {{levels were}} found to be {{significantly}} lower in vegans than in a control group on a standard American diet. Plasma <b>taurine</b> was 78% of control values, and urinary <b>taurine</b> was 29%.|$|E
25|$|In {{diabetic}} rats, <b>taurine</b> significantly decreased {{weight and}} decreased blood sugar. Likewise, <b>taurine</b> administration to diabetic rabbits resulted in 30% decrease in serum glucose levels. According {{to the single}} study on human subjects, daily administration of 1.5 g of <b>taurine</b> had no significant effect on insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity. There is evidence that <b>taurine</b> may exert a beneficial effect in preventing diabetes-associated microangiopathy and tubulointerstitial injury in diabetic nephropathy.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} mice hereditarily unable to {{transport}} <b>taurine</b> suggests {{it is needed}} for proper maintenance and functioning of skeletal muscles. In addition, {{it has been shown}} to be effective in removing fatty liver deposits in rats, preventing liver disease, and reducing cirrhosis in tested animals. Evidence indicates <b>taurine</b> may be beneficial for blood pressure in male rats. A single intravenous <b>taurine</b> supplementation resulted in measurable decreases in blood pressure. However, when rats were supplemented with <b>taurine</b> in their drinking water, only female rats showed an increase in blood pressure. Both genders showed significant tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> is an {{essential}} dietary requirement for feline health, since house cats (and {{all members of the}} cat family) cannot synthesize the compound. The absence of <b>taurine</b> causes a cat's retina to slowly degenerate, causing eye problems and (eventually) irreversible blindness– a condition known as central retinal degeneration (CRD), as well as hair loss and tooth decay. Decreased plasma <b>taurine</b> concentration has been demonstrated to be associated with feline dilated cardiomyopathy. Unlike CRD, the condition is reversible with supplementation. <b>Taurine</b> is now a requirement of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and any dry or wet food product labeled approved by the AAFCO should have a minimum of 0.1% <b>taurine</b> in dry food and 0.2% in wet food.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> is {{involved}} in a number of crucial physiological processes. However, its role in these processes is not clearly understood and the influence of high <b>taurine</b> doses on these processes is uncertain. A substantial increase in the plasma concentration of growth hormone was reported in some epileptic patients during <b>taurine</b> tolerance testing (oral dose of 50mg per kg body mass per day), suggesting a potential to stimulate the hypothalamus and to modify neuroendocrine function. A 1966 study found an indication that <b>taurine</b> (2 g/day) has some function in the maintenance and possibly in the induction of psoriasis. Three later studies failed to support that finding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> occurs {{naturally}} in fish and meat. The mean daily intake from omnivore diets {{was determined to}} be around 58mg (range from 9 to 372mg) and to be low or negligible from a strict vegan diet. In another study, <b>taurine</b> intake was estimated to be generally less than 200mg/day, even in individuals eating a high-meat diet. According to another study, <b>taurine</b> consumption was estimated to vary between 40 and 400mg/day.|$|E
25|$|Cat food is {{food for}} {{consumption}} by cats. Cats have requirements for their specific dietary nutrients. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid nutritional deficiency. The amino acid <b>taurine,</b> for example, which is found within meat, is degraded during processing, so synthetic <b>taurine</b> is normally added afterwards. Long-term <b>taurine</b> deficiency {{may result in}} retinal degeneration, loss of vision, and cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> has an {{observed}} {{safe level}} of supplemental intake in normal healthy adults {{at up to}} 3g/day. Even so, {{a study by the}} European Food Safety Authority found no adverse effects for up to 1,000mg of <b>taurine</b> per kilogram of body weight per day.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, about 5,000–6,000nbsp&tons of <b>taurine</b> were {{produced}} for commercial purposes: 50% for pet food and 50% in pharmaceutical applications. As of 2010, China alone {{has more than}} 40 manufacturers of <b>taurine.</b> Most of these enterprises employ the ethanolamine method to produce a total annual production of about 3,000tons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> {{acts as a}} glycation inhibitor. Taurine-treated {{diabetic}} rats had {{a decrease}} in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and AGEs content. The United States Department of Agriculture has found a link between cataract development and lower levels of vitamin B6, folate, and <b>taurine</b> in the diets of the elderly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> {{has been}} shown to reduce the {{secretion}} of apolipoprotein B100 and lipids in HepG2 cells. High concentrations of serum lipids and apolipoprotein B100 (essential structural component of VLDL and LDL) are major risk factors of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Hence, <b>taurine</b> supplementation is possibly beneficial for the prevention of these diseases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> is {{also used}} in some contact lens solutions.|$|E
25|$|In cells, <b>taurine</b> keeps {{potassium}} {{and magnesium}} inside the cell, while keeping excessive sodium out. In this sense, it {{works like a}} diuretic. Because it aids the movement of potassium, sodium, and calcium {{in and out of}} the cell, <b>taurine</b> has been used as a dietary supplement for epileptics, as well as for people who have uncontrollable facial twitches.|$|E
25|$|The retinal {{toxicity}} of vigabatrin {{can be attributed}} to a <b>taurine</b> depletion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> {{is used in}} the {{preparation}} of the anthelmintic drug netobimin (Totabin).|$|E
25|$|In the {{laboratory}} <b>taurine</b> {{can be produced}} by alkylation of ammonia with bromoethanesulfonate salts.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium taurate, the {{magnesium}} salt of <b>taurine,</b> is {{a mineral}} supplement of magnesium.|$|E
25|$|One {{study used}} {{to back up}} the claims of raw food being {{superior}} to cooked food is Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.'s study of 900 cats over a period of 10 years from 1932 to 1942. His results showed that cats that were fed 2/3 raw meat, 1/3 raw milk and a small amount of cod liver oil were disease free and healthy while those fed the same food with the meat cooked developed degenerative diseases and reproductive difficulties, with new generations plagued with health problems. The study was done before the importance of <b>taurine</b> in a cat's diet was known and {{it has been suggested that}} the group of Pottenger's cats on cooked food simply suffered from <b>taurine</b> deficiency as heating or cooking food causes a reduction in <b>taurine</b> content. In a study on feline maternal <b>taurine</b> deficiency, the group of taurine-deficient cats exhibited symptoms similar to the Pottenger's cats on a cooked diet.|$|E
25|$|The French {{food safety}} agency was {{concerned}} about <b>taurine.</b> A Red Bull drink that did not contain <b>taurine</b> was introduced. The French refusal of market approval was challenged by the European Commission, and partially upheld by the European Court of Justice in 2004. The French food safety agency relented in 2008, because it was unable to prove a definite health risk, taurine-related or not.|$|E
25|$|Prematurely born infants are {{believed}} to lack the enzymes needed to convert cystathionine to cysteine, and may, therefore, become deficient in <b>taurine.</b> <b>Taurine</b> is present in breast milk, and {{has been added to}} many infant formulas, as a measure of prudence, since the early 1980s. However, this practice has never been rigorously studied, and as such it has yet to be proven to be necessary, or even beneficial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> {{has also}} been shown to help people with {{congestive}} heart failure by increasing the force and effectiveness of heart-muscle contractions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> is {{essential}} for cardiovascular function, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, and the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} in animal studies {{as an alternative to}} glucose as an osmotic agent for use in peritoneal dialysis solutions.|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} be {{necessary}} {{to take into consideration}} that absorption of <b>taurine</b> from beverages may be more rapid than from foods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> can {{influence}} (and possibly reverse) defects in nerve blood flow, motor nerve conduction velocity, and nerve sensory thresholds in experimental diabetic neuropathic rats.|$|E
25|$|Methionine is an {{intermediate}} in the biosynthesis of cysteine, carnitine, <b>taurine,</b> lecithin, phosphatidylcholine, and other phospholipids. Improper conversion of methionine {{can lead to}} atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Complicating {{the matter}} {{is the ability of}} cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. Hybrid {{individuals}} and even breeds exist, not only between <b>taurine</b> cattle and zebu (such as the sanga cattle, Bos taurus africanus), but also between one or both of these and some other members of the genus Bosyaks (the dzo or yattle), banteng, and gaur. Hybrids such as the beefalo breed can even occur between <b>taurine</b> cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them part of the genus Bos, as well. The hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious – for example, genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only taurine-type cattle in Nepal, found them to be a mix of <b>taurine</b> cattle, zebu, and yak. However, cattle cannot be successfully hybridized with more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or African buffalo.|$|E
25|$|According {{to animal}} studies, <b>taurine</b> {{produces}} an anxiolytic effect and may {{act as a}} modulator or antianxiety agent in {{the central nervous system}} by activating the glycine receptor.|$|E
25|$|Many {{pet owners}} feed cats {{homemade}} diets. These diets generally consist of {{some form of}} cooked or raw meat, bone, vegetables, and supplements, such as <b>taurine</b> and multivitamins.|$|E
25|$|DHA modulates the carrier-mediated {{transport}} of choline, glycine, and <b>taurine,</b> {{the function of}} delayed rectifier potassium channels, and the response of rhodopsin contained in the synaptic vesicles, among many other functions.|$|E
25|$|It also {{acts as an}} {{antioxidant}} {{and protects}} against toxicity of various substances (such as lead and cadmium). Additionally, supplementation with <b>taurine</b> {{has been shown to}} prevent oxidative stress induced by exercise.|$|E
25|$|Red Bull {{contains}} caffeine, <b>taurine,</b> B vitamins (B3, B5, B6, B12), sucrose, and glucose. To produce Red Bull Sugarfree, sugars sucrose and glucose {{have been}} replaced by the sweeteners acesulfame K and aspartame/sucralose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taurine</b> {{is named}} after the Latin taurus (a cognate of the Greek ταῦρος) which means bull or ox, as it was first {{isolated}} from ox bile in 1827 by German scientists Friedrich Tiedemann and Leopold Gmelin.|$|E
