30|$|Physiologic lung {{development}} is a highly orchestrated process which in the end enables the gas exchange between the air-conducting parts of the lung and the blood vessels. The stages of lung development {{can be divided into}} the embryonic, the pseudoglandular, the canalicular, the saccular, and the alveolar stage. During the embryonic stage, the lung bud separates from the gut followed by the branching morphogenesis in the pseudoglandular stage until 17  weeks of gestation. The pseudoglandular stage is followed by the canalicular stage which continuous until the border of viability at about 24  weeks. The canalicular stage is characterized by the formation of the terminal branches of the bronchial tree, differentiation of type I and type II cells, vascular outgrowth, and the thinning of the mesenchyme. The subsequent saccular stage is mainly characterized by the formation of the primitive <b>terminal</b> <b>airspaces,</b> thinning of the connective tissue between the airspace and the pulmonary vessels, and the beginning of surfactant production.

A solution aimed at mitigating these chokepoints integrates the scheduling of runway operations, flight release from the gates and ramp into the airport movement area, and merging with other traffic competing for downstream airspace points. Within this integrated concept, we present a simulation-based analysis of the departure metering process, which delays the release of flights into the airport movement area while balancing two competing objectives: (1) maintaining large enough queues at the airport resources to maximize throughput and (2) absorbing excess delays at the gates or in ramp areas to save on fuel consumption, emissions, noise, and passenger discomfort. Three metering strategies are compared which respectively attempt to control the number of flights that (1) left the gate but did not take off, (2) left the ramp but did not take off, and (3) spent their unimpeded transit time to the runway but did not take off. It was observed that under deterministic and demand uncertainty conditions, the first strategy performed {{better than the other}} two strategies in terms of maintaining the runway throughput while transferring a significant average delay of two minutes to the gate.

Spirometric detection of not fully reversible airflow limitation unifies under the acronym COPD, a spectrum of heterogeneous conditions, whose clinical presentations may be substantially different. In a cross-sectional study we aimed to ascertain whether COPD phenotypes reflecting different mechanisms of airflow limitation could be clinically identified. MethodsMultidimensional scaling was used to visualize as a single point in a two-dimension space the multidimensional variables derived from each of 322 COPD patients (derivation set) by clinical, functional, and chest radiographic evaluation. Cluster analysis assigned then a cluster membership to each patient data point. Finally, using cluster membership as dependent variable and all data acquired as independent variables, we developed multivariate models to prospectively classify another group of 93 COPD patients (validation set) in whom high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) density parameters were measured. ResultsA multivariate model based on nine variables acquired from the derivation set by history (sputum characteristics), physical examination (adventitious sounds, hyperresonance), FEV 1 /VC, and chest radiography (increased vascular markings, bronchial wall thickening, increased lung volume, reduced lung density) partitioned the validation set into two groups whose clinical, functional, chest radiographic, and HRCT characteristics corresponded to either an airways obstructive or a parenchymal destructive COPD phenotype.

40|$|Pulmonary {{surfactant}} is a lipoprotein complex coating the conducting airways {{down to the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>airspaces.</b> Its {{main function}} is to lower surface tension at the air liquid interface thus preventing alveolar collapse at end expiration. Primary surfactant deficiency is {{the main cause of}} neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and treatment with exogenous pulmonary surfactant improves the course of the disease significantly. Furthermore, secondary surfactant deficiency caused by inactivation of endogenous surfactant occurs in older patients with acute RDS (ARDS), pneumonia or meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Abnormal alveolar presence of substances like aspirated meconium or leaking serum proteins inhibits surface activity. This inactivation of endogenous surfactant can be overcome by increasing the surfactant concentration with exogenous surfactant. In the clinical setting modified natural surfactants extracted from animal lungs are used most commonly. However, a new generation of surfactant preparations containing synthetic proteins are currently under development to improve supply and to lower costs. In our project we investigated the sensitivity of exogenous surfactant preparations to different types of inactivation and tried to find ways for improving their resistance. In vitro we found new synthetic surfactant containing proteins to be more resistant to meconium inactivation than modified natural surfactants. Meconium induced inactivation of modified natural surfactant was reversible, especially in the presence of calcium or polymyxin B (PxB), a cross linking protein of phospholipid films with antimicrobial properties. PxB enriched surfactant also preserves antibiotic characteristics in vitro and in an animal model of neonatal pneumonia. Accidentally, we observed surfactant inactivation by silicone oil dissolved from syringes that are in clinical use. This type of inactivation may lead to significant deterioration of lungs in an animal model of RDS. By comparison of surfactant preparations comprising the hydrophobic surfactant protein B and/or C we pointed out that both proteins are needed for alveolar stability...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCommercial {{aviation}} {{is expected}} to see an average growth of 3. 7 % per year {{over the next five}} years. At the same time, regional airlines are expressing concerns that they are unable to find a sufficient number of pilots who meet the minimum number of required flight hours and certifications. One option for handling the increased demand for, and reduced supply of, pilots is to better distribute the pilots already employed. This could be accomplished by reducing the number of required crewmembers on the flight deck from two to one. However, a significant challenge to the implementation of a single pilot crew is the increase in workload a single pilot would face especially in complex airspace. The harbor pilot is one concept of operations that has been proposed to deal with the potentially serious problem. In this concept, the harbor pilot is a ground operator {{whose job it is to}} help arriving single pilot aircraft navigate the complex <b>terminal</b> area <b>airspace.</b> The purpose of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of the harbor pilot concept by measuring the workload and performance of harbor pilots during a series of back-to-back simulated arrival procedures.

These goals are being realized by the introduction of {{flight management}} automation aiding and operations support systems on the flight deck and by new developments of ATC aiding systems that seek to optimize scheduling of aircraft while potentially reducing required separation and accounting for weather and wake vortex turbulence. Aiding systems on both the flight deck and the ground operate through algorithmic functions on models of the aircraft and of the airspace. These models may differ from each other as a result of variations in their models of the immediate environment. The resultant flight operations or ATC commands may differ in their response requirements (e. g. different preferred descent speeds or descent initiation points). The human operators in the system must then interact with the automation to reconcile differences and resolve conflicts. We have developed a model of human performance including cognitive functions (decision-making, rule-based reasoning, procedural interruption recovery and forgetting) that supports analysis of the information requirements for resolution of flight aiding and ATC conflicts. The model represents multiple individuals in the flight crew and in ATC. The model is supported in simulation on a Silicon Graphics' workstation using Allegro Lisp. Design guidelines for aviation automation aiding systems have been developed using the model's specification of information and team procedural requirements.

Despite the substantial {{reduction of the}} emitted aircraft noise in the last decades, the noise impact on communities located near airports {{is a problem that}} still lingers. Containing the sound generated by aircraft operations, while meeting the increasing demand for aircraft transportation, {{is one of the major}} challenges that airport authorities, air traffic service providers and aircraft operators may deal with. Aircraft noise can be reduced by improving the aerodynamics of the aircraft, the engine noise emissions but also in designing new optimised flight procedures. These procedures are generally called Noise Abatement Procedures (NAP) and may include preferential routings (in order to avoid populated areas) and also schedule optimised vertical flight path profiles. Present noise abatement procedures are far from being optimal in regards to minimising noise nuisances. In general, their optimisation is not possible due to the limitations of navigation methods, current avionic equipments and the complexity present at some <b>terminal</b> <b>airspaces.</b> Moreover, NAP are often designed manually by a group of experts and several iterations are needed. However, in the forthcoming years, new avionic systems and new Air Traffic Management concepts are expected to significantly improve the design of flight procedures. This will make them more flexible, and therefore will allow them to be more environmental friendly. Furthermore, in the few cases where NAP are optimised, an acoustical metric is usually used when building up the different optimisation functions. Therefore, the actual noise annoyance is not taken into account in the optimisation process. The annoyance is a subjective, complex and context-dependent concept. Even if sophisticated (and more accurate) noise annoyance models are already available today, their integration into an trajectory optimisation framework is still something to be further explored. This dissertation is mainly focused on the fact that those precise and more flexible trajectories will enable the definition of optimal flight procedures regarding the noise annoyance impact, especially in the arrival and departure phases of flights. In addition, one can conceive a situation where these kinds of procedures can be designed automatically or semi-automatically by an expert system, based on optimisation techniques and approximate reasoning. This would serve as a decision making tool for airspace planners and procedure designers. A complete framework for computing optimal NAP is developed in this work. This includes a set of nonlinear models which take into account aircraft dynamics, trajectory constraints and objective functions. The noise annoyance is modelled by using fuzzy logic techniques in function of the perceived maximum sound level, the hour of the day and the type of over-flown zone. The problem tackled, formally identified and formulated as a multi-criteria optimal control problem, uses a direct transcription method to transform it into a Non Linear Programming problem. Then, an assessment of different multiobjective optimisation techniques is presented. Among these techniques, scalarisation methods are identified as the most widely used methodologies in the present day literature. Yet, in this dissertation several alternative techniques are explored in order to overcome some known drawbacks of this technique. In this context, lexicographic, hierarchical, egalitarian (or min-max) and goal optimisation strategies are presented and tested. From this analysis some conclusions arise allowing us to take advantage of the best features of each optimisation technique aimed at building a final compound multi-objective optimisation strategy. Finally, this strategy is applied successfully to a complex and real scenario, where the East departures of runway 02 at the airport of Girona (Catalonia, Spain) are optimised. Two aircraft types are simulated at different periods of the day obtaining different optimal trajectories.
