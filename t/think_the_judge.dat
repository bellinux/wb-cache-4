[...] Woods also stated that [...] "She (Ramirez) was doing a photo shoot and asked to wear her wardrobe from the competition, but it did not fit her.

Now the general opinion of the world is certainly quite the reverse--namely this, that children, {{as long as they are}} under the control of their parents, should be hindered and prevented in those things to which they are most inclined. Of course the world in general, in carrying out this practice, excuses it by an assertion,--made to themselves or others,--that children customarily like those things which they ought not to like.

60|$|The next {{affair was}} {{to buy a}} horse for his own driving. The one {{heretofore}} his favorite stumbled, this very morning, {{on the road to}} town, and must be at once discarded. Judge Pyncheon's neck is too precious to be risked on such a contingency as a stumbling steed. Should all the above business be seasonably got through with, he might attend the meeting of a charitable society; the very name of which, however, in the multiplicity of his benevolence, is quite forgotten; so that this engagement may pass unfulfilled, and no great harm done. And if he have time, amid the press of more urgent matters, he must take measures for the renewal of Mrs. Pyncheon's tombstone, which, the sexton tells him, has fallen on its marble face, and is cracked quite in twain. She was a praiseworthy woman enough, <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judge,</b> in spite of her nervousness, and the tears that she was so oozy with, and her foolish behavior about the coffee; and as she took her departure so seasonably, he will not grudge the second tombstone. It is better, at least, than if she had never needed any! The next item on his list was to give orders for some fruit-trees, of a rare variety, to be deliverable at his country-seat in the ensuing autumn. Yes, buy them, by all means; and may the peaches be luscious in your mouth, Judge Pyncheon! After this comes something more important. A committee of his political party has besought him for a hundred or two of dollars, in addition to his previous disbursements, towards carrying on the fall campaign. <b>The</b> <b>Judge</b> is a patriot; the fate of the country is staked on the November election; and besides, as will be shadowed forth in another paragraph, he has no trifling stake of his own in the same great game. He will do what the committee asks; nay, he will be liberal beyond their expectations; they shall have a check for five hundred dollars, and more anon, if it be needed. What next? A decayed widow, whose husband was Judge Pyncheon's early friend, has laid her case of destitution before him, in a very moving letter. She and her fair daughter have scarcely bread to eat. He partly intends to call on her to-day,--perhaps so--perhaps not,--accordingly as he may happen to have leisure, and a small bank-note.|$|R

They inform <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> and return to the courtroom where the verdict is read. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> may either accept the verdict or overrule it. It is rare for the verdict to be overruled. This happens when <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> verdict is unlawful.

40|$|Queued Judging is {{a method}} for {{speeding}} up <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> of competition categories that {{are made up of}} multiple flights. Organizers create sorted entry lists for each category, then teams of judges take turns <b>judging</b> entries from <b>the</b> list, assessing the entire category in order. It was first used on a large scale during the 2008 American Homebrewers Association National Homebrew Competition, and had excellent results—the second round was judged in one day for the first time ever. An Analogy <b>Think</b> of <b>the</b> queued <b>judging</b> process like waiting in line at a bank, with the people in line being the entries and the tellers being <b>the</b> <b>judging</b> teams. When a judging team is available, the next entry is judged, just like a bank teller serves the next person in line. The old method of judging (dividing up entries for each judging team) is like the old method used at banks, grocery stores or post offices – each teller or agent having their own line.

You remember I was an old Whig, and whenever the Democratic party tried to get me to vote that the war had been righteously begun by the President, I would not do it. But whenever they asked for any money, or landwarrants, or anything to pay the soldiers there, during all that time, I gave the same vote that Judge Douglas did. You can think as you please as to whether that was consistent. Such is the truth, and <b>the</b> <b>Judge</b> has <b>the</b> right to make all he can out of it.
