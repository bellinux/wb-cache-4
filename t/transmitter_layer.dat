40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} {{the design of}} a {{software}} defined radio (SDR) transceiver using Open Source SCA Implementation Embedded (OSSIE) as the software platform. Designing a SDR requires both an appreciation of the IEEE 802. 11 a (wireless Local Area Network at 5 GHz band) protocol standard as well as the understanding of the C++ and CORBA software tools available to implement the physical <b>transmitter</b> and receiver <b>layers.</b> For this work, the Incremental Development Model was chosen, which is comprised of three stages: Design, Develop and Verify. The advantage of this model is its incremental nature, which allows the developer to learn from earlier versions of the system. Implementing the IEEE 802. 11 a physical layer using OSSIE requires a total of 23 components, 12 different functionalities and 31 sequential input-output (I/O) processes for the transmitter, while the receiver is implemented with 18 components, 12 different functionalities and 20 sequential I/O processes.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} design of a source-channel decoder for transmission of a vector quantized source over a noisy memoryless channel with a retransmission based protocol such as ARQ or Type-I hybrid ARQ. First we show {{that the problem of}} design of optimal ACK/NACK generation and decoding by packet combining can be cast and solved as a sequential decision problem. The optimal solutions found by dynamic programming give feedback generation rules which depend explicitly on the distortion metric. Next, based on the structure of the optimal solution, we propose suboptimal joint source-channel decoders which outperform conventional pure channel-decoders. 1.

We propose the notion of practical secrecy as a new design criterion based {{on the behavior of}} the eavesdropper’s error probability PE, as the signal-to-noise ratio goes to infinity.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{cooperative}} scheme between {{primary and secondary}} networks. In this scheme, a secondary user (SU) accepts a lease of {{a part of the}} licensed band according to a cooperative request of a primary user (PU). Hence, the SU helps the PU in transmitting primary signals and has an opportunity to access the frequency spectrum. On the other hand, the SU owns important data and may mistrust the intention of a primary <b>transmitter.</b> Physical <b>layer</b> security is applied to evaluate the cooperative efficiency in terms of the data transmission and data security. The numerical and simulative results show that the system performance of the primary network in the cooperative scheme is improved in terms of the outage probability and the symbol error rate and is compared with that in the direct transmission scheme. In addition, the secure performance of the secondary network, as expressed by the outage secrecy probability and the average secrecy capacity, is maintained under the eavesdropping of the primary transmitter.|$|R

40|$|ASEE 2007 IEEE 802. 11 is a {{wireless}} LAN technology {{based on a}} cellular architecture where the system is subdivided into cells. Each cell is called Basic Service Set (BSS) which is controlled by a base station called Accesses Point (AP). Access points are connected through Distribution System (DS), typically Ethernet or wireless itself. Ethernet LAN Technology uses CSMA/CD protocol; these protocols are very effective when medium is not heavily loaded. In this paper, the Wi-Fi MAC transmit and receive protocol is implemented with Verilog HDL. The individual modules of the Wifi MAC Layer Transmit and Receive Protocol confirming to the IEEE 802. 11 specification have been designed. The whole Wi-Fi Mac <b>Layer</b> <b>Transmitter</b> and Receiver are integrated. The various blocks and integrated blocks are simulated and functionality of each block is verified with test benches. Simulation results verify the correct functions of the designed Wi-Fi MAC transmit and receive protocol. The logic synthesis of the designed Wi-Fi MAC <b>Layer</b> <b>Transmitter</b> and Receiver is performed with Xilinx Synthesis Tools. Wi-Fi allows LANs (Local Area Networks) to be deployed without cabling for client devices, typically reducing the costs of network deployment and expansion. Spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs. A Wi-Fi enabled device such as a PC, game console, mobile phone, MP 3 player or PDA can connect to the Internet when within range of {{a wireless}} network connected to the Internet.

40|$|Among {{different}} wireless LAN technologies 802. 11 a {{has recently}} become {{popular due to}} its high throughput, large system capacity, and relatively long range. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable architecture for the 802. 11 a physical <b>layer</b> <b>transmitter,</b> which has low la-tency and low power consumption due to its pipelined structure. Data from the MAC layer can continuously flow through the pipeline without excessive buffering and handshaking within the physical layer. Dynami-cally reconfiguring this architecture to work at any data rate supported by 802. 11 a (eight different modes) can be performed within a few cycles, simply by adjusting the period of two clock signals and changing {{the value of a}} 3 -bit control signal.

40|$|A {{broadcast}} transmission {{strategy for}} the slowly fading Gaussian {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) channel is introduced. This broadcast strategy is an extension of the single input single output (SISO) broadcast approach. Perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed known at the receiver end only. This strategy facilitates to adapt the reliably decoded rate to the actual channel state without having any feedback link to the <b>transmitter.</b> Transmission of <b>layered</b> coded information is motivated by the theory of majorization. We derive the basic equations characterizing achievable rates of the strategy. Several ad-hoc approximations to the achievable region are considered and their performance is compared with the SISO setting and the ergodic capacity. It has been demonstrated that a single layer outage approach is reasonably efficient in the MIMO setting in terms of the average reliably decoded rate. A multiple-access (MAC) broadcast approach is also applied for the MIMO case, and demonstrated to be relatively efficient...|$|R
5000|$|The {{link layer}} is {{responsible}} for sending and receiving 80-bit FLITs. Each flit {{is sent to the}} physical layer as four 20-bit phits. Each flit contains an 8-bit CRC generated by the link <b>layer</b> <b>transmitter</b> and a 72-bit payload. If the link layer receiver detects a CRC error, the receiver notifies the transmitter via a flit on the return link of the pair and the transmitter resends the flit. The link layer implements flow control using a credit/debit scheme to prevent the receiver's buffer from overflowing. The link layer supports six different classes of message to permit the higher layers to distinguish data flits from non-data messages primarily for maintenance of cache coherence. In complex implementations of the QuickPath architecture, the link layer can be configured to maintain separate flows and flow control for the different classes. It is not clear if this is needed or implemented for single-processor and dual-processor implementations.|$|R
5000|$|The power {{reduction}} is accomplished {{in a few}} ways. In 100 Mbit/s, 1 gigabit and 10 Gbit/s speed data links, energy is used to keep the physical <b>layer</b> <b>transmitters</b> on all the time. If they could be put into [...] "sleep" [...] mode when no data is being sent, that energy could be saved. When the controlling software or firmware decides that no data needs to be sent, it can issue a low-power idle (LPI) request to the Ethernet controller physical layer PHY. The PHY will then send LPI symbols for a specified time onto the link, and then disable its transmitter. Refresh signals are sent periodically to maintain link signaling integrity. When there is data to transmit, a normal IDLE signal is sent for a predetermined period of time. The data link {{is considered to be}} always operational, as the receive signal circuit remains active even when the transmit path is in sleep mode.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A joint detection-estimation {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. The <b>transmitter</b> employs a <b>layered</b> turbo space-time code. The iterative scheme {{proposed for the}} receiver integrates in one scheme turbo decoding, coantenna nterference suppression and channel estimation. A main observation is that the high coding gain of the turbo space-time code can compensate {{for the application of}} simple co-antenna interference suppression scheme and can also facilitate good channel estimates. The performance of the MIMO-OFDM system is validated by simulations under various channel conditions including high Doppler. Numerical results show that for a 4 transmit 4 receive antenna (4 T 4 R) system, with a data rate of 4 Mb/s over a 1. 25 MHz bandwidth, a packet error rate (PER) of 10 − 2 is achieved at a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 16 dB for a typical urban channel with Doppler frequencies as high as 200 Hz. For a 4 T 6 R system, the same performance can be achieved for only 6 dB SNR. I...|$|R

The state sequence is known noncausally only to transmitter 1, not to the corresponding <b>transmitter</b> 2. A <b>layered</b> coding scheme is designed for transmitter 1 to help interference cancelation at receiver 2 (using a cognitive dirty paper coding) and to transmit its own message to receiver 1. Inner and outer bounds are derived, and are further analyzed to characterize the boundary of the capacity region either fully or partially for all Gaussian channel parameters. Our results imply that the capacity region of such a channel with mismatched transmitter-side state cognition and receiver-side state interference is strictly {{less than that of}} the corresponding channel without state, which is in contrast to Costa type of dirty channels, for which dirty paper coding achieves the capacity of the corresponding channels without state.

In this case, it seems the wireless ad hoc network [5] can be a useful communication environment, which can set up a local network connecting to neighboring hosts. In emergency case, it is highly required to find such important information as where water, food, shelter, medicine, and hospitals are. Hence, information discovery mechanism is a very indispensable issue in emergency ad hoc network. Moreover, considering unstable network condition, it will be needed to have diversity in route and information <b>transmitter.</b> In upper <b>layer,</b> it will be required to have some authentication mechanism without usual security infrastructure because even in emergency minimum security will be assured.

40|$|Abstract — Incremental-redundancy hybrid {{automatic}} repeatrequest (IR-HARQ) schemes {{are proposed}} in several wireless standards for increased throughput-efficiency and greater reliability. We investigate transmit power and modulation order adaptation {{strategies for the}} IR-HARQ schemes over correlated Rayleigh fading channels using semi-Markov decision processbased model. In order to jointly analyze physical layer and link <b>layer,</b> <b>transmitter</b> model incorporates a finite-size buffer that receives randomly varying traffic from a higher layer application. It is assumed that channel variations can be modeled with a firstorder Markov chain. We show that the optimal transmission power and rate adaptation laws under buffering delay and packet overflow constraints can be obtained using the framework of semi-Markov decision process. We discuss three different adaptation models for the IR-HARQ schemes and compare their performances with the non-adaptive scheme. It is shown that unique optimal policy exists for each case {{and it can be}} computed using linear programming approach. This optimal policy is then applied for realistic channel fading and incoming traffic samples to evaluate its performance for both hard-decision and softdecision decoding. Simulation results in general point out that substantial power savings can be achieved using adaptation and also if the transmission-delay requirements are relaxed.

40|$|ICASSP 2012 Tutorial number T- 3 (Half Day) The {{widely used}} OSI layered model {{partitions}} networking tasks into distinct protocol <b>layers.</b> At the <b>transmitter,</b> each <b>layer</b> adds some specific information (receiver address, type of signal, [...] .) to the transmitted packets. This facilitates network design, since a layer has {{not to be}} aware of the information introduced by other layers, allowing heterogeneous contents to be delivered via the same communication network. Moreover, upon reception, each layer extracts the required information at that level, while assuming that the lower layers behave perfectly. It then provides to the upper layers the required information. Therefore, error-detecting codes (CRC or checksums) protecting mainly headers (and sometimes the payload) are widely used at various places of the protocol stacks. They are combined with retransmission mechanisms (when feasible) for data packets deemed as corrupted. Moreover, since the layers work independently, but sometimes require the knowledge of identical (or correlated) information, some redundancy exists in the data extracted at each layer. This redundancy has been recognized and used for example in Robust Header Compression (RoHC) protocols for reducing the header lengths. Nevertheless, the existence of this redundancy can also be used (in a non exclusive manner) for other tasks, as outlined below The role of Joint Protocol and Channel Decoding (JPCD) is to make an efficient (and joint) use of the redundancy present in all protocol layers (including that introduced at Physical layer, e. g., by channel coding) in order to obtain optimal performance at a global level. A partial effort in this direction was already done under the framework of cross layer techniques, but JPCD intends to make full use of all properties of the signal that is transmitted. With this strategy, more reliable header recovery can be performed and aggregated packets can be more efficiently delineated. More recently, it has also been shown that channel decoding may benefit from the redundancy present in the protocol stack (protocol-assisted channel decoding). As a result, one can obtain at each layer packets that are more usable, i. e., contain fewer errors. Thus, JPCD allows one to obtain the best performance out of the received sequences without changing the structure of the transmitted signal. Clearly, since JPCD is performed within the receiver, the ability to use JPCD tools in the context of existing standards makes it potentially very practical. This tutorial explains in some details the required signal processing tools and their application to network layers, and provides examples of protocols for which this process has been implemented at all layers. This tutorial first presents some tools that are described in the book Joint Source-Channel Decoding. A Cross-Layer Perspective with Applications in Video Broadcasting over Mobile and Wireless Networks published in 2009 by Academic Press, and extends them in a comprehensive manner, providing missing ones, and giving many application examples. End-to-end simulations of applications concerning the reliable transmission of multimedia (video and html files) contents are finally provided. This set of simulations demonstrate that a truly permeable protocol stack can be implemented at decoder side, allowing the whole set of results already obtained under the name of Joint Source-Channel Decoding techniques to be practically used. Finally, this opens the floor for a true optimization of the redundancy allocation at the various layers of the protocol stack in order to obtain the best performance...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page [74]) The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to provide a}} design alternative to the user-plane wireless protocols of wireless asynchronous transfer mode (WATM) by making use of a flexible multiple access scheme, multieode direct-sequence code division multiple access (MC-CDMA). On a radio link, supporting multimedia applications with WATM demand additional requirements that are not present in wired ATM networks. In order to meet these requirements, we need improved communication technology, high computing speed, and an efficient and robust communication protocol. Protocol design is a fundamental issue in communication applications. A distributed implementation of such applications is derived from a given functional specification of the overall system. The design starts from a specification of the target system in textual form and is manually broken down into a set of functional blocks. After the functional decomposition, the communication protocol that interacts among these blocks is defined. Integrating heterogeneous traffic in a wireless environment is a major issue that needs to be resolved before wireless ATM technology can be realized. Moreover, the unstable wireless link and the mobile environment cause the radio link to be less reliable and constantly varying. These conditions demand the wireless protocols to be robust, efficient, and flexible. This thesis provides a design alternative for the wireless protocols of WATM that can operate over a multicode CDMA substrate. In the implementation of this thesis, CDMA channels are simulated to operate simultaneously, three of them carrying traffic of different traffic classes in forward direction and a feedback channel carrying traffic in the reverse direction from the receiver. The performances of these channels are tabulated. The feedback from the receiver is used to update a global table that maintains updated radio link conditions. The transmitting applications and <b>transmitter</b> side protocol <b>layers</b> can refer to link conditions in the status table in order to adapt their operations to suit the wireless environment prevailing at that point of time. Appropriate adaptations that can promote multimedia applications are performed. The underlying idea in providing adaptation is that the user can compromise a brief quality degradation rather than cause an abrupt shutdown of the service. The simulation results and the adaptation effects on the user experience are presented in later chapters. Experimental results are very encouraging and show that supporting multimedia applications on wireless devices is not too far from reality. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
