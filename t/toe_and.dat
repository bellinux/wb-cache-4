5|$|After the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman to {{a one-year}} {{contract}} in August 2002, Mitchell was demoted to the fourth wide receiver behind Pinkston, Thrash, and Freeman. Mitchell mainly contributed on special teams for the Eagles throughout the 2002 season. In the first fifteen weeks of the season, Mitchell caught {{a total of six}} passes for 53yards as a backup. Against the Cowboys in week sixteen, Pinkston left the game due to turf <b>toe,</b> <b>and</b> Mitchell caught two passes for 17yards in his place. Mitchell started in place of Pinkston in the last regular season game against the Giants on December 28, and led the team in receiving with four catches for 35yards.|$|E
5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing his <b>toe</b> <b>and</b> covering it up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Tinker {{had serious}} health {{problems}} in his later life. Complications of diabetes mellitus and Bright's disease left Tinker near death in 1936, when his physician believed he had 24 hours to live, and 1944, when he was placed in an oxygen tent. However, he returned to health and scouted minor league players for the Boston Braves in 1946. Tinker developed an infection relating to diabetes that in 1947 required the amputation of a <b>toe</b> <b>and</b> persisted until his left leg above the knee was amputated as well. Tinker died at Orange Memorial Hospital in Orlando on July 27, 1948, his 68th birthday, of complications from diabetes. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery and survived by his four children.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Cau et al. reconsidered {{the ecology}} of Balaur again in their reevaluation of its phylogenetic position, arguing that if Balaur was an avialan, it would be phylogenetically {{bracketed}} by taxa {{known to have been}} herbivorous, such as Sapeornis and Jeholornis. This suggests a non-hypercarnivorous lifestyle to be a more parsimonious conclusion and supports Cau's initial interpretations of its specializations. This is also indicated by the reduced third finger, the lack of a gynglymoid lower articulation of the second metatarsal and the rather small and moderately recurved second toe claw. Balaur had a broad pelvis, a broad foot, a large first <b>toe,</b> <b>and</b> broad lower ends of the metatarsals relative to the articulation surfaces; such a combination can in the remainder of the Theropoda only be found with the herbivorous Therizinosauridae.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death {{reached the}} King and Anne, who were overjoyed. The {{following}} day, Henry and Anne wore yellow, {{the symbol of}} joy and celebration in England, from head to <b>toe,</b> <b>and</b> celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow was the colour of mourning, in addition to black. For this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne {{may have been a}} symbol of mourning. With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but of cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present a neglected, unclassifiable case that {{involved}} a central type polydactyl adult with 7 <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> metatarsals, 4 cuneiforms and 1 cuboid. A 22 year-old male soldier with a right polydactyl was referred to our hospital. He suffered from the need of excessively wide-shoes and occasional shoe irritation. He was evaluated with plain radiography and 3 D tomography. The patient had central-type polydactyl with 7 <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> metatarsals, and 4 cuneiforms and 1 cuboid. Ankles and hind feet were completely normal. All toes were capable of tendon flexion and extension. His medical and family history was unremarkable. We planned to excise the excessive <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> metatarsals, but the patient denied the surgery. We present a very rare case with a central polydactyl having 7 <b>toes</b> <b>and</b> metatarsals, 4 cuneiforms and 1 cuboid.

5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paran√° maneuver, <b>toe</b> <b>and</b> foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
