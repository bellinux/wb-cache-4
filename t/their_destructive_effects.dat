The only study available suggests that the female wasps lay their eggs in eucalypt flowers (Drake 1974). After hatching, each small larva tunnel down into the developing seeds and gradually consume the content of a seed. The larva goes through several instars and the pupa develops within the seed coat. Fully-grown adult wasps emerge from the seed coat through a circular exit hole, and then exit through the top or side of the capsule usually before it opens.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is a study}} of the changing vulnerability of three towns in the Wadi Hadhramaut, Yemen, to flash flooding. The predominant construction material of the towns, Seiyun, Shibam and Tarim, is the sun-dried mud-brick, a seemingly unpractical choice in an area where floods are expected annually. However, until recently, the vulnerability of the towns to flooding has been limited. The majority of the flood events in the Wadi Hadhramaut have caused little destruction within the towns, the damage being manifested in the collapse of a few houses. Reconstruction of damage caused by flooding has remained within the capability of the communities.

The town planning principles of building on high ground and controlling flood waters have been affected by the pressing need to find more land on which to house the growing population. House construction has taken place at the edges of the flood channels. Agricultural lands that once absorbed flood waters have been developed into residential areas. Large suburbs have been developed in areas prone to inundation during major floods. These trends, coupled with the disruption caused by government intervention in community co-operation, have substantially increased the likelihood of a major flash flood causing a disaster in any one of these three towns...|$|R
40|$|Both hidden terminals, {{intrinsic}} in a multi-hop wireless network, and unfairness, due to location-dependent contention and binary exponential backoff, {{have significant}} impact on the performance of the network from MAC layer perspective, and <b>their</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>effect</b> is intensified and worsened by the upper layer protocols, like routing protocol and TCP congestion control. These two problems, existing in MAC layer, are open problems that have been haunting in the research community for more than a decade. How to solve the hidden terminals and unfairness efficiently is a very important issue in ad hoc networks and WLAN. Prior research works on the hidden terminal problem in ad hoc networks are {{based on the assumption that}} the SNR requirement is rate independent. But for a given digital modulation scheme, it is Eb/No (where Eb is the energy per bit, and No is the noise power spectral density) that should be kept relatively a constant, and the SNR requirement must change with rates. We show that because of this assumption, all the derived results and conclusions will be put in doubt. We correct this problem and present a new analytical model for the hidden terminal problem. Based on the insights provided by the new analysis, we propose a simple, yet efficient, scheme to eliminate hidden terminals in ad hoc networks. The new method requires no protocol changes from the 802. 11 standard. The NS 2 -based simulations proof our analysis and the effectiveness of the scheme proposed. In Chapter 3, unfairness is addressed from transmission power control perspective. Differ from previous research to leverage the potential of power control to increase a network's traffic carrying capacity or reduce the energy consumption, we show that power control can also significantly improve the fairness performance at MAC layer with help from receiver side. A new receiver-assisted power control MAC protocol (RAPC) is presented to exploit this gain. The NS- 2 based simulations and performance comparisons show that our approach significantly improves the fairness performance while maintain comparable throughput performance as that in original 802. 11 MAC...|$|R

40|$|Through the {{industrial}} revolution of the last 250 years, trace gases have {{had a significant impact}} on the climate. Of particular relevance to this work are species which facilitate the destruction of stratospheric ozone. In this thesis, I focus on four of these species. Understanding the release, reaction and transport pathways of the man-made chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) could help us to mitigate <b>their</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>effect.</b> Previous studies have found that both source and sink processes significantly alter the isotopic composition of trace gases (e. g. N 2 O and CFC- 12). Measuring these changes can be used to better constrain the interaction of these gases with the atmosphere. Atmospheric histories of δ(37 Cl) and δ(13 C) in CFC- 11, CFC- 12 and CFC- 113 are presented, covering the last 20 – 60 years. Air samples came from Greenland (NEEM) and Antarctic (Fletcher Promontory) polar firn, with additional samples taken from an archive of Southern Hemispheric background air (Cape Grim, Tasmania). This study extends the novel approach to measuring trace gas isotope ratios in small air volumes (200 – 600 ml), using a single-collector gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system. Carbonyl sulphide (COS) is the principal source of sulphur in the stratosphere, where it breaks down into sulphate aerosol which catalyses the destruction of ozone. Air was extracted from Greenland (NEEM) and Antarctic (DE 08, DML (BAS) and DSS) ice core samples and analysed for COS and a range of other trace gas mole fractions. The COS measurements were affected by a previously unknown post-extraction growth effect, leading to higher than expected values. This study also presents new COS measurements in firn air from NEEM and the Southern Hemisphere (EDML, Antarctica). The observed increase and subsequent decrease largely reflects changes in anthropogenic emissions during the 20 th century. These measurements also indicate that regional and site-specific effects have a significant influence on the recorded atmospheric history of COS...|$|R
40|$|The mucosal {{epithelium}} of the {{alimentary tract}} represents {{a barrier to}} noxious and immunogenic substances within the intestinal lumen. Damage of the epithelial surface which is seen both, under physiological condition and in certain patho-physiological changes, like inflammatory bowel disease or bacterial infections. Resealing of the mucosal epithelium is accomplished by epithelial cell migration, termed restitution, cell proliferation and differentiation. Repair of the intestinal surface epithelium is regulated by various cytokines and growth factors. HIV enteropathy, which is often seen in HIV-infected patients, is histologically described by focal cell degeneration. Increased levels of cytokines are found in intestinal biopsies of HIV-infected patients. From previous studies {{it is known that}} HIV infection of immune cells leads to increased cytokine production (TNF-a, IL- 1 ß, IFN-y, IFN-a). Furthermore it is shown that this specific cytokine pattern alters barrier function in intestinal HT- 29 /B 6 cells. Apart from cytokine induced barrier defects nothing is know about the modulation of epithelial restitution. For the first time this work addressed the question which kind of effects HIV-typical cytokines have on epithelial restitution. In the present study a new method was developed, which allows a more exact measurement of the velocity of restitution than previous methods. HT- 29 /B 6 monolayers were incubated with cytokines for one day. Thereafter, a defined area of the monolayer was cut out. Two hours later the epithelium was fixed and stained using ZO- 1 and occludin antibodies to visualize the tight junctions. The extent to which the gap was closed was measured and from that the velocity of restitution was determined. From several studies it is known that EGF and TGF-ß 1 stimulate intestinal epithelial cell restitution. In the present report application of this cytokines promoted the velocity of restitution. TNF-a, a central mediator in immune response and inflammation, did not alter the restitution of HT- 29 /B 6 cells. The recently characterized pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 13, which is the key cytokine in an experimental model of ulcerative colitis, inhibited intestinal cell migration. This effect might contribute to the epithelial barrier dysfunction seen in ulcerative colitis. The cytokine production in the intestinal mucosa of HIV patients is altered. These HIV-typical cytokines were tested in the restitution experiment. IFN-y as well as IFN-a did not alter the velocity of cell migration. IL- 1 ß, a proinflammatory cytokine, stimulated the restitution, and the same did the combination of TNF-a and IFN-y. Finally, the combination of HIV-typical cytokines (TNF-a, IL- 1 ß, IFN-y, IFN-a) was applied at a concentration found to be produced by HIV-infected immune cells. They enhanced the velocity of the epithelial restitution. In summary, these results indicate that the combination of HIV-typical cytokines stimulate the intestinal epithelial restitution and thereby counteract <b>their</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>effect</b> on mucosal epithelium...|$|R
