2500|$|While at {{the head}} of AMC, Chapin spearheaded the {{acquisition}} of Jeep from the Kaiser Motors Division of Kaiser Industries in 1970. According to Chapin: [...] "Perhaps the easiest decision I ever made was the purchase of Jeep from Kaiser in 1970. I tried to buy it when George Romney (later Michigan governor) and Roy Abernethy were running AMC. Romney and Edgar Kaiser couldn't get along. I was running the international operations under Abernethy and I was following Jeep around. When they put up a plant, I followed with a Rambler plant because it worked like a charm. Where Jeep was, there were roads and gasoline. Abernethy didn't go for the idea and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I became chairman and got a little money was to buy Jeep. We got it for a song, about $75 million..." [...] American Motors' engineers and designers quickly overhauled Jeep and expanded its lineup, creating a valuable asset that attracted Renault, Chrysler, and ultimately DaimlerBenz AG.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> {{after we}} were left {{together}} alone, {{was to make a}} third attempt to get up from my seat on the sand. Mr. Franklin stopped me.|$|E
60|$|Having {{arrived at}} that valiant resolution, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to lock and bolt {{the back and}} front doors, and see to the {{security}} of every shutter in the house.|$|E
60|$|GLORIA. That is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{have heard}} you say that does you honor.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{tried to}} stop the horses, I think. They ran away after the sleigh turned over. I wanted to help and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew I went down, too." ...|$|R
60|$|HARRY. Of course I did. When I {{heard someone}} {{shouting}} in English <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> thought of was George.|$|R
60|$|I {{found out}} from the coachman, among other matters, {{that there was a}} famous fishing stream near Barkingham; and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> on {{arriving}} at the town, was to buy a rod and line.|$|E
60|$|Upon these apprehensions, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{was to go}} quite out of my knowledge, and go {{by another}} name. This I did effectually, for I went into the Mint too, took lodgings in a very private place, dressed up {{in the habit of}} a widow, and called myself Mrs. Flanders.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Longdon {{turned from}} his contemplation with a visible effort. [...] "I {{feel obliged to}} you for taking it so; it mightn't--one never knows--have amused you. As I told you there, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to ask Fernanda about the company; and when she {{mentioned}} your name I immediately said: 'Would he like me to speak to him?'" ...|$|E
60|$|When next <b>I</b> awoke <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> saw was <b>the</b> round disc of a {{sympathetic}} eyeglass, behind which was Good.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will appear next month. I {{have lots}} of orders for others too. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wrote for <b>the</b> Courier was quite successful." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{saw when}} I {{got back to}} the ship was Ransome on the quarter-deck sitting quietly on his neatly lashed sea-chest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hey! are {{you ever}} going to get up?" [...] some one yelled into my drowsy brain. I roused and opened my eyes. The yellow, {{flickering}} shadows on the wall of my tent told me that the sun had long risen. I found my companions finishing breakfast. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to look over the dogs. Shep, the black-and-white pup, was missing.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} I {{had taken it}} in, and then <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to spring up and ask how she could leave the boy still in the woman's power, to which she {{answered}} that she had walked them back to Spinney Lawn--a whole mile--and that Lady Hester could not set forth again, now that Alured had heard the conversation.|$|E
60|$|You see, the {{combination}} started this way. When I {{got up to}} Redding and had become a doctor, I looked {{around to see what}} my chances were for aiding in, the great work. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to determine what manner of doctor I was to be. Being a Connecticut farmer, I naturally consulted my farmacopia, and at once decided to become a farmeopath.|$|E
60|$|In thy {{entering}} upon my book, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> find thee wrangling with, is by corrupting my words, {{and then}} by calling me liar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait till I {{tell you}} the whole of it. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard was, that Anty had made a low ruffian, named Moylan, her agent." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When I meet a {{beautiful}} girl, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> say is 'will you marry me?'. The second <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> say is, 'how do you do?'" [...] - [...] Tommy Manville ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I began 'em afore I {{was a day}} old. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in {{this life}} was to utter an 'orrible roar, and I obsarved that {{immediately}} I got a drink; so I roared agin, an' got another. Leastwise I've bin told that I did, an' if it wasn't obsarvation as caused me for to roar w'en I wanted a drink, wot wos it?" ...|$|E
60|$|May 1st. On getting indoors last night, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> after {{striking}} a light, {{was to take}} the ragged cravat off the candles, and smooth it out on the table. I then took the end that had been in poor Mary's hand out of my writing-desk, and smoothed that out too. It matched the torn side of the cravat exactly. I put them together, and satisfied myself that there was not a doubt of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I didn't do it," [...] she continued, [...] "for there wasn't no {{soft water}} {{underneath}} {{for her to}} fall into. After we went to bed I kep' awake for a long time, bein' afraid she'd {{get up in the}} night an' turn on all the gases and smother me alive. But I fell asleep at last, an' when I woke up, early in the mornin', <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to feel for that lunertic. But she was gone!" ...|$|E
60|$|I have twice {{instructed}} the publishers {{to send you}} a book--it was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did--long before <b>the</b> proofs were finished. Write me if it is not yet done.|$|R
6000|$|We {{arrived here}} this evening. I left the cars {{with my head}} full of <b>the</b> cathedral. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> saw, on lifting my eyes, was a brown spire. Said I,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I own a cart-horse, worth {{three of}} him!" [...] said the country fellow. [...] "If this pony were mine, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> should {{do would be}} to clip his wings!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> was {{to dismiss}} my visitor, the Dutch captain, whom I {{had a great}} deal of reason to think myself {{exceedingly}} obliged to: and, first, I handsomely rewarded his men, to whom I gave four pieces of eight a man; and having waited on the captain to the ship's side, and seen him into his boat, I fired him twenty-one guns at his going off; for which he fired twenty-five when he came on board his ship.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I ain't. He's {{written a letter}} to Lord Hampstead, who has always been my friend. Hampstead wasn't going to see me treated after that fashion. Hampstead wrote, and then Ã†olus wrote,--that's Sir Boreas,--and I've seen the letter,--that is, Hampstead told me what there is in it; and I ain't to be {{dismissed}} at all. When I heard the good news <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to come as fast as my legs would carry me, and tell the girl of my heart." ...|$|E
60|$|Neither {{was this}} all: but my goods being all English manufactures, such as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things {{particularly}} valuable and desirable in the country, I found means {{to sell them}} to a very great advantage; so that I might say, I had {{more than four times}} the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the advancement of my plantation: for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I bought me a Negro slave, and ail European servant also; I mean another besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Except," [...] she declared, [...] "for {{you poor}} dears {{who have been}} hurt, that is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have seen in England which makes me realise that you are at war." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, that is arranged. Now for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{have to ask}} of you. If Mr. Rosario comes, I do {{not wish}} that message from my husband to be delivered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> was told," [...] said Lodloe, [...] "was {{that you}} were a good-hearted fellow, but the fact that your father was an Irishman had {{deprived}} your character of ballast." ...|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} an {{undefined}} feeling prevented me from going {{near the site of}} Nuflo's burnt lodge. I went there at last; and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was to go all round the fatal spot, cautiously peering into the rank herbage, as if I feared a lurking serpent; and at length, at some distance from the blackened heap, I discovered a human skeleton, and knew it to be Nuflo's. In his day he had been a great armadillo-hunter, and these quaint carrion-eaters had no doubt revenged themselves by devouring his flesh when they found him dead--killed by the savages.|$|E
60|$|After the ambassadors were gone, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> was, in the {{presence}} of all the company, and, having before had the opinion of those I brought with me, to tell my second mate how well we were all satisfied with his conduct, and to declare him captain of the ship that he was in; only demanding his solemn oath, to be under orders of the great ship, as admiral, and to carry on no separate interests from us; which he thankfully accepted, and, to give him his due, as faithfully performed, all the rest of our very long voyage, and through all our adventures.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he said, as if endeavouring {{to explain}} this to himself, [...] "you hardly knew her, I suppose. Only met once since you were kids and {{all that sort of}} thing. But I'm a pal of hers and I'm dashed upset by the whole business, I can tell you. It worries me, I mean to say. Poor girl, you know, landed on her uppers in a strange country. Well, I mean, it worries me. So <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I got here was to try to find her. That's why I came over, really, to try to find her. Apart from {{anything}} else, you see, poor old Derek is dashed worried about her." ...|$|E
60|$|As I rose {{to my feet}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> saw was <b>the</b> {{malignant}} countenance of Issus {{glaring at}} me through the heavy bars of a grated door at {{one side of the}} chamber.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh well," [...] {{said the}} new King, [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> would like is my old pipe. You 'll {{find it in the}} pocket of the ragged coat I took off." ...|$|R
50|$|I've loved Chinese screens since I was {{eighteen}} years old. I nearly fainted with joy when, entering a Chinese shop, I saw a Coromandel for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. Screens were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> bought.|$|R
