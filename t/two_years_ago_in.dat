5|$|Dixon is {{accepted}} into the lacrosse team after trying out, but gets into a fight with team member George Evans (Kellan Lutz). Annie tells Dixon of her invitation to Naomi's party, and how she saw Ethan cheating on Naomi. The next day at school, Annie finds out that Silver made a video blog about her, depicting her as a bitchy farmer. Annie confronts Silver, who felt insulted by Annie's decision {{to hang out with}} Naomi. When Silver is reprimanded by her half-sister, Kelly, she realizes that she shouldn't reprimand Annie for what happened between her and Naomi in the past. Elsewhere, Ethan is forced by his team members to lie that Dixon started the fight during, and he is subsequently kicked off the team. Annie argues with Ethan because of his lying, and asks what happened to the Ethan that she met <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>In</b> class, Naomi reads an exact copy of Annie's paper. Afterward, when Annie confronts Naomi, she apologizes by giving Annie an $800 dress. Annie decides to watch the school play rehearsals, and Silver apologizes for the video by asking the drama teacher to let Annie sing with the chorus for the play. Much to Adrianna's dismay, Annie is allowed to be in the play. Naomi again gets into trouble when Harry discovers that she cheated, and forces her to write the paper in his office. Ethan has a fight with George and tells the truth, resulting in Dixon being allowed to play on the team. Dixon tells Annie that he feels horrible, as he sent a text message to Naomi telling her that Ethan is cheating on her.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 Mary Collison died - {{together}} Mary and Reginald Collison {{had spent}} their last years as caretakers of the temple. That summer Ugandan Bahá'ís held their first national youth conference and elected a national assembly just for Uganda - the first members were: Enos Epyeru, Javan Gutosi, S. M. lsimai, Moses Senoga, Julias Nambafu, Augustin Massati, Augustin Naku, and Albert Ocamodek. On the Presidency of Idi Amin in August, the Bahá'ís {{were among those}} invited to {{a meeting with the}} President. At the meeting the Bahá'ís offered a statement outlining the basic principle of the religion of obedience to government. At a follow-up meeting, Enoch Olinga represented the community at the close of a number of sessions of Religious Conferences that took place across Uganda. Soon afterwards, Músá Banání died in September after suffering a long illness and was buried on grounds of the temple in a new Bahá'í cemetery. The funeral gathered together three Hands of the Cause: Enoch Olinga, A. Q. Faizi, Ruhiyyih Khanum; a member of The Universal House of Justice, Ali Nakbjavani, Violette Nakhjavani and their daughter, Bahiyyih, whose wedding took place <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> Kampala to Paul Adams many other Bahá'í leaders from across Africa as well as six members of the National Spiritual Assembly of Uganda; and many other Baha'is from all over Uganda and other parts of Africa. Pioneers like Zylpha Mapp served development interests in Uganda in 1971-2 while working as a director of guidance at the Tororo Girls' School. She was on a leave of absence from the public school system from her work in the States, and was cooperating with the Uganda Ministry of Education in developing a guidance program in other schools of the nation while also began editing the Ugandan National Baha'i Newsletter. Later in 1971 then President Amin attended the celebration of the birth of Bahá'u'lláh and made complimentary remarks about the religion. These and others worked with university researchers on mental health issues as well. Efforts inside the community included noting the importance of Bahá'í elections as part of a worldwide initiative called for by the Universal House of Justice. Other projects in 1971-2 for Uganda included beautification of the cemetery, spreading the religion, and multiple youth gatherings. In 1972 Bahá'í Dwight W. Allen won an Award of Merit for helping in the establishment of the Tororo Girls' School which was transitioned to administration by the Ugandan government. Enoch Olinga's daughter Florence began attending the Tororo school in 1972 while other youth began making trips to various communities in support of Bahá'í activities. In 1973 Enoch Olinga and his wife both spoke at the Tororo School while the school also had visits from other leaders of the religion. In 1975-6 the Olingas toured parts of Uganda as well as having talks with government officials on the teachings of the religion with some of their travels covered by announcements by radio. Meanwhile, a public exhibit on the religion was held at the national museum which was covered by the now renamed Voice of Uganda national newsletter as well as examine Bahá'í teachings. 1975 was the silver anniversary of the religion in Uganda and a celebration, commemorating it was concluded with a program in observance of United Nations Day and a reception of high-ranking official guests from other Ghana and the UN, and members of the religion who had come from some villages. In 1976 Zylpha Mapp-Robinson, the daughter of the first African-American woman Bahá'í, who had pioneered in many places and who lived in Uganda nine years, was elected to the national spiritual assembly of Uganda in 1976. In June 1977 a small conference of leaders of the religion including the Olingas was held to discuss the progress of the growth of the religion. It was unusual in that even though just 52, 13 of whom were youth, were at the meeting, they received a message from the Universal House of Justice. Enoch Olinga reminded the group that Shoghi Effendi had called the Ugandan community the spiritual heart of Africa. In September the administrative institutions of the religion had been disbanded by the government along with over two dozen other groups. Soon the Uganda-Tanzania War broke out in 1978 and President Amin was overthrown by early 1979.|$|E
500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|E

2500|$|Major's {{verdict on}} the ERM {{was that it}} was the {{medicine}} that cured Britain of inflation; [...] "it hurt but it worked." [...] Speaking a few days after Black Wednesday, the Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, argued that [...] "the decision to join the ERM <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> the circumstances; that, having joined, we were right to endeavour to stick it out; and that, in the circumstances which evolved, we were right to withdraw." [...] Lamont's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain's inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain's membership was undoubtedly correct; [...] "the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do." [...] Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain's membership of the ERM, has written, [...] "although it was certainly a political disaster, the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our macro-economic performance." ...|$|E
