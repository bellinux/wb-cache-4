5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. They noted the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra. They also felt that the later <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> album were notably weaker than the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not stray far from the source material, and that several of the track choices did not seem to fit as well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1867 {{as part of}} the Great Northern Railway's line between Finsbury Park and Edgware stations. As part of London Underground's only {{partially}} completed Northern Heights plan, the station was completely rebuilt with additional <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s. Northern line trains started serving the station in 1939 and main line passenger services ended in 1941.|$|E
5|$|There are two diamond {{crossovers}} {{near this}} station: one {{is located at}} the eastern end, for eastbound trains, and the other {{is located at the}} western end, for westbound trains. Each switch allow trains to cross-over between the local and express <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction. There is a punch box located at the eastern end of the Jamaica-bound platform, allowing trains to continue along the Queens Boulevard line to 179th Street or to switch to the IND Archer Avenue Line.|$|E

5|$|A few {{copies of}} the {{original}} pressing of the LP with the four deleted tracks have turned up over the years, despite Columbia's supposed destruction of all copies during the pre-release phase (all copies found were in the standard album sleeve with the revised track selection). Other permutations of the Freewheelin album include versions with a different running order of the tracks on the album, and a Canadian version of the album that listed the <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong order. The original pressing of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is considered the most valuable and rarest record in America, with one copy having sold for $35,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} at Wave Aid, Silverchair reunited and by late 2005 began preparations {{for their next}} studio album, Young Modern. Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided to use them for Silverchair. In 2006, after five weeks practice the group demoed <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hunter Region, and then recorded at Los Angeles' Seedy Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer. Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band – they travelled to Prague to record with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The group also used Mac, Luke Steele (The Sleepy Jackson) and Julian Hamilton (The Presets, The Dissociatives) – Hamilton also co-wrote songs with Johns. Silverchair self-funded the album's production to ease the pressures faced previously when working with a record label.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway {{as part of}} the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided {{that the best way to}} do this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected, so instead Wehrmach started laying railway <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets in Trondheim. They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen Station and then follow Sandgata and Olav Tryggvasons gate, cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up Innherredsveien before reaching the Meråker Line at Lademoen Station. However, by German capitulation on 8 May 1945, construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate.|$|E

5|$|Each squad {{member in}} Mass Effect 2 had music {{composed}} for them, intended to convey their character; BioWare gave the composers detailed character studies for each to help. Tali's theme {{was created by}} Jimmy Hinson, who had generally made game remixes beforehand. Hinson worked {{from his home in}} Tennessee and made his pieces using FL Studio 9. Although they were given full access to the game's content, Hinson chose to avoid looking beyond what he absolutely needed to look at to write the tracks, due to wanting to experience the game fresh upon its release. In addition to Tali, Hinson also wrote tracks for Samara and Grunt, as well as various other <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
5|$|Neversoft's Brian Bright {{revealed}} {{that the use of}} Guitar Hero guitar controllers within DJ Hero arose when they tried to create mixes of guitar-heavy and rock <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game; they felt something was missing in these mixes and added in the Guitar Hero-style of play alongside it. Bright has stated that, while too late for the planned release of Guitar Hero 5, they are looking towards future instrument controller interoperability, including use of the DJ Hero controller into gameplay for future Guitar Hero titles, or using drum controllers within DJ Hero.|$|E
5|$|The Circle {{line and}} District line share <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sub-surface station. It was opened as Paddington (Praed Street) by the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) on 1 October 1868 {{when the company}} opened a branch from its main route between Hammersmith and Moorgate Street. The branch ran southwards to Brompton (Gloucester Road) and was planned {{as part of the}} Inner Circle, a {{circuitous}} route being constructed in conjunction with the District Railway (DR, now the District line) that was intended to link most of the capital's mainline stations. The extension was constructed mostly in shallow tunnels using the cut-and-cover technique. Services were provided by both the MR and the DR, with each company running Inner Circle trains over the other's tracks.|$|E

5|$|The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) which {{split from}} the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949, {{inherited}} the anti-Hindi policies of its parent organisation. DMK's founder Annadurai had earlier {{participated in the}} anti-Hindi imposition agitations during 1938–40 and in the 1940s. In July 1953, the DMK launched an agitation for changing {{the name of a}} town – Dalmiapuram – to Kallakudi. They claimed that the town's name (after Ramkrishna Dalmia) symbolised the exploitation of South India by the North. On 15 July 1953, M. Karunanidhi (later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) and other DMK members erased the Hindi name in Dalmiapuram railway station's name board and lay down on the <b>tracks.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> altercation with the Police that followed the protests, two DMK members lost their lives and several others including Karunanidhi and Kannadhasan were arrested.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Village {{for housing}} athletes {{during the games}} {{would have been a}} $1.1-billion series of newly {{constructed}} lakefront buildings that would have been converted to rental and condominium units after the games. The village was to be located immediately south of McCormick Place, which was expected to host 11 event venues, on a current truck parking lot between South Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central Railroad <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Near South Side and Douglas community areas. At the time, the parking lot was being used to stage events at McCormick Place. The village was slated to have pedways over Lake Shore Drive. This location was meant to enable 88% of the Olympic athletes to be within 15 minutes of their competition venue.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} changed radically {{during the}} early morning hours of 7 February. The Americans had forewarning of NVA armor in the area from Laotian refugees from camp BV-33. SOG Reconnaissance teams also reported finding tank <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area surrounding Co Roc mountain. Although the NVA was known to possess two armored regiments, it had not yet fielded an armored unit in South Vietnam, and besides, the Americans considered it impossible for them to get one down to Khe Sanh without it being spotted by aerial reconnaissance.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 2007, Rippy had {{completed}} all of the gameplay music, including end credits, battle themes, and ambient world <b>tracks.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> game's skirmish mode, the music reflects the environment rather than the warring factions. To ensure that {{the character of the}} music changed depending on the environment, he followed self-imposed rules; one environment could feature guitars, but not piano, for instance. To musically unify each world, he added a short introductory piece containing common elements. In contrast with the skirmish mode, the campaign mode contains different recurring melodies for each major character and the human ship Spirit of Fire. Rippy's most intensive work period was January 2008, when he began writing music for the game's cinematics; by this point, he had been working on the score for nine months. Rippy finished the score by February 2008, and, after three months, all tracks were ready to be recorded.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the the Erie and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie profited from the delays necessary to transfer cargo between the lines. When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the track gauge to allow through traffic, a conflict that {{became known as the}} Erie Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as an affront to their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and tore up railroad <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city in an effort to prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of the Erie and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and the Erie and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} <b>tracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on Track 1.|$|E
