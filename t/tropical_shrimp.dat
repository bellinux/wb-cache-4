Therefore, microbiological, sensory, and chemical changes of naturally contaminated tropical brackish water shrimp (Penaeus notialis) during storage at 28 °C, 7 °C and 0 °C were assessed. H 2 S-producing bacteria were the dominant group of microorganisms at 28 °C and 7 °C whereas Pseudomonas spp. were dominant at 0 °C. Total volatile basic nitrogen and trimethylamine correlated well (R 2 > 0. 90) with the sensory scores.

40|$|The Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the best way to manage our living marine resources. While traditional fisheries management focuses on the populations of the target species, an EAF recognizes the complexity of ecosystems in which fisheries operate. Crucial aspects of an EAF are therefore (1) trophic relations between target species, their prey and predators, (2) indirect interactions between fleets - through trophic links and bycatch - and (3) the impact of fishing on marine habitats and species communities. Ignoring these elements in fisheries management lies at the core of different environmental and socio-economic problems, particularly in <b>tropical</b> <b>shrimp</b> fisheries. Triggered by a negative public perception and increasing consumer demand for sustainable products, the fishery for seabob shrimp in Suriname launched a sustainability initiative, resulting in certification by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). This eco-label, however, was not an endpoint, but formed the basis for further improvements and was the direct motivation for this doctoral study. In cooperation with the local fisheries administration, the fishing industry, NGOs and the local university, research was conducted on the coastal ecosystem in Suriname, until recently virtually a blind spot for marine biologists. First, we investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of fish and invertebrates in the coastal waters. A second important element was the characterization of the role of seabob shrimp in the marine food web. Thirdly, this study focused on assessing the impact of seabob fisheries on the coastal ecosystem, by examining the composition of commercial catches. The scientific results were translated into recommendations to further support an ecosystem approach to the management of the Suriname seabob fishery.

40|$|Numerous {{freshwater}} {{species are}} consumed or exploited through artisanal fisheries in the rivers {{of the islands}} of Guadeloupe, French West Indies. Autochthonous production of organic matter is limited in these flowing rivers and is mainly represented by scarce filamentous green algae and an abundant epilithic biofilm growing on wet stones in the river bed. Stable isotope {{analysis was used to}} quantify the relative importance of biofilm and other riverine allochthonous and autochthonous food sources in the diet of <b>tropical</b> <b>shrimps</b> (Palaemonidae, Atyidae and Xiphocarididae) and fishes (Gobiidae and Eleotridae) consumed by the local people. The epilithic biofilm was exploited by most species, constituted an important source of autochthonous carbon and was an important source of organic matter production at the base of freshwater food webs in Caribbean rivers. Biofilm percentages in the diet reached 32 % for molluscs, 85 % for atyid shrimps, 29 % for xiphocaridid shrimps, 14 % for palaemonid shrimps and 13 % for fish. Assessment of biofilm in nine rivers showed that blue and red cyanobacteria were quantitatively dominant with a moderately rich diatom flora.

40|$|International {{environmental}} and social concerns about <b>tropical</b> <b>shrimp</b> production {{have led to the}} emergence of private transnational governance and regulation.

The rise of these various schemes has also been part of a shift from quantitative to qualitative policy goals within the Vietnamese aquaculture sector. In turn, this has led to new internal relationships, most notably the repositioning of private interests and community-based management within the Vietnamese state framework. We conclude that the ongoing transformation of the government’s role in environmental shrimp governance requires mechanisms that foster improved participation and compliance between the state and private actors. To achieve this efforts are needed to better include local government at both communal and village levels and to use existing global market incentives more strategically. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{focuses on}} quality and safety {{management}} of <b>tropical</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Penaeus spp.) using Benin (West Africa) {{as an example}} of a shrimp exporting country. The entire supply chain, from fishing areas (brackish waters) to shrimp processing plants, was investigated. The steps of the chain prior to shrimp processing at the freezer plants were critical for shrimp quality and safety because of prevailing temperature abuse and inappropriate hygienic conditions. Combining culture-dependent (plate counts) and culture independent (DGGE, clone libraries analysis) approaches, it was found that bacterial concentration in shrimps was higher than that of their surrounding water and sediment. Conversely, bacterial diversity was higher in water or sediment than in shrimps. At species level, distinct bacterial communities were associated with sediment, water or shrimp samples. Spoilage evaluation of shrimps showed that during storage at 0 ºC, Pseudomonas spp. were dominant, whereas at 7 ºC and 28 ºC, H 2 S-producing bacteria were the dominant group of microorganisms. An empirical model predicting shrimp shelf-life as a function of constant storage temperature was developed. Isolates producing strong off-odor were identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing as mainly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Enterobacteriaceae at 28 ºC or 7 ºC and Pseudomonas spp. and LAB (Carnobacterium maltaromaticum) at 0 ºC. The fastest growing isolates namely, Pseudomonas psychrophila and C. maltaromaticum were selected for their spoilage activity and for modeling studies. P. psychrophila had a higher growth rate and a higher spoilage activity at 0 to 15 ºC, while at 28 ºC, C. maltaromaticum had a higher growth rate. Models predicting the growth of pseudomonads in shrimps as a function of temperature were constructed. These models were validated under dynamic storage temperatures simulating actual temperature fluctuation in the supply chain. Using different risk classification approaches, the main foodborne pathogen risks identified were Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella. The management of the risks posed by the main pathogens was addressed using different scenarios to meet the set food safety objectives. Based on quantitative and ecological studies, this thesis developed tools that can be used in decision-making regarding <b>tropical</b> <b>shrimp</b> quality and safety management.  ...|$|E

Occasional data are given for Macrobrachium carcinus and an atyid shrimp, Potimirim potimirim. Size was {{measured}} as total body length (TBL), carapace length (CL), and telson length (TL), weight as dry weight (W), and realized fecundity as number of eggs per female. Size and W of eggs were determined {{in an early}} stage of development. Relationships between measurements of size, weight, and fecundity are described with regression equations. Significant species- and sex-specific variation was found in the slopes of the allometric TBL-W relationship. In the 2 species of Palaemon, females grew to a larger size than males; they showed also a steeper W increase with increasing TBL. Opposite patterns were observed in M. acanthurus and M. olfersii, suggesting different traits on the generic level. The minimum sexable size (minimum size of males with appendix masculina) was unrelated to the species-specific maximum size. Size at the onset of female maturity (minimum size with eggs) was larger in M. acanthurus than in the other species (29 versus 20 - 22 mm); W at the onset of female maturity increased with the maximum size of a species. Regressions of egg number on TBL indicated the highest overall level as well as the strongest size-dependence of fecundity in M. olfersii; these parameters were lowest in P. pandaliformis.

40|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{aquaculture}} is in a disease-induced {{crisis of}} lost production. The {{response to this}} crisis currently focuses on microbiology and pathology, quarantine, and transboundary transfer of shrimp. The crisis also involves an interaction between shrimp genetics and various human interests including protection of intellectual property. Breeders of high-quality strains generally employ (and are encouraged to employ) some form of breeder lock that generates inbreeding when broodstocks are copied. Smaller hatcheries sell these copied, inbred shrimp to farmers, who thereby {{increase the likelihood of}} losing their crops to disease. The joint behavior of breeders, hatcheries and farmers causes inbreeding to accumulate in tropical regions. The depressive effect of inbreeding on disease resistance is exceptionally strong in shrimp, as shown in a re-analysis of published field and experimental data. Inbreeding increases the severity and frequency of disease through a variety of mechanisms. We have relatively few, marker-based estimates of accumulated inbreeding in any non-pedigreed shrimp aquaculture system. Simulation shows, however, that locked post larvae (PLs) can be distinguished from copies in broodstocks and farm ponds, given appropriate analysis of genetic markers. Culture of stocks certified to be free of specified pathogens (specific pathogen free or SPF stocks) is strongly recommended and only SPF stocks can now be legally imported into most jurisdictions. These recommendations are appropriate, beneficial and necessary. But insofar as they increase the commercial value of proprietary genetic strains, such regulations may also increase the likelihood of copying, and thus inbreeding at farm level and ever-increasing susceptibility to disease and climate stress (Doyle, 2014 a). The intellectual property value of disease-resistant strains will be extremely high and intellectual property rights are fundamental to science-based economic innovation. Breeders will, and must, continue to protect their genetic improvement programs with genetic locks, especially in regions where judicial sanctions are ineffective. The regulatory objective should be to encourage biosecurity and genetic progress while discouraging copying and consequent inbreeding. The current consensus that inbreeding is unimportant may therefore be out of date. Inbreeding may be amplifying the severity of diseases (including the major current threats: white spot syndrome virus or WSSV, infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus or IHHNV and early mortality syndrome or EMS (acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease or AHPND). Continuing to ignore the interaction between inbreeding and disease may become a fatal error for <b>tropical</b> <b>shrimp</b> aquaculture...|$|E

In {{much of the}} Caribbean, eusocial species have dominated the diverse fauna of sponge-dwelling shrimp in coral rubble {{for at least the}} past two decades. Here we document a recent, dramatic decline and apparent local extinction of eusocial shrimp species on the Belize Barrier Reef. Our collections from shallow reefs in central Belize in 2012 failed to locate three of the four eusocial species formerly abundant in the area, and showed steep declines in colony size and increases in frequency of queenless colonies prior to their disappearance. Concordant with these declines, several nonsocial, pair-forming Synalpheus species increased in frequency. The decline in eusocial shrimp is explained in part by disappearance of two sponge species on which they specialize. Eusocial shrimp collections from Jamaica in 2012 showed similar patterns of decline in colony size and increased queenlessness compared with prior Jamaican collections. The decline and local extinction of eusocial shrimp happened against a backdrop of changes in coral assemblages during recent decades, and may reflect changes in abundance and quality of dead coral substratum and succession of the diverse cryptic organisms living within it.

Projections for increasing global demand for seafood {{in the face of}} level or declining fisheries requires continued expansion and intensification of aquaculture while ensuring best utilisation of captured stocks. Furthermore, continued pressure from consuming nations to ensure safe products for human consumption are being augmented by additional legislative requirements for animals (and their products) to be of low disease status.

40|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{fisheries}} {{are characterized}} by various interactions with their natural environment and with other fisheries.

40|$|Marine sponges are {{frequently}} inhabited {{by a wide}} range of associated invertebrates, including caridean shrimps. Symbiotic shrimps are often considered to be commensals; however, in most cases, the relationship with sponge hosts remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that sponge-inhabiting shrimps are often parasites adapted to consumption of sponge tissues. First, we provide detailed examination of morphology and stomach contents of Typton carneus (Decapoda: Palaemonidae: Pontoniinae), a West Atlantic <b>tropical</b> <b>shrimp</b> living in fire sponges of the genus Tedania. Remarkable shear-like claws of T. carneus show evidence of intensive shearing, likely the result of crushing siliceous sponge spicules. Examination of stomach contents revealed that the host sponge tissue is a major source of food for T. carneus. A parasitic mode of life is also reflected in adaptations of mouth appendages, in the reproduction strategy, and in apparent sequestration of host pigments by shrimp. Consistent results were obtained also for congeneric species T. distinctus (Western Atlantic) and T. spongicola (Mediterranean). The distribution of shrimps among sponge hosts (mostly solitary individuals or heterosexual pairs) suggests that Typton shrimps actively prevent colonisation of their sponge by additional conspecifics, thus protecting their resource and reducing the damage to the hosts. We also demonstrate feeding on host tissues by sponge-associated shrimps of the genera Onycocaris, Periclimenaeus, and Thaumastocaris (Pontoniinae) and Synalpheus (Alpheidae). The parasitic mode of life appears to be widely distributed among sponge-inhabiting shrimps. However, it is possible that under some circumstances, the shrimps provide a service to the host sponge by preventing a penetration by potentially more damaging associated animals. The overall nature of interspecific shrimp-sponge relationships thus warrants further investigation...|$|E

The interviews also elicited new knowledge on effort and valuable components of bycatch, useful to the management process. Among the problems facing the Gulf of California fishery, fishers tended to identify those generated externally [...] fluctuations in shrimp populations, increases in fishing effort, decreases in shrimp prices and increasing overheads [...] and thus distance themselves from responsibility for management options. The successes of any mitigation measures for the fishery are likely to depend on proper enforcement and reliable governance, as our study indicates. Should strong enforcement be put in place, then trawl free areas seem to be the most pragmatic way to alleviate problems associated with the fishery; our effort data point to areas that might have greatest acceptance among fishers. A reduction in capacity would clearly complement marine zoning for trawl free areas. In the long run, however, it may be economic extinction of the fishery that reduces pressure on the marine ecosystem.

40|$|The {{protective}} {{activity of}} a non-bacteriocinogenic Lactococcus piscium CNCM I- 4031 strain against Listeria monocytogenes {{was investigated in}} <b>tropical</b> cooked peeled <b>shrimp</b> stored at 8 °C in modified atmosphere packaging (50 % N 2 – 50 % CO 2). When inoculated alone (L. piscium 107 CFU g- 1 and L. monocytogenes 104 CFU g- 1), protective culture and target strain grew very well on shrimp reaching a maximum cell number of 109 CFU g- 1 after 7 and 14 days, respectively. In the presence of L. piscium, growth of L. monocytogenes was totally prevented after 3 days of storage. The count was 3. 4 log CFU g- 1 lower than in the control after 10 days and {{until the end of}} storage (31 days). Using the Seafood Spoilage and Safety Predictor Software ([URL] it was shown that pH decrease from 6. 58 to 5. 94 and lactic acid concentration of 89. 65 mM measured in the co-inoculated batch did not fully explain the inhibition observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} relations of reproductive parameters (sex and maturity) and seasonality with the accumulation of total mercury in a <b>tropical</b> marine <b>shrimp</b> species (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) from the north of Rio de Janeiro State, SE, Brazil. These coastal region suffers the influence of the Paraíba do Sul river water discharge. Shrimp samples were monthly collected between and separated by sex and maturity phases. The organisms suffer a specific strong acid digestion (method). Total mercury was analyzed in the extracts {{with the help of an}} ICP-EAS with a vapor generating accessory (VGA 77). The studied shrimp species presented an average total Hg concentration of 0. 036 μg. g- 1. A significant difference was observed between the rainy (spring/summer 0. 029 μg. g- 1) and the dry period (autumn/winter 0. 039 μg. g- 1) (p< 0. 05). The above mentioned results are in accordance with previous studies that described the total Mercury dynamics and transport in the lower RPS drainage basin as well as its estuarine area. Between sex there was no statistical significant difference observed, although a statistical significant difference was observed between the females in distinct maturation states (p< 0. 05), where the mature females presented higher Hg concentrations (0. 043 μg. g- 1). The total mercury values observed in the present study was always under the maximum values permitted for human consumption determined by Brazilian Authorities, therefore there is no health risk associated with the consumption of this species by human populations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the use of {{freshwater}} animals in biology lessons. It especially provides detailed instructions for school experiments and observations of these animals, which can be bred in a freshwater aquarium at school. Manuals have worksheets for pupils and are anter keys. Each worksheet has got guidance for teachers, which contains specific instructions for the preparation of observation and experimentation and also gives some additional information. Individual worksheets are focused on representatives of cold water and <b>tropical</b> freshwater fish, <b>shrimp</b> and crayfish. A considerable part of the worksheets is devoted to our invertebrates, which can be caught in nature, and placed into the aquarium for a limited period, so there we can see the experiments and observations of some aquatic larvae of insects, flatworms, bugs, beetles, molluscs, annelids and arthropods. It also includes information about the various representatives used in the worksheets, such as {{a brief description of the}} animal and its demands for breeding. There are also instructions on how to obtain these animals. This thesis also contains practical manuals onwhere to place the aquarium in the classroom and how to manage and maintain it because this work is conceived as a handbook for teachers of biology, who have no [...] ...|$|R
