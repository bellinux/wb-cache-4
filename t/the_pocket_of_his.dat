25|$|After {{the police}} arrive, Archie notices that an object has been stashed in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> topcoat. Concerned that he's being set up, Archie escapes the {{premises}} without examining the object. Back at Wolfe's house, {{the object is}} found to be a bloodstained fencing glove, in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp metal fitting that can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|E
25|$|As Langdon regains consciousness, {{he finds}} himself in a {{hospital}} located on an island. He is given the video camera which he placed in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tweed jacket. He is shocked when he hears the footage and becomes desperate {{to head back to}} the Vatican. The video shows the camerlengo branding himself with the Illuminati diamond and confessing that he himself is Janus, and who set in motion the night's chain of events in order to sabotage the Vatican. He also confesses that he killed the Pope with an overdose of heparin, a powerful anticoagulant because the Pope revealed he had fathered a child.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> glove, with his bare hand {{in order to secure}} it. The catcher, however, tries to keep his bare hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the bare hand cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|E
60|$|He stopped short, {{and thrust}} <b>his</b> hands into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> checked trousers.|$|R
60|$|He eyed me {{with one}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> blackest looks, and thrust his hands savagely into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> riding-coat.|$|R
60|$|But Ciccio vouchsafed no answer, {{and walked}} with <b>his</b> hands in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> water-proof, wincing from the weather.|$|R
500|$|A three-page {{letter was}} found in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket. The letter was never officially made public, but was leaked in November 1990 to Francine Pelletier, and {{published}} in the newspaper La Presse. In his suicide letter, Lépine claimed political motives, blaming feminists for ruining his life. He considered himself rational and expressed admiration for Denis Lortie, who had mounted {{an attack on the}} Quebec National Assembly in 1984 for political reasons, killing three Quebec government employees. The letter also contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because of their feminism. [...] Another letter, written to a friend, promised the explanation to the massacre lay by following clues left in Lépine's apartment. The hunt led only to a suitcase of computer games and hardware.|$|E
500|$|At Stonehenge, the Doctor, Amy, and River find {{a passage}} to an {{underground}} area. Inside, {{they find the}} Pandorica, a giant metal box outfitted with every type of lock imaginable. While examining the Pandorica, Amy confronts the Doctor about an engagement ring she had previously found in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket and feels a strong emotional attachment to; he says that it belonged to a [...] "friend", and that nothing is ever truly forgotten. The Pandorica is transmitting a signal amplified by Stonehenge's rocks across the universe, and River warns the Doctor that the signal is drawing [...] "everything that ever hated [...] " [...] to Earth that night. The Doctor is aided by a volunteer group of Roman legionaries; the centurion in charge of them is revealed to be Amy's fiancé, Rory. Neither Rory nor the Doctor can explain Rory's presence, as he was consumed by {{a crack in the}} universe during the events of [...] "Cold Blood" [...] and erased from existence. When Amy comes around after being knocked out by a damaged Cyberman, she does not remember Rory, which upsets him greatly. The Doctor assures Rory that Amy will remember in time, and hands him the engagement ring.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{lead story}} with the Cape Times {{published}} in 1996 she spoke about Terre'Blanche; [...] "He {{is a political}} Tyrannosaurus Rex ... a henpecked husband who has to remove his boots before he is allowed to enter his wife's pristine kitchen; a narcissist who carries a can of Fiesta hairspray in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> safari suit ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} sat forward hurriedly, felt rapidly in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat, and then {{jumped to his}} feet.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood with}} <b>his</b> hands in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great-coat, and a most amused smile upon his square-jawed, clean-shaven face.|$|R
60|$|Stumpy Nuggs carried matches, {{and quickly}} lit {{a bit of}} candle which he {{produced}} from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ragged attire.|$|R
2500|$|Wishing {{for a quiet}} holiday {{free from}} crime, Poirot goes to Rhodes during the low season in October where there {{are but a few}} guests. Aside from the young Pamela Lyall and Sarah Blake there is Valentine Chantry, a {{consciously}} beautiful woman who seems to swoon under the attentions of Douglas Gold. This is done at the expense of his own wife, Marjorie, a mildly attractive woman, and Valentine's husband Tony Chantry. This is the [...] "triangle" [...] that everyone observes, and it gets rather absurd with the two men vying for Valentine's favour. She seems to delight in the attention. Marjorie Gold soon wins the sympathy of many of the guests of the hotel as her husband is frequently in the company of Valentine, she confesses her own doubts about Valentine to Poirot. Poirot, however, warns her to flee the island if she values her life. The event comes to a head one evening, beginning when Gold and Chantry have a loud argument. Valentine and Marjorie return from a drive, and the former is poisoned by the cocktail her husband gives her. Gold is immediately suspected, as the strophanthin that kills Valentine is found in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dinner jacket. Poirot notices otherwise, seeing that Chantry puts it in Gold's pocket just as everyone's attention is on his dying wife. Poirot gives this information to the police, and points out to Pamela Lyall that she was focusing on the wrong triangle. The real triangle was between Douglas, Marjorie and Chantry. Chantry and Marjorie were in love, but they could not get married as Douglas, a Catholic, would not consent to divorce. For this reason, Chantry and Marjorie decided to kill Valentine and ensure that Douglas was blamed for the murder. Also, Poirot's warning to Marjorie Gold was not because he feared she was a victim at risk of being murdered, but the opposite. He was warning her she would be caught, tried, and convicted as one of the culprits, and be hanged for murder.|$|E
60|$|Lord Ashleigh smiled. His {{hand had}} {{disappeared}} into <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dinner-coat.|$|E
60|$|Then he felt in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{jacket and}} brought out a sixpenny-piece.|$|E
60|$|As Pep concluded, he {{suddenly}} dived into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new trousers, and, after considerable difficulty, extricated a silver dollar.|$|R
60|$|The Demon did not reply. He was busily {{forcing the}} various {{electrical}} devices that Rob had relinquished into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fiery jacket.|$|R
60|$|Button-Bright sat on {{the bench}} beside her and thrust <b>his</b> hands in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> knickerbockers. Then he {{reflected}} somewhat gravely for him.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{rose again}} to his feet, and began fumbling in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat.|$|E
60|$|From <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat he {{drew the}} letter which Blakeney had written an hour ago.|$|E
60|$|Huxter arose {{with great}} {{perturbation}} at this news, and plunged his stick into <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> paletot, and seized his hat.|$|E
50|$|The plot {{revolves}} around {{a boy who}} discovers that {{he is able to}} pull an infinite number <b>of</b> banknotes from <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jeans.|$|R
60|$|He stopped short; {{his hands}} clenched and thrust deeply downwards, {{seemed ready to}} burst <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket. A slight sigh escaped Captain Whalley.|$|R
60|$|Jorgenson, {{with his}} hands deep in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tunic, listened, looking down. Jaffir showed as much consternation as his nature was capable of.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't shoot!" [...] she cried, as Mr. Peters absent-mindedly dipped {{his hand}} into <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat. [...] "Oh, please don't shoot!" ...|$|E
60|$|Again Richard {{began to}} search, {{and this time}} {{produced}} from <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat a long and thick strip of sun-dried meat.|$|E
60|$|De Batz {{thought it}} well {{at this point}} to finger once more nonchalantly the bundle of crisp paper in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat.|$|E
25|$|Pym {{also carries}} {{a variety of}} weaponry, provisions, and {{scientific}} instruments, which are shrunken {{to the size of}} microchips and stored in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> uniform.|$|R
60|$|Bluenose {{drained the}} pot, flung a half-crown on the table, and swaggered {{out of the}} house with his hands deep in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rough pea-jacket.|$|R
60|$|Bernadine {{passed into}} the shadows and sank into a steamer chair by the side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{travelling}} companion. Peter continued his lonely walk, his hands thrust deep into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat, his eyes fixed upon the Folkestone lights, becoming every moment clearer and clearer.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think that}} d'Aguilar is this man?" [...] asked Peter, while Castell folded up {{the letter and}} hid it in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> robe.|$|E
60|$|He {{produced}} {{a copy of}} the paper from <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great-coat which hung from the door, and passed it to his bounding brother.|$|E
60|$|He paused, {{and from}} <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shabby {{trousers}} he half drew out a long, sheathed hunting-knife, {{and then quickly}} hid it again from her sight.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy did {{not stop}} to consider. He knew that every dollar the {{schooner}} brought now would go into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father, {{and that was enough}} for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll go {{back and}} be damned to it!" [...] said the captain recklessly, {{plunging}} <b>his</b> hands into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pea jacket and plumping back into his chair.|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{had already}} {{felt that there}} was some money in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> trousers, and he now handed his letter to the old woman and pulled out some gold.|$|R
