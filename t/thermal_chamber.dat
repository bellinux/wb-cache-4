In {{the present}} {{research}} and development proposal, we intend to study and develop an electronicapparatus to control the temperature of thermoelectric modules used {{in the construction of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>chamber</b> for characterization of new materials, including smart materials such as shape memory alloys among others. There are models that best describes the dynamical behavior of thermoelectric modules, and they are represented by the electric current in them. This current can be obtained by a switched power amplifier or actuator, which consists of an H-bridge, using amplifier class D, controlled by a microcontroller Arduino Due, the latter will be used to embed the joint temperature-current controller. This combination of thermoelectric modules, current amplifier and a <b>thermal</b> <b>chamber</b> is a nonlinear system, in which the dynamical analysis and control design are not well known and explored in the literature. As a consequence, a deeper knowledge is necessary to effectively design a controller to obtain arbitrary and precise temperature profiles for a proper material characterization. A stability analysis is performed for the temperature controller system in discrete time by the roots-locus method. A small <b>thermal</b> <b>chamber</b> will be constructed with the switched power amplifier driving the current in a thermoelectric module mounted on a heat sink. The controllers will be embedded in a microcontroller Arduino Due, from which the experimental results will obtained for later analysis.
