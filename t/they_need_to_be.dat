5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion {{is seen in the}} stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (seeds) {{are left in}} the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
50|$|On September 8, 2016 110 {{people were}} {{stranded}} when the cable cars stopped. <b>They</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evacuated by helicopter.|$|R
50|$|From 1830, deputies {{were elected}} for five years. <b>They</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 30 {{years old and}} to pay 500 francs in direct contributions.|$|R

5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
25|$|The Emergency Committee {{consists}} of the FIFA President {{as well as one}} member from each confederation. Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting.|$|E
25|$|Centre half-backs {{must have}} a great {{understanding}} of team structures, especially the strategies for kick-ins. <b>They</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to compete and take contested marks, and also run off their opponent to win uncontested possessions and force their opponents to chase.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the success}} in {{installing}} the listening devices, the Committee agents soon determined that <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repaired. <b>They</b> planned a second [...] "burglary" [...] {{in order to}} take care of this.|$|R
50|$|Had {{the merger}} gone ahead, these {{arrangements}} could still have <b>been</b> amended, as <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{approved by a}} vote of the remaining clubs; but when the merger was averted, the vote never went ahead.|$|R
50|$|As human territories expanded, <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> governed. Humans united {{under the}} G.E.F., or Galactic Earth Federation. At first, {{it was a}} {{peaceful}} federation. However, the G.E.F. became greedy, and began to annex planets by force.|$|R
25|$|As {{the fruits}} of Opuntia ficus-indica are delicate, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{carefully}} harvested by hand. The small spines on the fruits are removed by rubbing them on an abrasive surface or sweeping them through grass. Before consumption, they are peeled and sliced.|$|E
25|$|Only {{some kinds}} of {{couplings}} coexist {{on the end of}} a wagon at the same time, because amongst other reasons <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the same height. For example, in the Australian state of Victoria, engines had the AAR coupler, with buffers, and the chain mounted on a lug cast into the AAR coupler.|$|E
25|$|To work near power wires either {{additional}} training {{is required for}} arborists or <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Qualified Line Clearance Arborist or Utility Arborists (there may be different terminology for various countries). There is a variety of minimum distances that must be kept from power wires depending on voltage, however the common distance for low voltage lines in urban settings is 10 feet (about 3 metres).|$|E
50|$|After {{the guards}} were neutralized, the rescue force ran into another problem common in {{prisoner}} rescues: many prisoners were confused or so terribly afraid that <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forcibly removed. Others were sick {{and unable to}} walk. Nevertheless, the rescue was successful.|$|R
50|$|The single-user BASIC used several {{overlays}} {{to provide}} the full functionality of the language; when OS/8 was booted from a DECtape, a very noticeable delay occurred each time BASIC <b>was</b> required <b>to</b> switch overlays as <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read from tape.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} and mixed at Sarm East Studios in late 1975. As with [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", {{most of the}} guitar parts on the song were initially played on piano by Mercury, to demonstrate to Brian May how <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played on guitar.|$|R
25|$|Acuity {{is higher}} among male organisms that mate in mid-air, as <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to spot and assess {{potential}} mates against {{a very large}} backdrop. On the other hand, the eyes of organisms which operate in low light levels, such as around dawn and dusk or in deep water, tend to be larger {{to increase the amount}} of light that can be captured.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese legal code has no {{explicit}} {{provision for}} exile, but often dissidents are released {{on the grounds}} that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated for a medical condition in another country, and with the understanding that they will be reincarcerated if they return to China. Dissidents who have been released on medical parole include Ngawang Chophel, Ngawang Sangdrol, Phuntsog Nyidron, Takna Jigme Zangpo, Wang Dan, Wei Jingsheng, Gao Zhan and Fang Lizhi.|$|E
25|$|Global wild {{fisheries}} {{are believed}} to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help solve the problem because <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fed products from other fish. Studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon, as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them.|$|E
50|$|Bari {{was active}} in the Washington, DC community. In the early 1970s, Bari used a grant from the National Science Foundation to start a master's degree program in {{teaching}} mathematics. She felt that math teachers in DC public schools were not as well prepared as <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|R
50|$|In art, vellum {{was used}} for paintings, {{especially}} if <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent long distances, before canvas became widely used in about 1500, and continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for drawings, and watercolours. Old master prints were sometimes printed on vellum, especially for presentation copies, until at least the seventeenth century.|$|R
50|$|Shu Kido (城戸 修) and Shin Kido (城戸 信) (Shin and Shu): Joe's brother, {{a college}} student at Kyoto. He met Yolei when she is visiting Kyoto with her class. He also drove her and the others <b>to</b> where <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> when Daemon was attacking on Christmas Day.|$|R
25|$|Many other {{rites of}} passage are practiced by Shinto believers, {{and there are also}} many other festivals. The main reason for these ceremonies is so that Shinto {{followers}} can appease the kami in order to reach magokoro. Magokoro can only be received through the kami. Ceremonies and festivals are long and complex because <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perfect to satisfy the kami. If the kami are not pleased with these ceremonies, they will not grant a Shinto believer magokoro.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the issue}} of a point of {{reference}} is the issue of orientation: a displacement in 2 or 3 dimensions is not just a length, but is a length together with a direction. (This issue does not arise in 1 dimension, or rather is equivalent to the distinction between positive and negative.) Thus, to compare or combine two dimensional quantities in a multi-dimensional space, one also needs an orientation: <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compared to a frame of reference.|$|E
25|$|Most {{filters are}} built using {{a set of}} C++ classes {{provided}} in the DirectShow SDK, called the DirectShow Base Classes. These handle much of the creation, registration and connection logic for the filter. For the filter graph to use filters automatically, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> registered in a separate DirectShow registry entry {{as well as being}} registered with COM. This registration can be managed by the DirectShow Base Classes. However, if the application adds the filters manually, they {{do not need to be}} registered at all.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of collector {{was appointed by}} the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. From 1820 onward, collectors <b>were</b> limited <b>to</b> four-year commissions, {{at the end of}} which <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reappointed by the President. They could also be removed from office at any time at the pleasure of the President.|$|R

50|$|In May 2007 {{four white}} lion cubs were born at Jurques Zoo in France. The cubs {{consisted}} of one male and three females. Each cub weighed approximately 1.5 kg at birth, and all four were in good health. However, <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hand fed because {{their mother was}} not taking proper care of them.|$|R
25|$|The {{degree of}} flexing and the {{material}} constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, and <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.|$|E
25|$|By {{contrast}} with these views, some recent scholars, travelers and armchair travelers {{have tried to}} map Odysseus's travels. Modern opinions are so varied in detail that for convenience <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> classified, as do the ancient ones. This article deals first with those who believe, as did many ancient authors, that {{the hero of the}} Odyssey was driven west or south-west from Cape Malea and, more than nine years later, returned from the west to his native Ionian islands: his landfalls are therefore {{to be found in the}} western Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Captive males breed at {{five years}} of age, but wild males attain {{dominance}} much later when they are larger. In one five-year field study, only one rhino estimated to be younger than 15 years mated successfully. Captive females breed as young as four years of age, but in the wild, they usually start breeding only when six years old, which likely indicates <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> large enough to avoid being killed by aggressive males. Their gestation period is around 15.7 months, and birth interval ranges from 34–51 months.|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} lasted from the 2nd to 10 February, {{although}} the Beatles {{did not play}} on the 10th, as <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in London early on the 11th. The Beatles played two dates at the Cavern Club, Liverpool on 3 and 4 February, before joining the Shapiro tour again on the 5th.|$|R
