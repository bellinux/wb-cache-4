This paper extends their analysis to a richer setting that is capable of more closely accounting for the dynamics of the US business cycle. We find that the original conclusion survives in this setting: namely, the model requires an elasticity of real marginal cost <b>to</b> <b>ouput</b> approximately equal to the inverse intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption in order to account for the countercyclicality of the aggregate inventory-to-sales ratio in the data...|$|E
40|$|Tourism {{sector has}} a {{strategic}} role in economy {{that has been}} one of foreign exchange sources for country and that has accelerated growth to other economic sector. However, tourism is prone to changes of global economic condition in which could affect Indonesian toursim demand as shown by number of tourism inbound. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the change of GNP per capita and relative price; and impact <b>to</b> <b>ouput</b> and income in Indonesia economy. Two-stepanalysis were employed to reach the objectives. The first step is using dynamic panel Error Correction Model to estimate the impact of GNP per capita and relative price to tourism demand in short-run and long-run. The second step is using Input–Output analysis to analyze the impact of the change of tourist’s expenditure due to change of GNP per capita and relative price <b>to</b> <b>ouput</b> and income in Indonesia economy, especially tourism sector. The results showed that both in the long-run and short-run, GNP per capita and relative price affected Indonesia tourism demand significantly. The decrease in per capita and the increase in relative price decrease tourism demand due to bearing for tourists' expenditure. Furthermore, the decrease induces a decline in output and income of Indonesia, especially tourism sector. The tourism sector which the most suffered of it is food and beverage sector, while the others sector which aslso the most suffered of it are trades sector, crops sector, oil and gas sector, food industry, prossecing and preservation sector, fisheries sector and farms sector...|$|E
40|$|Many {{continuous}} {{industrial processes}} {{can be controlled}} using programmable automation controllers for digital implementation of classical PID control. For this type of applications, a PID control block has been developed {{for use in the}} programming environment PCWorkx. In the lecture two types of PID control of tank level are discussed: single point control and cascade control. The single point control uses a single PID controller to regulate tank level using a single measurement for feedback being tank level itself. The PID controller output determines the state of the feed valve. The system has limitations in reacting to variations in output flow, which is to be regarded as a system disturbance. The cascade control uses two PID controllers for a better performance of the level control. The master controller is the level controller using the level setpoint and measurement to determine the setpoint for the slave controller driving the input flow valve. Measurements of input and output flow are taken into account, enabling the system to faster respond <b>to</b> <b>ouput</b> flow disturbances. Both types of control can be implemented using the PID control block in PCWorkx for programming a Phoenix Contact ILC. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The State-Space Averaging {{approach}} to modelling switching converter power stages {{is used to}} extend the analytical descriptions of the buck, boost, buck-boost, and Cuk converters to included the effects of all parasitic resistances and transistor storage-time modulation. The analysis reveals {{for the first time}} a new and unexpected term in the line <b>to</b> <b>ouput</b> response of the Cuk converter. The new term contains a right half-plane zero produced by the energy transfer capacitance in combination with the duty-ratio-weighted sum of the on-resistances of the transistor and diode plus a non-dissipative ac resistance term due to transistor storage-time modulation. The conventional circuit model of the converter is modified to include the effects of the new term. The improved model permits an eas physical interpretation of the new zero, which has been observed only the in Cuk converter. An extended analysis of storage-time modulation in bipolar transistor switches shows that the ac small-signal performance of a switching converter is highly dependent on the nature of the base drive. It is demonstrated that storage-time modulation in conjunction with a proportional base drive can produce instability in switching converters, even open-loop. The results of these analyses are verified experimentally and their impacts on practical converters are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A summary is {{presented}} {{of the main}} results obtained {{during the course of}} research on output feedback control. The term output feedback is used to denote a controller design approach which does not rely on an observer to estimate the states of the system. Thus, the order of the controller is fixed, and can even be zero order, which amounts <b>to</b> constant gain <b>ouput</b> feedback. The emphasis has been on optimal output feedback. That is, a fixed order controller is designed based on minimizing a suitably chosen quadratic performance index. A number of problem areas that arise in this context have been addressed. These include developing suitable methods for selecting an index of performance, both time domain and frequency domain methods for achieving robustness of the closed loop system, developing canonical forms to achieve a minimal parameterization for the controller, two time scale design formulations for ill-conditioned systems, and the development of convergent numerical algorithms for solving the output feedback problem...|$|R

The system comprises a microcontroller. three water level float sensors, two valves, a water pump and a siren. The system enables flood water to be diverted to two alternative channels with the use of two valves. The pump is activated once the water level exceeds the predetermined limit. The siren will be activated in a critical condition when both channels are full and the system is unable to cope with the flood water. It signals evacuation for people in order to minimise loss of lives and properties. The function of the microcontroller enables the system to operate automatically without the use of computer and manpower.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the joint {{estimation}} of Rayleigh fading channels and symbols in a MC-DS-CDMA system. Formerly, particle filtering has been introduced {{as a set of}} promising methods to solve communication problems. PF consists in simulating possible values of the unkwnown parameters and selecting the most likely candidates with regard to the received signal. Here, the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is used to significantly decrease the variance of the channel/symbol estimates. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, sinusoidal stochastic models have been shown to better represent the statistical properties of Rayleigh channels than classical autoregressive models. Therefore, the proposed RBPF estimator is based on these models which are expressed as the sum of two sinusoids in quadrature at the maximum Doppler frequency with autoregressive processes as amplitudes. The model parameters are unknown and need to be estimated. Since PFs are not wellsuited to recover non-varying parameters, we propose to crosscouple the RBPF with a Kalman filter which makes use of the RBPF <b>ouputs</b> <b>to</b> sequentially update the parameters. Secondly, the choice of an efficient proposal distribution to simulate the particles is crucial for PF performance. We suggest using a suboptimal distribution which simulates likely values of the symbols at a reasonable computational cost...|$|R

The variant problem requires the input to satisfy a certain extra condition, and allows the <b>ouput</b> <b>to</b> be almost equivalent to the input.

Thus, we propose to solve {{a variant of}} the initial quantifier elimination problem. We present an algorithm (VQE), that exploits the strengthened pre-condition and the weakened post-condition. The main idea underlying the algorithm is to substitute the repeated projection step of CAD by a single projection without carrying out a parametric existential decision over the reals. We find that the algorithm VQE can tackle important and challenging problems, such as numerical stability analysis of the widely-used MacCormack's scheme.

40|$|EN] The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effects of tillage and cropping system on soil organic C sequestration in dryland semiarid agroecosystems of the Ebro valley, as well as the factors controlling this C stabilization. The study was conducted at three long-term tillage experiments located at Selvanera (Lleida province), Agramunt (Lleida province) and Peñaflor (Zaragoza province). At Selvanera (475 mm of mean annual precipitation and a Xerocrept fluventic soil) four tillage systems were compared (conventional tillage, subsoil tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage) under a wheat-barley-wheat-rapeseed rotation. At Agramunt (430 mm of mean annual precipitation and a Xerofluvent typic soil) four tillage systems were compared (conventional tillage, subsoil tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage) under a wheat-barley. At Peñaflor (390 mm of mean annual precipitation and a Xerollic calciorthid soil) three tillage systems were compared (conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage) and two cropping systems (a barley-fallow rotation and a continuous barley system). In order <b>to</b> determine C <b>ouputs,</b> measurements of soil CO 2 emissions were carried out during three cropping seasons (2002 - 2003, 2003 - 2004, 2004 - 2005) at Peñaflor and during two (2003 - 2004, 2004 - 2005) at Agramunt and Selvanera. Soil CO 2 measurements were performed every 15 days and during tillage with greater frequency. To quantify C inputs, root biomass and straw production were measured at harvest. Soil aggregation dynamics was monitored during two cropping seasons at the two cropping systems of Peñaflor by measuring dry aggregate distribution and water aggregate stability. Three soil samplings were made after harvest to study the influence of organic matter fractions on soil aggregation dynamics (2002 - 2003 and 2003 - 2004 cropping seasons) and soil organic C content, particulate organic matter and mineral-associated C (2004 - 2005 cropping season). In the upper 5 cm of soil depth, no-tillage sequestered 50 - 100 % more organic C and 20 - 50 % more particulate organic matter and mineral-associated C than conventional tillage. However, this trend was inverted at lower depths where no-tillage showed the lowest values and conventional tillage the greatest. Cropping system intensification led to a greater soil organic C content in all the tillage systems. The study of the soil organic matter fractions in relation with the dynamics of soil aggregation demonstrated that no-tillage led to a greater macroaggregate stability and, thus, to a greater long-term organic C sequestration in these macroaggregates. This organic C stabilized under no-tillage macroaggregates consisted of particulate organic matter occluded within the microaggregates protected by the macroaggregates. The temporal variation of soil aggregation was affected by crop growth, with a drop of the stability of soil macroaggregates when crop died. During the cropping season, soil CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere were 30 % and 5 % greater under conventional tillage and reduced tillage, respectively than under no-tillage. Soil CO 2 emissions at the time of tillage were 100 % and 50 % greater under conventional tillage and reduced tillage, respectively, than under no-tillage. In all the cases, soil organic C balances showed C looses in all tillage and cropping systems. However, under no-tillage soil C looses were 20 - 50 % lower than under conventional tillage. Finally, the barley-fallow rotation showed greater C losses due to reduction in the soil C inputs during the long fallow phase.
