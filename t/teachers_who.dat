5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> showed the film to their {{students}} reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E

By age 15, her mother and ballet <b>teachers,</b> <b>who</b> were serving as her custodial guardians, fought a custody battle over her. Meanwhile, Copeland, who was already an award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The 1998 legal issues involved filings for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother. Both sides dropped legal proceedings, and Copeland moved home to begin studying under a new teacher who was a former ABT member.|$|E
5|$|From early on, ascetics {{have played}} a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. They {{contribute}} towards growth and development of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life. Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as paramhansas in a single night. Paramhansa is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were the highest order of sannyasi in the sect. Prominent paramhansas included Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, Gunatitanand Swami, Premanand Swami, Nishkulanand Swami, and Nityanand Swami.|$|E

5|$|In Byzantium, the {{elementary}} school teacher occupied a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used). However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and {{much of their time}} was taken with detailed word-for-word explication. Books were rare and very expensive and likely only possessed by <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> dictated passages to students.|$|E
5|$|On March 24, Zahorchak's {{proposal}} for district wide reform {{will be put}} before the Allentown School Board. The plan for reform is based primarily on financial expectations within the district. While {{the plan calls for}} the hiring of new <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> will not be full-time and not on district payroll, it also calls for the termination of 300+ teachers. Staff members from each of the Allentown School District's schools will attend the meeting in order to overhaul the plan.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{response}} {{was much less}} effusive. The show averaged 9 million viewers per episode, as compared to The Cosby Show, which garnered an average 63 million viewers per week. Our World was the lowest rated prime time show of the 104 that aired during the 1986-7 television season, bringing in only a 6.5/10 rating/share. One segment of the public who responded very favorably to the program was <b>teachers,</b> <b>who</b> assigned Our World as homework. ABC created a study guide for the show, mailing out some 39,000 copies a month to educators and fans.|$|E

5|$|Primary school {{teachers}} are general <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> have received their training at either the University of Iceland or the University of Akureyri.

Optional in-service teacher training courses are offered on an annual basis.|$|E

Dual credit courses offered in the district include English 3, English 4, Government/Economics, US History, Sociology, Psychology, Pre-Calculus, and Biology.|$|E
5|$|The {{exclusion}} of professionals caused several controversies {{throughout the history}} of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing <b>teachers,</b> <b>who</b> were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.|$|E

5|$|The {{law school}} of Beirut {{supplied}} the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent {{because of the}} affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession. A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor Leo I. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern praetorian prefecture had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> instructed them {{at one of the}} recognized law schools of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|The work Abovian {{accomplished}} {{in the field of}} education was remembered. Yerevan's State Pedagogic Institute was named after him.

Between 1948–84, five documentary films were produced in the Armenian SSR about the life and work of Abovian.|$|E

The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again.

5|$|During the 1890s, Harvard Law School was {{pioneering}} the casebook {{method of}} teaching introduced by Dean Christopher Langdell. Apart from Langdell, Hand's professors included Samuel Williston, John Chipman Gray, and James Barr Ames. Hand preferred those <b>teachers</b> <b>who</b> valued {{common sense and}} fairness, and ventured beyond casebook study into the philosophy of law. His favorite professor was James Bradley Thayer, who taught him evidence {{in his second year}} and constitutional law in his third. A man of broad interests, Thayer became a major influence on Hand's jurisprudence. He emphasized the law's historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes. He stressed the need for courts to exercise judicial restraint in deciding social issues.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their <b>teachers,</b> <b>who</b> sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
