5|$|The {{potential}} impact of <b>thiomersal</b> on autism has been investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that <b>thiomersal</b> does not cause autism. For example, the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning differ significantly from those of autism. In addition, multiple population studies have found no association between <b>thiomersal</b> and autism, and rates of autism have continued to increase despite removal of <b>thiomersal</b> from vaccines. Thus, major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization (WHO) as well as governmental {{agencies such as the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC reject any role for <b>thiomersal</b> in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In spite of the consensus of the scientific community, some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that <b>thiomersal</b> is linked to autism.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of <b>thiomersal</b> when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that <b>thiomersal</b> should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of <b>thiomersal</b> in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although <b>thiomersal</b> was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of <b>thiomersal,</b> mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the data showed that while the vaccine {{schedule}} for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards {{for the first six}} months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in <b>thiomersal</b> because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of <b>thiomersal,</b> with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that <b>thiomersal</b> was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of <b>thiomersal</b> from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from <b>thiomersal</b> and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between <b>thiomersal</b> and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and <b>thiomersal.</b> A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from <b>thiomersal</b> exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher <b>thiomersal</b> exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E
5|$|In North America, a Canadian {{study of}} 27,749 {{children}} in Quebec showed that <b>thiomersal</b> {{was unrelated to}} the increasing trend in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). In fact, the study noted that rates of PDDs {{were higher in the}} birth cohorts with no <b>thiomersal</b> when compared to those with medium or high levels of exposure. A study performed in the US which analyzed data from 78,829 children enrolled in HMOs taken from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) did not show any consistent association between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes, noting different results from data in different HMOs. A study performed in California found that removal of <b>thiomersal</b> from vaccines did not decrease the rates of autism, suggesting that <b>thiomersal</b> could not be the primary cause of autism. A study on children from Denmark, Sweden and California likewise argued against TCVs being causally associated with autism.|$|E
5|$|Mercury is an {{ingredient}} in dental amalgams. <b>Thiomersal</b> (called Thimerosal in the United States) is an organic compound {{used as a}} preservative in vaccines, though this use is in decline. <b>Thiomersal</b> is metabolized to ethyl mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link. Nevertheless, <b>thiomersal</b> has been removed from, or reduced to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 {{years of age and}} under, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this report}} was released, several {{independent}} reviews {{have examined the}} body of published research for a possible thiomersal-autism link by examining the theoretical mechanisms of <b>thiomersal</b> causing harm and by reviewing the in vitro, animal, and population {{studies that have been}} published. These reviews determined that no significant evidence exists to establish <b>thiomersal</b> as the cause of autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the United States, {{worries about}} <b>thiomersal</b> had not gained any {{significant}} traction as of 2009.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thiomersal</b> (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove <b>thiomersal</b> from vaccines {{as quickly as possible}} as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European vaccines. It is still used in all multi-dose vials of flu vaccines in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove <b>thiomersal</b> was an indication that the preservative caused autism.|$|E
5|$|Mercury, as <b>thiomersal,</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{manufacture}} of mascara. In 2008, Minnesota became the first state in the United States to ban intentionally added mercury in cosmetics, giving it a tougher standard than the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on data from large populations of children to study {{the relationship between the}} use of vaccines containing <b>thiomersal,</b> and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Almost all of these studies have found no association between thiomersal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and autism, and studies done after the removal of <b>thiomersal</b> from vaccines have nevertheless shown autism rates continuing to increase. The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} the {{recommendation}} to have <b>thiomersal</b> removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote the theory that <b>thiomersal</b> caused autism. The controversy began to gain legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the public and gained widening support within certain elements in the autism advocacy community as well as in the political arena, with U.S. Representative Dan Burton openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional hearings on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Further {{evidence}} of the scientific consensus includes the rejection of a causal link between <b>thiomersal</b> and autism by multiple national and international scientific and medical bodies including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the Canadian Paediatric Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the European Medicines Agency.|$|E
5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and <b>thiomersal</b> appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of <b>thiomersal</b> to protect the pharmaceutical industry, and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence of Harm, dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in <b>thiomersal,</b> clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of <b>thiomersal,</b> the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between <b>thiomersal</b> and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that the media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E
25|$|Contact lens {{solutions}} often contain preservatives such as {{benzalkonium chloride}} and benzyl alcohol. Preservative-free products usually have shorter shelf lives, but are {{better suited for}} individuals with an allergy or sensitivity to a preservative. In the past, <b>thiomersal</b> {{was used as a}} preservative. In 1989, <b>thiomersal</b> was responsible for about 10% of problems related to contact lenses. As a result, most products no longer contain <b>thiomersal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the <b>thiomersal</b> {{in child}} {{vaccines}} has been alleged {{to contribute to}} autism, and thousands of parents in the United States have pursued legal compensation from a federal fund. A 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee favored rejecting any causal relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and autism. Autism incidence rates increased steadily even after <b>thiomersal</b> was removed from childhood vaccines. Currently there is no accepted scientific evidence that exposure to <b>thiomersal</b> {{is a factor in}} causing autism.|$|E
25|$|Many {{vaccines}} need preservatives {{to prevent}} serious adverse effects such as Staphylococcus infection, which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Several preservatives are available, including <b>thiomersal,</b> phenoxyethanol, and formaldehyde. <b>Thiomersal</b> {{is more effective}} against bacteria, has a better shelf-life, and improves vaccine stability, potency, and safety; but, in the U.S., the European Union, {{and a few other}} affluent countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content. Although controversial claims have been made that <b>thiomersal</b> contributes to autism, no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thiomersal</b> (INN), or thimerosal (USP), is an organomercury {{compound}}. This compound is a {{well established}} antiseptic and antifungal agent.|$|E
25|$|Thiomersal's main use is as an {{antiseptic}} and antifungal agent, {{due to the}} oligodynamic effect. In multidose injectable {{drug delivery}} systems, it prevents serious adverse effects such as the Staphylococcus infection that, in one 1928 incident, killed 12 of 21 children vaccinated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Unlike other vaccine preservatives used at the time, <b>thiomersal</b> does not reduce the potency of the vaccines that it protects. Bacteriostatics such as <b>thiomersal</b> are not needed in single-dose injectables.|$|E
25|$|Morris Kharasch, {{a chemist}} at the University of Maryland, filed a patent {{application}} for <b>thiomersal</b> in 1927; Eli Lilly later marketed the compound under the trade name Merthiolate. In vitro tests conducted by Lilly investigators H. M. Powell and W. A. Jamieson {{found that it}} was forty to fifty times as effective as phenol against Staphylococcus aureus. It was used to kill bacteria and prevent contamination in antiseptic ointments, creams, jellies, and sprays used by consumers and in hospitals, including nasal sprays, eye drops, contact lens solutions, immunoglobulins, and vaccines. <b>Thiomersal</b> was used as a preservative (bactericide) so that multidose vials of vaccines could be used instead of single-dose vials, which are more expensive. By 1938, Lilly's assistant director of research listed <b>thiomersal</b> as one of the five most important drugs ever developed by the company.|$|E
25|$|The {{risk from}} {{toxicity}} is also distinct from toxicity itself. For instance, the preservative <b>thiomersal</b> used in vaccines is toxic, but the quantity administered {{in a single}} shot is negligible.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{speculation}} that heavy metal poisoning may trigger {{the symptoms of}} autism, particularly in small subsets of individuals who cannot excrete toxins effectively, some parents have turned to alternative medicine practitioners who provide detoxification treatments via chelation therapy. However, evidence to support this practice has been anecdotal and not rigorous. Strong epidemiological evidence refutes links between environmental triggers, in particular <b>thiomersal</b> containing vaccines, and the onset of autistic symptoms. No scientific data supports {{the claim that the}} mercury in the vaccine preservative <b>thiomersal</b> causes autism or its symptoms, and there is no scientific support for chelation therapy as a treatment for autism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thiomersal</b> is {{very toxic}} by inhalation, ingestion, and {{in contact with}} skin (EC hazard symbol T+), with a danger of {{cumulative}} effects. It is also very toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in aquatic environments (EC hazard symbol N). In the body, it is metabolized or degraded to ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} corporation Eli Lilly and Company gave <b>thiomersal</b> {{the trade}} name Merthiolate. It {{has been used}} as a preservative in vaccines, immunoglobulin preparations, skin test antigens, antivenins, ophthalmic and nasal products, and tattoo inks. Its use as a vaccine preservative was controversial, and it was phased out from routine childhood vaccines in the European Union, and a few other countries in response to popular fears. The current scientific consensus is that these fears are unsubstantiated.|$|E
25|$|Several claimants have {{attempted}} to bypass the VICP process with claims that thimerosal in vaccines had caused autism, but these were ultimately not successful. They have demanded medical monitoring for vaccinated children who do not show signs of autism and have filed class-action suits on behalf of parents. In March 2006, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that plaintiffs suing three manufacturers of <b>thiomersal</b> could bypass the vaccine court and litigate in either state or federal court using the ordinary channels for recovery in tort. This is the first instance where {{a federal appeals court}} has held that a suit of this nature may bypass the vaccine court. The argument was that <b>thiomersal</b> is a preservative, not a vaccine, so it does not fall under the provisions of the vaccine act. The claims that vaccines (or thimerosal in vaccines) caused autism eventually had to be filed in the vaccine court as part of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding. Some of these attempts to bypass the VICP process lost on their own merits or were stayed pending the outcome of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding, which did not find a causal link.|$|E
25|$|Heavy metal {{toxicity}} {{has been}} proposed as a hypothetical etiology of autism, and dysfunction of MT synthesis and activity {{may play a role}} in this. Many heavy metals, including mercury, lead, and arsenic have been linked to symptoms that resemble the neurological symptoms of autism. However, MT dysfunction has not specifically been linked to autistic spectrum disorders. A 2006 study, investigating children exposed to the vaccine preservative <b>thiomersal,</b> found that levels of MT and antibodies to MT in autistic children did not differ significantly from non-autistic children.|$|E
25|$|Several {{environmental}} risk {{factors have been}} proposed to {{support the hypothesis that}} the actual frequency of autism has increased. These include certain foods, infectious disease, pesticides. There is overwhelming scientific evidence against the MMR hypothesis and no convincing evidence for the <b>thiomersal</b> (or Thimerosal) hypothesis, so these types of risk factors have to be ruled out. Although it is unknown whether autism's frequency has increased, any such increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.|$|E
25|$|Autism Speaks {{believes}} that vaccines {{have been shown}} to be safe for most children, and are important for preventing serious diseases such as measles and mumps. It recognizes that some individuals may have adverse reactions, or respond poorly, to vaccines, and advocates research into identifying any subgroups of such individuals and mechanisms behind any such reactions. This has strained relations between the Wrights and their daughter Katie, the mother of a boy with autism. Katie believes her son's autism was caused by <b>thiomersal,</b> a preservative that was formerly common in children's vaccines in the United States; no major scientific studies have confirmed this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Vaccines {{may also}} contain {{preservatives}} to prevent contamination with bacteria or fungi. Until recent years, the preservative thimerosal {{was used in}} many vaccines that did not contain live virus. As of 2005, the only childhood vaccine in the U.S. that contains thimerosal in greater than trace amounts is the influenza vaccine, which is currently recommended only for children with certain risk factors. Single-dose influenza vaccines supplied in the UK do not list <b>thiomersal</b> (its UK name) in the ingredients. Preservatives may be used at various stages of production of vaccines, and the most sophisticated methods of measurement might detect traces {{of them in the}} finished product, as they may in the environment and population as a whole.|$|E
500|$|The <b>thiomersal</b> {{controversy}} describes {{claims that}} vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative <b>thiomersal</b> {{contribute to the}} development of autism and other brain development disorders. Thimerosal is no longer used in children's vaccines in the United States, except some types of flu shots. [...] While exposure to mercury may result in damage to brain, kidneys, and developing fetus, the current scientific consensus has found no convincing scientific evidence supporting claims that <b>thiomersal</b> has such effects.|$|E
500|$|This {{controversy}} has caused harm due to parents attempting {{to treat their}} autistic children with unproven and possibly dangerous treatments, discouraging parents from vaccinating their children due to fears about <b>thiomersal</b> toxicity and diverting resources away from research into more promising areas {{for the cause of}} autism. Thousands of lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. to seek damages from alleged toxicity from vaccines, including those purportedly caused by <b>thiomersal.</b> US courts have ruled against multiple representative test cases involving <b>thiomersal.</b> A 2011 journal article described the vaccine-autism connection as [...] "perhaps, the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years".|$|E
500|$|The {{suggestion}} that <b>thiomersal</b> {{has contributed to}} autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders has {{had a number of}} effects. Public health officials believe fear driven by advocates of a thiomersal-autism link has caused parents to avoid vaccination or adopt [...] "made up" [...] vaccination schedules that expose their children to increased risk from preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis. Advocates of a thiomersal-autism link have also helped enact laws in six states (California, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New York and Washington) between 2004 and 2006 to limit the use of <b>thiomersal</b> given to pregnant women and children, although later attempts in 2009 in twelve other states failed to pass. These laws can be temporarily suspended, but vaccine advocates doubt their utility given the lack of evidence for danger with <b>thiomersal</b> in vaccines. Vaccine advocates are also concerned that passage of such laws help fuel a backlash against vaccination and contribute to doubts about the safety of vaccines that are unwarranted.|$|E
500|$|<b>Thiomersal</b> was {{introduced}} as a preservative in the 1930s {{to prevent the}} growth of infectious organisms such as bacteria and fungi, {{and has been in}} use in vaccines and other products such as immunoglobulin preparations and ophthalmic and nasal solutions. Vaccine manufacturers have used preservatives to prevent microbial growth during the manufacturing process or when packaged as [...] "multi-dose" [...] products to allow for multiple punctures of the same vial to dispense multiple vaccinations with less fear of contamination. After the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 mandated a review and risk assessment of all mercury-containing food and drugs, vaccine manufacturers responded to FDA requests made in December 1998 and April 1999 to provide detailed information about the <b>thiomersal</b> content of their preparations.|$|E
