5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} <b>their</b> <b>cells.</b> The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in <b>their</b> <b>cells</b> until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in <b>their</b> <b>cells</b> overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|According to Schumacher, {{during the}} scene in which the costumes of the Riddler and Two-Face are seen, he {{originally}} planned to put Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze escaping from Arkham Asylum while many other villains saw them from <b>their</b> <b>cells.</b> The scene, however, didn't {{make it in the}} final film.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within <b>their</b> <b>cells,</b> and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, {{the film}} was re-used in a GEICO commercial, in which the {{characters}} {{go out of the}} screen and talk on <b>their</b> <b>cell</b> phones. The Gecko talks to them about not using <b>their</b> <b>cell</b> phones, and the food items go back in the screen in the opposite direction.|$|R
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of the June 2015 Turkish elections, Agar.io {{was used in}} Turkey as a medium of {{political}} advocacy; many players were naming <b>their</b> <b>cells</b> after Turkish political parties and references, with alliances formed between players with similar political views, battling against other players with opposing views. Some political parties have used Agar.io in campaign posters {{as a symbol of}} support.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of May 24â€“25, Laura and L.D. were kidnapped from <b>their</b> <b>cells</b> by between a dozen and 40 white men, {{allegedly}} including Charley Guthrie, father of the folk singer Woody Guthrie. The Associated Press reported that Laura was raped. She and L.D. were then hanged from a railroad bridge over the North Canadian River. According to one source, Laura's baby was with her but survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|Glycocalyx is {{produced}} by many bacteria to surround <b>their</b> <b>cells,</b> and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a highly structured capsule. These structures can protect cells from engulfment by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages (part of the human immune system). They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces {{and the formation of}} biofilms.|$|E
50|$|The Cathedral of His Glory {{operates}} under a cell group {{program where}} the cell leaders must undergo a retreat {{followed by a}} year of training and studying the Biblical doctrines before they graduate from the School of Leaders. The pastor {{and his wife have}} twelve men and women in <b>their</b> <b>cell</b> groups, each of whom has twelve members in <b>their</b> <b>cell</b> groups.

5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} is {{a collection}} of techniques used to analyse biological markers in the genome and proteomethe individual's genetic code and how <b>their</b> <b>cells</b> express their genes as proteinsby applying molecular biology to medical testing. The technique is used to diagnose and monitor disease, detect risk, and decide which therapies will work best for individual patients.|$|E
5|$|Most {{living things}} that are {{visible to the naked}} eye in their adult form are eukaryotes, {{including}} humans. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria in <b>their</b> <b>cells.</b> The nucleus is an organelle that houses the DNA that makes up a cell's genome. DNA (Deoxyribonuclaic acid) itself is arranged in complex chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Prisoners ate {{meals in}} <b>their</b> <b>cells,</b> {{from the early}} years of the prison through to its closure in 1991. Bread from the prison bakehouse was {{included}} in every meal in the convict era. It was served with black tea for breakfast, and with either tea or cocoa in the evening. The main meal, called dinner, was in the middle of the day, and also featured soup, meat, and vegetables.|$|E

5|$|Several Listeria and Shigella species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton, {{which is}} {{normally}} used to move organelles inside the cell. By promoting actin polymerisation at one pole of <b>their</b> <b>cells,</b> they can form {{a kind of}} tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of <b>their</b> <b>cells</b> can move within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners found A and B wings {{unsupervised}} as {{the prison}} officers had already evacuated, {{and began to}} free other prisoners who were still locked in <b>their</b> <b>cells.</b> The prison officer {{in charge of the}} first landing of C wing was ordered to evacuate, {{and with the help of}} three other officers evacuated the 73 Rule 43(a) prisoners being held there, being fearful for the safety of the prisoners who were regarded as sex offenders. Due to rioting prisoners entering the wing, the officers were unable to evacuate a further seven Rule 43(a) prisoners who were being held on the second landing. Rioting prisoners also gained access to E wing, where the Rule 43(a) prisoners had been left locked in <b>their</b> <b>cells</b> after the prison officers evacuated. A number of these Rule 43(a) prisoners were attacked by rioting prisoners. One such prisoner was Derek White, who was being held on remand on charges of indecent assault and buggery. White later died in North Manchester General Hospital on 3 April after being admitted suffering from head wounds, a dislocated shoulder and chest pains.|$|E

5|$|After {{approximately}} three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, {{with the last}} of them locked in <b>their</b> <b>cells</b> just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, Karnet, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the state government, which did not consider prison reform a priority.|$|E
5|$|In the Convict Establishment of 1855, the {{day began}} with the wakeup bell at 4:30 am, and the {{officers}} and prisoners assembled in the parade ground at 5:25 am. Prisoners were sent to work before and after breakfast (in <b>their</b> <b>cells),</b> before assembling for muster at midday. This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and more work throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm.|$|E
5|$|Individual archaea {{range from}} 0.1micrometers (Î¼m) to over 15Î¼m in diameter, and occur in various shapes, {{commonly}} as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus, needle-like filaments {{that are less}} than half a micrometer in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Archaea in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat, square archaea that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within <b>their</b> <b>cells,</b> but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.|$|E

5|$|Organisms differ {{according}} {{to the number of}} constructed molecules in <b>their</b> <b>cells.</b> Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Agar.io is {{to grow a}} cell on a petri dish by swallowing both randomly generated pellets (agar), which slightly increases a cell's mass, and smaller cells, without being swallowed by larger cells. The browser version currently holds four game modes: FFA (Free-For-All), Teams, Experimental, and Party. The mobile version of the game includes FFA (Free-For-All) and Rush Mode. The goal {{of the game is}} to obtain the largest cell; players must restart when all <b>their</b> <b>cells</b> are eaten. Players can change their cell's appearance with predefined words, phrases, symbols or skins. The more mass a cell has, the slower it will move. Cells gradually lose a small amount of mass over time.|$|E
