5|$|In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, {{moving about}} 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his uncle had a barber {{shop in the}} Hotel Conneaut. Around 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the {{itinerary}} for dance bands who worked {{up and down the}} Ohio Valley. Como, Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sing with his band. Young Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Ranger Company entered {{action on}} 11 April, {{part of a}} tank-infantry task force {{conducting}} aggressive reconnaissance in a wide valley near the river. Encountering a village, the 3rd Platoon cleared the village and killed two Chinese stragglers. After the lead elements of the tank company and the 3rd Platoon had taken the Kantongyon village, the tank company commander wanted to move his company west {{into the center of}} the valley before continuing north. Captain and now Executive Officer, Bob Channon was near the rear of the company column. CO, Jess Tidwell, riding with the tank Co, called Channon on the radio and instructed him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> take control of the 1st and 2nd Platoons.|$|E
5|$|A {{flurry of}} action followed. On 1 July 1941 he {{expended}} 89 rounds and damaged a Bf 109E. Bader's section was attacked and Johnson out-turned his assailant. Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. Losing {{sight of the}} squadron, Johnson and his wingman proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. Johnson dived so as <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> underneath into the enemy's blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. Johnson saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his wingman, Johnson disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, Johnson bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something flying off the Bf 109's starboard wing. Johnson could not see any more owing to the oil-covered windscreen and {{did not make a}} claim. His second victory was probably Unteroffizier (Corporal) R. Klienike, III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.|$|E

5|$|Point 343 {{was held}} through the 18th, however, though {{with the loss}} of 63 men; by the evening, a force of tanks had managed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{stabilise}} the position with the aid of artillery support. The 4th/11th Sikh Regiment moved around the Gurkhas to the north, covering the northern flank of the San Marino heights, and the division's 11th Brigade passed through them to help encircle the city. On the evening of the 19th, the 2nd Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of 11th Indian Infantry Brigade began to push into {{the outskirts of the city}} from the north, but early on the morning of the 20th were held back by defensive positions in the north-west of the city, where the road to the upper part of the city, situated higher on the mountain, began. Tanks moved into the suburbs, whilst a company of the Camerons moved uphill toward the summit in heavy rain. The city was secured by the early afternoon, with only 24 casualties among the attackers, and 54 prisoners taken.|$|E
25|$|The {{afternoon}} of the wreck, the purser, Mr. J.W. McCully, went downriver to Salem, where he telegraphed to the company Oregon City to send up nails, lumber and carpenters to repair the Alice, and another steamer, either the Fannie Patton or the E.N. Cooke <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> take off the cargo.|$|E
25|$|When escape seemed unlikely, Seringapatam changed {{course and}} {{appeared}} to be making an attack run on Greenwich but the latter came to a halt and waited for Georgiana <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> provide assistance. At this point, four men were transferred from Georgiana to Greenwich so Captain Stavers chose to break off the attack and continue fleeing. Lieutenant Gamble closed the distance between the two ships and he first demanded that the British surrender. But when the Americans came within pistol range, Seringapatam raised her colors and fired a powerful broadside.|$|E

25|$|Under fire, Minerve {{attempted}} to ram Dido. Manoeuvering to avoid destruction, Captain George Henry Towry turned aside and instead found his rigging impaled on the French ship's bowsprit. After 15 minutes of hand-to-hand combat, the French bowsprit shattered under the strain. Dido too was left badly damaged, but the delay allowed Lowestoffe <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> rake Minerve, causing such severe damage that the French ship was rendered unmanageable. On seeing his companion in this situation, Captain Charbonnier of Artémise, which had played an ineffectual {{part in the}} combat, withdrew, briefly and distantly pursued by Lowestoffe. Isolated and immobile, Minerve was then battered into surrender by Lowestoffe. The captured frigate was commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name, and served until she was recaptured by the French at the Action of 2 July 1803.|$|E
25|$|At this dire point, Gen. Jackson rode to {{that part}} of the field to rally the men and came upon his old brigade finally being brought up to {{reinforce}} the line. Intending to inspire the troops there, he attempted to brandish his sword; however, due to the infrequency with which he drew it, it had rusted in its scabbard and he was unable to dislodge it. Undaunted, he unbuckled the sword from his belt and waved it, scabbard and all, over his head. He then grabbed a battle flag from a retreating standard bearer and yelled at his men to rally around him. The Stonewall Brigade, heartened by their commander, launched into the Union troops and drove them back. By this point, Banks's men were becoming tired and disorganized, with their ammunition nearly gone. Without any support, his men had been unable to follow up on their initial success. In their zeal, the Stonewall Brigade pursued the Federals as they fell back, but soon found themselves beyond the Confederate line and without support. The Federals reformed and attacked, driving the 4th and 27th Virginia back. But the actions of the Stonewall Brigade gave the Confederate line time to reform and A.P Hill's troops <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> fill the gaps from Winder's broken regiments. Jackson ordered Hill and Ewell to advance. He encountered Brig. Gen. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch (a career politician) making a lengthy speech to his troops, and urged him to press forward. The Union right immediately collapsed. Ewell, having difficulty silencing his guns, was delayed, but the Union left began to waver at the sight of Crawford's retreat and were finally broken by a charge down Cedar Mountain by Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade.|$|E
500|$|Biden {{went on to}} {{duplicate}} other parts of Kinnock's speech, such as their forebears' ability {{to read and write}} poetry, their strength in working for hours underground in a mine only <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> play football afterward, and their being limited by lack of a [...] "platform" [...] upon which to stand.|$|E

500|$|Yamamoto felt {{deception}} {{would be}} required to lure the U.S. fleet into a fatally compromised situation. To this end, he dispersed his forces so that their full extent (particularly his battleships) would be concealed from the Americans prior to battle. Critically, Yamamoto's supporting battleships and cruisers trailed Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's carrier force by several hundred miles. They were intended <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> destroy whatever elements of the U.S. fleet might come to Midway's defense once Nagumo's carriers had weakened them sufficiently for a daylight gun battle;. (This tactic was typical of the battle doctrine of most major navies at the time.) ...|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{resistance}} Zayas's men, possibly the best {{troops in the}} Spanish army at the time, were being slowly forced back. However, they held long enough for Ballesteros and Lardizabal <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> for Stewart's 2nd Division to advance to their support. [...] Stewart brought John Colborne's 1st Brigade up, followed by the Division's two other brigades. The 3rd Regiment of Foot (the Buffs) took the lead, followed by the 48th and the 66th. Colborne's brigade formed up on the French left, and supported by a battery of KGL cannon the British opened fire, forcing Girard's two flanking battalions to face outwards in order to return fire.|$|E
500|$|... and {{by playing}} professionally. Art started playing trumpet professionally {{at the age}} of 16, {{performing}} in the bands of Horace Henderson, Jimmy Mundy, and Floyd Ray, among others. These opportunities came about through a combination of his ability and the absence of numerous older musicians, who were still in the armed forces following World War II. Around this time in Los Angeles, there were abundant opportunities for musical development, according to Farmer: [...] "During the day you would go to somebody's house and play. At night there were after-hours clubs [...] anybody who wanted to play was free <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> play". Farmer left high school early but persuaded the principal to give him a diploma, which he did not collect until a visit to the school in 1958.|$|E

6000|$|But Tom {{was equal}} to the occasion, and after the first onslaught he turned, as if {{summoning}} help from the cliff. [...] "This way!" [...] he cried. [...] "Tell the company <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> here <b>and</b> the other company can surround the swamp!" ...|$|R

500|$|In September 1963, Waters and Mason {{moved into}} a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near Crouch End in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a {{part-time}} tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass. Sigma6 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house. Mason said about Barrett: [...] "In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter {{is the fact that}} he bothered <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> introduce himself to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 October 1803 Captain Robert Honyman of [...] sighted {{a convoy}} off Boulogne of six French sloops, some armed, under the escort of a gun-brig. He sent Harpy and [...] to pursue them but the winds were {{uncooperative}} and the squadron {{was unable to}} engage. However, the hired armed cutter Admiral Mitchell was able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> attack the convoy. After {{two and a half}} hours of cannonading, Admiral Mitchell succeeded in driving one sloop and the brig, which was armed with twelve 32-pounder guns, on the rocks. Admiral Mitchell had one gun dismounted, suffered damage to her mast and rigging, and had five men wounded, two seriously.|$|E
2500|$|Caesar {{initially}} {{tried to}} land at Dubris (Dover), whose natural harbour had presumably been identified by Volusenus as a suitable landing place. However, {{when he came in}} sight of shore, the massed forces of the Britons gathered on the overlooking hills and cliffs dissuaded him from landing there, since the cliffs were so close to the shore that javelins could be thrown down from them onto anyone landing there. After waiting there at anchor [...] "until the ninth hour" [...] (about 3pm) waiting for his supply ships from the second port <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> meanwhile convening a council of war, he ordered his subordinates to act on their own initiative and then sailed the fleet about [...] along the coast to an open beach. In the absence of archaeological evidence at the landing point, this beach was most probably at Walmer, which is the right distance up the coast from the White Cliffs. It was thought in the 19th century to be near Deal Castle, a house there named SPQR, but is now thought to be [...] further south, where it is now marked by a concrete memorial.|$|E

2500|$|One early recruit to {{join the}} {{regiment}} was named Jack Jackson. Jackson {{was said to be}} very large and strong-willed and quickly became a Sergeant in Company B. At some point Jackson joined the regimental recruiting parties; the officers were having trouble with convincing local field hands to join. Jackson's recruiting method was described as very forceful but ultimately successful. At the Battle of Milliken's Bend one of Jackson´s superior officers, Lieutenant David Cornwell, described the attack; saying that the 23rd Iowa was not behaving courageously but the three black infantry regiments offered great resistance. He said that Jackson, [...] "Laid into a group of Texans... smashing in every head he could reach", and that, [...] "Big Jack Jackson passed me like a rocket. With the fury of a tiger he sprang into that gang and crushed everything before him. There was nothing left of Jack's gun except the barrel and he was smashing everything he could reach. On {{the other side of the}} levee, they were yelling 'Shoot that big !' while Jack was daring the whole gang <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> fight him. Then a bullet reached his head and he fell full on the levee." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Squad 5-O, {{the move}} to Tooth and Nail {{was more than just}} a change of {{approach}} in musical style. The band also began to move away from explicit references to Jesus, and to use metaphor more extensively. They also began to tour in more mainstream venues than churches, as explained by Jeff Fortson: [...] "Jesus said to be fishers of men; we have realized that you can't do that unless you're where the people who need him are." [...] Generally, the band was discontented with the state of the Christian music industry and Christian subculture, which they saw as exploitive and misleading. Jeff Fortson contrasted for HM magazine their experiences playing at a [...] "large Christian event" [...] and a secular one a few days later. At the Christian event (which was headlined by Steven Curtis Chapman) [...] "... the kids were coming out of the seats and standing in the aisles <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> rock out with us... They just shut us down... The park security and promoters evidently thought we were just evil and inciting riots." [...] At the secular show they reported that they could [...] "...connect with the kids, you know, just be real... same exact response from the crowd, and that's why I feel that's where we belong." ...|$|E
