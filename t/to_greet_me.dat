60|$|It was Ja. As {{his eyes}} fell upon me his face lighted with pleasure. He came quickly forward <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me</b> after {{the manner of}} his tribe.|$|E
60|$|He always stands there--and {{has stood}} these thirty years--in the back {{part of his}} shop, his tape woven about his neck, a smile of welcome on his face, waiting <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{am sorry}} to say I was about two minutes late, which was enough, however, for Commander O. <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me</b> with a shout from a great distance: [...] "Oh! You are coming, then!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had sunk}} {{into one of}} the golden thrones, and as I turned <b>to</b> her she <b>greeted</b> <b>me</b> with a wan smile.|$|R
60|$|During my {{audience}} with the jeddak another party entered the chamber from behind me, so that I did not see their faces until Kulan Tith stepped past <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> them, commanding <b>me</b> <b>to</b> follow and be presented.|$|R
60|$|I {{spent three}} days of {{enforced}} idleness at the Casa Blanca, as the house was called, before Santa Coloma returned, and after the rough experience I had undergone, during which I had subsisted on a flesh diet untempered by bread or vegetables, they were indeed like days spent in paradise to me. Then the General came back. I was sitting alone in the garden when he arrived, and, coming out <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> he <b>greeted</b> <b>me</b> warmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were the}} first to take me in your arms when I came into the world, Aunt Rachel," [...] she had said, [...] "and I want you to be the first <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me</b> on that {{wonderful}} day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{she come}} forward and speak for herself?" [...] said Mrs. Bretton, turning to my corner; and at this invitation, forward I came. Graham courteously rose up <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me.</b> He stood tall on the hearth, a figure {{justifying}} his mother's unconcealed pride.|$|E
60|$|Here, then, {{we found}} the equerry again, {{consumed}} by anxiety. He leapt forward <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me,</b> addressing me by the old title of Madonnino which I loved to hear from him, however much that title might otherwise arouse harsh and gloomy memories.|$|E
60|$|Within {{the wide}} brim of her bonnet her {{exquisite}} face appeared like a rosebud nestling in a basket. She smiled when I rose <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> her, gave <b>me</b> {{a look that}} sent my susceptible heart a-flutter and caused me to wish that I had not taken that bottle-green coat of mine to the Mont de Piété only last week. I offered her a seat, which she took, arranging her skirts about her with inimitable grace.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{what shall}} I say to our father, In {{the place to}} which I fare? O, what shall I say to our mother, Who <b>greets</b> <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> there? And to all the kindly Camerons That have lived and died long-syne - Is this the word you send them, Fause-hearted brother mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{what shall}} I say to our father, [...] In {{the place to}} which I fare? [...] O, what shall I say to our mother, [...] Who <b>greets</b> <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> there? [...] And to all the kindly Camerons [...] That have lived and died long-syne-- [...] Is this the word you send them, [...] Fause-hearted brother mine?" ...|$|R
60|$|But as I {{opened the}} door, {{the very first}} thing that my eye rested upon was a long pair of sky-blue legs with hussar boots, and a short pair of black ones with knee {{breeches}} and buckles. They both sprang up together <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Simon Kenton was in {{particularly}} good humor on that morning when, all our preparations completed, {{we left the}} camping place with our faces turned toward the north, and I was exceedingly happy, for {{at the end of}} the journey my mother was waiting <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{does not}} come <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me</b> so frankly as she did, [...] And in her utmost {{openness}} I feel there's something hid; [...] She almost seems to shun me, as if she thought that I [...] Might win her gentle heart again to feelings long gone by.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye may be right, Quentin, for a' I ken; {{but some}} men are no' left to theirsel's. There's that puir young chiel Anderson, that was shot i' the lungs an' has scarce been able {{the last day}} or twa to crawl to the yett to see his auld mither--he's deeing this afternoon. I went ower to the tombstane that keeps the east wund aff him, an' he said to me, `Andry, man,' said he, `I'll no' be able to crawl to see my mither the day. I'll vera likely be deid before she comes. Wull ye tell her no' <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> for <b>me,</b> for I'm restin' on the Lord Jesus, an' I'll be a free man afore night, singing the praises o' redeeming love, and waitin' for her to come?'" ...|$|R
60|$|The next day, as James More {{seemed a}} little on the {{complaining}} hand in the matter of my chamber, I offered to have in more furniture; and coming in the afternoon, with porters bringing chairs and tables, found the girl once more left <b>to</b> herself. She <b>greeted</b> <b>me</b> on my admission civilly, but withdrew at once to her own room, of which she shut the door. I made my disposition, and paid and dismissed the men so that she might hear them go, when I supposed she would at once come forth again to speak to me. I waited yet a while, then knocked upon her door.|$|R
5000|$|Though I've sailed {{overseas}} from Invercargill Theres {{a yearning}} strong that calls {{me back to}} SouthlandWhere in childhood days, I used to play and bepart of a local music family.Joyous hours playing with the Garrison BandConcerts and contesting all around New ZealandAnd marching down to Dee Street, in the southernmost town. [...] The memories, of childhood, and playing tunes, I loved to learnSomeday I will return, to mountains high and green leafed fernOreti Beach, Waihopai, an Oyster feed, from Foveaux StraitI cannot wait <b>to</b> see, who <b>greets</b> <b>me,</b> at Bluff port gate.Invercargill is, {{the only place that}} I adoreAnd my old band pals, I long to see them all once moreSoon my ship will be, returning from the deep blue seaTo my dear old home, the gem of all the Southern Seas (x2).|$|R
60|$|When I {{returned}} it was breakfast time. I {{went into the}} dining hut, and there Stella was waiting <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me,</b> dressed in simple white and with orange flowers on her breast. She came forward to me shyly enough; then, seeing the condition of my face, started back.|$|E
60|$|When {{he saw me}} Seti {{sprang from}} his seat and came <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me,</b> as a man does the friend whom he loves. I kissed his hand, and going to Merapi, kissed hers also noting that on it now shone that ring which once she had {{rejected}} as too large.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Dennis saw me, {{his face}} lost the dull puzzled {{expression}} which {{had seemed to}} characterise it; he dropped the pole of the go-cart from one hand, and his son from the other, and came jumping forward <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me</b> with all his might, leaving his progeny roaring in the road.|$|E
6000|$|I {{can hardly}} say. Small vexations and {{annoyances}} {{seem to have}} beset him since he came back, and no man, under those circumstances, is ever presented at his best. He looks, as I think, thinner than {{he was when he}} left England. His wearisome cough and his comfortless restlessness have certainly increased. His manner--at least his manner towards me--is much more abrupt than it used <b>to</b> be. He <b>greeted</b> <b>me,</b> on the evening of his return, with little or nothing of the ceremony and civility of former times--no polite speeches of welcome--no appearance of extraordinary gratification at seeing me--nothing but a short shake of the hand, and a sharp [...] "How-d'ye-do, Miss Halcombe--glad to see you again." [...] He seemed to accept me as one of the necessary fixtures of Blackwater Park, to be satisfied at finding me established in my proper place, and then to pass me over altogether.|$|R
60|$|As each couple appeared, the curiosity--the uneasiness, probably--of Saint-Eustache and his men, had increased, {{and their}} {{expectancy}} was on tiptoe {{to see what}} lord it was went abroad with such regal pomp, when I appeared in the gateway and advanced at the trot {{into the middle of}} the quadrangle. There I drew rein and doffed my hat to them as they stood, open-mouthed and gaping one and all. If it was a theatrical display, a parade worthy of a tilt-ground, it was yet a noble and imposing advent, and their gaping told me that it was not without effect. The men looked uneasily at the Chevalier; the Chevalier looked uneasily at his men; mademoiselle, very pale, lowered her eyes and pressed her lips yet more tightly; the Vicomtesse uttered an oath of astonishment; whilst Lavedan, too dignified <b>to</b> manifest surprise, <b>greeted</b> <b>me</b> with a sober bow.|$|R
60|$|In answer, {{he bowed}} and <b>greeted</b> <b>me</b> with cold ceremoniousness.|$|R
60|$|The Marquis {{then led}} {{me up the}} broad stairs, lined with lackeys, to our own suite of apartments, where I was to arrange my dress before being {{presented}} to Madame de Nidemerle, who begged me to excuse her not being present <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me,</b> as she had caught cold, and had a frightful megrim.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} her in our drawing-room, {{standing beside the}} tall lamp-stand that half filled the bay {{as though she had}} just turned from watching for me at the window. There was something in her pale face that arrested me. She looked as if she had not been sleeping. She did not come forward <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have ruled}} in many shapes and lands, Leo. Perchance they were ancient companions and servitors of mine come <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me</b> {{once again and}} to hear my tidings. Or perchance they were but shadows of thy brain, {{pictures}} like those upon the fire, that it pleased me to summon to thy sight, to try thy strength and constancy.|$|E
40|$|In “A Primer in Positive Psychology ” Chris Peterson {{offers this}} three-word {{summary of the}} field: Other people matter. The {{following}} other people significantly enhanced my life throughout graduate school and contributed to my development as a psychologist. Nothing I have accomplished in graduate school would be possible without Marty Seligman, who trusted enough in my abilities to bring me here. I still remember rushing into Marty’s office (I was lost) on a chilly February day in 2005 only <b>to</b> have him <b>greet</b> <b>me</b> with a very jovial: “Do you want a cookie? ” before he launched into {{a list of the}} reasons why I should come work with him at Penn. Marty, you were right, and I have never regretted my decision. You have opened countless doors for me and molded me into a better psychologist, writer, and person. I may not be as fast as General Petraeus, but I am working towards it. I am also deeply grateful for the guidance and support of my dissertation committee: Rob DeRubeis and Mike Kahana.

60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour I was in my brother's sitting-room. Ralph <b>greeted</b> <b>me</b> cordially.|$|R
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to describe the look of surprise and delight with which he <b>greeted</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|A violent {{perception}} of the mysterious, the irrevocable march of human life swept over me and I shivered before a sudden realization of the ceaseless change and shift of western life and landscape. How few of those I knew were there <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me!</b> Walter and Charles were dead, Maud and Lena were both married, and Burton was preaching somewhere in the West.|$|E
60|$|The {{better to}} deceive the servant in attendance, I did {{this with the}} assured air of an old and {{familiar}} acquaintance. With a presence of mind truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and, <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me,</b> held out the most bewitchingly little of hands. The valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love.|$|E
60|$|The {{first man}} <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> <b>me</b> was Kantos Kan himself. My old friend had won {{to the highest}} place in the navy of Helium, {{but he was still}} to me the same brave comrade who had shared with me the privations of a Warhoon dungeon, the terrible atrocities of the Great Games, and later the dangers of our search for Dejah Thoris within the hostile city of Zodanga.|$|E
60|$|She went {{straight}} {{up to him}} and passed her arm through his. He <b>greeted</b> <b>me</b> stiffly, but not unkindly.|$|R
60|$|I {{led the way}} to my study. Mr. Stanley <b>greeted</b> <b>me</b> affably {{and with}} a commendable {{assumption}} of bluff respect.|$|R
60|$|I found Wolf Larsen in the cabin, {{stripped}} and bloody, {{waiting for}} <b>me.</b> He <b>greeted</b> <b>me</b> {{with one of}} his whimsical smiles.|$|R
