5000|$|The {{purchase}} {{cable is}} a wire rope that looks {{very similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> cable. They are much longer, however, and are not designed to be easily removed. There are two purchase cables per arresting cable, and they connect to each end of <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> wire. Purchase cables connect <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> wire to <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> gear engines and [...] "pay out" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> wire is engaged by the aircraft. As an incoming aircraft engages the deck pendant, the purchase cable transmits {{the force of the}} landing aircraft from the deck gear to <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> engine. <b>The</b> pendant (<b>arresting</b> wire) is [...] "swaged" [...] (attached) to the purchase cable by means of a loop created with zinc heated to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This onboard fabrication is considered dangerous, and it is reported the Navy is testing the use of an automated press to accomplish it more safely. On land based systems, heavy nylon tapes are used in place of purchase cables, but they serve the same function.|$|R

5|$|Glik v.

The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording <b>the</b> <b>arrest,</b> they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.|$|E

50|$|A normal {{arrestment}} {{is accomplished}} when <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> hook of an incoming aircraft engages {{one of the}} deck pendants. When a landing aircraft engages a deck pendant, {{the force of the}} forward motion of the landing aircraft is transferred to a purchase cable which is routed via sheaves to <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> engine, located in a machinery room below the flight deck or {{on either side of the}} runway. As the deck pendant and the purchase cable are pulled out by <b>the</b> aircraft being <b>arrested,</b> <b>the</b> kinetic energy of the aircraft is transferred to mechanical energy of the cables, and <b>the</b> <b>arresting</b> engine transfers <b>the</b> mechanical energy of the cables to hydraulic energy. <b>The</b> <b>arresting</b> engine brings about a smooth, controlled stop of the landing aircraft. At the completion of the arrestment, <b>the</b> aircraft <b>arresting</b> hook is disengaged from the deck pendant, which is then retracted to its normal position.|$|R
5|$|In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, {{feared that}} the Lakota leader was about to flee the {{reservation}} with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him.

The plan called for <b>the</b> <b>arrest</b> to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised {{the use of a}} light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after <b>the</b> <b>arrest.</b>|$|E
