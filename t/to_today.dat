5|$|Periyar {{hailed the}} Thirukkural as a {{valuable}} scripture which contained many scientific and philosophical truths. He also praised the secular nature of the work. Periyar praised Thiruvalluvar for his description of God as a formless entity with only positive attributes. He also suggested that one who reads the Thirukkural will become a Self-respecter, absorbing knowledge in politics, society, and economics. According to him, though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate <b>to</b> <b>today,</b> it permitted such changes for modern society.|$|E

5|$|Austen's novels have {{resulted}} in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance, and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, The Bennets (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice and continuing on <b>to</b> <b>today,</b> class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era (considered to be from 1901 <b>to</b> <b>today</b> by MLB, {{as it was the}} first season with both of the current Major Leagues in operation), four Australians have played in postseason games, all of them pitchers. Graeme Lloyd became the first, playing with the New York Yankees in 1996. He made {{appearances}} against the Texas Rangers in the League Division Series, the Baltimore Orioles in the League Championship Series, and the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. Lloyd was credited with the win in game4 of the 1996 World Series, becoming the first Australian player to do so, as well as becoming the first Australian to be a World Series champion when the Yankees won in 1996 and again in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Late Carboniferous and Early Permian insect orders {{include both}} extant groups, their stem groups, {{and a number}} of Paleozoic groups, now extinct. During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of , making them far larger than any living insect. This {{gigantism}} may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative <b>to</b> <b>today.</b> The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor. Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the largest mass extinction {{in the history of the}} Earth, around 252 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} is {{the practice}} of injecting one or more drugs into a person by a government {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. While Nazi Germany was known to execute enemies of the state using an injection of lethal drugs, the first country to legalize and formally implement what is referred <b>to</b> <b>today</b> as lethal injection was the United States. The state of Texas adopted it as its form on capital punishment in 1977 and executed the first person by it, Charles Brooks Jr., in 1982. The practice was subsequently adopted by the other U.S. states using capital punishment. As of 2017, the method is being used by 31 U.S. states, as well as by their federal government and military.|$|E

5|$|The East Stand at Old Trafford was {{the second}} to be {{converted}} to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012–13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred <b>to</b> <b>today.</b> The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.|$|E
5|$|The two liberal {{governments of}} César Gaviria (1990-1994) and Ernesto Samper (1994-1998) pursued {{a policy of}} {{economic}} opening and business modernization. In the spirit of these policies, the government established a comprehensive new sector policy that aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities, improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in the poorest {{parts of the country}} where public utilities were not performing well, the establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at the national level, increased cost recovery, and protecting the poorest through cross-subsidies in the form of area-based tariffs. The basis of this sector policy was established by Law 142 of July 1994, at the end of president César Gaviria’s term of office. With some modifications to that law in 2001, the same policy continues to be pursued <b>to</b> <b>today</b> despite several changes of governments.|$|E
5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred <b>to</b> <b>today</b> as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E
