25|$|Gas {{blending}} of trimix involves decanting oxygen and helium into the diving cylinder and then <b>topping</b> <b>up</b> the mix with air from a diving air compressor. To ensure an accurate mix, after each helium and oxygen transfer, the mix {{is allowed to}} cool, its pressure is measured and further gas is decanted until the correct pressure is achieved. This process often takes hours and is sometimes spread over days at busy blending stations.|$|E
25|$|Partial {{pressure}} blending using pure oxygen decanted {{into the}} cylinder before <b>topping</b> <b>up</b> with air may involve very high oxygen fractions and oxygen partial pressures during the decanting process, which constitute {{a relatively high}} fire hazard. This procedure requires care and precautions by the operator, and decanting equipment and cylinders which are clean for oxygen service, but the equipment is relatively simple and inexpensive. Partial pressure blending using pure oxygen {{is often used to}} provide nitrox on live-aboard dive boats, but it is also used in some dive shops and clubs.|$|E

Moving on to Brest, West Haven loaded 2,306 tons of captured German ordnance, aviation supplies and 375 tons of steel rail ballast for the return journey. Departing for New York on 17 May, West Haven made an intermediate stop on 23 May at Ponta Delgada, Azores, probably to refuel, before continuing on to her destination.|$|E

25|$|After {{fermentation}} {{the grapes}} are then aged in small oak barrels. In many DOC regions, the wines {{are required to}} age for at least 3 years {{though it is not}} uncommon for producers to age their wines for 5 to 10 years. Traditionally the barrels were made of chestnut instead of oak, which contributed high amounts of wood tannins and was very porous which promoted excessive evaporation in the barrel. Under this same traditional style of winemaking, a large ullage or air space would emerge in the barrel and oxidation took place. This gave the wine its characteristic amber but also flavours and traits that may be characterised as wine faults. Towards the end of the 20th century, more produces began switching to oak barrels while maintaining the tradition of not <b>topping</b> <b>up</b> the barrels and filling in the ullage space. This angel's share still produces some level of oxidation, though not as severe as the style was historically made. Modern winemaking technique also calls for more temperature control and keeping the wine in rooms with a consistent temperature that promotes more fresh flavours in the wine and fewer faults.|$|E

[...] A series of air refuelings can give range {{limited only by}} crew fatigue and engineering factors such as engine oil consumption. [...] Because the receiver aircraft can be topped up with extra fuel in the air, air refueling can allow a takeoff with a greater payload which could be weapons, cargo, or personnel: the maximum takeoff weight is maintained by carrying less fuel and <b>topping</b> <b>up</b> once airborne. [...] Alternatively, a shorter take-off roll can be achieved because take-off can be at a lighter weight before refueling once airborne.

2500|$|The fear system {{dictates}} how scared a given NPC is. There {{are three}} levels of fear; normal, scared and [...] "Crack-up". When an NPC enters [...] "Crack-up" [...] mode, Blake has only {{a limited amount of}} time to reduce their fear level, or the NPC will kill themselves, attack Blake and other NPCs, attack the environment, or die of a heart attack. Each NPC responds differently to different surroundings; for example, medics tend to scare easier than soldiers. Generally, however, fear increases when entering rooms covered in blood, entering dark locations, finding particularly disfigured corpses, being attacked by multiple enemies, and hearing enemies but not being able to see them. When an NPC is scared, it affects their performance; soldiers become less accurate, engineers take longer to repair fuse boxes and medics don't heal characters as quickly. Blake can reduce fear by giving NPCs adrenaline, <b>topping</b> <b>up</b> their ammo, moving away from particular locations, or successfully defeating enemies.|$|E

2500|$|Jones next {{crossed the}} Solway Firth from Whitehaven to Scotland, hoping to hold for ransom the Earl of Selkirk, {{who lived on}} St Mary's Isle near Kirkcudbright. The Earl, Jones reasoned, could be {{exchanged}} for American sailors impressed into the Royal Navy. The Earl was discovered to be absent from his estate, so his wife entertained the officers and conducted negotiations. Canadian historian Peter C. Newman gives credit to the governess for protecting the young heir and to the butler for filling a sack half with coal, and <b>topping</b> it <b>up</b> with the family silver, in order to fob off the Americans. Jones claimed {{that he intended to}} return directly to his ship and continue seeking prizes elsewhere, but his crew wished to [...] "pillage, burn, and plunder all they could". Ultimately, Jones allowed the crew to seize a silver plate set adorned with the family's emblem to placate their desires, but nothing else. Jones bought the plate himself when it was later sold off in France, and returned it to the Earl of Selkirk after the war.|$|R

2500|$|Vapour-compression {{distillers}} {{were installed}} on US submarines shortly before World War 2. Early attempts {{had been made}} with evaporators running from diesel engine exhaust heat, but these could only be used when the submarine was running at speed on the surface. A further difficulty with submarines was the need to produce high-quality water for <b>topping</b> <b>up</b> their large storage batteries. Typical consumption on a war patrol was around [...] per day for hotel services, drinking, cooking, washing etc. and also for replenishing the diesel engine cooling system. A further 500gallons per week was required for the batteries. The standard Badger model X-1 for diesel submarines could produce 1,000gallons per day. Tank capacity of 5,600gallons (1,200 of which was battery water) was provided, around 10 days reserve. With the appearance of nuclear submarines and their plentiful electricity supply, even larger plant could be installed. The X-1 plant was designed {{so that it could}} be operated when snorkelling, or even when completely submerged. As the ambient pressure increased when submerged, and thus the boiling point, additional heat was required in these submarine distillers and so they were designed to run with electric heat continuously.|$|E
2500|$|Ticket {{machines}} {{operate at}} every Luas stop {{and these are}} the only source of single-journey and return tickets. They also sell 1-day, 7-day and 30-day tickets, valid in either some or all the fare zones, for adults, children and students. It is also possible to purchase 'Combi' tickets valid on Dublin Bus and Luas. DART and Luas 'Combi' tickets have been produced since Luas opened but despite this being a major ticket option these LUAS-DART Combis are not available at either ticket newsagents or online from either Iarnród Éireann or Luas, nor are they available in Luas vending machines. They are available only from Iarnród Éireann ticket offices. Transport user lobby groups like 'Rail Users Ireland' have written to both Luas and Iarnród Éireann asking for an explanation for this and none has been forthcoming. [...] While it is also possible to purchase Luas-DART-Dublin Bus triple combi tickets (from Iarnród Éireann booking offices) from monthly ramblers upward, these are often more expensive than simply <b>topping</b> <b>up</b> a Leap card to its weekly cap rate (currently €40 for Adults). Certain ticket combinations are not possible (for example a one-day student ticket), and tickets can only be valid from the stop at which they are purchased and must commence their validity within 90 minutes, valid until a specific time shown on the card. Certain tickets require the user to hold an ID card and write the number on the ticket, to prevent the ticket from being transferred to another person.
