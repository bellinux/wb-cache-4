5|$|The cuisine of the Galilee is {{very similar}} to Lebanese cuisine, due to the {{extensive}} communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. The Galilee specializes in a number of meals based on the combination of bulgur, spices and meat, known as kubbi by Arabs. Kubbi bi-siniyee is a combination of minced lamb or beef mixed with pepper, allspice and other spices wrapped in a bulgur crust, then baked. Kubbi bi-siniyee could serve as the main dish during a Palestinian lunch. Kubbi neyee is a variation of kubbi, that is served as raw meat mixed with bulgur and a variety of spices. It is mostly eaten as a side dish and pita or markook bread is used for scooping the meat. Since the dish is raw, whatever is not eaten is cooked the next day in either <b>the</b> <b>baked</b> version or as fried kibbee balls.|$|E
25|$|Ice cream may {{be served}} in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or in cones, which are licked. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie. Ice cream {{is used to}} prepare other desserts, {{including}} ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as <b>the</b> <b>Baked</b> Alaska.|$|E
25|$|The choux pastry paste is piped {{through a}} pastry bag or dropped {{with a pair}} of spoons into small balls and baked to form largely hollow puffs. After cooling, <b>the</b> <b>baked</b> profiteroles are {{injected}} with filling using a pastry bag and narrow piping tip, or by slicing off the top, filling them, and reassembling. For sweet profiteroles, additional glazes or decorations may then be added.|$|E
50|$|This episode has a {{theme of}} using {{alternatives}} for ingredients usually used in baking. For <b>the</b> signature <b>bake,</b> <b>the</b> bakers were given the challenge of baking a cake, but without using sugar. They were given {{two and a half}} hour for <b>the</b> <b>bake.</b> For <b>the</b> technical <b>bake,</b> <b>the</b> challenge was to make twelve identical gluten-free pitta breads in two hours. In the showstopper, the bakers needed to make an ice-cream roll using dairy-free ice-cream. They were given four and a half hours for <b>the</b> <b>bake.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> soft <b>bake</b> is <b>the</b> most {{important}} of <b>the</b> <b>bake</b> steps for stress formation. It is performed after spinning. Its function is to remove the solvent from the resist and make the layer solid. Typically at least 5% of the solvent remains in the layer after <b>the</b> soft <b>bake,</b> however <b>the</b> thicker the coating, the harder it becomes to remove the solvent, as evaporating solvent through thick layers becomes increasingly difficult with coating thickness. <b>The</b> <b>bake</b> is performed on a programmable hot plate to reduce the skinning effect of solvent depletion at the surface creating a dense layer which makes {{the remainder of the}} solvent more difficult to remove. In order to reduce stress, <b>the</b> <b>bake</b> procedure is generally a two step process made up of holding at 65°C before ramping to 95°C and holding again for a time dependent on the layer thickness. The temperature is then lowered slowly to room temperature.|$|R
25|$|Hydrogenation {{converts}} liquid {{vegetable oils}} into solid or semi-solid fats, {{such as those}} present in margarine. Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties, such as the melting range, which is why liquid oils become semi-solid. Solid or semi-solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in <b>the</b> <b>baked</b> product. Because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal fats, are available {{in a wide range}} of consistencies, and have other desirable characteristics (such as increased oxidative stability and longer shelf life), they are the predominant fats used as shortening in most commercial baked goods.|$|E

500|$|New England {{had a great}} {{abundance}} of wildlife and seafood. Traditional East Anglian fare was preferred, {{even if it had}} to be made with New World ingredients. Baked beans and pease porridge were everyday fare, particularly during the winter, and usually eaten with coarse, dark bread. At first, it was made with a mixture of wheat and maize (corn), but a disease struck in the 1660s called wheat rust, after which it was made of rye and maize, creating what was later known as [...] "rye 'n injun". Vegetables with meat boiled thoroughly was a popular dish, and they were cooked together rather than separately, unlike many other regions in North American colonies, and frequently without seasoning. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders, and New England was the origin of dishes today seen as quintessentially American, such as apple pie and <b>the</b> <b>baked</b> Thanksgiving turkey.|$|E

50|$|For <b>the</b> {{signature}} <b>bake,</b> <b>the</b> bakers {{had three}} hours to make a free-form loaf of bread. The bread had to be yeast bread, and hand shaped. In <b>the</b> technical <b>bake,</b> <b>the</b> bakers were given one hour and 45 minutes to make eight large soft pretzels using Paul's recipe. Immediately following the technical challenge, the bakers went on to make the showstopper, which was two types of croissants, one plain and one filled. They were given two hours the first day, allowed the dough to rise overnight in the fridge, and then three hours {{the next day to}} finish <b>the</b> <b>bake.</b>|$|R

40|$|Chemically amplified resists {{depend upon}} <b>the</b> {{post-exposure}} <b>bake</b> (PEB) process {{to drive the}} deprotection reactions (in positive resists) that lead to proper resist development. For this reason they often exhibit critical dimension (CD) sensitivity to PEB temperature variation. In this work the effects of variation in {{different aspects of the}} PEB step on post-develop CD are studied for two extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresists. The spatial and temporal temperature uniformity of the PEB plate is measured using a wireless sensor wafer. Programmed variations in <b>the</b> <b>bake</b> plate temperature set point are then used to measure the CD sensitivity to steady state temperature variation. In addition, the initial temperature ramp time is modified using a thin sheet of polyimide film between the wafer and <b>the</b> <b>bake</b> plate. This allows for measurement of the CD sensitivity to transient temperature variation. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>bake</b> time is adjusted to measure the CD sensitivity to this parameter...|$|R

2500|$|Heat {{can also}} by itself cause sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{to act as}} a raising agent in baking because of thermal decomposition, releasing carbon dioxide. When used this way on its own, without the presence of an acidic component (whether in the batter or by the use of a baking powder containing acid), only half the available CO2 is released. Additionally, in the absence of acid, thermal decomposition of sodium bicarbonate also produces sodium carbonate, which is strongly alkaline and gives <b>the</b> <b>baked</b> product a bitter, [...] "soapy" [...] taste and a yellow color. To avoid an over-acidic taste from added acid, non-acid ingredients such as whole milk or Dutch-processed cocoa are often added to baked foods.|$|E
2500|$|An eruv tavshilin (Hebrew: עירוב תבשילין [...] "mixed cooked food items") {{is made in}} {{the home}} {{on the eve of a}} holiday with a work proscription that {{directly}} precedes the Sabbath. [...] It is made by taking a cooked item and a baked item, and placing them together. [...] It is common to use a piece of cooked egg, fish, or meat as the cooked item and a piece of bread or matzah as <b>the</b> <b>baked</b> item. [...] It is needed because while it is allowed to cook and transfer fire on holidays (unlike the Sabbath and Yom Kippur, when these activities are forbidden), these activities are allowed to be done for use on only the holiday, and not for the next day. [...] The eruv tavshilin makes it possible to begin preparing for the Sabbath before the holiday, and continue doing so. [...] The foods of the eruv tavshilin are traditionally eaten on the Sabbath day following the holiday.|$|E

Grover, a blue monster described by Borgenicht as [...] "self-confident, furry, cute, capable, and intelligent", has a superhero alter-ego named [...] "Super Grover", who is more well-meaning than helpful. In addition to Ernie and Bert, recognizable humanoid Muppets appearing on the show also include Count von Count, a number-obsessed vampire based on Bela Lugosi's interpretation of Count Dracula; and Prairie Dawn, a methodic and driven young girl who loves to write and direct pageants featuring her friends.|$|E
50|$|On several occasions, {{the stone}} huts {{underwent}} major restoration work (at {{the turn of}} the 1970s and again in the 1990s) (see Jean-Pierre Chavent in Bibliography). A number of alterations were made to roof ridges: the separate roofs of the huts in group 2 were merged over two thirds of their height so as to mimick the ondulating ridge of group 1; likewise, the ridge line of the hut leaning against the gable of <b>the</b> <b>bake</b> house, originally a curve and countercurve, was straightened to be made parallel to the ridge of <b>the</b> <b>bake</b> house.|$|R
