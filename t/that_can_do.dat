25|$|A {{common problem}} in {{computer}} graphics is {{to generate a}} non-zero vector in R3 that is orthogonal to a given non-zero one. There is no single continuous function <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> this for all non-zero vector inputs. This is a corollary of the hairy ball theorem. To see this, consider the given vector as the radius of a sphere and note that finding a non-zero vector orthogonal to the given one is equivalent to finding a non-zero vector that is tangent {{to the surface of}} that sphere where it touches the radius. However, the hairy ball theorem says there exists no continuous function <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> this for every point on the sphere (i.e. every given vector).|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for some polyhedra to change their overall shape, while keeping the shapes of their faces the same, by varying the angles of their edges. A polyhedron <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{this is called a}} flexible polyhedron. By Cauchy's rigidity theorem, flexible polyhedra must be non-convex. The volume of a flexible polyhedron must remain constant as it flexes; this result is known as the bellows theorem.|$|E
25|$|The {{power factor}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of real power to {{apparent}} power. As power is transferred along a transmission line, it does not consist purely of real power <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> work once transferred to the load, but rather consists of a combination of real and reactive power, called apparent power. The power factor describes the amount of real power transmitted along a transmission line relative to the total apparent power flowing in the line.|$|E
25|$|Computable {{functions}} {{are the basic}} objects of study in computability theory. Computable {{functions are}} the formalized analogue of the intuitive notion of algorithm, {{in the sense that}} a function is computable if there exists an algorithm <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> the job of the function, i.e. given an input of the function domain it can return the corresponding output. Computable functions are used to discuss computability without referring to any concrete model of computation such as Turing machines or register machines. Any definition, however, must make reference to some specific model of computation but all valid definitions yield the same class of functions.|$|E

25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|Glasgow Square Theatre, {{located on}} the {{downtown}} riverfront, is a 285-seat auditorium that hosts year-round concerts, plays, and other community functions. The theatre can be transformed into an outdoor amphitheatre, {{one of the few}} theatres in Canada (if not the only) <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that. During the summer it hosts celebrations for Canada Day on June 30, the New Glasgow Riverfront Jubilee during the first weekend in August, and the Race on the River Dragon Boat Festival in mid-August. The Roseland Cabaret nightclub operates in the former Roseland film theatre in downtown New Glasgow, one of the oldest film theatres in Nova Scotia and site of a famous 1946 civil rights case.|$|E
25|$|In M, {{characters}} are awarded Power Points (similar to experience points) <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> many beneficial {{things for the}} character. As described above, Power Points (abbreviated pp.) are used to purchase powers, feats, skills, abilities, and devices. The specific nature of Power Points was changed drastically with the 2nd edition (2e) of Mutants & Masterminds. In the first edition, when a character accrues 15 pp, they advance a Power Level, thus raising the caps on power and skill ranks, {{as well as on}} power bonus stacking. There were options to keep the Power Level the same while increasing total number of points (and many sample antagonists in the Game Master setting have more points than their Power Level would suggest), but these have been incorporated into the 2nd edition rules.|$|E

Matt Casamassina of IGN praised the developers' work commenting they have [...] "done a fine job of taking Nintendo's dated franchise and updating it for the new generation" [...] and summed up the general opinion by stating that [...] "For some, GX will be the ultimate racer. For others, it will be flat out too difficult." [...] In Japan, F-Zero GX sold 100,981 units and became qualified for the Player's Choice line in both Europe and North America by selling at least 250,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|The fifth, and last, of David's volumes {{consisting}} {{primarily of}} recipes {{is by far}} the longest of them. The 1970 paperback edition published by Penguin Books runs to 584 pages. David's biographer Artemis Cooper describes it as [...] "a book that only needed assembling", because it was based on previously published articles and her own collection of notes and recipes from the previous two decades. David researched her recipes thoroughly, and whenever several supposedly classic and mutually contradictory recipes existed she [...] "knew how to reduce a recipe to its bare essentials, and then reconstruct it". By the 1960s, she was described in the British press as [...] "the most revered goddess of cooking", and The Observer said, [...] "It is difficult to think of any home <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> without [...] Elizabeth David's [...] French Provincial Cooking.|$|E

Kirkwood said that [...] "Darren's one of my {{favourite}} characters". Fellow producer Paul Marquess spoke positively of Dawson's performance in an interview with Digital Spy, stating, [...] "I think Ashley Taylor Dawson, who plays Darren, is a really strong actor, {{and by the end of}} this year we'll see a very different side to his character". Co-star Kieron Richardson commented on Dawson's performance as Darren, calling Dawson one of the serial's [...] "strongest actors", adding that Dawson compelled him to watch when he was on screen. Richardson added that Dawson [...] "makes me laugh, he does comedy really well and he does vulnerability really well".|$|E
500|$|During the {{classical}} period, the main justification for slavery was economic. From a philosophical point of view, {{the idea of}} [...] "natural" [...] slavery emerged at the same time; thus, as Aeschylus states in The Persians, the Greeks [...] "f no man are they called the slaves or vassals", while the Persians, as Euripides states in Helen, [...] "are all slaves, except one" [...] — the Great King. Hippocrates theorizes about this latent idea {{at the end of}} the 5th century BC. According to him, the temperate climate of Anatolia produced a placid and submissive people. This explanation is reprised by Plato, then Aristotle in Politics, where he develops the concept of [...] "natural slavery": [...] "for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave." [...] As opposed to an animal, a slave can comprehend reason but [...] "…has not got the deliberative part at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Žigić played {{regularly}} {{through the}} 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign under {{the management of}} Radomir Antić, contributing three goals and partnering former Red Star teammate Marko Pantelić as Serbia qualified for a major tournament {{for the first time}} as an independent nation. Ahead of the tournament proper, he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006: [...] "I went to Germany as player with no reputation or real experience to speak of. Tactically, I have learned a lot and I'm in much better condition, both physically and psychologically. This is my World Cup, I think I can play a lead role and I want to show I'm a player <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it in big games." [...] After losing to Ghana in the opening group match, Serbia went on to face Germany. Within two minutes of Miroslav Klose's first-half dismissal, Žigić headed a cross down to Milan Jovanović who scored what proved to be the only goal of the game; Lukas Podolski's second-half penalty was saved, and Antić dedicated the victory to the Serbian people. In a game of missed chances against Australia, Serbia lost 2–1 and finished bottom of the group.|$|E
