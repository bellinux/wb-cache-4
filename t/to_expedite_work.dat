40|$|In the {{chemical}} processing industries, there is tremendous pressure {{to shorten the}} time to market. The urgency is particularly felt in pharmaceutical industry since {{the development of a}} successful drug from concept to finished product can take over a decade. Cost is also an important issue. Effective communication {{plays a key role in}} reducing the process development time, since the conversion of a bench scale recipe to a scalable process involves different parties with divergent focus of work. It is important that critical data/information be available at the right time <b>to</b> <b>expedite</b> the <b>work</b> process. This dissertation responds to the process development challenges encountered during crystallization process synthesis, which plays an important role in generating high purity solid products. We have presented an approach for integrating chemistry research and process design with the use of composition space. The approach guides members in a process development team to identify the feasible process alternatives by integrating different activities (e. g. experiment and modeling) in an effective manner. Since the approach is intended to provide a general framework for synthesizing crystallization process for simple organic substances, further details on specific issues are required to extend its application for synthesizing organics with complex solid-liquid equilibrium phase behavior. The approach for synthesizing polymorphs and solid solutions are therefore presented as they are commonly found in specialty chemicals. Further development efforts involving experimental work is necessary to obtain a more realistic process design. Important experimental data are first defined and then determined before process synthesis takes place. To illustrate this point, the development of separation and purification of amino acids, L-leucine and L-valine, which exhibit solid solution phase behavior, is thoroughly discussed...|$|R

Research on {{sickness}} absence focuses on interventions aimed at <b>expediting</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> However, {{we need to know}} more about sustaining employees at work after return to work. Therefore, this study investigated the recurrence of sickness absence according to diagnosis. Methods We analyzed the registered sickness absence data of 137, 172 employees working for the Dutch Post and Telecom. Episodes of sickness absence were medically certified, according to the ICD- 10 classification of diseases, by an occupational physician. The incidence density (ID) and recurrence density (RD) of medically certified absences were calculated per 1, 000 person-years in each ICD- 10 category. Results Sickness absence due to musculoskeletal disorders had the highest recurrence (RD = 118. 7 per 1, 000 person-years), followed by recurrence of sickness absence due to mental disorders (RD = 80. 4 per 1, 000 person-years). The median time to recurrent sickness absence due to musculoskeletal disorders was 409 days after the index episode. Recurrences of sickness absence due to musculoskeletal disorders accounted for 37 % {{of the total number of}} recurrent sickness absence days. For recurrences of sickness absence due to mental disorders this was 328 days and 21 %, respectively. Unskilled employees with a short duration (< 5 years) of employment had a higher risk of recurrent sickness absence.

The 1968 Constitutional Law of Federation specified that the national governments directed and controlled the activities of all national committees within their respective territories. The system of national committees was established at the close of World War II by the then-existing provisional government and was used by the communists as a means of consolidating and extending their control. On the local level, the membership of the national committees consisted of from fifteen to twenty-five persons. National committees on the higher levels were proportionately larger: national committees at the district level had from 60 to 120 members, and national committees at the kraje level had between 80 and 150 members. National committee members were popularly elected for five-year terms of office. Each national committee elected a council from among its membership. The council, composed of a chairman, one or more deputy chairmen, a secretary, and an unspecified number of members, acted as the coordinating and controlling body of the national committee. <b>To</b> <b>expedite</b> the <b>work</b> of the national committee, the council established commissions and other subcommittees and could issue decrees and ordinances within its area of jurisdiction. The national committees on the local level were assigned particular areas of jurisdiction, including maintaining public order and organizing the implementation of the political, economic, and cultural tasks assigned by the KSC and the federal government.
