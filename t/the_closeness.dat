5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and <b>the</b> <b>closeness</b> of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E

5|$|A thorium atom has 90 electrons, {{of which}} four are valence electrons. Three atomic orbitals are {{theoretically}} {{available for the}} valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, {{even more so than}} the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger {{near the bottom of the}} periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin–orbit interaction. <b>The</b> <b>closeness</b> in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, for which +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As an {{important}} metric in graphs, group closeness centrality measures how close {{a group of}} vertices is to all other vertices in a graph, and it is used in numerous graph applications such as measuring the dominance and influence of a node group over the graph. However, when a large-scale graph contains {{hundreds of millions of}} nodes/edges which cannot reside entirely in computer’s main memory, measuring and maximizing group closeness become challenging tasks. In this paper, we present a systematic solution for efficiently calculating and maximizing <b>the</b> group <b>closeness</b> for disk-resident graphs. Our solution first leverages a “probabilistic counting method ” to efficiently estimate <b>the</b> group <b>closeness</b> with high accuracy, rather than exhaustively computing it in an exact fashion. In addition, we design an I/O-efficient greedy algorithm to find a node group that maximizes <b>the</b> group <b>closeness.</b> Our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of random accesses to disk, thereby dramatically improving computational efficiency. Experiments on real-world big graphs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. I...|$|R
