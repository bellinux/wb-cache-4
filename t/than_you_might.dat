Later, while {{reviewing}} the Wonder World Tour, he elaborated that {{the song was}} a reminder [...] "that manufactured pop {{need not be a}} bad thing – if the manufacturing is good enough". Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music said, [...] "Fortunately for Cyrus, [...] flee your brain cells within seconds of their final chords, which means you're more likely to remember the breezily brilliant hit 'Party in the U.S.A.'" [...] Mikael Wood of New York City's Time Out magazine described the song as a [...] "killer tune [...] which proves that Miley makes for a much better rapper <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect". Heather Phares of AllMusic selected the track as one of the EPs best, describing it as a frothy party anthem suitable for Cyrus' alias, Hannah Montana. > Review|first=Heather|last=Phares|work=Allmusic|accessdate=August 29, 2010}} ...|$|E
500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> think. I worked on it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable. But I got some good, funny feedback from it, so I'm glad it worked out." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Die Hand Die Verletzt" [...] {{was written}} by Glen Morgan and James Wong, who were co-executive {{producers}} for the series as well as writers. The episode originally stemmed from an idea of Glen Morgan's to have a scene where a snake eats a man. [...] Series creator Chris Carter described the episode as [...] "a cautionary tale about playing with fire, playing with things bigger and badder <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> imagine". In an interview, he also praised the purposefully clashing tones of the entry, noting that it begins almost comical, with the PTC saying Satanic prayers and toads raining from the skies. However, as it goes on, it becomes increasingly dark. Morgan and co-writer James Wong left the series after this episode to produce the series [...] The line written by Mrs. Paddock on a chalkboard {{at the end of}} the episode, [...] "It's been nice working with you," [...] also acted as a goodbye to the crew of the show. The two later returned to the show in the fourth season.|$|E

500|$|Smoking {{cigarettes}} {{has become}} synonymous with Dot, and Brown {{has suggested that the}} habit is [...] "intrinsic" [...] to the character. Following the 2007 England smoking ban, it was reported in the Daily Mail that the BBC were refusing to prohibit the character from smoking on-screen despite the act being banned in workplaces, as they have [...] "to portray real life– and people smoke". Dot's smoking was criticised by private healthcare company Bupa in 2008, when they rated her television's most unhealthy character. They suggest that, in order to spread a public message, Dot should appear breathless, not with [...] "implausibly good health". They added, [...] "Though Dot Cotton has a smoker's voice– deeper <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect, she {{does not seem to be}} short of breath or wheezy" [...] and that viewers would be influenced by this. However, Dot's smoking has been described by broadcasting watchdogs Ofcom as [...] "justified in the context of the programme as a representation of an East End character" [...] and they therefore stipulate that enforcement of broadcast smoking-sanctions would be unlikely on EastEnders.|$|E
500|$|At the film's release at the Sundance Film Festival, {{film critic}} Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News {{compared}} {{the effect of}} Reservoir Dogs {{to that of the}} 1895 film L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat, whereby audiences supposedly saw a moving train approaching the camera and ducked. Bernard said that Reservoir Dogs had a similar effect and people were not ready for it. Vincent Canby of The New York Times enjoyed the cast and the usage of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino's directing and liked {{the fact that he did}} not often use close-ups in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times also enjoyed the film and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said [...] "Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> suspect." [...] Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino's dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the film on its [...] "deadpan sense of humor".|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} a generally positive reception and holds a 76% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 145 reviews. Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman gave The Young Victoria a B+; he gave praise to Emily Blunt's performance and concluded, [...] "The Young Victoria has a subtler flow <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect, {{and at times}} it's calmer than you may like. Director Jean-Marc Vallée's images have a creamy stateliness, {{but this is no}} gilded princess fantasy — it's the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings, and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it a [...] "frivolously entertaining film" [...] and believed it was [...] "directed with some snap by Jean-Marc Vallée". Dargis finished her review, [...] "Despite the filmmakers’ efforts to persuade us that The Young Victoria is a serious work, and despite some tense moments and gunfire, the film’s pleasures are as light as its story. No matter. Albert may never rip Victoria’s bodice, but he does eventually loosen it, to her delight and ours." ...|$|E

500|$|John Anderson of Los Angeles Times commented [...] "Spears acquits {{herself as}} well as anyone might, in a movie as {{contrived}} and lazy as this one". Chris Kaltenbach of Baltimore Sun said, [...] "go see Crossroads if you want to hear Britney sing or see her wear next-to-nothing. But otherwise, avoid this train wreck at all costs". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, however, gave the movie a positive review, commenting Crossroads [...] "not only makes excellent use of the singer's sweetly coltish acting abilities, but it also promotes a standardized set of sturdy values with none of Mariah Carey's desperate Glitter, or any of Mandy Moore's gummy pap in A Walk to Remember". Bret Fetzer of Amazon.com also gave a positive review, noting that the movie [...] "could have been trite schmaltz, but the script has some grit and the direction is fresh and relaxed--and, most significantly, Spears is far more sympathetic and engaging <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect". Jane Crowther of BBC applauded Cattrall and Aykroyd's interactions with the characters, and said that [...] "Spears manages to come across on film as natural, endearing, and extremely likable". Time named it one of the top 10 worst chick flicks.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} one of two X-Files episodes to take place in real time—wherein events are {{presented}} at the same rate that the audience experiences them—the other being the sixth season episode [...] "Triangle". Due {{to the nature of the}} shooting schedule, the episode was relatively cheap to film and production moved at a quick pace. Initially, the actors struggled with the new cinéma vérité style of the episode, and several takes were needed for scenes during the first few days, but these problems receded as filming progressed. On one night, three-and-a-half pages of script were shot in only two hours; the normal rate for The X-Files was three to four pages a day. Both Watkins and Mills likened the filming of the episode to live theater. The former noted, [...] "In a sense we were doing theater: we were doing an act, or half of a whole act in one take." [...] Anderson called the performance [...] "fun" [...] to shoot, and highlighted [...] "Scully getting pissed off at the camera crew" [...] as her favorite part to play. She further noted that [...] "it was interesting to make the adjustment to playing something more real <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> play for television." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick Stewart {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jean-Luc Picard after Justman saw him perform at the University of California, Los Angeles. Roddenberry insisted that he wanted a French actor in the role, but Justman {{arranged}} a meeting between Stewart and the production team to introduce the actor, and later Berman supported the casting. Fontana thought that American actor Stephen Macht would be better in the role. Justman wanted Stewart in the show in some capacity, and with Roddenberry still opposing him as Picard, Justman suggested that he might be a good fit instead for Data. Because Roddenberry couldn't find an actor he preferred more for Picard, he relented and changed his concept of Picard to better fit Stewart. Although Stewart was willing to put on an American accent to portray the role of Picard, the producers asked him to use his natural accent instead. They also tested him with a hairpiece but thought that it looked [...] "awful". Stewart was pleased to have received the role, saying that his children were impressed with the new part and praised the mythos of the show saying, [...] "The great strength of Star Trek is its epic, classic feel. For an actor of my background, it has more richness and depth <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect on television." ...|$|E

500|$|De Boer {{felt that}} the {{producers}} {{did a good job}} with involving Ezri {{over the course of the}} seventh season, but not to the extent that it detracted from the more established members of the main cast. However, there was one part of the season where she was concerned that the fans would suffer from [...] "Ezri overload". But she {{felt that the}} character had a real story arc and character evolution as the season went by. She said that she did not want Ezri to remain the same [...] "young and confused" [...] person that she was in her first appearances, which was something that the writers and producers agreed with. She said that [...] "As time went on, you saw that Ezri was intelligent, that she was endearing and a good person. She became a more complicated character <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have thought in her first few episodes." [...] She praised specific episodes which evolved the character, such as [...] "The Siege of AR-558" [...] which required Ezri to draw upon Dax's past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed [...] "" [...] as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in [...] "" [...] were [...] "fascinating". As she approached the end of Deep Space Nine, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining , saying that [...] "My first instinct would be to say no. I would need to feel there was a reason for Ezri to be on Voyager". She was interviewed at the series wrap party after completing filming on the final episode, [...] "What You Leave Behind", and said, [...] "The last episode was very emotional, especially on the last day... I couldn't believe that a season had gone by already. I realized all the people I'd grown close to must be feeling it much more because they'd been doing it 7 years. I cried." ...|$|E

[...] She went on to call the [...] "shared vocals... refreshing and upbeat," [...] concluding that [...] "Gordon is a great introduction to the Barenaked Ladies' sweet comic relief."

2500|$|By {{the second}} season, {{critical}} reception warmed. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post and noted critic Alan Sepinwall remained ambivalent towards the show; otherwise critics were uniformly positive. In particular, several critics noted improvements from season one. Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "Big Love has dropped {{the last vestiges of}} its ostentatious quirkiness and fashioned {{itself into a}} rich and grounded family drama," [...] and Diane Werts of Newsday said that [...] "'Big Love' does more this year <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect, and more richly, more provocatively, more dramatically and amusingly, too." [...] The second season was cited among the best shows of 2007 by numerous publications, including PopMatters, the San Francisco Chronicle, Time Magazine, Entertainment Weekly and NPR.|$|E
2500|$|After Hilton hosted NBC's Saturday Night Live in February 2005 with Keane as {{the musical}} guest she {{received}} her first major role, starring with Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray in the horror film House of Wax.

In View London, Matthew Turner said that Hilton [...] "does better <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect". Although MTV thought her [...] "actually pretty good", TV Guide called Hilton [...] "talentless". Her role as Paige Edwards won the Teen Choice Award for Best Scream and earned her a nomination for Choice Breakout Performance– Female; it also won her the 2005 Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress at the 2005 Golden Raspberry Awards.

2500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, was {{favourable}} of 'Gotta Be You', {{referring to}} Austin as [...] " [...] clearly knows where Sugababes' strengths lie", further stating [...] " [...] adds a light, but nonetheless thrilling dusting of monotonal crunk-influenced synthesised honking to 'Gotta Be You'." [...] He was less favourable about their cover of 'Obsession', stating, [...] "sadly, Sugababes' version sands off the edges rather than amps up the lunacy: what's left is like 1980s night at karaoke". He also remarks that [...] "you {{get the impression}} that they would be happier making R". In conclusion, however, he states that [...] "the album's strike rate is far higher <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect from a manufactured pop act's fourth album; it avoids the obvious pitfalls and its highpoints are genuinely high", giving the album 3 out of 5 stars.|$|E

2500|$|John Aizlewood {{from the}} London Evening Standard was {{confused}} about what Hotel Cabana was conceptualising but called Naughty Boy's collaborations with Sandé [...] "stellar", praising [...] "Pluto" [...] (also featuring Wretch 32) and [...] "Wonder". Aizlewood said [...] "the result sounds like a compilation album, but a filler-free one where almost every song is capable of standing alone." [...] The Independents Andy Gill awarded it the [...] "Album of the Week", praising Sandé's performance on the album, described as [...] "an impassioned lead". AllMusic rated it 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "unapologetically ostentatious, skillfully constructed pop." [...] The Times rated it 3 out of 5 stars, saying it [...] "proves far more interesting <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> imagine" [...] but was critical of the album's reliance on Sandé and described Ed Sheeran as [...] "her twin in tedium, bleating away".|$|E
2500|$|Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle {{believed}} {{the film to}} be [...] "an odd picture, a rumination on depression and self-discovery that's couched as an office comedy." [...] Although Meyer said that the film is [...] "never truly funny or insightful," [...] she did give the picture some credit, stating that [...] "the movie works intermittently by digging a little deeper <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> expect." [...] Meyer also approved of the performances of Allen, Belushi, and Warburton. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times likened the film to [...] "an afterschool special, with grownups cast in the kids' roles." [...] Ebert also called the film [...] "crashingly obvious," [...] later remarking that the audience is [...] "faced with the dismal prospect of being denied a climax, which, if it occurred, {{would be just as}} predictable as its substitute." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{disapproved of}} Sonic 3D Blasts gameplay style, some finding its isometric perspective limiting. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN lamented that [...] "the sense {{of speed and}} intense action that Sonic's name was built on is absent here, replaced by, essentially, a looping, lazy fetchquest". Austin Shau of GameSpot echoed this concern, calling the gameplay [...] "an exercise in tedium". Besides the game's goals, Shau and Thomas criticized the controls, particularly {{in the area of}} Sonic's overly slow-paced movement and slippery deceleration. Thomas did admit that the game [...] "has its moments" [...] of quick-footed vigor, but characterized these as few and far between, and Shau summarized that, while not unsalvageable in isolation, the game's elements violently clashed and customers would be [...] "spending 800 Wii points for a vat of oil and water". Damien McFerran of NintendoLife stated that its repetition was broken only by its boss battles and special stages, the latter of which Shau wrote off as [...] "childishly easy". Reflecting on its complaints years earlier upon the game's inclusion in Sonic Mega Collection Plus, however, Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com called the game [...] "much better <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be led to believe".|$|E
