50|$|A <b>tracing</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{also known}} as a pattern wheel, pounce wheel, and dart wheel, is an {{instrument}} with multiple teeth on a wheel attached to a handle. The teeth can be either serrated or smooth. It is used to transfer markings from patterns onto fabric with or without tracing paper, this sewing tool also makes slotted perforations. Such markings might include pleats, darts, buttonholes, notches or placement s for appliques or pockets.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of modern-day home sewing patterns contain multiple sizes in one pattern. Once a pattern {{is removed from}} a package, you can either cut the pattern based on the size you will be making or you can preserve the pattern by tracing it. The pattern is traced onto fabric using one of several methods. In one method, tracing paper with transferable ink on one side is placed between the pattern and the fabric. A <b>tracing</b> <b>wheel</b> is moved over the pattern outlines, transferring the markings onto the fabric with ink that is removable by erasing or washing. In another method, tracing paper is laid directly over a purchased pattern, and the pieces are traced. The pieces are cut, then the tracing paper is pinned and/or basted to the fabric. The fabric can then be cut to match the outlines on the tracing paper. Vintage patterns may come with small holes pre-punched into the pattern paper. These are for creating tailor's tacks, a type of basting where thread is sewn into the fabric in short lengths {{to serve as a}} guideline for cutting and assembling fabric pieces.|$|E

As compensation, Zane asked for a grant of land at three river crossings, where he would establish ferry service. A committee recommended action, and vouched for Zane’s competence and character, and the general utility of the road.|$|R
60|$|Such was the {{ordinary}} experience, but this evening we had camped earlier {{on account of}} the rain, and had more time. We found that our camp was on an old indistinct supply-road, running along the river. What is called a road there shows no ruts or <b>trace</b> of <b>wheels,</b> for they are not used; nor, indeed, of runners, since they are used only in the winter when the snow is several feet deep.

The road was mainly a winding path with hoof-prints in it, and now and then a faint <b>trace</b> of <b>wheels</b> on either side in the grass--wheels that {{apparently}} had a tire as broad as one's hand.|$|R

The company was authorized to increase its capitalization to $100,000 through the sale of additional shares with the value of $100 each.

50|$|The Amsler (polar) type {{consists}} of a two-bar linkage. At {{the end of one}} link is a pointer, used to trace around the boundary of the shape to be measured. The other end of the linkage pivots freely on a weight that keeps it from moving. Near the junction of the two links is a measuring wheel of calibrated diameter, with a scale to show fine rotation, and worm gearing for an auxiliary turns counter scale. As the area outline is <b>traced,</b> this <b>wheel</b> rolls {{on the surface of the}} drawing. The operator sets the wheel, turns counter to zero, and then traces the pointer around the perimeter of the shape. When the tracing is complete, the scales at the measuring wheel show the shape's area.|$|R
40|$|Te {{objective}} of the research was determination {{of the impact of}} load-ing capacity of fertilization sets on soil compaction. Degree of soil compaction was determined based on four indexes. Three fertilization sets were selected for research: set A – tractor Renault 95. 14 plus a waste removal vehicle of cubic capacity of 6 m 3, set B – tractor John Deere 6420 plus a waste removal vehicle 12 m 3, and set C Valtra N 121 plus a waste removal vehicle 8 m 3. Four indexes were deter-mined: field area compaction, loading a field with sets crossings, degree of compaction in the <b>trace</b> of <b>wheels</b> and cubic capacity of ruts. It was determined that the biggest surface of the compacted field was for the set A (27 %) and the smallest for the set B (16 %). Loading of a field with the sets crossings was the highest also for the set A (212 kN·km·ha- 1) and the lowest for the set B (167 kN·km·ha- 1). Degree of compaction in the <b>trace</b> of <b>wheels</b> was the highest for the set B (105 kN·m- 1) and the lowest for the set A (77 kN·m- 1). The highest cubic capacity of ruts was determined on the field fertilized with the set A (99 m 3) and the lowest for the set B (61 m 3). From among the technical parameters of fertilization machines the following affect the soil compaction degree: tractor mass and a waste removal vehicle mass and its cubic capacity and the working width, which depends on the application unit which was used. The set B may be recognized as the the best selected fertilization set (a tractor and a waste removal vehicle) on account of soil compaction and the least favourable – the set A.

40|$|Abstract — For {{a mobile}} robot it is {{critical}} to detect and compensate for slippage, especially when driving in rough terrain environments. Due to its highly unpredictable nature, drift largely affects the accuracy of localization and control systems, even leading, in extreme cases, to the danger of vehicle entrapment with consequent mission failure. This paper presents a novel method for lateral slip estimation based on visually observing the trace produced by the wheels of the robot, during traverse of soft, deformable terrain, as that expected for lunar and planetary rovers. The proposed algorithm uses a robust Hough transform enhanced by fuzzy reasoning to estimate the angle of inclination of the <b>wheel</b> <b>trace</b> with respect to the vehicle reference frame. Any deviation of the <b>wheel</b> <b>trace</b> from the planned path of the robot suggests occurrence of sideslip that can be detected, and more interestingly, measured. This allows one to estimate the actual heading angle of the robot, usually referred to as the slip angle. The details of the various steps of the visual algorithm are presented and the results of experimental tests performed in the field with an all-terrain rover are shown, proving the method to be effective and robust.

60|$|The road to {{the house}} bore very few <b>traces</b> of {{carriage}} <b>wheels,</b> as my cousin received few visitors but such as came on foot or on horseback, and never used a carriage himself. Once, indeed, as I was told, he had had the old family carriage drawn out from among the dust and cobwebs of the coachhouse and furbished up, and had drove, with his mother, to the village church to take formal possession of the family pew; but there was such hooting and laughing after them as they passed through the village, and such giggling and bantering about the church door, that the pageant had never made a reappearance.|$|R
50|$|After {{the merger}} of the West and East German {{railways}} to create Deutsche Bahn AG, the large fleet of this very robust and reliable East German locomotive was no longer wanted on German rails.

The Deutsche Bahn finally reduced its permitted maximum speed to 80 km/h, which meant it could {{be taken out of}} service because this speed was too low for duties on main lines. Individual locomotives were later equipped with special shock absorbers on their bogies to counter the rocking motion.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{approximation}} {{to perfect}} Ackermann steering geometry may be generated {{by moving the}} steering pivot points inward so as to lie on a line drawn between the steering kingpins and {{the centre of the}} rear axle.

6000|$|A {{distinguished}} {{and accomplished}} country gentleman and politician, of scientific tastes, was {{riding in the}} New Forest, some twelve miles from {{the place where he}} was residing. In a grassy glade he discovered that he did not very clearly know his way to a country town which he intended to visit. At this moment, {{on the other side of}} some bushes a carriage drove along, and then came into clear view where there was a gap in the bushes. Mr. Hyndford saw it perfectly distinctly; it was a slightly antiquated family carriage, the sides were in that imitation of wicker work on green panel which was once so common. The coachman was a respectable family servant, he drove two horses: two old ladies were in the carriage, one of them wore a hat, the other a bonnet. They passed, and then Mr. Hyndford, going through the gap in the bushes, rode after them to ask his way. There was no carriage in sight, the avenue ended in a cul-de-sac of tangled brake, and there were no <b>traces</b> of <b>wheels</b> on the grass. Mr. Hyndford rode back to his original point of view, and looked for any object which could suggest the illusion of one old-fashioned carriage, one coachman, two horses and two elderly ladies, one in a hat and one in a bonnet. He looked in vain--and that is all! ...|$|R

60|$|Just {{opposite}} to us, {{at the other}} side of the broad, white road, was the Friar's Oak Inn, which was kept in my day by John Cummings, a man of excellent repute at home, but liable to strange outbreaks when he travelled, as will afterwards become apparent. Though there was a stream of traffic upon the road, the coaches from Brighton were too fresh to stop, and those from London too eager to reach their journey's end, so that if it had not been for an occasional broken <b>trace</b> or loosened <b>wheel,</b> the landlord would have had only the thirsty throats of the village to trust to. Those were the days when the Prince of Wales had just built his singular palace by the sea, and so from May to September, which was the Brighton season, there was never a day that from one to two hundred curricles, chaises, and phaetons did not rattle past our doors. Many a summer evening have Boy Jim and I lain upon the grass, watching all these grand folk, and cheering the London coaches as they came roaring through the dust clouds, leaders and wheelers stretched to their work, the bugles screaming and the coachmen with their low-crowned, curly-brimmed hats, and their faces as scarlet as their coats. The passengers used to laugh when Boy Jim shouted at them, but if they could have read his big, half-set limbs and his loose shoulders aright, they would have looked a little harder at him, perhaps, and given him back his cheer.|$|R
60|$|DURING A {{pedestrian}} trip last summer, through {{one or two}} of the river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of B-, where I had determined to stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone--strictly speaking--during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly warm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all things, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much about the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or even before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its appearance--although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. At all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me. I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease--Ponto taking charge of my gun--until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended to be paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The <b>traces</b> of light <b>wheels</b> were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon--the most aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in being open through the wood--if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of light trees--and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks--bore no resemblance to any road I had before seen. The tracks of which I speak were but faintly perceptible--having been impressed upon the firm, yet pleasantly moist surface of--what looked more like green Genoese velvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly--but grass such as we seldom see out of England--so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in color. Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route--not even a chip or dead twig. The stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully placed--not thrown-along the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere, luxuriantly, in the interspaces.|$|R
40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2013 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Ülkemiz çalışma ortamında yaşanan en önemli günümüz sorunlarından biri de yıllardan beri süre gelen, düzeltme çalışmalarının halen yetersiz olduğu işçi sağlığı ve iş güvenliği problemidir. Her iş günü yaklaşık 1 ’i ölümlü 21 iş kazasının gerçekleştiği inşaat sektörü ise bu problemin kendini en çok hissettirdiği faaliyet kollarından biri olarak ilk sıralarda yer almaktadır. Bu çalışmada, işçi sağlığı ve iş güvenliği kavramının önemine ve tarihsel gelişimine değinilmiştir. Ardından, Sosyal Güvenlik Kurumu istatistik yıllıklarından yararlanılarak işçi sağlığı ve iş güvenliği bakımından sayısal değerlendirmeler, faaliyet kolları arasında ve inşaat sektörü içinde bazı değerlendirmeler yapılmıştır. Değerlendirmeler ışığında, inşaat sektörünün diğer kollarının aksine karayollarındaki çalışma alanlarında, saha içi çalışanlar ve sistem kullanıcıları birbirinden tam olarak ayrı tutulamadığından iş güvenliği sorunlarının yanında trafik güvenliği sorunlarının da belirgin olarak ortaya çıktığı görülmüştür. Böylelikle güvenliğin, çalışma alanlarındaki işçiler için olduğu kadar her gün binlerce insanın kullandığı karayollarındaki sürücüler ve yayalar için de hayati önem taşıdığının altı çizilmiştir. Büyük kentler için özellikle önemli olan şehir içi karayollarında gerçekleştirilen çalışmaların, trafiğe getirdiği olağandışı ekstra yük ile trafik güvenliği açısından risk artışına sebep olduğu saptanmıştır. Sadece inşaat faaliyet kolu çalışanları olarak bile düşünüldüğünde büyük bir kesimi ilgilendiren şantiyelerdeki iş güvenliği durumunun, bu faaliyet kolunun etki alanının toplumu da içine alması ile daha fazla sorgulanmasını gerektirmektedir. Bu nedenle, tez kapsamında sektör içinde iş ve trafik güvenliği açısından önemli bir yer tuttuğuna inanılan karayolu şantiyeleri üzerinde durulmuştur. Araştırma kapsamında ayrıca karayolu yapım, bakım ve onarım çalışmalarından ve bu çalışmalarda karşılaşılan sorunlardan bahsedilmiştir. Bu gibi çalışmaların yolu kullananlar üzerindeki etkisi bazı dava dosyaları ile desteklenerek, gözler önüne serilmiştir. Kamu alanlarına müdahalenin fazlaca olduğu şantiyelerin gerektirdiği güvenlik önlemlerinin, işçinin yanında toplum açısından da gerekliliğini vurgulayan şehir şantiyeciliğinden bahsedilmiştir. Ayrıca çalışmaları ve trafiği beraber ilgilendiren yol yapım, bakım ve onarımlarında alınması gerekli önlemler ve trafik işaretleme standartlarına ve çalışmalar sırasında yapılması gereken kontrollere değinilmiştir. Son olarak da uygulamaları kolaylaştırıcı ve iyileştirici öneriler sunulmuştur. One of {{the most}} {{significant}} problems in the present working environment is the health and safety at work, which has been an ongoing problem for years and the corrective efforts are still insufficient. In our country, the frequency of the accidents, having the first place among world countries in terms of accidents, increase the importance of the issue. One {{of the most}} important reasons for this situation is that the specific conditions of the construction activities. From past to present, there has occurred most improvements in the health and occupational safety regulations although, applications not yet reached the desired level. It is shown that illiteracy as a cause of this situation. Therefore, it is important to focus on the educational component. Construction industry is among the leading branches of business where this problem can be felt significantly, as there are approximately 21 work accidents with 1 involving death every workday. In this study, the importance and historical evolution of the term ‘health and safety at work’ is mentioned. Following this, using the statistical annuals of the Social Security Institution, numerical assessments in terms of health and safety at work, assessments between various branches of activities and assessments in the construction industry are performed. Occupational safety is the significant problem that should be considered at construction sites. On the other hand, it is not expected to {{have the same kind of}} risks and accidents in each construction sites. At the present, requirements of infrastructure such as highway and sewer continue to increase for parallel with the development of cities. So these requirements cause that construction sites, which incorporates elements of hazard, interfere to areas of public. In the light of these assessments, besides the health and safety problems, traffic safety problems also occurs distinctly in the highway construction sites, since the workers in the highway construction sites and the system users cannot be completely separated from each other. Many studies which include construction activities have been executed and are still executing about occupational safety. However lack of studies, which is dangerous for both workers and users, about construction activities carried out in urban is attracted attention. Whereas many deaths, injuries and material loss are caused by accidents of near urban construction sites. The vital importance of safety is underlined not only for workers in the jobsite, but also for thousands of drivers and pedestrians that use highways every day. Due to this intervention some additional safety precautions should be taken for both employees and public. Developed a system that aims to secure not only for workers but also for public who lives unaware of the risks. Construction sites can be safe when workers are aware of hazards and prevent the probable risks. From past to present, many studies have been executed about occupational health and safety. Also at the present, it is thought that works affect not only employees in fields of works but also people around the work areas. Urban roads are especially important for major cities and it is determined that the construction works performed on these urban roads cause extraordinary increase in the traffic and consequently cause an increase in the traffic safety risk. The health and safety at construction sites concerns a significant part of the society even when only construction industry workers are considered. This concern should increase when highway construction sites are considered since this industry involves the society within its influence area. Considering the interventions to public, it is seen to be a risk of works that maintenance, repair and renovation of existing roads more than others. It is necessary to investigate the current situation and what can be done for this problem because of lack of studies about. For this reason, it is intended that risks caused by maintenance and repair works carried out on the roads and current situation are revealed within the scope of this study. So, highway construction sites are emphasized within the scope of this study since it is believed that these sites have a significant place in terms of health and safety at work and traffic safety at the same time. In this thesis, firstly it is described that the current situation and the development of occupation safety in Turkey and the world. After, the statistics of work and traffic accidents which published annually by Turkish Statistical Institute, Labor and Social Security Institution and General Directorate of Security are discussed. Accidents of costruction sector has been compared with others between 2008 and 2011. Besides, 73 case files are examined in this thesis and risk assessment which about maintenance and repair works on the roads. In this context, work items on road works have defined and the risk scores of these are calculated. For calculating this risk assessment, 5 x 5 Risk Assessment Decision Matrix Method is used. It was concluded that people, especially to the drivers are most responsible for accidents but it also was seen that the road faults have not been enough in statistics. Besides it is found that road failures such as <b>wheel</b> <b>trace,</b> road pit and lack of road signs have a significant problems for traffic. It is mentioned what kind of work done in roads and problems of encountered in these works. Besides the statistics shows that many workers have been hired without any insurance however they are faced with many accidents. Finally, it is focused on what can be done for the safety of the work site and its surrounding area and it has been made suggestions on these problem. Construction and maintenance works and the problems faced during these works are examined in this study. The effects such works on the road users are given and they are supported by several case documents. As in many countries, deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents are a major public health problem in Turkey. It is mentioned that construction sites in the urban areas emphasizes necessity of security precautions required in construction sites that has great interference on public domains not only for workers but also for public. Because not taking the enough precautions for the work and traffic accidents cause more problems. Necessary controls during working process, standards related to traffic signs, and precautions to be taken for road construction, maintenance and repair which concerns both construction works and traffic are mentioned. Finally, suggestions to facilitate and correct applications are presented. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
