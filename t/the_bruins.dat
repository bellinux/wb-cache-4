5|$|After {{finishing}} last in 1966–67, <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> {{qualified for}} the 1968 playoffs, their first appearance in the playoffs since the 1958–59 season. In the pre-season, <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> added Phil Esposito, Fred Stanfield and Ken Hodge from the Chicago Black Hawks {{in one of the}} most famous deals ever. <b>The</b> <b>Bruins</b> also added rookies Glen Sather and Derek Sanderson, developing a more aggressive image that led to the nickname of the 'Big Bad Bruins.' <b>The</b> <b>Bruins,</b> happy to make the playoffs, were swept by eventual champion Montreal in the first round.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} round of the 2011 NHL playoffs, Horton scored a game-winning {{overtime}} goal for <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> in both games five and seven to help <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> win the series over the Montreal Canadiens. A third period goal by Horton against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the only goal of game 7, later sent <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> to the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|Orr joined <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> for the 1966–67 season, {{his first}} as a professional. <b>The</b> <b>Bruins</b> were not {{convinced}} Orr belonged on defence, trying him out at centre first. Through the pre-season, Orr was given jersey number 27. At the season's start, <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> offered him jersey number 5, that of past Bruins star Dit Clapper, but Orr chose jersey number 4. Orr made his NHL regular-season debut on October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, getting one assist. On October 22, he scored his first NHL goal against the Montreal Canadiens. It was a slap shot past Gump Worsley and the Boston Garden crowd gave Orr a standing ovation.|$|E

5|$|The 1975–76 {{season was}} Orr's final season with <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> {{and it was}} tumultuous. Orr's {{contract}} was ending after the season, potentially making him a free agent. <b>The</b> <b>Bruins</b> were sold by Storer Broadcasting in August 1975 and the new Jacobs ownership group had to promise to keep Orr {{as a condition of}} the purchase. <b>The</b> <b>Bruins</b> and Orr reached a verbal agreement with the Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> after his playing days were over. The agreement was to be checked out as to whether it would be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the league would approve it.|$|E
5|$|Then-Bruins {{head coach}} Don Cherry {{suggested}} that the reason Orr never re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> was Orr's complete trust in Eagleson at the time (Orr said that he described Eagleson as a brother). Cherry recalled Orr had refused to speak with <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> team president directly, allowing Eagleson to mislead or withhold enough details from Boston's offer. Orr's departure from <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> was acrimonious {{and he has not}} held an official role with <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> since. Years later, it emerged that Eagleson had very good relations with Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz and NHL president John Ziegler that colluded to hold back salaries of certain players. Orr disassociated himself from Eagleson in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the season}} started, however, Orr {{underwent}} another surgery on September 20, 1975. The Bruins' contract talks with Orr and Eagleson became difficult. The Bruins' insurer would not insure {{a contract with}} Orr and doctors advised <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> that Orr {{would not be able}} to play much longer. Orr returned to the lineup on November 8, 1975, the day after <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> traded Esposito to the New York Rangers. Orr was able to play the next ten games for the team but had to stop on November 28 due to pain in his knee. The next day, he underwent another knee surgery. Originally expected to only be out for seven to eight weeks, his knee did not respond to therapy and he returned home to Parry Sound. His season was over after ten games and he would not play again for <b>the</b> <b>Bruins.</b> His impending free agency led to speculation that <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> would trade him, but despite his injury, they were negotiating to keep him until the end.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{decided to}} help the war effort next season by joining the United States Coast Guard. During his time with the Coast Guard, he played with the Coast Guard Cutters hockey team in Curtis Bay, Maryland, and later served in the South Pacific. After the war ended, Brimsek {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> {{in time for the}} 1945–46 season. However, Brimsek was not as sharp as he was before due to having not played any professional hockey for two years. In his first season back, Brimsek guided <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> to the Finals, matching up with the Montreal Canadiens. <b>The</b> <b>Bruins</b> were defeated in five games with three games requiring overtime. Brimsek was applauded for his performance in the playoffs, compensating for his team's weak defence. This marked Brimsek's fourth appearance in the Finals and it would be his last. At the end of the season, Brimsek was also named to the NHL Second All-Star Team, the fifth time in his career.|$|E
5|$|In {{that first}} season, Orr was {{challenged}} by the veterans, and he earned respect by defeating Montreal tough guy Ted Harris in his first NHL fight. On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr's knees {{for the first time}} in the NHL. He would miss nine games and <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17–43–10 record, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans.|$|E

5|$|Ross {{took over}} an {{improved}} team. He had recently signed three players, Milt Schmidt, Bobby Bauer and Woody Dumart, who all {{grew up together}} in Kitchener, Ontario, and had them play on the same line, soon nicknamed the Kraut Line {{in reference to the}} German heritage of all three. Along with them, Ross had acquired a new goaltender in 1938, Frank Brimsek; after Brimsek earned six shutouts in his first eight games, <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> traded away Tiny Thompson to allow Brimsek to play. With these players <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> finished first in the league in 1937–38; Ross was named as the second best coach in the league, selected for the end of season All-Star Second Team. The next season <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> won 36 of 48 games, and won the Stanley Cup in the playoffs; Ross was named to the First All-Star Team as the best coach in the league for the season and the team only tied two games, which is tied for the second fewest in a season. He hired the recently retired Cooney Weiland to coach <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> for the 1939–40 NHL season. <b>The</b> <b>Bruins</b> would win the Cup again in 1941, and tied their record of only four away losses all season. Ross once again took over as coach of the team before the 1941–42 season began, as Weiland became coach of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, and led the team to 25 wins in 48 games, which was enough to earn third place in the league. By this time the Second World War had caused several Bruins players, including the entire Kraut Line and goaltender Brimsek, to enlist in their respective armed forces. <b>The</b> <b>Bruins</b> finished second in the NHL during the 1942–43 season with 24 wins in 50 games and Ross was again named in the Second NHL All-Star Team as second best coach in the league. <b>The</b> <b>Bruins</b> missed the playoffs in 1943–44, the first time in ten years they failed to qualify, but returned to the playoffs the next season, something they did for five straight years.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-year}} junior {{career in the}} United States Hockey League (USHL), he was {{selected}} by <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> 179th overall in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. Following the draft, he joined the college ranks with the Boston College Eagles of the Hockey East conference. In four seasons with the Eagles, Alberts was named Hockey East's Best Defensive Defenseman and was a two-time NCAA All-American. Joining <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> in 2005, he played three seasons with the club before being traded to the Flyers. He played with the Flyers for one year, then with the Hurricanes in 2009. At the trade deadline the following year, he was dealt to the Canucks. Internationally, Alberts has competed for the American national team at the 2006 and 2007 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing in}} the World Cup of Hockey, {{tallying}} three assists in six contests for Team Europe, Ehrhoff was handed a Professional Try Out by the Boston Bruins in late September, but he opted to leave <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> the following month.|$|E

5|$|After re-signing {{for another}} year in July 2006, he {{recorded}} 10 assists over 76 games the following season. He earned his first multi-year contract in the off-season, re-signing with <b>the</b> <b>Bruins.</b> During the 2007–08 season, he was limited to 35 games due to a head injury suffered on November 26, 2007, during {{a game against the}} Philadelphia Flyers. Going down to his knees to block a puck moving into the defensive zone, opposing forward Scott Hartnell bodychecked him, using his elbow to hit Alberts' head against the boards. Alberts left the game injured, while Hartnell received a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct; he was later suspended an additional two games by the league. Alberts recovered in time to make his NHL playoff debut in April 2008, as <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> were eliminated in the first round by the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} as an on-ice official, he was named {{head coach of the}} Hamilton Tigers for one season. When the Boston Bruins were formed in 1924, Ross was hired as the first coach and general manager of the team. He would go on to coach the team on three {{separate}} occasions until 1945 and stayed as general manager until his retirement in 1954. Ross helped <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> finish first place in the league ten times and to win the Stanley Cup three times; Ross personally coached the team to two of those victories. After being hired by <b>the</b> <b>Bruins,</b> Ross, along {{with his wife and two}} sons, moved to a suburb of Boston, and became an American citizen in 1938. He died near Boston in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and it was unlikely that Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by <b>the</b> <b>Bruins.</b> In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent back down to the Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with <b>the</b> <b>Bruins.</b> Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with <b>the</b> <b>Bruins.</b> Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not sit well with Bruins fans as Thompson was a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E

5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> were swept, {{it would}} have {{marked the first time}} an overall top-seed was swept from the opening round of the playoffs since the Cleveland Barons ousted the Buffalo Bisons in 1954. But <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> fought off {{elimination}} with a 5–1 victory in game three on May 4, where Bourque scored two goals and one assists against his former team. Despite scoring the first goal for the third straight game, Hershey failed to score on any of its six power plays, including a five-on-three that lasted a full two minutes. Providence also won a dramatic fourth game on May 5. Trailing 4–3 in the third period, <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> stunned Hershey by scoring two goals in the final four minutes, including Carter Camper completing a hat trick with his game-winner with 64 seconds left in the game. Hershey were eliminated from the playoffs after losing the fifth and final game by 3–2. Crabb tied the game 2–2 in the third with his fifth goal of the series, but Bruins forward Jamie Tardif broke the tie at 9:20 of the period.

5|$|In 1942, Conacher left <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> {{to enlist}} in the Royal Canadian Air Force for the {{duration}} of the Second World War where he served as a physical training instructor. He continued to play hockey in the Canadian military leagues, playing first for the Saskatoon RCAF team in 1942–43, then with the Dartmouth RCAF for the following two seasons. He led the Halifax city league with nine goals in 1943–44. Toward the end of the war, Conacher was deployed to England where he continued to play with military teams, but the deployment also meant he was unavailable to return to <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> at the start of the 1945–46 season like many of his teammates did. He appeared in only four games late in the season following his discharge from the military.|$|E

He was moving all his extremities in the ambulance. He was later diagnosed with a severe concussion and missed {{the remainder of the}} 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. This was arguably the turning point in the series, as <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> would go on to win 4 of the next 5 games, and score 21 of the next 25 goals after the hit. Rome was suspended for 4 games. Although Horton missed the remainder of the finals, he was able to hoist the Stanley Cup in Vancouver on June 15 after <b>the</b> <b>Bruins</b> won game 7.|$|E
