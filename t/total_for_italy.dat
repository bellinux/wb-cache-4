40|$|Recent works {{show that}} {{wholesale}} exporters play {{a large role}} in international trade. Wholesalers provide intermediate services for manufacturers and account for a substantial portion of <b>total</b> export values <b>for</b> <b>Italy,</b> Japan, and the United States. This study seeks to provide the first evidence on the link between firm productivity and exports by wholesalers, using Japanese firm-level data. Empirical analysis reveals that wholesale firms are heterogeneous and that exporters are more productive than non-exporters in the wholesale sector, as is seen in the manufacturing sector. In addition, the analysis provides the evidence that exporters with foreign subsidiaries tend to be more productive than those without and that they outperform the latter in terms of other measures such as average exports, export-sales ratio, and the extensive margin of exports. These results are in line with the firm heterogeneity model of exports and are similar with the previous empirical studies on manufacturing...|$|R

50|$|The enfranchisement of the Cisalpine {{provinces and}} the Italian Allies after the Social War {{would account for}} some of the {{population}} growth of the 1st century BCE. Alternate readings of the Augustan census both accept the basic accuracy of the figures, but assume different methods {{on the part of the}} census-takers. The standard interpretation assumes that the census-takers included all citizens - men, women, and children - in the Augustan censuses; the revised interpretation assumes that the census-takers only counted adult men, as they had during the Republican period. The standard interpretation is not supported by any evidence internal to the text, but reduces the implied population <b>totals</b> <b>for</b> 28 BCE <b>Italy</b> from 10 million to a more plausible 4 million. The high total earns support from recorded conflict over land in the late Republic and other indications of population pressure, but does not accord well with comparative evidence from other periods and other parts of the empire.|$|R
40|$|This paper applies {{time series}} methodologies {{to examine the}} causal {{relationship}} among electricity demand, real per capita GDP and <b>total</b> labor force <b>for</b> <b>Italy</b> from 1970 to 2009. After a brief introduction, {{a survey of the}} economic literature on this issue is reported, before discussing the data and introducing the econometric techniques used. The results of estimation indicate that one cointegrating relationship exists among these variables. This equilibrium relation implies that, in the long-run, GDP and labor force are correlated negatively, as well as GDP and electricity. Moreover, there is a bi-directional Granger causality flow between real per capita GDP and electricity demand; while labor force does not Grangercause neither real per capita GDP nor electricity demand. This implies that electricity demand and economic growth are jointly determined at the same time for the Italian case. The forecast error variance decomposition shows that forecast errors in real per capita GDP are mainly caused by the uncertainty in GDP itself, while forecast errors in labor force are mainly resulted from the labor force itself, although aggregate income and electricity are important, too...|$|R
