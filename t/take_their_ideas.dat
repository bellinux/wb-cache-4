The music must also be both interesting and playable for the musicians, and hopefully, meet the quality standards of the orchestral world." ...|$|E
60|$|For my own part I {{have not}} only more hope in the {{situation}} but more faith in the French people than is ordinary among the English, who really try to exceed one another in discoloration and distortion of the circumstances. The government was in a deadlock--what was to be done? Yes, all parties cried out, 'What was to be done?' and felt that we were waist deep a fortnight ago {{in a state of}} crisis. In throwing back the sovereignty from a 'representative assembly' which had virtually ceased to represent, {{into the hands of the}} people, I think that Louis Napoleon did well. The talk about 'military despotism' is absolute nonsense. The French army is eminently civic, and nations who <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> from the very opposite fact of a standing army are far from understanding how absolutely a French soldier and French citizen are the same thing. The independence of the elections seems to be put out of reach of injury; and intelligent men of adverse opinions to the government think that the majority will be large in its favour. Such a majority would certainly justify Louis Napoleon, or should--even with you in England.|$|E

50|$|In 1901, McCarthy was {{appointed}} the chief document clerk for the Wisconsin Free Library Commission. Although the position {{was designed to}} provide legislators with reference materials, McCarthy ultimately expanded its scope to include researching legislation {{from around the world}} and drafting legislation. He was interested in improving lawmaking from what he saw as a chaotic process largely controlled by lobbyists to a systematic one that produced well-crafted legislation that could both survive court challenge and {{serve as a model for}} other states and the federal government. He formulated the concept of a legislative reference library— a place where legislators could <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>ideas,</b> learn about the experiences of other states and countries, cast their ideas in concrete terms, and then have the help of trained draftsmen to put their ideas into legal form. Initially spurned by the legislature, McCarthy was eventually given space for his project in the attic of the capitol. He ultimately built it into the first legislative reference library in the country, and was responsible for overhauling the way legislation was created in the state.|$|E

Gibbs pitched the idea to his college roommates, Antonio Belmontes and Seena Zandipour, who helped him refine the concept and start prototyping. Together they founded Helios Biking and successfully <b>took</b> <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> through the HAXLR8R hardware start-up incubator based out of Shenzhen, China. Being in Shenzhen allowed them to rapidly iterate between prototypes & complete their R&D in just under 4 months. According to Helios co-founder Seena Zandipour, [...] "We underestimated ourselves. Within the first week, we had the prototype completed." ...|$|R
50|$|During the Age of Discovery, European explorers {{attempted}} to connect many peoples {{with whom they}} first came into contact to the Ten Lost Tribes, sometimes in conjunction with attempts to introduce Christian missionaries. The first person to identify the lost tribes with an East Asian nation was João Rodriguez (1561-1634), a Jesuit missionary and interpreter. In 1608, {{he argued that the}} Chinese descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel. He believed that the Chinese sages Confucius and Lao-tse <b>took</b> <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> from Judaism. Rodriguez later abandoned this theory. In his Historia da Igreja do Japão he argued that Japan was populated in two waves of immigration from the mainland, one group originating from Chekiang, and the other from Korea.|$|R

Bunn and Netter <b>took</b> <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> to Dr. Jonathan Mann, Director of the Global Programme on AIDS (now known as UNAIDS). Dr. Mann liked the concept, approved it, and {{agreed with the}} recommendation that the first observance of World AIDS Day should be on 1 December 1988. Bunn, a former television broadcast journalist from San Francisco, had recommended the date of 1 December that believing it would maximize coverage of World AIDS Day by western news media, sufficiently long following the US elections but before the Christmas holidays.|$|R
30|$|In the {{prototyping}} module, {{the teams}} <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> for solutions and start sorting and grouping {{them to find}} realistic solutions. The teams then take a few ideas (3 – 10) further and prototype them. The purpose of prototyping several ideas is to advance the one-sentence statement into a more advanced solution. This can be done through a simple sketch, Legos, or perhaps an advertisement describing the main features. The teams can then go out and interview users, show them the simple prototypes, and get feedback on which ones to develop further. As the number of prototypes is reduced, the more advanced prototypes can be developed, with more detail and functionality. More advanced prototypes include functional prototypes that solve the functional challenge but {{do not have the}} final design; it can be a 3 D computer simulation, a scaled-down version, and so on.|$|E
30|$|Large {{firms have}} {{realized}} {{the need for}} rapid learning, and therefore, probe-and-learn processes have been introduced with success, primarily by computer and Internet companies (Lynn et al. 1996; Brown and Eisenhardt 1998; Steiber and Alänge 2013 a, 2015). And more recently, the work of Steve Blank and Eric Ries has popularized their “lean startup” approach {{as a way to}} create internal probe-and-learn processes at traditional large companies such as GE (as in their Fastworks program just mentioned). The fundamental idea in lean startup is for the large company to quickly build a “minimum viable” product, test it with customers, and learn from this either how to proceed or to pivot and try a new approach (Blank 2005; Ries 2011). The corporate accelerators can be viewed as intensive programs in which cohorts of internal idea providers are trained to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> further, either into solutions for current business areas or into new startups.|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} have a scientific interest in taking their translational studies from bench to bedside. They want to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> {{and see how}} far they can go towards bringing medical solutions to as many patients as possible. However, it can be frustrating when the clinical development of their work {{is beyond the scope}} and capabilities of their university or hospital. Even for those institutions with research beds, studies are usually limited to small, pilot studies. Even for those institutions with the necessary financial support, the manufacturing, regulatory, and legal essentials are not in place to evolve such studies to larger, later-stage human trials. This is nothing new. What is new is the rising tide of researchers turning to the for-profit world. Either directly- by starting their own companies, or indirectly- by working with existing pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, researchers are moving more and more technologies towards the marketplace. Biotechnology Entrepreneurship: From Science to Solutions provides a real-world introduction to starting and growing life science companies, as well as useful material for medical researchers interested in getting their technologies to as many patients as possible. Increasingly, universities and medical research centers are making technology transfer and development- such as filing patents and establishing formal industry relationships- a factor in tenure and promotion evaluation; the new millennia version of publish or perish. The outlicensing and commercialization of life science technologies are becoming valued parts of the academic career ladder. For example, North Carolina State University tenure and promotion process includes technology transfer to industry and filing patents- as part of more general definition of generating, contributing to, or disseminating knowledge[1]. One study found a direct relationship between the granting of tenure and the type of industr...|$|E

40|$|There is no {{escaping}} our economic future. It {{is clean and}} green or it is no future at all. Our past prosperity relied on coal-fred power, but coal can no longer secure us a prosperous and safe future. Coal-fred pollution and the ways we bring electricity into our homes and businesses have barely changed at all over the past 100 years. But like the digital revolution that is transforming so many aspects of our lives, energy generation and its delivery is undergoing a revolution propelled by sophisticated technology and increasingly controlled by everyday Australians. Renewable technologies lower prices for everyone and are advancing in leaps and bounds {{and will continue to}} do so for a long time to come. By contrast, prices for fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas will continue to increase as they become harder and harder to reach and exploit. The global warming emergency that Australia and the rest of the world face requires leadership and strong intervention from government to overcome the market failures that continue to entrench dangerous pollution. In the face of the climate challenge, the rest of the world is moving rapidly to transform their economies and we cannot risk being left behind. To avoid catastrophic global warming and stabilise warming at 1. 5 degrees, Australia must cut pollution rapidly to achieve netzero pollution by 2040. The Australian Greens have a strategy to get there, and our plan for at least 90 % clean energy by 2030 is a critical component. A clean energy powered economy is inevitable. However, for Australia to secure all the benefts of lower prices, better technologies, more jobs, competitive advantages, signifcant export opportunities for innovative Australian technologies and services, building the clean economy needs to start right now. If we don’t start now, we will get stuck importing technologies while our best minds leave to <b>take</b> <b>their</b> <b>ideas</b> to be developed overseas.  ...|$|E
