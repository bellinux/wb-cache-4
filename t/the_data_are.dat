40|$|Abstract-The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the impact of various pre-processing models on the forecast capability of artificial neural network (ANN) when auditing financial accounts. Hence, the focus of this paper is on the pre-processing of <b>the</b> <b>data.</b> ANNs <b>are</b> selected for auditing purposes because they are capable of learning complex, non-linear underlying relationships. Therefore, they are used to model the dynamics and the relationships between account values in order to find unexpected fluctuations. This study uses a multi-layered neural network with the backpropagation algorithm. The artificial neural network model used in this study was built by using the financial statements of 31 manufacturing companies over four years. The values of the accounts were regarded as a time-series. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> pre-processed in four different ways. Firstly, all <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> scaled linearly. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> pre-processed linearly on a yearly basis. Thirdly, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>were</b> pre-processed linearly on a company basis.
