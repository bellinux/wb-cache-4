50|$|In the 2011 {{version of}} TTD, <b>target</b> <b>validation</b> {{information}} has been integrated. <b>Target</b> <b>validation</b> normally requires the determination that the target is expressed in the disease-relevant cells/tissues, it can be directly modulated by a drug or drug-like molecule with adequate potency in biochemical assay, and that target modulation in cell and/or animal models ameliorates the relevant disease phenotype. Therefore, TTD collects three types of <b>target</b> <b>validation</b> data: experimentally determined potency of drugs against their primary target or targets, observed potency or effects of drugs against disease models (cell-lines, ex-vivo, in-vivo models) linked to their primary target or targets, and the observed effects of target knockout, knockdown, RNA interference, transgenetic, antibody or antisense treated in-vivo models. Currently, TTD provides complete or partial validation information for 932 targets (351 successful, 252 clinical trial, 34 discontinued and 295 research targets).

40|$|Abstract—It {{has been}} {{established}} that microRNAs (miRNAs) {{play an important role}} in gene expression by post-transcriptional regulation of messengerRNAs (mRNAs). However, the precise relationships between microRNAs and their target genes in sense of numbers, types and biological relevance remain largely unclear. Dissecting the miRNA-target relationships will render more insights for miRNA <b>targets</b> identification and <b>validation</b> therefore promote the understanding of miRNA function. In miRBase, miRanda is the key algorithm used for target prediction for Zebrafish. This algorithm is high-throughput but brings lots of false positives (noise). Since validation of a large scale of targets through laboratory experiments is very time consuming, several computational methods for miRNA <b>targets</b> <b>validation</b> should be developed. In this paper, we present an integrative method to investigate several aspects of the relationships between miRNAs and their targets with the final purpose of extracting high confident targets from miRanda predicted targets pool. This is achieved by using the techniques ranging from statistical tests to clustering and association rules. Our research focuses on Zebrafish. It was found that validated targets do not necessarily associate with the highest sequence matching. Besides, for some miRNA families, the frequency of their predicted targets is significantly higher in the genomic region nearby their own physical location. Finally, in a case study of dre-miR- 10 and dre-miR- 196, it was found that the predicted target genes hoxd 13 a, hoxd 11 a, hoxd 10 a and hoxc 4 a of dre-miR- 10 while hoxa 9 a, hoxc 8 a and hoxa 13 a of dre-miR- 196 have similar characteristics as validated target genes and therefore represent high confidence target candidates.

It can be fitted with a variety of warheads which can be targeted on both land and sea targets.

Its maneuverability makes the missile ideal for destroying surface-to-air missile threats. The on-board autopilot and inertial navigation-global positioning navigation systems (INS/GPS) allow the missile to perform its mission autonomously. A data link enables intervention and <b>target</b> <b>validation.</b> The Delilah missile was first used in combat by Israel over Lebanon in July and August 2006 and launched by F-16D fighter aircraft.

50|$|The {{process of}} neurodegeneration {{is not well}} understood, so the {{diseases}} that stem from it have, as yet, no cures. In the search for effective treatments (as opposed to palliative care), investigators employ animal models of disease to test potential therapeutic agents. Model organisms provide an inexpensive and relatively quick means to perform two main functions: target identification and <b>target</b> <b>validation.</b> Together, these help show the value of any specific therapeutic strategies and drugs when attempting to ameliorate disease severity. An example is the drug Dimebon (Medivation). This drug is in phase III clinical trials for use in Alzheimer's disease, and also recently finished phase II clinical trials for use in Huntington's disease. In March 2010, {{the results of a}} clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug Dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease.

Evaluation of whole brain florbetaben PET images using the clinically applicable visual assessment method demonstrated that florbetaben provides good diagnostic efficacy in detecting/excluding cerebral neuritic β-amyloid plaques. Sensitivity and specificity {{of the whole}} brain assessment was 98 and 89%, respectively, against the histopathological standard of truth. Good agreement between blinded readers (kappa 0.90) was reported. Furthermore, high negative and positive predictive values were reported for florbetaben imaging to exclude or detect β-amyloid plaques (negative predictive value 96.0% and positive predictive value 93.9%, see [...] ). Intravenous injections of florbetaben are generally well tolerated in all subject groups. Analysis of 872 patients with 978 florbetaben administrations found no serious adverse reactions related to the tracer. All adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate in severity and temporary only. The most common reactions (incidence < 1%) were injection-site pain (3.9% of patients), injection-site erythema (1.7%) and injection-site irritation (1.2%). There was no overall difference in the tolerability of florbetaben between different age populations. Repeated annual florbetaben injections showed no differences in the tolerability profile. Risks and side effects are addressed in the patient information leaflet. You may also ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information.|$|E

In addition, we have confirmed the peroxisomal localization of UP 6 (unknown protein 6) and GLX 1 (glyoxalase 1 homolog), two proteins with possible roles in stress responses and glutathione-dependent detoxification, respectively.

Our method constructs causal network models of gene expression by combining genome-wide DNA- and RNA-level data. Prognostic scores are obtained from a singular value decomposition of the networks.

50|$|Oligonucleotides are a third {{category}} of big molecules. They are oligomers of nucleotides, {{which in turn}} are composed of a five-carbon sugar (either ribose or desoxyribose), a nitrogenous base (either a pyrimidine or a purine) and 1-3 phosphate groups. The best known representative of a nucleotide is the coenzyme ATP (=Adenosine triphosphate), MW 507.2. Oligonucleotides are chemically synthesized from protected phosphoramidites of natural or chemically modified nucleosides. The oligonucleotide chain assembly proceeds in the direction from 3’- to 5’-terminus by following a procedure {{referred to as a}} “synthetic cycle”. Completion of a single synthetic cycle results in the addition of one nucleotide residue to the growing chain. The maximum length of synthetic oligonucleotides hardly exceeds 200 nucleotide components. From its current range of applications in basic research, a.o. in drug <b>target</b> <b>validation,</b> drug discovery and therapeutic development, the potential use of oligonucleotides is foreseen in gene therapy (antisense drugs), disease prevention and agriculture. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) constitute a combination between small and big molecules. The small molecule parts, up to four different APIs, are highly potent cytotoxic drugs. They are linked with a monoclonal antibody, a big molecule which is of little or no therapeutic value in itself, but extremely discriminating for its targets, the cancer cells. The first commercialized ADCs were Isis’s Formivirisen and, more recently, Pfizer’s (formerly Wyeth) Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin). Examples of ADCs in phase III of development are Abbott’s / Isis’s Alicaforsen and Eli Lilly’s Aprinocarsen.|$|E

40|$|We present two {{procedures}} for validating targets whose track estimates are obtained using the Maximum Likelihood Probabilistic Data Association (ML-PDA) algorithm. The ML-PDA, developed for Very Low Observable (VLO) target tracking, always provides a track estimate that must then {{be tested for}} target existence by comparing {{the value of the}} Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) at the track estimate to a threshold. Using extreme value theory, we show that {{in the absence of a}} target the LLR at the track estimate obeys approximately a Gumbel distribution rather than the Gaussian distribution previously ascribed to it in the literature. The off-line <b>target</b> <b>validation</b> procedure relies on extensive off-line simulations to obtain a set of <b>target</b> <b>validation</b> thresholds that are then used by the tracking system.
