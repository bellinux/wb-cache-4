5|$|In 2006, PTC {{requested}} that <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> deny broadcast license renewal for Salt Lake City CBS station KUTV {{because they felt}} that the broadcast of the Without a Trace episode that was ruled indecent violated community standards and that CBS failed {{to take action to}} reduce indecent content following <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> fines. Subsequently, CBS agreed to pay <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> $300,000 to settle the KUTV license challenge.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2014, <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> voted 3–2 {{to approve}} the {{proposed}} ban on joint sales agreements and voted 5–0 {{to approve the}} proposed ban on coordinated retransmission consent negotiations {{between two of the}} four highest-rated stations within a given market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014. Under the restrictions, <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application's filing. <b>The</b> <b>FCC</b> also began a request for comment on policies to address other agreements, such as shared services agreements. The prohibition on television JSAs had been proposed as early as 2004, a year after <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> voted to treat JSAs between radio stations as duopolies. Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of using it as a move to encourage participation in a spectrum incentive auction then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during retransmission consent negotiations with pay television providers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>FCC</b> {{granted the}} {{ownership}} transfer on February 3, 2015 subject to several conditions regarding business relationships and communication between AJG and WVRC. An {{appeal of the}} grant conditions was denied by <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> on September 16, 2015. Bowers Broadcasting subsequently filed applications for extension of the consummation of the transfer on October 23, 2015, January 29, 2016, April 22, 2016, July 22, 2016, and October 17, 2016.

5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to renew the}} station's license in early 1971, Mid-Atlantic Network ran into trouble with <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> due to the quantity of commercials the station was airing. The station was carrying 22 minutes of commercials an hour according to a letter from then-FCC Broadcast Bureau Chief Francis R. Welsh. Welsh said in the letter that <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> was not convinced the amount of commercials served the community in a positive way. At the time, <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> allowed no more than 18 minutes of commercials per hour. However, the station's license was ultimately renewed on May 14, 1971.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{aspired to}} grow beyond its three stations, {{applying}} for new television station licenses in Cincinnati and Cleveland in 1947. This {{would give the}} network five owned-and-operated stations (O), the maximum allowed by <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> at the time. However, DuMont was hampered by Paramount's two stations, KTLA (channel 5) in Los Angeles and WBKB (channel 4, now WBBM-TV on channel 2) in Chicago – {{the descendants of the}} two experimental stations that rankled DuMont in 1940. Although these stations did not carry DuMont programming (with the exception of KTLA for one year from 1947 to 1948), and in fact competed against DuMont's affiliates in those cities, <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> ruled that Paramount essentially controlled DuMont, which effectively placed the network at the five-station cap. Paramount's exertion of influence over the network's management and the power of its voting stock brought <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> to its conclusion. Thus, DuMont was unable to open additional stations as long as Paramount owned stations or owned a portion of DuMont. Paramount refused to sell.|$|E

5|$|However, Paramount {{vetoed the}} plan {{almost out of}} hand due to {{antitrust}} concerns. A few months earlier, <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> had ruled that Paramount controlled DuMont, and there were still some questions about whether UPT had really separated from Paramount.|$|E
5|$|In May 1951, ABC {{chairman}} Edward Noble and United Paramount Theatres president Leonard Goldenson {{announced a}} proposed merger between their companies. The {{plan was to}} merge ABC and its five television stations with United Paramount Theatres, a company only recently spun off from Paramount Pictures. UPT also owned the network's Chicago station, WBKB; that station {{would have to be}} sold in order for the merged company to stay under the five-station cap. Because the proposed merger involved the sale of a television station, it required the approval of <b>the</b> <b>FCC,</b> which opened a hearing on the issue that August. The proposed deal was complex, and would affect many parties involved in television broadcasting, including Paramount, DuMont, and CBS (CBS executives wanted to purchase WBKB). During the hearing, Allen DuMont asked <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> to force Paramount to sell its share of the DuMont Network. He stated that Paramount in effect owned two television networks, the PTN and DuMont; <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> had similarly forced NBC to sell off one of its two radio networks eight years earlier due to concerns about multi-network ownership. Paramount executives, however, denied ever having operated a television network. Evidence presented against Paramount included network affiliation contracts and advertisements for the Paramount Television Network from 1951. Despite Paramount executives' testimony, advertisements for the Paramount Television Network ran as late as 1952.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{informed}} <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> that it {{was unable}} to find buyers for WABM or WMMP – the company's MyNetworkTV stations in Birmingham, Alabama and Charleston, South Carolina that it planned to sell in its purchase of Allbritton Communications. In Birmingham, the company proposed surrendering the licenses of WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV – the two full-powered satellites of ABC affiliate WBMA-LD, converting WABM into a full-powered satellite of WBMA-LD – and moving its existing MyNetworkTV programming to a digital subchannel of WABM (although the WBMA-LD simulcast was placed on WABM's subchannel instead while MyNetworkTV programming was retained on its main channel). Similarly, in Charleston, Sinclair planned to surrender WCIV's license and move its ABC affiliation and programming to WMMP. In both cases, Sinclair believed that its own stations had superior technical facilities than those of the stations it intends to surrender. Sinclair was able to retain WBMA-LD in any event as <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> does not impose any ownership limits on low-power stations.|$|E
50|$|In April 1987, <b>the</b> <b>FCC's</b> board {{recommended}} <b>the</b> {{cancellation of}} WBUZ's license. When Serafin {{said he needed}} time to try finding a buyer for the station, federal judge Walter Miller offered Serafin the option of additional time by selling under <b>the</b> <b>FCC's</b> 'distress sale' policy, which allows discounted sales to minorities. Serafin reportedly refused the offer, and the station fell silent in 1989.|$|R
50|$|The court {{focused on}} three main issues, which were <b>the</b> <b>FCC’s</b> pricing rules for these {{unbundled}} network elements, also whether {{the exclusion of}} historical costs in the pricing rules constitutes a governmental taking, and lastly, various rules for combining network elements. It focused primarily on the economic implications of <b>the</b> <b>FCC’s</b> costing standards which the Court upheld and secondarily on the takings claim.|$|R

5|$|Sinclair's use {{of local}} {{marketing}} agreements {{would lead to}} legal issues in 1999, when Glencairn, Ltd. (since restructured as Cunningham Broadcasting) {{announced that it would}} acquire Fox affiliate KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma from Sullivan Broadcasting; Glencairn subsequently announced plans to sell five of its 11 existing stations that were operated by Sinclair under LMAs to that company outright. As the family of Sinclair Broadcast Group founder Julian Smith controlled 97% of Glencairn's stock assets (which remains the case under its Cunningham structure) and the company was to be paid with Sinclair stock in turn for the purchases, KOKH and Sinclair-owned WB affiliate KOCB (now a CW affiliate) would effectively constitute a duopoly in violation of FCC rules. The Rainbow/PUSH coalition (headed by Jesse Jackson) filed challenges against the sale with <b>the</b> <b>FCC,</b> citing concerns over a single company holding two broadcast licenses in a single market and argued that Glencairn was masquerading as a separate minority-owned company (Edwards, who served as Glencairn's president, is African American) when it was really an arm of Sinclair that the company used to gain control of the stations through LMAs. After <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> updated its media ownership rules to allow a single company to own two television stations in the same market in August 1999, Sinclair restructured the deal to acquire KOKH outright. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>FCC</b> issued a $40,000 fine against Sinclair for illegally controlling Glencairn.|$|E
