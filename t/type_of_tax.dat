5|$|Several {{years before}} the Union of Lublin, the Polish obrona potoczna was reformed, as the Sejm (national {{parliament}} of Poland) legislated in 1562–1563 the creation of wojsko kwarciane (named after kwarta, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> levied on the royal estate in royal lands {{for the purpose of}} maintaining this formation). This formation was also paid for by the king, and in the peace time, numbered about 3,500–4,000 men according to Bardach; Brzezinski gives the range of 3,000–5,000. It was composed mostly of the light cavalry units manned by nobility (szlachta) and commanded by hetmans. Often, in wartime, the Sejm would legislate a temporary increase {{in the size of the}} wojsko kwarciane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, {{during the reign}} of Stefan Batory (1576–1586), a peasant-based levy formation, piechota wybranicka (lit. drafted or {{selected}} infantry, also known as piechota łanowa, lit. acreage infantry) was formed. It was based on peasants from the royal estates only, who received a unit of land (łan) in exchange for their service. The formation numbered about 2,300 and after early disappointments was never seen as of much military value. It supplemented the few small units of haiduk infantry, which saw service in Poland primarily around late 16th and 17th centuries. In 1655 a new infantry unit was created, the żołnierz dymowy (or żołnierz łanowy– lit. chimney or łan soldier, named again after the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> applied). It required all lands, no matter whether owned by king, nobles or the Church, to provide peasant recruits, and applied a similar requirement to towns.|$|E

The terms progressive, regressive, and proportional are used to describe the way the rate progresses from low to high, from high to low, or proportionally.

25|$|The {{existence}} of a tax can increase economic efficiency in some cases. If there is a negative externality associated with a good, meaning that it has negative effects not felt by the consumer, then a free market will trade {{too much of that}} good. By taxing the good, the government can increase overall welfare as well as raising revenue. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> is called a Pigovian tax, after economist Arthur Pigou.|$|E

There were no tables or chairs. Some traders might be protected from the sun with a simple thatched parasol. A certain <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> or rent was levied by officials for each space occupied by traders in the marketplace. The trade and economy in the Angkor marketplace were mainly run by women.|$|E
25|$|Some {{local governments}} {{in an effort}} to evade the two-thirds voter {{approval}} requirement for special taxes under Proposition 218 may express legally nonbinding intent to spend general tax proceeds for one or more specific purposes. This may be done in several forms such as the adoption of intention language before the tax election date, the formation of an advisory committee relating to the expenditure of the tax proceeds, or by placing a companion advisory measure on the same election ballot. The most frequent <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> where this occurs is the local sales tax, but it can also occur with other local taxes such as utility user taxes, transient occupancy (hotel bed) taxes, business taxes, and various local excise taxes.|$|E

500|$|To become law, {{the bill}} {{will need to be}} {{included}} in a final version of tax legislation from the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, pass both the House and the Senate, and finally be signed by the President. [...] In 2005, President Bush established an advisory panel on tax reform that examined several national sales tax variants including aspects of the FairTax and noted several concerns. These included uncertainties as to the revenue that would be generated, and difficulties of enforcement and administration, which made this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> undesirable to recommend in their final report. [...] The panel did not examine the FairTax as proposed in the legislation. The FairTax received visibility in the 2008 presidential election on the issue of taxes and the IRS, with several candidates supporting the bill. A poll in 2009 by Rasmussen Reports found that 43% of Americans would support a national sales tax replacement, with 38% opposed to the idea; the sales tax was viewed as fairer by 52% of Republicans, 44% of Democrats, and 49% of unaffiliateds. [...] President Barack Obama did not support the bill, arguing for more progressive changes to the income and payroll tax systems. [...] President Donald Trump has proposed to lower overall income taxation and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three.|$|E

40|$|Today {{development}} <b>of</b> national <b>tax</b> systems {{takes place}} under the decisive influence <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition. That is why there is no necessity in developing of theoretical and methodical vehicle for studying this phenomenon. Topicality of this subject is conditioned {{by the fact that}} understanding of character and features <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition are impossible without determination <b>of</b> its <b>types.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this article is to define <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition under conditions of globalization of world economy. Definition <b>of</b> forms and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition is debatable in economics literature; therefore today general approach is absent. Besides in most cases scientists lack unified approach when selecting and examining descriptions <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition classifications. Often researchers make no difference between such concepts as "type" and "form" <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition. Authors offer logical communication chart for such categories as "maintenance", "form", "type", and on this basis necessity to examine tax competition as form of economic competition is grounded and it is proposed to identify certain displays <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition that have general signs as well as its types but not as forms. On the basis of analogies method in relation to the signs of classifications of economic competition and taking into account works of economists in the field <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition authors suggest classification <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition based on the list of entries in accordance with their functions and status; territory of action; particular branch sign; instruments; methods of competitive activities; on the objects <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition; actions <b>of</b> participants in accordance with which fourteen <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition are selected. Practical application of this classification will be necessary for deep understanding of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition in all its variety. The prospect of subsequent scientific researches in this direction is the detailed analysis of certain displays <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> competition in Ukraine...|$|R

[...] The tax systems vary greatly and can be progressive, proportional, or regressive, depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax.</b> [...] Comparison of tax rates {{around the world is}} a difficult and somewhat subjective enterprise. Tax laws in most countries are extremely complex, and tax burden falls differently on different groups in each country and sub-national unit. Of course, services provided by governments in return for taxation also vary, making comparisons all the more difficult.|$|E

[...] The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> a local government imposes (general or special) is legally significant because it determines the applicable voter approval requirement.
