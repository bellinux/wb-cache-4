25|$|Some {{argue that}} it is {{impossible}} to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the Three Mile Island effect. Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good <b>thing</b> <b>if</b> plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.|$|E

The US recommendation is 6RZE with the option of adding a quinolone such as moxifloxacin. The level of evidence for all these regimens is poor, {{and there is little}} to recommend one over the other.|$|E

500|$|While touring with ArtRave in the United Kingdom, Gaga {{appeared}} with Bennett on the twelfth season of British television show, Strictly Come Dancing, performing two {{songs from the}} album, [...] "Anything Goes" [...] and [...] "It Don't Mean a <b>Thing</b> (<b>If</b> It Ain't Got That Swing)". Following the tour's completion the duo performed the title track on talk shows The View and The Colbert Report. For the Christmas Tree lighting at Rockefeller Center, Bennett and Gaga performed a rendition of [...] "Winter Wonderland". A few days later on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, they performed [...] "Cheek to Cheek" [...] and [...] "It Don't Mean a <b>Thing</b> (<b>If</b> I Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] and Gaga singing solo on [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye".|$|E

The song's title introduced the term [...] "swing" [...] into common usage and gave name to the swing era.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} {{statutory}} provisions prohibit incitement. Under section 107(a) of the Penal Code, {{a person is}} said to [...] the doing of a <b>thing</b> <b>if</b> he or she instigates someone to do that <b>thing.</b> <b>If</b> a person abets an offence, {{and as a result}} the act abetted is committed, the person is to be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. If the offence is not committed due to the abetment, and it is punishable by imprisonment, the abettor is to be imprisoned for up to a quarter of the maximum jail term of the offence, or may receive a fine, or both. If either the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant whose duty it was to prevent the offence from happening, the abettor may be imprisoned for up to half of the maximum jail term of the offence, or may be fined, or receive both penalties. However, if the offence abetted but not committed is punishable with death or life imprisonment, the abettor is liable to a penalty of up to seven years' imprisonment, a fine, or both. If any hurt is caused {{as a result of the}} abetment, the abettor may be jailed up to 14 years and must also be fined.|$|E

[...] The reporting about this story indicates that Glass did track down Fitzgerald and demand the rifle's return, which Fitzgerald sullenly complied with.|$|E
500|$|Bennett {{said that}} Gaga had written an {{original}} {{song for the}} album titled [...] "Paradise". It also contained solo performances along with the duets; Gaga later clarified that the album contained only standards.

However, at the end of the debate she conceded to the superior knowledge of Yajnavalkya by saying: [...] "venerable Brahmins, you may consider it a great <b>thing</b> <b>if</b> you get off bowing before him. No one, I believe, will defeat him in any argument concerning Brahman." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s, swing jazz {{emerged as}} a {{dominant}} form in American music. Duke Ellington and his band members composed numerous swing era hits that have become standards: [...] "It Don't Mean a <b>Thing</b> (<b>If</b> It Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] (1932), [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] (1933) and [...] "Caravan" [...] (1936), among others. Other influential bandleaders of this period were Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway and Fletcher Henderson. Goodman's band became well-known from the radio show Let's Dance and in 1937 introduced a number of jazz standards to a wide audience in the first jazz concert performed in Carnegie Hall.|$|E

500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent {{that for us}} to defeat it or even communicate with it, or {{have any kind of}} relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false.

As the story developed, everything worked until the very end. How do you resolve this <b>thing?</b> <b>If</b> humans can defeat this marvelous machine, [...] it's really not so great, is it? Or if it really is great, will we like those humans who do defeat it? Should they defeat it? Who is the story's hero anyway? That was the problem.

500|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the National Action Plan, a variety of people and organizationsincluding First Nations, human trafficking victims, law enforcement, and victim service providerscriticized Canada for failing to have such a plan. Charles Momy, president of the Canadian Police Association, said that despite existing efforts from local law enforcement agencies, Canada lacked and required [...] "a coordinated response to ensure the offenders are prosecuted, and put a stop to this modern day form of slavery." [...] In October 2008, John Fenn of Toronto's Streetlight Support Services expressed his frustration that there was still no national action plan on this subject despite the passing of the corresponding motion the previous year. Fenn said, [...] "Even if we make a muck of the <b>thing</b> <b>if</b> we get started, let's get started." [...] Benjamín Santamaria of Project Desert Roses, another Toronto-based organization, voiced the same complaint.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Gaga began {{promoting}} the album {{through a series}} of public appearances with and without Bennett, the first of them being at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in New York City. At the school, which was founded by Bennett and his wife Susan Crow, the pair performed as a duo and individually, and fielded questions from the audience. They concluded their engagement by watching a performance from the school's choir. Two days after her performance at the school, Gaga showed a new tattoo of a Miles Davis trumpet she had gotten earlier. The singer posted a picture to her Instagram account of her getting the tattoo with Newman, announcing his involvement on the album while proclaiming, [...] "It's jazz time, world". Gaga also performed with Bennett at the Montreal International Jazz Festival, and starred in a holiday commercial for retail company H, directed by Johan Renck and featuring [...] "It Don't Mean a <b>Thing</b> (<b>If</b> I Ain't Got That Swing)". The artists announced the news on Instagram. At the 2014 New York Fashion Week party, Gaga performed [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye", dedicating it to her boyfriend, actor Taylor Kinney.|$|E

500|$|Verbal {{report is}} widely {{considered}} to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues. [...] For one <b>thing,</b> <b>if</b> verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other branches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult {{to make sense of the}} idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected. [...] Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology, which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted. [...] Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language: [...] this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language. [...] As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may feel that it is possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely: [...] a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.|$|E
500|$|Along with musicians D'Angelo and Erykah Badu, Maxwell was {{credited}} with helping to shape the [...] "neo soul" [...] movement that rose to prominence during the late 1990s. Along with D'Angelo's Brown Sugar (1995) and Badu's Baduizm (1997), Urban Hang Suite has been recognized by writers for beginning neo soul's popularity and helping the genre obtain commercial visibility. However, in contrast to D'Angelo, Maxwell was more conventional in his approach on his debut album. The term [...] "neo soul" [...] was penned in the late 1990s by record executive Kedar Massenburg, who managed both D'Angelo and Erykah Badu. According to Shapiro, the term itself refers to a musical style that obtains its influence from more classical styles, and bohemian musicians seeking a soul revival, while setting themselves apart from the more contemporary sounds of their mainstream R counterparts. In commenting on the [...] "new soul revival" [...] in music, Maxwell told Entertainment Weekly in 1997 that [...] "everything out there musically was inspired or influenced by something from the past. It's not about creating some super-fresh new <b>thing.</b> <b>If</b> it doesn't lend itself to your history, {{how is it going}} to extend to your future?" [...] According to Kerika Fields, Maxwell received an overwhelmingly positive reaction to his debut album from music listeners due to their weariness of contemporary black music's predictability.|$|E

[...] following which Gaga appears on stage in Menkes' red jumpsuit and a big wig to sing her solo rendition of [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)".
