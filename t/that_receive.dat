5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei <b>that</b> <b>receive</b> input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees <b>that</b> <b>receive</b> parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites <b>that</b> <b>receive</b> input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E

40|$|Background Contrary to the proven {{benefits}} of iron, few concerns in producing the oxidative stress is remained problematic. Objectives The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the oxidative stress in the male Wistar rats fed bread supplemented with iron in different doses i. e., 35 (basic), 70 (two fold), 140 (four fold), and 210 mg/kg (six fold) with or without NaHCO 3 (250 mg/kg). Methods In this experimental study Iron, ceruloplasmin, ferritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), albumin, total protein, uric acid and plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), were evaluated in 30 rats at the first and last day of the experiment (day 30). In addition, phytic acid levels were detected in all baked breads. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and t test procedure though SPSS statistical software version 20. Results Serum iron level in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> basic level of iron plus NaHCO 3 decreased significantly in the last day of the trial. Higher level of serum iron was seen in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> iron twofold, fourfold and sixfold and rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> iron fourfold plus NaHCO 3. Serum ceruloplasmin and ferritin in groups of rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> fourfold level of iron plus NaHCO 3 and rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> iron sixfold showed a significant increase (P ≤ 0. 05). Serum total protein and uric acid in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> basic level of iron plus NaHCO 3 and rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> twofold level of iron showed a significant decrease. Serum total protein levels in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> fourfold level of iron showed a significant decrease. Bread with NaHCO 3 showed higher phytic acid levels than other groups. Conclusions These results indicate that oxidative stress was not induced, whereas some antioxidant activities were significantly changed in rats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> iron-enriched bread...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} studies revealed that, in a murine model of asthma, mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Fas-deficient T cells developed a prolonged phase of airway inflammation, mucus production, and airway hyperreactivity {{that failed to}} resolve even 6 weeks after the last challenge. To investigate how Fas–Fas ligand (FasL) interaction occurs between T cells and other cells in vivo, Gld mice with abnormalities of the FasL signaling pathway were used. The reconstituted mice were made by transferring T cells from B 6 or Gld mice to Rag−/− or FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice. We found that Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> B 6 T cells resolved the airway inflammation, whereas FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Gld T cells developed a prolonged airway inflammation at Day 28, with decreased IFN-γ production. Both FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> B 6 T cells and Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Gld T cells also had completely resolved their airway inflammation by Day 28 after challenge. Interestingly, FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Gld T cells eventually resolved airway inflammation at Day 42, with a similar level of IFN-γ production to that of control group. These results demonstrate that FasL expression on either T cells only or non–T cells only was sufficient for the eventual resolution of airway inflammation, and the prolonged airway inflammation in FasL-deficient Rag−/− mice <b>that</b> <b>received</b> Gld T cells was correlated with decreased IFN-γ production by Gld T cells...|$|R

40|$|The sedative, propofol-sparing and {{cardiopulmonary}} {{effects of}} acepromazine, midazolam, butorphanol and combinations of butorphanol with acepromazine or midazolam in goats were evaluated. Six healthy Boer - Indigenous African crossbreed goats were by randomised cross-over designated to 6 groups: Group SAL <b>that</b> <b>received</b> saline, Group ACE <b>that</b> <b>received</b> acepromazine, Group MID <b>that</b> <b>received</b> midazolam, Group BUT <b>that</b> <b>received</b> butorphanol, Group ACEBUT <b>that</b> <b>received</b> acepromazine and butorphanol and Group MIDBUT <b>that</b> <b>received</b> midazolam and butorphanol as premedication agents intramuscularly on different occasions at least 3 weeks apart. The degree of sedation was assessed 20 minutes after {{administration of the}} premedication agents. Thirty minutes after premedication, the dose of propofol required for induction of anaesthesia adequate to allow placement of an endotracheal tube was determined. Cardiovascular, respiratory and arterial blood-gas parameters were assessed up to 30 minutes after induction of general anaesthesia. Acepromazine and midazolam produced significant sedation when administered alone, but premedication regimens incorporating butorphanol produced inconsistent results. The dose of propofol required for induction of anaesthesia was significantly reduced in goats <b>that</b> <b>received</b> midazolam alone, or midazolam combined with either acepromazine or butorphanol. The quality of induction of anaesthesia was good in all groups, including the control group. Cardiovascular, respiratory and blood-gas parameters were within normal limits in all groups and not significantly different between or within all groups. In conclusion: sedation with midazolam alone, or midazolam combined with either acepromazine or butorphanol significantly reduces the induction dose of propofol with minimal cardiopulmonary effects in goats...|$|R

5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches <b>that</b> <b>receive</b> information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
