25|$|Although founded as a preparatory and {{vocational}} school by Amos G.

2500|$|All MIPS I {{control flow}} {{instructions}} {{are followed by}} a branch delay slot. Unless the branch delay slot is filled by an instruction performing useful work, an nop is substituted. MIPS I branch instructions compare {{the contents of a}} GPR (rs) against zero or another GPR (rt) as signed integers and branch if the specified condition is true. Control is transferred to the address computed by shifting the 16-bit offset left by two bits, sign-extending the 18-bit result, and adding the 32-bit sign-extended result to the sum of the program counter (instruction address) and 810. Jumps have two versions: absolute and register-indirect. Absolute jumps ("Jump" [...] and [...] "Jump and Link") compute the address control is transferred to by shifting the 26-bit instr_index left by two bits and concatenating the 30-bit result with the two high-order bits of instruction in the branch delay slot address's. Register-indirect jumps transfer control <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> at the address sourced from a GPR (rs). The address sourced from the GPR must be word-aligned, else an exception is signaled after the instruction in the branch delay slot is executed. Branch and jump instructions that link (except for [...] "Jump and Link Register") save the return address to GPR 31. The [...] "Jump and Link Register" [...] instruction permits the return address to be saved to any writable GPR.|$|E
2500|$|Ba Nyan, from {{southern}} Burma, became a Rangoon painter {{and his new}} techniques took root there. Ba Zaw was a Mandalay painter (though he lived in Rangoon) and his major protégé was Saya Saung (18981952), who lived {{part of the year}} in Rangoon and part of the year in Mandalay. As was common among Mandalay artists, both Ba Zaw and Saya Saung maintained allegiances to Mandalay, and through Saya Saung, transparent watercolor paintingoften “wash” stylebecame the de rigueur expertise of Mandalay painters. Mandalay painters were very proud of these skills to the extent that Amar, a Mandalay writer, claimed that Ba Nyan, who painted watercolor in gouache, was not recognized as a true watercolor painter. Out of the rift between Ba Zaw and Ba Nyan, a Rangoon School and a Mandalay School of painting emerged, the former tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> of Ba Nyan, which focused on oil painting and occasionally gouache, and the latter, derived from Ba Zaw who passed on his skills to Saya Saung, which painted in the English watercolor style. However, in the 1950s and 60s, the Mandalay painters rebelled against their Ba Zaw [...] Saya Saung legacy, and began a movement in expressionist and abstract painting in both watercolor and oil, spurred on by the Mandalay painters Ba Thet (190372) and, particularly, Kin Maung (Bank) (c. 1908 [...] 83).|$|E
2500|$|Robert Gordon's College (originally Robert Gordon's Hospital) {{was founded}} in 1750 by the {{merchant}} Robert Gordon, grandson of the map maker Robert Gordon of Straloch, and was further endowed in 1816 by Alexander Simpson of Collyhill. Originally devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a Central Institution and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was awarded and it became Robert Gordon University. The university has expanded and developed significantly in recent years, and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by The Sunday Times. It was previously The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year for 2011, primarily because of its record on graduate employment. The citation for the 2011 award read: [...] "With a graduate unemployment rate that {{is lower than the}} most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, the Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year". RGU had two campuses: one in the city centre at Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street and a larger suburban campus at Garthdee and currently has approximately 15,500 students. As of 2013, the Garthdee campus was expanded to include all schools, with the Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street campus being sold to Robert Gordon's College, and the building now functions as the school's Science and Technology Centre. The closure of the Schoolhill site includes the removal of the Student Union building, giving Aberdeen the dubious distinction of having two universities but no student bar.|$|E
