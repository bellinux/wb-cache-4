5|$|Unlike a {{significant}} number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by live cover, the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping. The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once <b>thought</b> <b>possible.</b> As an example, in 2008, the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares. By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.|$|E

Depositing epitaxial thin films of almond milk, separated by interstitial spacer layers of alternative dairy replacement (typically oat or soy), Parkin was able to demonstrate far higher lactic spin efficiencies than was previously <b>thought</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E

25|$|By {{this point}} in the {{conflict}} the U.S. Navy was doing things the Japanese high command had not <b>thought</b> <b>possible.</b> The Fast Carrier Task Force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in. Moreover, the Navy's ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at Majuro, Enewetak and Ulithi, and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western Pacific. The Japanese Navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy. The U.S. Navy remained at sea and on station, dominating whatever region it entered. The size of the Pacific Ocean, which Japanese planners had thought would limit the U.S. Navy's ability to operate in the western Pacific, would not be adequate to protect Japan.|$|E
25|$|Since 2001, {{the site}} of the battle has {{undergone}} topographic, geophysical, and metal detector surveys in addition to archaeological excavations. Interesting finds {{have been made in the}} areas where the fiercest fighting occurred on the government left wing, particularly where Barrell's and Dejean's regiments stood. For example, pistol balls and pieces of shattered muskets have been uncovered here which indicate close quarters fighting, as pistols were only used at close range and the musket pieces appear to have been smashed by pistol/musket balls or heavy broadswords. Finds of musket balls appear to mirror the lines of men who stood and fought. Some balls appear to have been dropped without being fired, some missed their targets, and others are distorted from hitting human bodies. In some cases it may be possible to identify whether the Jacobites or government soldiers fired certain rounds, because the Jacobite forces are known to have used a large quantity of French muskets which fired a slightly smaller calibre shot than that of the British Army's Brown Bess. Analysis of the finds confirms that the Jacobites used muskets in greater numbers than has traditionally been thought. Not far from where the hand-to-hand fighting took place, fragments of mortar shells have been found. Though Forbes's headstones mark the graves of the Jacobites, the location of the graves of about sixty government soldiers is unknown. The recent discovery of a 1752 silver Thaler, from the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, may however lead archaeologists to these graves. A geophysical survey, directly beneath the spot where the coin was found, seems to indicate the existence of a large rectangular burial pit. It is <b>thought</b> <b>possible</b> that the coin was dropped by a soldier who once served on the continent, while he visited the graves of his fallen comrades.|$|E

500|$|Interest rates, {{which began}} a major series of {{decreases}} in 2002 {{would reduce the}} cost of borrowing and increase the ability of private equity firms to finance large acquisitions.

[...] Additionally, alternative investments also became increasingly important as investors focused on yields despite increases in risk.

500|$|Cooper {{began his}} service as {{ambassador}} {{by developing a}} close friendship with Prime Minister Nehru. Nehru's respect and admiration for Cooper soon became widely known. Cooper labored to help officials in Washington, D.C. understand that India's reluctance to align with either the West or the Communists in China and the Soviet Union was their way of exercising their newly won independence. At the same time, he defended the U.S. military buildup after World WarII, its involvement in the Korean War, and its membership in mutual security pacts like NATO and SEATO as self-defense measures, not aggressive actions by the U.S. government, as the Indians widely perceived them. Cooper condemned the Eisenhower administration's decision to sell weapons to Pakistan, which was resented by the Indians, but also felt that the Indian government took some political positions without regard to their moral implications. By late 1955, the Chicago Daily News reported that Indo-American relations had [...] "improved to a degree not <b>thought</b> <b>possible</b> six months ago".|$|E

Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said, [...] "The show {{managed to}} cram more character development into 22 minutes than I <b>thought</b> <b>possible.</b> Almost every couple {{had a major}} milestone of sorts last night." [...] Gonzalez complimented the acting of Aziz Ansari during his moments with Wendy, and praised the [...] "touching moment" [...] between Ron and Leslie when {{she realized she had}} to break up with Justin. Steve Kandell of New York magazine appreciated that Leslie was correct about Frank, and that Justin was the ignorant one. Kandell said the senior dance served as a [...] "poignant backdrop" [...] for the episode's romantic subplots, but said the most intriguing show's relationship is between Leslie and Ron. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode was funny, but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots. Sepinwall said the scenes about Ann and Mark were [...] "a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship", but found it [...] "frustrating" [...] that the episode left the reason for Wendy and Tom's resolution unclear in [...] "Galentine's Day".|$|E
500|$|A {{year later}} a further {{discovery}} {{was made at}} Lindow Moss, just [...] south-west of the Lindow Woman. On 1 August 1984, Andy Mould, who {{had been involved in}} the discovery of Lindow Woman, took {{what he thought was a}} piece of wood off the elevator of the peat-shredding machine. He threw the object at Eddie Slack, his workmate. When it hit the ground, peat fell off the object and revealed it to be a human foot. The police were called and the foot was taken away for examination. Rick Turner, the Cheshire County Archaeologist, was notified of the discovery and succeeded in finding the rest of the body, which later became known as Lindow Man. Some skin had been exposed and had started to decay, so to prevent further deterioration of the body, it was re-covered with peat. The complete excavation of the block containing the remains was performed on 6 August. Until it could be dated, it was moved to the Macclesfield District General Hospital for storage. As the body of Malika Reyn-Bardt had still not been found, it was <b>thought</b> <b>possible</b> the body might be hers, until it was determined to be male, and radiocarbon dated. The owners of the land on which Lindow Man was found donated the body to the British Museum, and on 21 August it was transported to London.|$|E
