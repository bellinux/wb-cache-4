5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> but possess a fovea.|$|E
5|$|The eyes {{can focus}} independently, and are {{specialized}} with a duplex retina that contains {{two types of}} visual cells for both day and night vision, and a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> which reflects onto the retina to enhance vision in the dark. There is also a third eyelid on each eye, the nictitating membrane.|$|E
5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E
5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The {{eyes are}} {{located at the}} sides of the head and have a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> or {{reflecting}} membrane, {{at the back of the}} retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> a reflective layer of {{tissue in the}} eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, {{including}} soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a dorsal stripe {{down the back}} (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large eyes and a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.|$|E
5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: {{in addition to having}} a large pupil and lens, and a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|E
5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet {{some or all of the}} brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (<b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum),</b> which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{eyes are}} similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, {{including}} similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment {{with the help of a}} tissue called <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum.</b> This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.|$|E
25|$|Cats {{have the}} ability to see in low light, which is due to muscles {{surrounding}} their irides–which contract and expand their pupils–as well as to the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> a reflective membrane that optimizes the image.|$|E
25|$|The retina of catfish are {{composed}} of single cones and large rods. Many catfish have a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> which may help enhance photon capture and increase low-light sensitivity. Double cones, though present in most teleosts, are absent from catfish.|$|E
25|$|Coelacanth {{eyes are}} very sensitive, {{and have a}} <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum.</b> Coelacanths are almost never caught in the daytime, but have been caught at all phases of the moon. Coelacanth eyes have many rods, receptors in the retina that help animals see in dim light. Together, the rods and tapetum help the fish see better in dark water.|$|E
25|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cones, since cone cells are not {{sensitive}} enough for a low-photon nighttime environment. There are few coloured oil droplets, which would reduce the light intensity, but the retina contains a reflective layer, the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum.</b> This increases the amount of light each photosensitive cell receives, allowing the bird to see better in low light conditions. Owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in diurnal hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
25|$|Cats, {{like dogs}} {{and many other}} animals, have a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> which is a {{reflective}} layer behind the retina that sends light that passes through the retina back into the eye. While this improves {{the ability to see}} in darkness, it appears to reduce net visual acuity, thus detracting when light is abundant. In very bright light, the slit-like pupil closes very narrowly over the eye, reducing the amount of light on the sensitive retina, and improving depth of field. Big cats have pupils that contract to a round point. The tapetum and other mechanisms give the cat a minimum light detection threshold up to seven times lower than that of humans. Variation in color of cats' eyes in flash photographs is largely due to the reflection of the flash by the tapetum.|$|E
25|$|The wels catfish's mouth {{contains}} {{lines of}} numerous small teeth, two long barbels {{on the upper}} jaw and four shorter barbels on the lower jaw. It has a long anal fin that extends to the caudal fin, and a small sharp dorsal fin relatively far forward. It relies largely on hearing and smell for hunting prey, but its eyes have a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> providing the advantage of night vision, {{contrary to popular belief}} that the wels has poor eyesight. With its sharp pectoral fins, it creates an eddy to disorient its victim, which the predator sucks into its mouth and swallows whole. The skin is very slimy. Skin colour varies with environment. Clear water will give the fish a black color, while muddy water will often tend to produce green-brown specimens. The underside is always pale yellow to white in colour. Albinistic specimens are known to exist and are caught occasionally. The wels swims by undulating its long, muscular tail in a wave-like action, similar to crocodilians. They can also swim backwards.|$|E
500|$|The eyes, {{ears and}} {{nostrils}} of crocodilians {{are at the}} top of the head. This allows them to stalk their prey with most of their bodies underwater. Crocodilians possess a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> which enhances vision in low light. While eyesight is fairly good in air, it is significantly weakened underwater. The fovea in other vertebrates is usually circular, but in crocodiles it is a horizontal bar of tightly packed receptors across the middle of the retina. When the animal completely submerges, the nictitating membranes cover its eyes. In addition, glands on the nictitating membrane secrete a salty lubricant that keeps the eye clean. When a crocodilian leaves the water and dries off, this substance is visible as [...] "tears".|$|E
500|$|The sperm whale's eye {{does not}} differ greatly {{from those of}} other toothed whales except in size. [...] It is the largest among the toothed whales, {{weighing}} about 170 g. [...] It is overall ellipsoid in shape, compressed along the visual axis, measuring about 7×7×3 cm. The cornea is elliptical and the lens is spherical. [...] The sclera is very hard and thick, roughly 1 cm anteriorly and 3 cm posteriorly. There are no ciliary muscles. The choroid is very thick and contains a fibrous <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum.</b> Like other toothed whales, the sperm whale can retract and protrude its eyes thanks to a 2-cm-thick retractor muscle attached around the eye at the equator.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most diurnal primates, {{but like}} all strepsirhine primates, the ring-tailed lemur has a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> or {{reflective}} layer behind the retina of the eye, that enhances night vision. [...] The tapetum is highly visible in this species because the pigmentation of the ocular fundus (back surface of the eye), which is present in—but varies between—all lemurs, is very spotty. [...] The ring-tailed lemur also has a rudimentary foveal depression on the retina. [...] Another shared characteristic with the other strepsirrhine primates is the rhinarium, a moist, naked, glandular nose supported by the upper jaw and protruding beyond the chin. [...] The rhinarium continues down where it divides the upper lip. [...] The upper lip {{is attached to the}} premaxilla, preventing the lip from protruding and thus requiring the lemur to lap water rather than using suction.|$|E
500|$|Spiders have {{primarily}} four {{pairs of}} {{eyes on the}} top-front area of the cephalothorax, arranged in patterns that vary from one family to another. [...] The principal pair at the front are of the type called pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), which in most arthropods are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by {{the walls of the}} cup. However, in spiders these eyes are capable of forming images. The other pairs, called secondary eyes, are thought to be derived from the compound eyes of the ancestral chelicerates, but no longer have the separate facets typical of compound eyes. Unlike the principal eyes, in many spiders these secondary eyes detect light reflected from a reflective <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> and wolf spiders can be spotted by torch light reflected from the tapeta. On the other hand, jumping spiders' secondary eyes have no tapeta.|$|E
500|$|The Portuguese dogfish {{typically}} {{reaches a}} length of [...] for males and [...] for females, though specimens up to [...] long have been recorded. Sharks in the Mediterranean are smaller, growing no more than [...] long. This species has a flattened, broadly rounded snout that is shorter than the mouth is wide. The nostrils are preceded by short flaps of skin. The eyes are large and oval in shape, positioned laterally {{on the head and}} equipped with a reflective <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> that produces a yellow-green [...] "eye shine". The mouth is wide and slightly arched, with moderately thick, smooth lips and short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws. The upper teeth are slender and upright with a single cusp, numbering 4368 rows. The lower teeth have a short, strongly angled cusp and number 2941 rows; their bases interlock to form a continuous cutting surface. The five pairs of gill slits are short and nearly vertical.|$|E
500|$|Researchers {{working at}} Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands {{have found the}} blacktip reef shark can be readily {{attracted}} by splashing or striking metal tools against hard objects underwater, {{as well as by}} the scent of both healthy and injured fish. As with most sharks, the blacktip reef shark does not have any cone cells in its retina, limiting its ability to discriminate colors and fine details. Instead, its vision is adapted for sensitivity to movement or contrast under low light conditions, which is further enhanced by the presence of a reflective <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum.</b> Experiments have shown that this shark is capable of detecting small objects up to [...] away, but is unable to clearly discern the shape of the object. Electroreception is another means by which this shark can locate prey; its ampullae of Lorenzini have a sensitivity of approximately 4nV/cm and an effective range of [...] Similar to the grey reef shark, this species becomes more excited and [...] "confident" [...] in the presence of other individuals of its species, and in extreme situations can be roused into a feeding frenzy. Feeding activity may be greater at night than during the day.|$|E
2500|$|In many flash photographs, {{even those}} without {{perceptible}} red-eye effect, the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> of many animals' pupils creates an [...] "eyeshine" [...] effect. [...] Although eyeshine is an unrelated phemonenon, animals with blue eyes may display the red-eye effect {{in addition to}} it.|$|E
2500|$|A related type of chromatophore, the leucophore, {{is found}} in some fish, in {{particular}} in the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum.</b> [...] Like iridophores, they utilize crystalline purines (often guanine) to reflect light. [...] Unlike iridophores, however, leucophores have more organized crystals that reduce diffraction. [...] Given a source of white light, they produce a white shine. [...] As with xanthophores and erythrophores, in fish the distinction between iridophores and leucophores is not always obvious, but, in general, iridophores are considered to generate iridescent or metallic colours, whereas leucophores produce reflective white hues.|$|E
2500|$|Vision is its {{critical}} sense. Its {{eyes are}} proportionally large and contain a large spherical lens, improving its focusing ability. Its pupil is mobile {{to help it}} adapt to the intense glare of the Arctic ice. Its retina is rod-dominated and backed by a cat-like and reflective <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> enhancing its low light sensitivity. Its rods best sense blue-green, while its cones help with bright light and may provide some colour discrimination. Its cornea is sometimes tear-covered, {{to protect it from}} salt. Lacking tear ducts, it [...] "cries" [...] to remove its tears. On ice, the mother identifies her offspring by smell. This sense may also warn of an approaching predator. Underwater, this seal closes its nostrils and smells nothing. Its whiskers, called vibrissae, lie in horizontal rows on either side of its snout. They may provide a touch sense, and underwater, also respond to low-frequency vibrations, such as movement.|$|E
2500|$|Crocodiles {{have very}} good night vision, and are mostly nocturnal hunters. They use the {{disadvantage}} of most prey animals' poor nocturnal vision to their advantage. The light receptors in crocodilians’ eyes include cones and numerous rods, so it is assumed all crocodilians can see colours. Crocodiles have vertical-slit shaped pupils, {{similar to those of}} domestic cats. One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil, helping to protect the eyes during daylight. On the rear wall of the eye is a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> which reflects incoming light back onto the retina, thus utilizing the small amount of light available at night to best advantage. In addition to the protection of the upper and lower eyelids, crocodiles have a nictitating membrane (sometimes called a [...] "third eye-lid") that can be drawn over the eye from the inner corner while the lids are open. The eyeball surface is thus protected under the water while a certain degree of vision is still possible.|$|E
50|$|Presence of a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> enables {{animals to}} see in dimmer light than would {{otherwise}} be possible. The <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> which is iridescent, reflects light roughly on the interference principles of thin-film optics, as seen in other iridescent tissues. However, the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> cells are leucophores, not iridophores.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> {{in animals}} that have it, can produce eyeshine, for example {{as seen in}} cat eyes at night. Red-eye effect, a {{reflection}} of red blood vessels, appears {{in the eyes of}} humans and other animals that have no <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum,</b> hence no eyeshine, and rarely in animals that have a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum.</b> The red-eye effect is a photographic effect, not seen in nature.|$|E
50|$|In flash photographs, {{odd-eyed}} cats typically show a red-eye {{effect in}} the blue eye, {{but not in the}} other eye. This is due to the combined effect of the (normal) presence of a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> in both eyes and the absence of melanin in the blue eye. The <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> produces eyeshine in both eyes, but in the non-blue eye a layer of melanin over the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> selectively removes some colors of light.|$|E
50|$|Like humans, {{some animals}} lack a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> {{and they usually}} are diurnal. These include most {{primates}}, squirrels, some birds, red kangaroo, and pig. Among primates only the strepsirrhines, {{with the exception of}} several diurnal Eulemur species, have a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> is present, its {{location}} on the eyeball varies with {{the placement of the}} eyeball in the head, such that in all cases the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> enhances night vision {{in the center of the}} animal's field of view.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> {{functions}} as a retroreflector which reflects light directly back along the light path. This serves to match the original and reflected light, thus maintaining the sharpness and contrast of {{the image on the}} retina. The <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> reflects with constructive interference, thus increasing the quantity of light passing through the retina. In the cat, the <b>tapetum</b> <b>lucidum</b> increases the sensitivity of vision by 44%, allowing the cat to see light that is imperceptible to human eyes.|$|E
