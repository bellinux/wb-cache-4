During this time Pilecki’s group was itself infiltrated by , a former TAP member and double agent for Poland's Stalinist government.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> emergence of male turtles.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, a huge {{general strike}} took place {{across the country}} at the {{instigation}} of the Belgian Workers' Party on the issue of voting rights. The system of plural voting, in force since 1893, was extremely unpopular because of its perceived unfairness, but also because the system tended <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Party. Although between 300,000 and 450,000 workers were involved, the strike was ultimately unsuccessful. The party voted in favor ending the strike and taking future action by parliamentary means, on 22 April 1913.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, the Spanish {{government}} decided {{to sign a}} contract with the French company GIAT to begin production of the AMX-30. However, it was not the advantages of the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness to sell their L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, that led the Spanish Army <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> French armored vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Duchy's {{population}} was 65% Polish but with its exclusion of serfs and underrepresentation of landless rural commoners the electoral law was designed <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> German inhabitants. The proportion of Polish representatives diminished further {{after the events}} of 1848, and Jacek Jędruch notes that due to growing discrimination against Polish representatives that date {{marks the end of}} the period in which this legislative body can be seen as continuing the Polish parliamentary tradition. Also, while the proceedings of the first sejms were published in Polish, since 1877 they were published in German.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s Indiana's Republican party, whose adherents tended <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> temperance movement, began {{challenging}} the state's Democrats, who supported personal freedom and a limited federal government, for political power. Early temperance legislation in Indiana earned only limited and temporary success. In 1853 Republicans persuaded {{the state legislature}} to pass a local option law that would allow township voters to declare their township dry, but it was later deemed unconstitutional. In 1855 a statewide prohibition law was passed, but it met the same fate as the local option. In the decades to come Protestant churches, especially the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, Quakers, and women's groups would continue to support temperance efforts and gave strong support to the mostly dry Republican Party. The Catholics, Episcopalians and Lutherans stood opposed and gave strong support to the wet Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{design has}} similar goals to protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. Nucleic acid design {{has the advantage of}} being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. Nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

5|$|The Bridge Creek–Moore tornado {{was part}} of a much larger outbreak, which {{produced}} 71 tornadoes across five states throughout the Central Plains on May 3 alone, along with an additional 25 that touched down a day later in some of the areas affected by the previous day's activity (some of which were spawned supercells that developed on the evening of May 3), stretching eastward to the Mississippi River Valley. On the morning of May 3, in its Day 1 Convective Outlook for the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a slight risk for severe weather, as a dry line that stretched from western Kansas into western Texas approached a warm, humid air-mass over the Central Plains; the conditions ahead of the dry line and a connecting trough positioned over northeastern Colorado appeared <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> development of thunderstorms later that day that would contain large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and isolated tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|This left Australia {{a target}} of 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have been}} the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. Only 44 runs came in the first hour. Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes and they began to attack; Morris hit three consecutive fours off Len Hutton's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121/1. In the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both had given chances, but England fumbled them.|$|E

Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. When Laker was introduced to exploit the spin, 13 runs were taken from his first over, but only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. Bradman signalled his intentions on his first ball by driving Laker against the spin for a boundary. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours off Len Hutton's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121/1. In the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Australia had given chances, but England failed to seize them. Evans failed to stump Morris when he was on 32, and Crapp dropped Bradman from Compton.|$|E

25|$|Since R. revolutionalis queens mate singly, {{there is}} a high level of {{relatedness}} within the colony, and the workers are more likely <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> sons produced by workers rather than sons produced by the queen because the workers are more closely related to each other's sons.

So, the workers switch between wanting to invest in new queens and wanting to invest in males depending on how many queens already exist in the colony.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{differentiating}} feature {{between the}} MWC model and KNF model {{lies in the}} scale of conformational changes.

On the other hand, the KNF model suggests these conformational changes occur {{on the level of}} tertiary structure within the protein, as neighboring subunits change conformation with successive ligand binding.|$|R

30|$|Observing Figure  4, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the oils from the fresh {{branches}} at 2100  m altitude are different from the other groups by the compound 54, epi-cyclocolorenone, a sesquiterpene ketone (Figure  3 e). Epi-cyclocolorenone was biosynthesized only at 2100  m altitude in all oils, and in higher proportions in the oils from fresh branches (36.47 %), followed by dry leaves (7.32 %) and fresh leaves (5.53 %) (Table  6). Thus, {{it can be seen}} that the elevation in altitude <b>favored</b> <b>the</b> biosynthesis of this compound in D. brasiliensis, in addition <b>to</b> <b>favoring</b> <b>the</b> formation of phenylpropanoids. It can also be inferred that epi-cyclocolorenone, possibly, presents biosynthesis in the branches and is translocated to the leaves.|$|R
