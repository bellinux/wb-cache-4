5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E

With Stoke not being promoted Higginbotham again decided <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> a transfer request to help force through a move to Sunderland. He spent one season at the Stadium of Light before returning to Stoke in 2008. He became a vital member of Tony Pulis' squad as Stoke established themselves in the Premier League. He scored the winning goal in the FA Cup quarter-final against West Ham United but missed out on both the semi-final and the final due to a knee injury. After his recovery he struggled to force his {{way back into the}} side and spent time out on loan to Nottingham Forest and Ipswich Town before joining Sheffield United on a free transfer in January 2013. After eight months at Bramall Lane, he left to join Conference Premier side Chester before ending his career with a short spell at Altrincham.|$|E
5|$|Placed on {{an upper}} {{floor of the}} State House, the bell was rung {{in the early years}} of {{independence}} on the Fourth of July and on Washington's Birthday, as well as on Election Day to remind voters <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> their ballots. It also rang to call students at the University of Pennsylvania to their classes at nearby Philosophical Hall. Until 1799, when the state capital was moved to Lancaster, it again rang to summon legislators into session. When Pennsylvania, having no further use for its State House, proposed to tear it down and sell the land for building lots, the City of Philadelphia purchased the land, together with the building, including the bell, for $70,000, equal to $ today. In 1828, the city sold the second Lester and Pack bell to St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church, which was burned down by an anti-Catholic mob in the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844. The remains of the bell were recast; the new bell is now located at Villanova University.|$|E

25|$|As {{the coup}} was under {{preparation}} in December 1917, Rakovsky was {{present on the}} border and waiting a signal to enter the country. When Bolsheviks were arrested and the move was overturned, he was probably responsible for ordering the arrest of Romania's representative to Petrograd, Constantin I. Diamandy, and his entire staff (all of whom were used as hostages, pending the release of prisoners taken in Iaşi). Trotsky, who was by then Russia's People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs (Foreign Minister), called on the Romanian government of Ion I. C. Brătianu <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> persons captured, indicating that he would otherwise encourage the communist activities of Romanian refugees on Russian soil, and receiving a reply according to which no such arrests had occurred.|$|E
25|$|In March 1949, he {{was arrested}} by the regime's secret police, the Securitate. The latter {{discovered}} his name while investigating the Bucharest connections of the armed resistance movement. Late in 1948, Tonegaru had obtained a Belgian Red Cross parcel for Teohar Mihadaş, a poet and {{former member of the}} fascist Iron Guard, who, unbeknown to his benefactor, had passed it on to an anti-communist fighter in his native Bistriţa. Caught up in the subsequent Securitate clampdown, Mihadaș was tortured until he implicated his connections. According to one account, the Securitate officers storming into Tonegaru's house treated him like a ringleader, and, having misinterpreted a piece of paper on which the poet had sketched out a piece titled Pistolul lui Werther ("Werther's Gun"), pressed him <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> his weapons, and repeatedly beat him with a crop.|$|E
25|$|By 17 February, Soviet {{infantry}} and cavalry divisions supported by aircraft {{were less than}} 15 kilometers northeast of Tbilisi. The Georgian army put up a stubborn fight {{in defense of the}} approaches to the capital, which they held for a week in the face of overwhelming Red Army superiority. From 18 to 20 February, the strategic heights of Kojori and Tabakhmela passed from hand <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> heavy fighting. Georgian forces under General Giorgi Mazniashvili managed to push the Soviets back inflicting heavy losses; they quickly regrouped and tightened the circle around Tbilisi. By 23 February, the railway bridges had been restored, and Soviet tanks and armoured trains joined in a renewed assault on the capital. While the armoured trains laid down suppressing fire, tanks and infantry penetrated the Georgian positions on the Kojori heights. On 24 February, the Georgian commander-in-chief, Giorgi Kvinitadze, bowed to the inevitable and ordered a withdrawal to save his army from complete encirclement and the city from destruction. The Georgian government and the Constituent Assembly evacuated to Kutaisi in western Georgia, which dealt the Georgian army a significant moral blow.|$|E

500|$|The Trial of Lord George Gordon {{for high}} treason {{occurred}} on 5 February 1781 before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench, {{as a result}} of Gordon's role in the eponymously named riots.

Intending only <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> a petition to Parliament, Gordon riled the crowd by announcing the postponement of the petition, denouncing Members of Parliament and launching [...] "anti-Catholic harangues".
