We wanted to find a solution to a plot problem. And we still had Leonard Nimoy’s presence there, even though he [...] was dead. So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which is outrageous. Outrageous, and yet we did it, and {{had a lot of fun}} doing it. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to get him out of it. Because Leonard’s officially retired, so we did the animation to use his voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for the band's {{second album}} started {{immediately}} after touring their self-titled debut. Guitarist Munky described {{the writing process}} as, [...] "we didn't write nothin' for two years <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> creativity build up, like blue balls of creativity." [...] Doug Small, author of The Story of Korn (...) , said that [...] "the band's songwriting method — a sort of collective building process wherein four instrumentalists, with the input of Jonathan , develop each other's ideas until they've created a monster — is truly a group effort." [...] The album's lyrics — {{for the most part}} — were primarily written by lead singer Jonathan Davis. Drummer David Silveria told Modern Drummer, [...] "somebody will start playing something {{and the rest of us}} will work around it and see where it goes." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{and lead}} {{designer}} Billy Thomson had previously confirmed that Crackdown was designed {{from the outset}} to be a long-running series of games, stating that sequels for the game are very likely to be produced, especially if Crackdown performed well commercially. However, during the Industry All Stars event in September 2007, Wilson confirmed that Realtime Worlds was not working on a sequel to the game, saying [...] "Microsoft was a little late in stepping {{up to the plate}} to ask for Crackdown 2, and by <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> already started working on bigger, better things". However, then-corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios, Shane Kim, stated that Microsoft still holds the intellectual property rights for Crackdown and that a Crackdown sequel was still a possibility. [...] Realtime Studios manager Colin MacDonald clarified that if they have the resources after completion of , they could approach Microsoft to discuss a sequel.|$|E

500|$|Captain America's shield, {{which serves}} as both a {{defensive}} tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG). Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that [...] "We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [...] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.... And <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a stunt shield made of polyurethane, {{which is sort of}} a synthetic rubber... and we made an ultrasoft one we put on [...] back, so that if there were an accident, it wouldn't hurt him." [...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield".|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz, Richard Zajdlic, Tony Saint and Simon Burke were {{contracted}} as {{the series}} writers, while Alex Holmes, Bill Eagles, Paul Wilmshurst and Daniel Percival {{serve as the}} series directors. Andy Harries and Elaine Pyke were the show's executive producers, with Percival and Spotnitz working as Co-Executive Producers. In addition, Michael Casey, Trevor Hopkins and Sue De Beauvoir were the series producers, with Bill Shepard serving as co-producer. Spotnitz wrote the first episodes. He was approached to write for the series because the producers needed somebody to reimagine the show as Armitage was committed to The Hobbit in New Zealand, by introducing two new leads. Spotnitz described the process; [...] "We had this great format, this great world of 'Strike Back' and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to imagine who were the new characters {{who were going to}} drive the show in the second year." [...] Before Project Dawn was even announced, the crew were scouting for locations in South Africa, where the first series was shot, as well as investigating {{other parts of the world}} including the United States, South America, and Europe.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequences}} where Superman utilizes close-combat fight {{scenes with}} the other Kryptonians {{proved to be a}} major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew. Desjardin explained, [...] "When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don’t want to do the traditional, 'OK I’m a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that’s not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment." ...|$|E

500|$|Rudin {{believed}} England {{offered the}} level of craftsmanship in period detail, painting and costuming that was suitable for the film's design. Having directed Batman entirely in Britain, Burton agreed, and designers from Batmans art department were employed by Paramount for Sleepy Hollow. As a result, principal photography was pushed back to November 20, 1998 at Leavesden Film Studios, which had been recently vacated by [...] The majority of filming took place at Leavesden, with studio other work at Shepperton Studios, where the massive Tree of the Dead set was built using Stage H. Production then moved to the Hambleden estate at Lime Tree Valley for a month-long shoot in March, where the town of Sleepy Hollow was constructed. [...] "We came to England figuring we would find a perfect little town," [...] producer Adam Schroeder recalled, [...] "and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to build it anyway." [...] Filming in Britain continued through April, and a few [...] scenes were shot using a sound stage in Yonkers, New York the following May.|$|E
500|$|... "Trevor" [...] was co-written by Ken Hawryliw and Jim Guttridge. Hawryliw {{had been}} The X-Files {{property}} master from 1993 to 1998 while {{the show was}} filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Over the years, he had written several scripts but had never submitted them to The X-Files writing staff. Eventually, {{he moved on to}} work on Millennium, where he developed a friendship with Guttridge. Guttridge showed Hawryliw a script he had been writing that he wanted to submit for The X-Files. Although the story was not written like an X-Files script, Hawryliw enjoyed the premise. The two decided to form a partnership: Guttridge would craft the basic story and script and Hawryliw would help to craft it into an X-Files script. Hawryliw later explained that the idea to make Pinker search out his son: [...] "There's this unique man who can walk through walls. Now, who would this ability best apply to? Well, a convict obviously—a guy in prison. But <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to give him an even stronger, more compelling reason to want his freedom, and that was where his son came from".|$|E
500|$|Their {{subsequent}} recording for {{the album}} was influenced by their experiences in Trinidad and Caribbean musical styles, including the rhythms and festive atmosphere of the local music scene. They enlisted Trinidadian dancehall artist General Grant, a regular at Caribbean Sound Basin, to perform a ragga rap on [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Dance Hall", songs they developed in Trinidad. Raphael Wiggins recalled this in an interview for the Toronto Star: [...] " [...] was just hanging around the studio. We {{asked him to come}} freestyle on [...] After that, he just kept hanging around. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the song 'Dance Hall' playing one night and he started again, so we just turned on the mic." [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend" [...] was also recorded there. According to D'wayne, they recorded [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] in the studio at 3a.m., and Raphael was [...] "quite snookered" [...] on an alcoholic beverage when delivering his vocals. Collectively, the group had written and recorded approximately 40songs {{at the end of the}} sessions. In an interview for Billboard, D'wayne Wiggins said that they focused on the love songs when having to decide what songs would make the album.|$|E

500|$|When Manfredini {{returned}} {{for the first}} sequel, he had an easier time composing since he only needed to perfect what he had already created. Over {{the course of the}} sequels, Manfredini loosened the philosophy that the theme should be reserved just for the killer. Manfredini describes the style of the sequels as more of a [...] "setting 'em up and knocking 'em down" [...] approach, which meant that there were more [...] "McGuffins and red‑herrings" [...] that required the killer's theme music be played to try to trick the audience. Manfredini explains, [...] "The original had the real myopic approach, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to start thinking of the sequels as more conventional films." [...] For Part 3, Manfredini only returned to score the first and last reels of the film because he was busy with a Broadway production. Jack Tillar pieced together portions of the score from the first two films to fill the remaining time for Part 3, while Michael Zagar composed an opening and closing theme. Manfredini and Zagar met at the latter's apartment, where Zagar rescored the original opening theme using a disco beat. Manfredini {{returned for}} The Final Chapter, and although there were similar elements to the score, everything was newly recorded for the fourth Friday the 13th.|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{regarded}} as favourites and their team included many players who had experienced success in the competition. The most notable was captain Paolo Maldini, who had won the competition four times previously, all with Milan, and Clarence Seedorf who had won the competition three times with three different clubs. Liverpool had been considered underdogs throughout the competition, but had beaten more favoured opposition, including Juventus and Chelsea, to reach the final. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez acknowledged this: [...] "Maybe Milan are favourites, but we have confidence, and we can win". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger felt Liverpool would win the match: [...] "I fancy Liverpool as Milan look jaded physically and certainly mentally, by losing the [...] title, I think they {{have never had a}} better chance than now to beat Milan." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was not so optimistic, stating that the Liverpool side were not as good as the one that had won the 2001 UEFA Cup Final: [...] "No disrespect to the squad we have got now but it is obvious we are not as strong as we were when we won the UEFA Cup in 2001. Back <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a settled team and that season when we went into games against Barcelona and Roma, we always felt we were as good as them." ...|$|E

I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when I was stuck out there, it cost me {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace.

On 17 September 2008, Albarn and Jamie Hewlett {{announced}} that they would be doing another Gorillaz album in an interview with CBC News. Hewlett said that from their work on Monkey, [...] "we just learned more about what we do, musically and artistically. That's a great place to come at when we come to another Gorillaz album. It doesn't have to be animation and music". Hewlett also expressed annoyance at having to draw the band members again: [...] "I'm so f--king bored of drawing those characters. But <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a moment where we had a new angle on it... I'm gonna adapt them".

It isn’t a judgment of guilt. It isn't a disciplinary measure. And what we've done is to use the interim to try {{to understand the nature of}} the case better.
