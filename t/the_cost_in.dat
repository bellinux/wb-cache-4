5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{internet}} usage in China {{is much higher}} than other nations. Many minimum wage workers in China cannot afford access to internet because the cost of having the internet is about 10 percent of their wage. The cost {{of internet}} usage in China as a percentage of income is 18 times <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> South Korea and 51.5 times <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> Japan. This data shows that because the cost of the internet is so high in China, many Chinese citizens cannot afford the internet. The digital divide in China is directly related to income.|$|E

25|$|The oxides of {{nitrogen}} are a natural product of the burning of gas in air and are produced in large quantities by gas-fired furnaces.

25|$|Patterns that {{incorporate}} discontinuous street types such as crescents and culs-de-sac have not, in general, regarded pedestrian {{movement as a}} priority and, consequently, have produced blocks that are usually in the 1000-foot range and often exceed it.

25|$|Haloperidol was {{discovered}} in 1958 by Paul Janssen. It was made from pethidine (meperidine).

The yearly cost of the typical dose of haloperidol is about 20 to 800 pounds (30 to 1,250 US dollars) in the United Kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> the United States is around 250 US dollars a year.|$|E

25|$|A more {{comprehensive}} approach to measuring cost-effectiveness or efficacy of malarial control would not only measure <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> dollars, {{as well as the}} number of people saved, but would also consider ecological damage and negative human health impacts.

It is similar to the earlier study regarding estimated theoretical infant mortality caused by DDT and subject to the criticism also mentioned earlier.|$|E
25|$|The Both respirator, a {{negative}} pressure ventilator, {{was invented in}} 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered {{by the fact that}} the machines were very large, heavy (about 102kg), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and £2000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> Europe in the mid-1950s was around £1500.

Estimates vary as to the number of men lost at Hanover; Union losses in one source are listed as 19 killed, 73 wounded, and 123 missing (for a total of 215). The 18th Pennsylvania had suffered the most, with three men killed, 24 wounded, and 57 missing. On the Confederate side, Stuart's losses are generally estimated as 9 dead, 50 wounded, and 58 missing, for a total of 117.|$|E
25|$|As North Vietnam {{needed to}} {{replenish}} its {{armed forces in}} 1974, Thiệu decided {{to go on the}} attack. He stretched his own forces thinly by launching offensives that regained most of the territory captured by PAVN forces during the 1973 campaign, and retook 15% of the total land area controlled by the communists {{at the time of the}} cease-fire. In April, Thiệu launched the Svay Rieng Campaign against communist strongholds in eastern Cambodia near Tây Ninh, in what was the last major ARVN offensive. While these operations were successful, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> terms of manpower and resources was high. By the end of the year the military was experiencing equipment shortages as a result of decreased American aid, while communist forces continued to gain strength.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than a year}} later, the Oakland Seals were in {{financial}} difficulty and having trouble drawing fans. An apparent deal was in place to move the team to Vancouver, but the NHL {{did not want to}} see one of their franchises from the expansion of 1967 move so quickly and vetoed the deal. In exchange for avoiding a lawsuit, the NHL promised Vancouver would get a team in the next expansion. Another group, headed by Minnesota entrepreneur Tom Scallen, made a new presentation and was awarded an expansion franchise for the price of $6million (three times <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> 1967). The new ownership group purchased the WHL Canucks, and brought the team into the league with the Buffalo Sabres as expansion teams for the 1970–71 season.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} value of natural capital and ecosystem services is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as {{especially important in}} ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> dollar terms. Ecological economist Robert Costanza led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in Nature, the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global GDP was $27 trillion). Half of the value went to nutrient cycling. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in Ecological Economics Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Same-sex alliances do {{not need}} to be sexual in nature, {{although}} when competition for partners is especially severe the sexualisation of same-sex alliances occur more often. Displays of commitment between partners are adaptive because of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> terms of efforts invested in maintaining the alliance. Sex could be argued as a type of currency in long-term relationships, and signify to an individual’s partner and to others a prominent level of connection and commitment, and homosexual/homoerotic behaviour become significant representation of one’s loyalty and affiliation in a same-sex alliance. Ultimately, homoerotic behaviour is not selectively disadvantaged, as homoerotic behaviour does not result in a net decrease to an individual’s reproductive success, and the attraction to other individuals of same sex and the behaviour as result of that attraction is not contrary or alternative to the attraction to people of the other sex.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>in</b> February 1929 were {{approximately}} {{half a million}} Francs, although this excluded {{the cost of the}} lodge and the landscaping elements (almost twice the original budget). The project was tendered in February with contracts awarded in March 1929. Changes made to the design whilst the project was being built including an amendment to the storey height and the exclusion and then re-introduction of the chauffeur's accommodation led to the costs rising to approximately 900,000 Francs. At the time the project started on site no design work had been done on the lodge and the final design was only presented to the client in June 1929. The design was for a double lodge but this was reduced to a single lodge as the costs were too high. Although construction of the whole house was complete within a year, it was not habitable until 1931.|$|E
