In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to the slide handle and released <b>the</b> <b>action</b> slide lock which enabled immediate opening of <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> In {{the absence of any}} recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release <b>the</b> <b>action</b> slide lock.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control <b>the</b> <b>action</b> indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), in which case <b>the</b> <b>action</b> is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates <b>the</b> <b>action</b> directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is {{commonly referred to as}} direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

5|$|Casualties in {{the battle}} were minimal, the British losing four killed and two wounded while the French {{recorded}} no casualties at all. The significance of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> lies in {{the ease with which}} French frigates operating from Île de France were able to attack and capture vital trade convoys without facing serious opposition. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> of 18 November was the second occasion in 1809 in which a British East India convoy was destroyed and another would be lost at <b>the</b> <b>Action</b> of 3 July 1810 the following year. These losses were exceptionally heavy, especially when combined with the 12 East Indiamen wrecked during 1809, and would eventually provoke the massive buildup of British forces in late 1810. Despite the French success Vénus was never again able to operate independently in this manner. Hamelin was needed during 1810 to operate against the strong British frigate squadrons that returned in the spring to harass his cruisers and prepare for the planned invasions of Île Bonaparte and Île de France using the soldiers stationed on Rodriguez. The French commodore was ultimately unable to prevent these operations and was eventually captured in <b>the</b> <b>Action</b> of 18 September 1810, a personal engagement with Rowley on HMS Boadicea.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{attribution}} of personal traits to other persons depends on <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>the</b> observer performs {{at the same}} time (Bach & Tipper, 2007). Here, we show that the effect reflects a mis{{attribution of}} appraisals of <b>the</b> observers’ own <b>actions</b> to <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> of others. We exploited spatial compatibility effects to manipulate how fluently—how fast and how accurately—participants identified two individuals performing sporty or academic <b>actions.</b> <b>The</b> traits attributed to each person in a subsequent rating task depended on the fluency of participants’ responses in a specific manner. An individual more fluently identified while performing <b>the</b> academic <b>action</b> appeared more academic and less sporty. An individual more fluently identified while performing <b>the</b> sporty <b>action</b> appeared sportier. Thus, social perception is—at least partially—embodied. The ease of our own responses can be misattributed to <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> of others, affecting which personal traits are attributed to them...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Action</b> of 18 September 1810 was a naval battle fought between British Royal Navy and French Navy frigates in the Indian Ocean {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars.

In consequence of the heavy losses the British force had suffered, reinforcements were hastily rushed to the area and became individual targets for the larger French squadron blockading the British base at Île Bourbon.|$|E
