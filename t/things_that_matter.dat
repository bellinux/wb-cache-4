What is my perspective now? I've fought for so many things, I've tried so hard to be number one and to stay on top, to look good, to be the best. And I realized that a lot of things that last and the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> are none of those things." ...|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, {{who had not}} served as writers since the season four season finale, wrote the script for the series finale. Regarding the finale, Mutchnick stated: [...] "We wrote {{about what you want}} to have happen with people you love. I think Will and Grace end up very fleshed out. They end up as full adults. All the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> in life, they end up having." [...] Three years before the series finale was created, Mutchnick was asked on his opinion regarding how {{he would like to see}} the character's story come to a conclusion, [...] "The truth is that [...] serve each other's dysfunction. And the best way for their story to end is to find love." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belfast, Northern Ireland, where a person's religion and income are evident by the street they live on. He contrasted this with the anonymity he felt when visiting Ethiopia, saying: [...] "...the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren't such divisions, {{a place where the}} streets have no name. To me, that's the way a great rock 'n' roll concert should be: a place where everyone comes together... Maybe that's the dream of all art: to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> the most to us all." [...] Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife, Ali Hewson; he first wrote them down on an airsickness bag while staying in a village.|$|E
500|$|Brandon {{gave the}} Dream a 4.5/5, despite stating {{that it was}} [...] "no Apple iPhone killer", given its lower quality of its {{application}} selection and multimedia features in comparison. In conclusion, the Dream {{was considered to be}} a [...] "stellar" [...] phone that [...] "points to a future when a phone is as flexible and useful as the PC on your desk." [...] Engadget felt that the Dream [...] "isn't going to blow anyone's mind right out of the gate" [...] due to its hardware, but that the Android platform as a whole held its own against its competitors, and that early adopters of Android through the G1 were [...] "buying {{into one of the most}} exciting developments in the mobile world in recent memory." [...] GSMArena noted that the Dream would have been [...] "another average smart QWERTY messenger" [...] had it not been for its introduction of Android; in conclusion, the Dream was considered [...] "far from the perfect package", but still believed that [...] "it gets the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter</b> done and gets them done right." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Painters and Dockers {{released}} seven albums between 1984 and 1994, {{which featured}} {{a selection of}} sarcastic and amusing singles, such as [...] "Die Yuppie Die" [...] from 1988's Kiss My Art and pro-queer and anti-monarchy [...] "I Know Better Queens Than That" [...] from 1994's The <b>Things</b> <b>That</b> <b>Matter.</b> Their greatest chart success was achieved with 1985's [...] "Nude School" [...] which received air play {{on a number of}} commercial radio stations and which was marked by its controversial lyrics and video clip. At one time, The Painters and Dockers even co-owned a vinyl record pressing plant.|$|E

60|$|The Assistant Commissioner {{shook his}} {{supported}} head. “The history of your relations with that useful personage {{is the only}} <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> just now,” he said, closing slowly his weary, deep-set eyes, and then opening them swiftly with a greatly refreshed glance.|$|R
60|$|ECRASIA. I {{say that}} if the ancients had {{thoroughly}} grasped the theory of fine art they would understand that the difference between a beautiful nose and an ugly one is of supreme importance: that it is indeed the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{practice}} note {{version of}} the report also rates conditions from 1 - good, 2, - needing attention in the near future, 3 - needing attention now using a traffic light system {{to draw attention to}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter.</b> [...] In this format, if there is a defect, not only will it be identified but its causes analyzed and methods of repair and elimination of the cause discussed in some detail. [...] The report also includes commentary to advise your solicitor on issues that need addressing in the conveyance, and any risks that affect the building, grounds and people of a more general nature. [...] There is also discussion on the means of escape in case of fire, which in older houses in particular can be compromised by poor design and alterations. [...] There is no market valuation or an assessment of rebuilding costs for insurance purposes in the document. [...] These can be added, along with cost estimates for the repairs by a separate agreement as discussed in the helpful RICS explanatory notes to clients.|$|E
2500|$|This {{document}} format has been revised in 2010 {{to include an}} easy to assimilate format for the reader. [...] The problem with the earlier format often reported to RICS by clients in receipt of the previous 'Homebuyer's Survey and Valuation' was that the structure did not easily distinguish the faults from the main description. [...] A traffic light system was introduced and surveyors have to rate each element of the inspection according to priority. [...] In this way, serious impediments are identified easily, and less critical defects commented upon to give the reader advice on what will need attention in the near future. [...] It does {{not comment on the}} maintenance requirements for items found to be in satisfactory condition, only confirming that there is no cause for concern at this time. This format is suitable {{for a wide range of}} properties, but is best suited to traditionally built houses that are not subject to very serious distress or previous major alterations or extensions. This report is much longer than the condition report and looks in more detail at the property to report on the visual condition and maintenance needs of nine external elements of construction, nine internal elements of construction, seven services supplied to the building, and three key components of the grounds in which the property is sited.

Neither album nor singles peaked into the top 50. Morris left in 1989 and Darren Garth had replaced Juric on guitar by early 1990; the band undertook a Canadian tour promoting the album. In December 1991 they released the mini-album, Hickory Dickory Dock with its track [...] "Merry Christmas, Carol" [...] and the single, [...] "New World Order". Nervous '90s appeared in June 1992 and contained six studio tracks and three live tracks recorded with the Salvation Army Brass Band. During 1992 they became involved in Performers Releasing Information about Clean Syringes (PRICS), which included running workshops and gigs on safe sex and drug use. In 1993, Garth left and Colin Badger joined on guitar and backing vocals, Painters and Dockers undertook the Australia-wide Return to the Love Planet tour and released a pro gay CD-EP, I Know Better Queens than That in December which comprised four tracks, including an acoustic version of [...] "I Know Better Queens than That" [...] and two tracks taken from the live album Bucket. An EP, Hickory Dickory Dock, and the album The <b>Things</b> <b>that</b> <b>Matter</b> followed in 1994. A mini-album, [...] Advance Australia Where?, {{was released}} in August 1998 with the single [...] "You're Going Home In The Back Of A Divi Van". By that stage, original members, Nelson and O'Connor had left, mainstay Stewart now with Badger and Buckler were joined by Paul Calvert on bass guitar, Sonja Parkinson on trombone and backing vocals, and Jenny Pineapple on saxophone and backing vocals.

60|$|And that is {{all there}} was between us. The events are nothing, the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> {{is the way in}} which this {{experience}} stabbed through the common stuff of life and left it pierced, with a light, with a huge new interest shining through the rent.|$|R
