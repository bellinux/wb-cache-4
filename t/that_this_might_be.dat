5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed two {{lines in the}} crowd a few yards apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, {{but it has been}} shown that they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E

He wished to acknowledge his home district of Tokachi, but the kanji for Tokachi (十勝) literally mean 'ten wins' and it was felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> bad luck, limiting his wins in any tournament to ten. As a compromise, he took the name Hokutoumi (北勝海), taking the kanji 勝 ('win') from the second kanji of Tokachi but pronouncing it as the first kanji.|$|E

25|$|The English name Acoma was {{borrowed}} from Spanish Ácoma (1583) or Acóma (1598). The Spanish name was {{borrowed from}} the Acoma word ʔáák’u̓u̓m̓é meaning 'person from Acoma Pueblo'. ʔáák’u̓u̓m̓é itself is derived from ʔáák’u (singular, plural: ʔaak’u̓u̓m̓e̓e̓ʈʂʰa). The name {{does not have any}} meaning in the modern Acoma language. Some tribal authorities connect it to the similar word háák’u 'preparedness, place of preparedness' and suggest <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the origin of the name. The name does not mean 'sky city'. Other tribal elders assert that it means 'place that always was' while outsiders say it means 'people of the white rock'.|$|E
25|$|Haig then {{returned}} to France (13–15 February) to inspect Fifth Army, which was taking over a section of French line. On the morning of Saturday 16 February {{he met with the}} French Minister of Munitions, and attended a British Army Commanders’ conference at which the apparent imminence of a major German attack in the Third or Fifth Army sectors (but probably not Flanders at this stage, as the ground was still wet there) was discussed. It was still thought <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the prelude to greater German attack in Champagne, a view apparently shared by French intelligence. Later that day he travelled back to England by destroyer and special train.|$|E
25|$|Since Le Sage's {{particles}} must lose speed when {{colliding with}} ordinary matter (in {{order to produce}} a net gravitational force), {{a huge amount of}} energy must be converted to internal energy modes. If those particles have no internal energy modes, the excess energy can only be absorbed by ordinary matter. Addressing this problem, Armand Jean Leray proposed a particle model (perfectly similar to Le Sage's) in which he asserted that the absorbed energy is used by the bodies to produce magnetism and heat. He suggested, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> an answer for the question of where the energy output of the stars comes from.|$|E

25|$|One {{analogy is}} to think of helium-4 as ash, {{and the amount of}} ash that one forms when one {{completely}} burns a piece of wood is insensitive to how one burns it. The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary as there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by stellar nucleosynthesis. In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang theory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%, then this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would particularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than 25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the mid-1990s, observations suggested <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the case, causing astrophysicists to talk about a Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further observations were consistent with the Big Bang theory.|$|E
25|$|The clerk, {{standing}} in {{the centre of the}} portrait and uniting the two-halves, holds the music he is singing from, possibly entitled 'Farewell my Judy'. Jeremy Barlow speculates <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a sentimental love song. The two servants frame the picture, the black servant playing a pipe and tabor. The combination of these musical instruments had a popular accompaniment to dancing for several centuries, but was in decline in England by the eighteenth century. Barlow considers Hogarth's representation of the tabor pipe a poor one, arguing that it is too short and has too many holes to be the usual three-holed tabor pipe, the boy holds it too far up its length and does not cover all the holes. Barlow points out that Hogarth may have intended the instrument to be a flabiol instead. He also notes that the lively music the instruments would have produced would be unlikely to complement a sentimental ballad that the clerk appears to be singing, and instead suggests the painting combines and conflates a number of typical activities in the cabin into one scene.|$|E
25|$|Later, Sae {{leaves for}} New York and meets up with Junichi, and they worked {{together}} in the same company. Junichi proposed to Sae later on. Sae returned to Kushiro to attend her friend Minami's wedding, and she found out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells him <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the last time she visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news- the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on the table when he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was killed in Iraq.|$|E

25|$|The second {{goal was}} to help the {{creation}} of new institutions to conduct the research necessary to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In {{the early years of the}} epidemic there was little money or enthusiasm in the scientific community for such work. The threat of the epidemic was not apparent to most, as for example reflected in the Department of Health and Human Service recommendation to Congress in 1986 that only one million dollars be allocated to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for HIV/AIDS research. In the late summer of 1886 Rock Hudson fell in with AIDS in Paris and was airlifted to Los Angeles. Realizing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a moment to begin to build support for HIV/AIDS research, Haseltine enlisted the help of Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he was working in the newly created American Foundation for AIDS Research (AMFAR), and members of the Lasker Foundation. In a six-week period this small group, with the support of Senators Ted Kennedy and Ted Stevens, were able to convince Congress to add about $320 million as a supplemental appropriation to the budget of NIH specifically for HIV/AIDS research (as recounted in the book Rapture). Haseltine was appointed to the Council of the National Institute of Allergy (NIAID) and Infectious disease to help direct how these funds were to be used. Over the next few years funding of HIV/AIDS research grew to about $2 billion per year. These funds have been instrumental in creating a powerful research institutions to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic, institutions which have trained many thousands of scientists and doctors and which continue to seek better ways to treat, cure and prevent the disease. Haseltine played an important early role in the creation of the International Society or AIDS Research and was the Founding editor of the scientific journal AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses.|$|E
500|$|Austin and the Tejano leaders {{agreed to}} a compromise.

500|$|Reviewers also {{compared}} Firefly to Whedon's other series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

500|$|In his {{commentary}} on the Aeneid, Servius considers this story as a deliberate departure from the [...] "true" [...] story, bowdlerized {{to make it more}} suitable for an epic poem. He interprets it as showing Troilus overpowered in a straight fight. Gantz, however, argues <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a variation of the ambush story. For him, Troilus is unarmed because he went out not expecting combat and the backward pointing spear was what Troilus was using as a goad {{in a manner similar to}} characters elsewhere in the Aeneid. Sommerstein, on the other hand believes that the spear is Achilles' that has struck Troilus in the back. The youth is alive but mortally wounded as he is being dragged towards Troy.|$|E
