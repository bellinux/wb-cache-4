[...] Respondents were asked what level of monthly fee they would be prepared to pay to receive RTÉ if subscription access were hypothetically to replace the licence fee: the annualised mean and median household figures were €180 and €252.60, compared to the then licence fee of €150, with those who frequently watched RTÉ programs most willing to pay.|$|R

The heir obtains ownership, or a lesser real right (such as a usufruct), only on delivery or transfer in pursuance of a testamentary disposition or intestate succession.

The differences (for instance Spelman's {{use of the word}} hidas) indicate that the text he copied was not Recension A, but a different text, written in Latin. According to Peter Featherstone, the highly edited form of the copied text suggests the possibility that Spelman embellished the Latin text himself.|$|R

Discuto o impacto das observações de Wittgenstein sobre o que torna uma maneira de seguir regras correta para a maneira como pensamos em correção, contato com o mundo e verdade. Considero essas observações à luz do modo como Hegel faz uso de algumas idéias de Kant e como este uso ilumina o modo como podemos pensar no contato do nosso pensamento com o mundo. Entram na discussão algumas posições recomendadas contemporaneamente por fi lósofos como McDowell, Hornsby e Brandom.
