5|$|Resident Evil 3 was {{released}} for the Microsoft Windows and Dreamcast platforms in 2000, featuring enhanced 3D character models and higher resolution graphics. The Dreamcast version includes more alternate costumes {{than in the}} PlayStation version. Critical reception for these ports was not as positive. The Microsoft Windows version was criticized for not being optimized for keyboard and mouse and for not letting players save their progress at any time. Critics noted {{that some of the}} pre-rendered backgrounds in the Dreamcast version of the game were not improved, resulting in <b>them</b> <b>looking</b> not as good as the PlayStation version's due to the Dreamcast's higher graphic fidelity. CVC generally praised the Dreamcast version, but admitted that the difference in graphical quality between Resident Evil 3 and Code: Veronica was very large.|$|E
5|$|A white dwarf's stellar and {{planetary}} system is inherited from its progenitor star and may {{interact with the}} white dwarf in various ways. Infrared spectroscopic observations made by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope of the central star of the Helix Nebula suggest {{the presence of a}} dust cloud, which may be caused by cometary collisions. It is possible that infalling material from this may cause X-ray emission from the central star. Similarly, observations made in 2004 indicated the presence of a dust cloud around the young white dwarf G29-38 (estimated to have formed from its AGB progenitor about 500 million years ago), which may have been created by tidal disruption of a comet passing close to the white dwarf. Some estimations based on the metal content of the atmospheres of the white dwarfs consider that at least a 15% of them may be orbited by planets and/or asteroids, or at least their debris. Another suggested idea is that white dwarfs could be orbited by the stripped cores of rocky planets, that would have survived the red giant phase of their star but losing their outer layers and, given those planetary remnants would likely be made of metals, to attempt to detect <b>them</b> <b>looking</b> for the signatures of their interaction with the white dwarf's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes with}} Q and Picard {{together}} on a white background were compared {{to those in the}} Warren Beatty and Buck Henry 1978 film Heaven Can Wait by producer Merri Howard and director of photography Jonathan West. These particular scenes caused some problems as there were concerns by the director of photography that Q's white robes would not show up on camera well against the all-white background. They were worried that he might appear simply as a floating head. With both de Lancie and Stewart anticipating re-shoots for these scenes, they were both unhappy as they shot those appearances. However this was filmed late on the last day; de Lancie said that it resulted in both of <b>them</b> <b>looking</b> quite tired. Some scenes were cut {{in order to reduce the}} episode down to the required length. This included a one-page monologue by Marta which would have taken place on the morning after her liaison with Picard, a scene where Picard was to report to La Forge in engineering, audio mention of Dr. Selar and a mention of Scobee Hall – a reference to Dick Scobee, the commander of the Space Shuttle Challenger at the time of the destruction of the vessel.|$|E

25|$|While {{surgeries}} {{do exist}} to correct for severe cases of floaters, {{there are currently}} no medications (including eye drops) that can correct for this vitreous deterioration. Floaters are often caused by the normal aging process and will usually disappear as the brain learns to ignore <b>them.</b> <b>Looking</b> up/down and left/right will cause the floaters to leave the direct field of vision as the vitreous humour swirls around due to the sudden movement. If floaters significantly increase in numbers and/or severely affect vision, {{then one of the}} below surgeries may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is used in}} modified atmosphere packaging {{systems in}} the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep <b>them</b> <b>looking</b> fresh. The carbon monoxide combines with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment metmyoglobin. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat. Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%.|$|E
25|$|Poodles {{are often}} cited as a hypoallergenic dog breed. Their {{individual}} hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds of dogs; combined with the tightly curled coat, which slows the loss of dander and dead hair by trapping it in the curls, an individual poodle may release less dander and hair into the environment. In addition, most poodles are frequently brushed and bathed to keep <b>them</b> <b>looking</b> their best; this not only removes hair and dander, but also controls the other potent allergen, saliva.|$|E

Busy sheltering the absconding revolutionaries of the Chittagong Armoury Raid, Bhupen was arrested again in 1930, {{for a period of}} eight years. During 1938-41 and 1946-51 he edited the weekly Forward : his editorials were read with interest by patriots of all political trends. In 1946 his collection of essays, Indian Revolution and the Constructive Programme appeared with a foreword by Dr Rajendra Prasad, the first president of future independent India. In the meantime, in 1941, Bhupen was again detained till 1946.|$|E

500|$|While the {{original}} level geometry was kept, the levels received new textures, characters and weapons were recreated, and skyboxes were rebuilt. Lobb explained that [...] "things {{are large and}} blocky because that's what [...] looks like", meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer. He also observed that, as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands, {{he was worried about}} <b>them</b> <b>looking</b> awkward in the low-poly geometry level design. According to him, [...] "it's one of the areas that I give a lot of credit to the developer on. It just looks right.

He {{is influenced by the}} work of American artists he grew up listening to, such as Usher, Michael Jackson, Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Ginuwine, Musiq Soulchild, Justin Timberlake, Eminem, Jay-Z, Nas, Tupac, Dr. Dre, and Canibus. Park credits Usher as his idol and as one of his biggest influences, who he started listening to in the 6th grade. He also cites Michael Jackson as his role model, as [...] "he is the best". He cites both Usher and Michael Jackson as singers and dancers who influence him vocally and in dance, as he attempts to mimic <b>them,</b> <b>looking</b> at their music videos. Park also cites Chris Brown as an inspiration, and wants [...] "to be a singer who can be good at both singing and rapping like [...] ". Park began listening to hip hop music when he was in second grade, after one of his cousins let him listen to Warren G's [...] "Regulate". In general, Park stated he [...] "doesn't really listen to music to get inspiration, I listen to music because I listen to music, but I do get inspired when I listen to music, it definitely helps".|$|E
500|$|Karen Hartley-Thomas was {{the hair}} and make-up {{designer}} for the production. She began prepping {{a couple of months}} before filming began, and she met with the director and producer early on to discuss the whole look of the film. Like the costumers, she read books and went to art galleries during her research. The female characters in Sense and Sensibility wear a [...] "no make-up look" [...] because in the time period in which the film is set, only the lower classes would have worn white and pink make-up. The Dashwood sisters wore no mascara and only a little corrective and blush. Hartley-Thomas also used very little make-up on the men, as she does not like <b>them</b> <b>looking</b> made up. Discussing the hair, Hartley-Thomas said [...] "Elinor's hair is always quite neat and done, where Marianne, being a freer character and more rebellious, she has lots of different looks and lots of wild looks with the hair loose." [...] She also explained that some of the male actors wore wigs because the men in those days would have had a lot more volume to their hair, whereas the modern styles tend to be shorter and clippered. John Dashwood and his son were given red hair, as Hartley-Thomas wanted them to stand out amongst the more natural colours of the other male characters.|$|E

2500|$|At school, Garner had {{developed}} {{a keen interest in}} the work of Aeschylus and Homer, as well as the Ancient Greek language. Thus, he decided to pursue the study of Classics at Magdalen College, Oxford, passing his entrance exams in January 1953; at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic. He was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education, and he noted that this removed him from his [...] "cultural background" [...] and led to something of a schism with other members of his family, who [...] "could not cope with me, and I could not cope with" [...] <b>them.</b> <b>Looking</b> back, he remarked, [...] "I soon learned {{that it was not a}} good idea to come home excited over irregular verbs". In 1955, he joined the university theatrical society, playing the role of Mark Antony in a performance of William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra where he co-starred alongside Dudley Moore and where Kenneth Baker was the stage manager. In August 1956, he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing, and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree; he left Oxford in late 1956. He nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained [...] "a permanent strength through all my life".|$|E
