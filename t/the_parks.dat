5|$|After {{three months}} of closure due to the Pawnee budget crisis and {{government}} shutdown, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly informs her fellow employees that <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> department has been reopened, although on a shoestring budget. State auditors Chris (Rob Lowe) and Ben (Adam Scott) announce they may only conduct existing park maintenance, but Leslie wants to offer better programs and services. Meanwhile, the always-optimistic Chris continues trying to convince Ann (Rashida Jones) {{to go on a}} date with him. Ann finds him too intense, but Leslie convinces her to accept a date and try to persuade Chris to increase <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> budget.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{also won}} {{approval}} of a $10million bond issue to benefit the state parks, which had poor lodging and few amenities. Combs combined the bond issue with $10million in revenue bonds and effected major renovations at all 26 of the state's parks. Though his dreams of seeing privately owned tourist facilities spring up around <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> {{did not come to}} fruition, out-of-state tourism to Kentucky more than doubled during his administration, accounting for about sixty percent of state park visitors and fifty-three percent of the overnight visitations to <b>the</b> <b>parks.</b> Journalist John Ed Pearce recounts that Kentucky natives began to complain that they could not get reservations in <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> during peak seasons and called for limitations on the number of out-of-state visitors or a reservation system that favored Kentuckians, although nothing was done to address these complaints.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Theodore Wirth came to Minneapolis as <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> superintendent. During his tenure, {{the park}} system {{increased}} from 1810 acres (7.3km²) in 57 properties to 5421 acres (21.9km²) in 144 properties. The park system, organized around the Minneapolis chain of lakes (including Cedar Lake, Lake of the Isles, Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, Lake Hiawatha, and Lake Nokomis) became a model for park planners around the world. He also encouraged active recreation in <b>the</b> <b>parks,</b> {{as opposed to just}} setting aside parks for passive admiration.|$|E

5|$|Poaching is {{a serious}} problem in the country, {{particularly}} of elephants for the profitable ivory industry and a threat to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>park's</b> {{popularity}} {{peaked in}} the 1930s and 1940s.

5|$|After {{several years}} of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. The committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended different management of Yellowstone's elk population. In addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing wildlife in <b>the</b> <b>parks,</b> the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire ecology, and other issues, the report suggested that the National Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> using current scientific research.|$|E

5000|$|Swiss {{landscape}} designer John J.

[...] Naturalist Gustave Jermy opened the Museum of Natural History in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> in 1885. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> suffered in 1891 when wells dug into the Edwards Aquifer dwindled <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> water supply. Between 1897 and 1899, <b>the</b> <b>park</b> was renovated {{under the direction of}} Mayor Bryan Callaghan. Beginning just before World War II, the water needs of a burgeoning population once again decreased water levels, drying up the springs for the next 35 years. When excessive rainfalls during the 1990s replenished <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> water supply, <b>the</b> public once again became interested in <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> <b>The</b> <b>park</b> underwent an additional renovation 1998-2000.|$|R
2500|$|Following the 1970 season, Hershey Park began a {{redevelopment}} plan {{which called for}} <b>the</b> <b>park</b> to become a theme park.

The Miniature Railroad, however, continued to operate despite the addition of <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> gate in 1971. The addition of the gate and the location of the ride placed a portion of the track within <b>the</b> <b>park</b> gate, and a portion of the track outside <b>the</b> <b>park</b> gate. <b>The</b> Comet Hollow station was inside <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> Boulevard station was outside the gate.
