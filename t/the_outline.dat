Eight toft compartments are discernible {{to the west of}} Main Street, and <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> of the four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls. The fields were largely arable, providing the village with most of its food requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E

We plan to promptly provide <b>the</b> <b>Outlines</b> of all <b>the</b> newly promulgated Japanese statutes in English, using machine translation. Structured documents in XML format made it possible to achieve various functions concerning machine translation, text search, and display style. We developed the Document Type Denition for <b>the</b> <b>Outlines</b> based on our investigation of their struc-ture. We also developed a rule-based annotator for <b>the</b> <b>Outlines,</b> which adequately marked up 87. 2 % on <b>the</b> <b>Outlines</b> of Japanese acts...|$|R

5|$|As {{with its}} spiritual predecessor, the {{environment}} of the game {{takes the form of a}} series of isometric flip-screen rooms (which trace <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature is the use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Craigmillar Castle is the 14th-century L-plan tower house, built on a rocky outcrop. Wrapped around this is the 15th-century {{courtyard}} wall, with ranges of buildings at the south-east, east, and west. Beyond the wall is a lower outer wall, enclosing a broad outer courtyard. This contained gardens and a chapel. Further gardens lay to the south, where <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> of a fish pond can be seen.|$|E

The civil war divided the nation for decades – Finnish society was reunited through social compromises based on a long-term culture of moderate politics and religion, the outcome of World War I and the postwar economic recovery.|$|E

5|$|Most {{researchers}} have {{disagreed with the}} identification of the structures as collagen or other structural fibres. Notably, the team of scientists that reported the presence of pigmentation cells in the structures argued that their presence proved the structures were feathers, not collagen, because collagen does not contain pigment. Gregory S. Paul reidentified what the collagen hypothesis's proponents consider a body outline outside of the fibres as an artefact of preparation: breakage and brushed-on sealant have been misidentified as <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> of the body.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the conference, Mihailović sent Ostojić to {{establish}} a forward headquarters in Kalinovik in south-eastern Bosnia. Ostojić was to command an operation aimed at encircling and destroying Partisan forces in Bosnia, which was to use Chetnik units serving as Italian auxiliaries in Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as other Chetnik units in the Lika region, northern Bosnia and northern Dalmatia. The plan was predicated on an Allied landing on the Dalmatian coast, which Mihailović believed was imminent. <b>The</b> <b>outline</b> concept was that the Chetniks would set up a corridor through the Italian occupied zone of the NDH as far as the Partisan liberated area in western Bosnia and Lika, neutralising the Italians through a combination of vague promises, encouraging them to surrender, and disarming them if necessary. The plan was finalised by early December 1942 at Mihailović's headquarters in Montenegro, and operations were planned to commence on 5 January 1943. However, the plan assumed that Mihailović's forces were unified, which they were not, and also that his authority extended to many more Chetniks than it did in reality.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
40|$|Modeling dynamic characters, in {{observance}} of calligraphic rules {{can be done}} with the help of parametric curves. The class of Bézier curves is a powerful tool for modeling <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> of <b>the</b> surface razed by a nib's calligrapher. Unfortunately, after capturing <b>the</b> character's hand-drawn <b>outlines,</b> <b>the</b> surface delimited by <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> doesn't correspond to the space to shade when writing the character. Some of the curves pieces of <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> are to be subdivided at some appropriate points. In order to identify these points, decompositions of the Bézier curves involved, with respect to particular directions, are necessary. This paper presents a simple and e ective mathematical method for doing such decompositions. The proposed method helps to determine the points as extrema of certain functions. Then, the method is implemented and used to design some Arabic dynamical characters. This will help in building dynamic fonts respecting calligraphic strong rules...|$|R

5|$|A project {{board was}} {{established}} in January 2009, {{with the objective of}} ensuring the stadium be built by 2012. City councillors approved <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> business case for the stadium in June 2009, meaning officials could start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{architect}} Robert Smirke was appointed in December 1834 {{to design a}} replacement palace, pressure from the former MP Lieutenant Colonel Sir Edward Cust to open the process up to a competition gained popularity {{in the press and}} led to the formation in 1835 of a Royal Commission. This body determined in which style the new construction should be built, and in June they decided that either Elizabethan or gothic styles should be used. The commission also decided that although competitors would not be required to follow <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> of the original palace, the surviving buildings of Westminster Hall, the Undercroft Chapel and the Cloisters of St Stephen's should all be incorporated into the new complex.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of <b>the</b> <b>outline</b> of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E
