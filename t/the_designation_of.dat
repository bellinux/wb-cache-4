5|$|Until the 1970s Crucibulum {{was thought}} to be monotypic, {{containing}} the single species C.laeve (formerly C.vulgaris). This was in part due to the stance that Curtis Gates Lloyd and other mycologists had taken in the early 20th century, believing that <b>the</b> <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> new species was not justifiable due to the existence of intermediate forms in similar habitats and close proximity. In 1970–71, Brodie discovered and reported two variants that differed from C.laeve sufficiently to justify naming them as new species.|$|E
