50|$|The gist of {{the story}} is clearer in the 1673 version, which is longer than the one {{recorded}} in 1812: The three daughters of Pehr Tyrsson (Töre) and his wife Karin are killed by three highwaymen when on their way to church. Three wells spring up where the three maidens are killed. The men later visit the family farm and try to sell the girls' silk shirts. Karin recognises them and realises that the daughters must have been killed by the men, so she tells her husband. He kills two of them, but lets the third live. When he and Karin ask the surviving highwayman who they are and where they come from, he tells them that they were brothers who had been sent away by their parents when very young, to fend for themselves in the world, and that their parents were <b>Töres</b> and Karin in Vänge. Realizing that he has killed his own sons, Töre then vows to build a church to atone for his sins.|$|E

5000|$|Back in Miami, Sean {{wakes up}} in time to punch Emma and calls for Penance, who {{instantly}} frees herself from Emplate's grasp, giving Sean a clear shot with his sonic scream. Though Emma desperately claims she wouldn't have really gone through with the deal, Sean does not believe her, tells her {{to stay away from}} the kids and the school, and leaves with Penance. During the battle against the Prime Sentinels in L.A., <b>Tores</b> briefly displays the mutant ability to harness psychic energy and direct it as a weapon. Generation X launches an ambush, but is quickly overwhelmed. Synch and Monet are wounded, and she urges him to synch with her invulnerability so he can survive the next wave of attacks, which he has never done before. As he does so, Synch glimpses Monet's true nature, calling her [...] "M&M" [...] just before the attack. As planned, Gil then sets off a huge explosion to destroy the hideout and the Sentinels. Synch emerges from the rubble first, using his aura to locate Monet. Instead he finds Nicole and Claudette, each in a coma and separated for the first time since joining the team as Monet. However, the secret of where the real Monet was would remain a mystery to the team.|$|E

50|$|The Catholic parish of Banate {{celebrated its}} 250th {{foundation}} anniversary in 2013 {{which was established}} by the frayles of the Augustinian Order in 1763. The present church was erected {{under the supervision of}} Fray Eustaqio <b>Tores,</b> OSA in 1870 but was left unfinished which is why there is no particular architectural style found in the edifice. Nevertheless, the church of Banate withstood the tests of time, from fires to the bombings of the war. Built {{in the shape of a}} Latin cross, it is one of the old churches in Iloilo, still intact and whole from the narthex to the apse and transepts unlike some churches which were either cut into half or damaged either by nature or war. It is made of corals, limestone and rocks and put together through a mixture of Apog and Eggs. It is also one of the widest, in terms of space, having three spacious naves all in all surpassing even that of Sta. Barbara or Lambunao. The last Augustinian curate of Banate, Fray Bernardo Arquero, OSA, commissioned the three bells donated by Donya Carmen Baban and cast by the renowned bell-caster Hilario Sunico. The campana mayor is one of the largest in the island but it is, unfortunately, broken. It is the last existing old Augustinian-built church in the north. It was built under forced-labor. The parish also boasts of having the complete old baptismal, marriage and death records dating back to the early 1900s which can be found in the parish office. Ironically, the modern church of the Philippine Independent Church stands across it.|$|E
