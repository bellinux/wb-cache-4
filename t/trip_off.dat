5|$|On September 30, 1920, Patton relinquished {{command of}} the 304th Tank Brigade and was reassigned to Fort Myer as {{commander}} of 3rd Squadron, 3rd Cavalry. Loathing duty as a peacetime staff officer, he spent much time writing technical papers and giving speeches on his combat experiences at the General Staff College. In July 1921 Patton {{became a member of}} the American Legion Tank Corps Post No. 19. From 1922 to mid-1923 he attended the Field Officer's Course at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley, then he attended the Command and General Staff College from mid-1923 to mid-1924, graduating 25th out of 248. In August 1923, Patton saved several children from drowning when they fell off a yacht during a boating <b>trip</b> <b>off</b> Salem, Massachusetts. He was awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal for this action. He was temporarily appointed to the General Staff Corps in Boston, Massachusetts, before being reassigned as G-1 and G-2 of the Hawaiian Division at Schofield Barracks in Honolulu in March 1925.|$|E

This was followed by a complete absence from the game in 1890.|$|E
25|$|As of 2006, {{scientists}} had minimal success satellite tagging North Pacific right whales. Observations total probably less than 50 hours {{over the last}} 50 years. What {{little is known about}} North Pacific right whale behavior suggests that it is similar to the behavior of right whales in other oceans, except in its choice of wintering grounds. The individual which was observed during a whale-watching tour off the Kii Peninsula, Japan breached six times in a row in 2006. The same whale watching operator had two different sightings in 2006 and again had a very close encounter with a right whale in 2011. This animal was very curious and active; it swam around the vessel for more than 2 hours, breaching, spyhopping, tail-slapping, and pec-slapping close to the boat. The ship had to cruise away from the whale because it kept following them. Another curious and playful individual was encountered during a whale-watching <b>trip</b> <b>off</b> Bonin Islands in March 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Newton-John met gaffer/cameraman Patrick McDermott a {{year after}} her 1995 divorce from Matt Lattanzi. The couple dated {{on and off for}} nine years. McDermott {{disappeared}} following a 2005 fishing <b>trip</b> <b>off</b> the Californian coast. Various theories abounded regarding his disappearance ranging from his death by accident or foul play to McDermott staging his disappearance to avoid child support payments to his ex-wife, actress Yvette Nipar. Newton-John, who was in Australia at her Gaia Retreat & Spa {{at the time of his}} disappearance, was never a suspect in McDermott's disappearance. A US Coast Guard investigation, based on then-available evidence and released in 2008, [...] "suggest McDermott was lost at sea", although some have claimed contact with McDermott since his disappearance.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 May 1981, USAF EC-135N, (AF Serial Number 61-0328), crashed {{during a}} {{scheduled}} Advanced Range Instrumented Aircraft (ARIA) navigator and Primary Mission Electronic Equipment (PMEE) training mission from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. For an unexplained reason, the aircraft pitch trim {{was moved to}} the full nose-down position, which exceeded the ability of the autopilot to control, and the aircraft pitched over abruptly. [...] The abrupt pitch over caused the generators to <b>trip</b> <b>off</b> line and the loss of AC electrical power prevented the pitch trim from being operated normally. [...] The aircraft became uncontrollable and exploded at about 1,500ft MSL. [...] The crash occurred near Walkersville, MD at 10:50L. [...] All seventeen crew members and four passengers on board the aircraft were killed.|$|E

2500|$|When Tyne Tees {{adopted the}} Channel 3 North East {{branding}} in September 1996, the traditional [...] "TTTV" [...] logo arrangement was dropped {{in favour of}} a large '3', with the region written {{to the left of}} the '3'. The name [...] "Tyne Tees Television" [...] was only seen in small letters at the bottom of the screen, whereas Yorkshire, who also adopted the Channel 3 brand a month later, was allowed to keep its 'chevron' logo alongside the '3'. On-screen announcements said, [...] "This is Tyne Tees Television, broadcasting as Channel 3 in the North-East." [...] The new branding was launched on 2 September 1996, with [...] "Going Home (The Theme of the Local Hero)" [...] by Mark Knopfler regularly accompanying ident sequences. Following Granada's takeover, the Channel 3 branding was scrapped. As Bob Conlon, regional executive with the Independent Television Commission, said: [...] "People never really grasped the name - it didn't exactly <b>trip</b> <b>off</b> the tongue and it was still referred to as Tyne Tees Television, because it has been there for years." [...] All other regions in the network had retained their own identities rather than conforming to the generic 'Channel 3' brand.|$|E
2500|$|Rule {{concluded}} that {{the primary cause of}} the sinking was a failure of the electrical bus that powered the main coolant pumps. According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 9:11 a.m., causing the main coolant pumps to <b>trip</b> <b>off.</b> This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. Thresher could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the high-pressure air pipes, and so it sank. Rule's analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that Thresher was intact until it imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of Skylark did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and Skylark was able to communicate with Thresher, despite the fact that even a small leak at test depth would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of Thresher testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a [...] "minor problem".|$|E
2500|$|Without injured Daniele Galloppa, who {{was ruled}} {{out until the}} new year, Parma opened their season on the last Sunday of August with 20 victory over newly {{promoted}} Brescia. Valeri Bojinov opened the scoring after just ten minutes when, having played a short pass to débutant Sebastian Giovinco {{on the edge of}} the box, was returned the ball after a chipped Giovinco ball over the defence, which beat the offside trap and left the previous season's top scorer Bojinov through on goal. The second goal came on the stroke of half-time through Stefano Morrone, who was left a simple tap-in after a far post header from Alessandro Lucarelli off a lofted free-kick set him up. Parma's second league game of the season involved a <b>trip</b> <b>off</b> the mainland to Catania, where a goal in either half saw off Parma's challenge despite a late goal from Giovinco, but the match ended in regrettable style as Lucarelli was given his marching orders for a second yellow card. Parma then secured consecutive 11 draws, first at home to Genoa and then away to Lecce, in very similar fashion as the opposition took the lead through a first-half penalty before Parma drew level halfway through the second half. Two difficult games – away to Fiorentina and at home to A.C. Milan – ended in defeat as Parma slipped into the relegation zone with two- and one-goal reverses respectively, the latter after a spectacular 30-yard strike from Andrea Pirlo. Remarkably, Parma gave away a penalty for four consecutive matches before the run was ended against Milan. Parma went rock-bottom in Serie A after their seventh league game and a 11 draw against Cesena as Cristian Zaccardo scored his second league goal of the season, despite having the better of the match. Consecutive goalless draws at home to Roma and Chievo lifted the club out of the relegation zone but prompted sporting director Pietro Leonardi to offer public support to head coach Pasquale Marino. Bizarrely, in the lead-up to the Roma match on 24 October, Parma's fans protested against the lunchtime kick-off by the simultaneous consumption of sandwiches.|$|E

I had not waited for this before making some {{reflections}} concerning him, but I now formulated them to myself. He really had none of that reserve I had attributed to him the night before; it was merely caution and this is the case with most country people. They are cautious, but not reserved; if they think they can trust you, they keep back none of their affairs; and this is the American character, for we are nearly all country people. I understood him perfectly when he said, [...] "I ruther break stone than go through what I have been through the last week! You understand how it is. 'Tain't as if she said anything; I wish she would; but you feel all the while that it ain't what she expected it to be, and you feel as if it was you that was to blame for the failure.

I see girls all the way along down gettin' acquainted on the cars and boats--we come east on the Ogdensburg road to Rouse's Point, and then took the boat down Lake Champlain and Lake George--but she always seemed to hold back.
