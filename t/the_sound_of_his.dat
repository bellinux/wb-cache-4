5|$|While riders queue {{they are}} shown three {{briefing}} videos featuring actor Renny Krupinski as a sinister man surrounded in darkness, who explains at length {{the physical and}} psychological effects of riding on Oblivion. Although based on scientific facts, his speeches are deliberately exaggerated with hyperbole and dark humour to give riders a sense of intimidation while preparing for Oblivion. The man remains unnamed throughout the videos, although the character was originally {{referred to as the}} Lord of Darkness during production. The final preshow video features a second character whose image appears inverted and therefore glowing white, who argues with the Lord of Darkness as to whether Oblivion is really safe for riders to experience; to which he is repeatedly ignored. The Lord of Darkness maintains that the ride is safe, before the video ends with <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ominous laughter.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, Hendrix played {{right-handed}} guitars {{that were}} {{turned upside down}} and restrung for left-hand playing. This had an important effect on <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guitar; because of the slant of the bridge pickup, his lowest string had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound, which was {{the opposite of the}} Stratocaster's intended design. In addition to Stratocasters, Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters, Duosonics, two different Gibson Flying Vs, a Gibson Les Paul, three Gibson SGs, a Gretsch Corvette, and a Fender Jaguar. He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on The Dick Cavett Show in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Requiem for a Tower: This melody {{from the}} Two Towers trailer, a {{variation}} on Clint Mansell's Lux Aeterna from the score to Requiem for a Dream, was not written by Shore but rearranged to work well with <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> score. It was reused in TV spots and the Supertrailer.|$|E

50|$|In February 2005, he {{released}} an EP entitled Woman King, which expanded on <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> previous LP {{with the addition}} of electric guitars. Each track features a spiritual female figure, and had subtle Biblical undertones.|$|R
25|$|During the 1980s Oldfield became {{expert in}} the use of digital {{synthesizer}} and sequencers (notably the Fairlight CMI) which began to dominate <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> recordings: from the late 1990s onwards, he became a keen user of software synthesizers. He has, however, regularly returned to projects emphasising detailed, manually played and part-acoustic instrumentation (such as 1990's Amarok, 1996's Voyager and 1999's Guitars).|$|E
25|$|Kozlovsky was {{well-known}} to be a favourite {{singer of}} Joseph Stalin. Stalin used to invite Kozlovsky {{to come over}} whenever he wanted to listen to <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice, even {{in the middle of}} the night. So pleased was Stalin with Kozlovsky's singing, that he once kissed him and then himself sang to the piano accompaniment of Kozlovsky. Kozlovsky gained great renown throughout the Soviet Union, but was never allowed to leave its borders.|$|E
25|$|He {{formed a}} three-man group with his cousins, Robert Diggs and Russell Jones, {{who would later}} be known as RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard. At the time he didn't like <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice. The group, FOI: Force of the Imperial Master, and later All in Together, saw the three rapping and DJing, {{switching}} names and performing local shows; since they lived in different boroughs, GZA and Ol' Dirty would travel from Brooklyn out to Staten Island {{to meet up with}} their cousin RZA, after which the three would travel across New York City and challenge other MCs to battles. He left school in the 10th grade, but nurtured his affection for science as he developed his skills as a lyricist.|$|E

25|$|Bruckner's symphonies are scored for {{a fairly}} {{standard}} orchestra of woodwinds in pairs, four horns, {{two or three}} trumpets, three trombones, tuba (from the second version of the Fourth), timpani and strings. The later symphonies increase this complement, but not by much. Notable {{is the use of}} Wagner tubas in his last three symphonies. Only the Eighth has harp, and percussion besides timpani (though legend has it the Seventh is supposed to have a cymbal crash at the exact moment Wagner died). Bruckner's style of orchestral writing was criticized by his Viennese contemporaries, but {{by the middle of the}} twentieth century, musicologists recognized that his orchestration was modeled after <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> primary instrument, the pipe organ, i.e., alternating between two groups of instruments, as when changing from one manual of the organ to another.|$|E
25|$|Undertaker {{would return}} on the March 6 episode of Raw after Braun Strowman called out Reigns. Strowman left the ring {{following}} a brief staredown with Undertaker, who was then confronted by Reigns. After disrespectful comments were made by Reigns, The Undertaker performed a chokeslam on him. This led to a No Holds Barred match between Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Undertaker lost to Reigns after five spears in his fourth WrestleMania main event. After the match, Undertaker left his gloves, coat and hat {{in the center of}} the ring before slowly making his exit, also walking over to his wife Michelle McCool to kiss her, then walked up the ramp and performed his signature arm-raised pose as smoke surrounded him and he descended down into the ramp to <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> music. After he disappeared, the lights went out and his signature gong sounded off three times to end the show.|$|E
25|$|Nearly {{seven years}} after he first {{requested}} it, Garcia received his second custom guitar (Tiger) from Irwin {{in the summer of}} 1979. The first concert that Garcia played Tiger was August 4, 1979 at the Oakland Auditorium Arena. Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover. The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was cocobolo, with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and flame maple, in that order. The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil DiMarzio SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing his pickups every year or two. The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate {{in the back of the}} guitar. In terms of weight, everything included made Tiger tip the scales at 13Â½ pounds. This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.|$|E

25|$|On {{board the}} Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son {{that he would}} become the person that he was meant to be, only to {{suddenly}} abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan fell in love with <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has {{to make it look like}} he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's never too late to change, to become a better man.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event, the match between The Undertaker and Roman Reigns was {{revealed}} to be a No Holds Barred match. Jim Ross returned as a guest commentator. During the match, Undertaker performed a chokeslam on an announce table on Reigns, who then performed a spear through another announce table. Undertaker performed a Last Ride for a near-fall. Reigns performed two Superman Punches on Undertaker, who performed a chokeslam on Reigns onto a chair for a near-fall. Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Reigns for a near-fall. Reigns executed another spear but Undertaker applied Hell's Gate, with Reigns managing to escape. Reigns attacked Undertaker with a chair, and performed two spears - both scored near-falls. Undertaker attempted his signature sit-up, but suddenly collapsed. After another spear, Reigns pinned Undertaker to win the match and become the second person to defeat Undertaker at WrestleMania, after Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX. After the match, The Undertaker symbolically left his gloves, coat, and hat {{in the center of}} the ring, hinting that this was possibly his last match. In a very rare moment, Undertaker broke character and kissed his wife, Michelle McCool, who was seated in the front row. Undertaker walked to the center of the entrance ramp, looked at the crowd and raised his arm as he was lowered below the stage to <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> music and his signature gong sounded three times as the show ended. In the arena, the main stage lighting (not the crowd's lighting) was left off for the remainder of the evening, and Undertaker's clothes were left in the ring as the production crew cleaned up, only taking his clothing articles when it was time to disassemble the ring.|$|E

500|$|Howard [...] "Sandman" [...] Sims (January 24, 1917 â May 20, 2003) was an African-American tap dancer {{who began}} his career in vaudeville.

500|$|The cover art, {{music and}} lyrics {{of the album}} portray the {{symbolism}} equating earthly love and heaven that would often feature in Morrison's work. When Astral Weeks was released by Warner Bros. Records in November 1968, it did not receive promotion from the label and was not an immediate success with consumers or critics. Blending folk, blues, jazz, and classical music, the album's songs signaled {{a radical departure from}} <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> previous pop hits, such as [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] (1967).|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{worked closely}} with {{individual}} musicians in Springsteen's band to help them achieve the sound they wanted. Keyboard player Danny Federici received attention from John Stilwell and Jackson who collaborated in modifying his cut-down Hammond B-3 organ. Clarence Clemons came to Jackson with his ideas about microphones; subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> saxophones {{was picked up by}} a device invented jointly by Clemons and Jackson.
