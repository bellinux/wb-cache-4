5|$|Fluorocarbon gases are {{generally}} greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 20,000 {{times that of}} carbon dioxide. Organofluorine compounds persist in the environment due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the carbon–fluorine bond. Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals; a few plants synthesize organofluorine poisons that deter herbivores.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 1860, Lincoln {{was elected}} the 16th {{president}} of the United States, beating Douglas, Breckinridge, and Bell. He was the first president from the Republican Party.

5|$|Perry was {{inspired}} to write the episode due to his interest in conspiracy theory literature, which he finds interesting but does not believe in. The Coast to Coast AM radio show featured in the episode also served as an inspiration, and its host Art Bell agreed to appear as himself. Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition {{for the role of}} Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium crew were fans of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> his performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{calutron}} {{is a type}} of sector mass spectrometer, {{an instrument}} in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current. Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the field and the charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever epidemic in the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E

5|$|Following the Polish campaign, Hitler {{approved}} {{the expansion of}} the SS combat troops to three divisions as well as bringing the LSSAH up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> a reinforced motorised regiment. To achieve this goal before the commencement of the planned invasion of France and the Low Countries, Berger needed at least partially-trained personnel. To do this, he circumvented the recruiting primacy of the Wehrmacht by transferring men from forces already under Himmler's control, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV) that ran the concentration camps, and combat-trained police reinforcements of the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police or Orpo). By adding these men to the LSSAH and the existing three regiments of the SS-VT, he expanded the force to the approved ceiling, including 50,000 trained replacements. The three new divisions were: the SS-Verfügungs-Division (later given the name Reich and then Das Reich) commanded by the Inspector of the SS-VT, SS-Gruppenführer Paul Hausser; the SS-Division-Totenkopf commanded by the Inspector of Concentration Camps, SS-Gruppenführer Theodor Eicke; and the Polizei-Division, commanded by SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch. This rapid transformation was theoretical to a significant extent, as Eicke and the SS-TV continued to resist exchanges of personnel with the SS-VT.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Otto von Bismarck—Minister President of Prussia—had {{a master plan}} to expand the North German Confederation of 1866 to include the {{remaining}} independent German states into a single entity or simply to expand {{the power of the}} Kingdom of Prussia. They conclude that factors in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> Bismarck's Realpolitik led a collection of early modern polities to reorganize political, economic, military, and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century. Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity. Military successes—especially those of Prussia—in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813–14. By establishing a Germany without Austria, the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorines exhibit biopersistence due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the carbon–fluorine bond. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), {{which are}} {{sparingly}} water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted persistent organic pollutants; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) {{are most often}} researched. PFAAs {{have been found in}} trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in breast milk and the blood of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA. In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans. High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels.|$|E

5|$|Playford, used to {{cooperating}} with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise and, predicting {{that one day}} Dunstan {{would be at the}} helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E
5|$|Relations were hostile {{with both}} Sweden and Denmark from the start. During his rivalry with Earl Skule, Skule {{attempted}} {{to gain the}} support of Valdemar II of Denmark, but any aid was made impossible after Valdemar's capture {{by one of his}} vassals. Since the Danes wanted overlordship of Norway and supported the Guelphs (those supporting the Pope over the Holy Roman Emperor), Haakon in turn sought closer ties with the Ghibelline Emperor Frederick II, who sent ambassadors to Norway. As Haakon had gained a powerful reputation due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> his fleet, other European rulers wanted to benefit from his friendship. Despite the struggle between the Pope and the Emperor, Haakon was able to maintain friendships with both. According to an English chronicler, the Pope wanted Haakon to become Holy Roman Emperor. It has been suggested that Haakon hesitated to leave Norway due to the Mongol threat.|$|E
5|$|During {{the advance}} on Finschhafen, a company from the 2/17th Battalion, {{which had been}} tasked with {{securing}} the beachhead and the flank, {{had been sent to}} Sattelberg but had been unable to occupy it due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese force already there. As captured orders had revealed Japanese plans to breakthrough to the coast, it was decided to place the company into a blocking position east of Sattelberg along the coast road around Jivevaneng. In this position, from 25 September onwards they were subjected to a number of attacks as they attempted to deflect attacks by the Japanese 3rd Battalion, 80th Infantry Regiment, which were aimed at breaking through to Heldsbach Plantation, directly south of the beachhead at Siki Cove. On 30 September the 2/17th were replaced by a company from the 2/43rd Battalion, and {{over the next couple of}} days, a whole battalion of Japanese surrounded the position and attacked it eight times. Four attempts by the Australians to relieve the company failed, before an attack on Kumawa by the 2/17th Battalion on 5 October cut the Japanese supply lines and provoked a strong counterattack, which subsequently drew pressure off the beleaguered company, and enabled it to be relieved on 7 October. As the threat of Japanese counterattack grew, the 24th Brigade landed at Langemak Bay on 10 October to reinforce the 20th Brigade. The following day, Wootten was able to establish his divisional headquarters at Finschhafen, and preparations began for the Australians to attack the Japanese force around Sattelberg.|$|E

5|$|The valence {{electrons}} of moscovium fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p1/2 (two electrons), and 7p3/2 (one electron). The first {{two of these}} are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs, while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry. (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements nihonium and flerovium.) Thus, the +1 oxidation state should be favored, like Tl+, and consistent with this the first ionization potential of moscovium should be around 5.58eV, continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens. Moscovium and nihonium both have one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state: thus they should have similar melting and boiling points (both melting around 400°C and boiling around 1100°C) due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> their metallic bonds being similar. Additionally, the predicted ionization potential, ionic radius (1.5Å for Mc+; 1.0Å for Mc3+), and polarizability of Mc+ {{are expected to be}} more similar to Tl+ than its true congener Bi3+. Moscovium should be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density around 13.5g/cm3. The electron of the hydrogen-like moscovium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Mc114+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.82 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like bismuth and antimony are expected to be 1.25 and 1.077 respectively.|$|E
