These compensations and charges should modify local access charges in each country. The paper closely examines the most promising methods for computing ITCs presently considered in the Internal Electricity Market (IEM) of the European Union, namely the Average Participations (AP) method and the With and Without Transits (WWT) method. Some attention is also given to a third method that lies somewhere between the two previous ones: the Average Participations applied to Transits (APT) method. The performance of the AP, WWT and APT methods is {{compared with that of}} the <b>temporary</b> <b>method</b> presently <b>applied</b> to compute compensations in the IEM. The three methods are closely examined both from a conceptual point of view and taking into account the numerical results they produce. Based on this analysis, the AP method is proposed as the best option to compute ITCs in the European Union. The paper draws on research projects carried out for the European Commission and the Florence Regulatory Forum. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

30|$|In recent years, {{radiotherapy}} {{has attracted}} attention {{as a treatment}} for oral cancer because it can maintain a better quality of life (QOL) of the patient in comparison with surgery. Among the radiotherapies, brachytherapy has a number of advantages; it can intensively irradiate cancer tissue and reduce radiation exposure to normal tissue around the cancer tissue. With regard to oral cancer, two brachytherapy methods are performed in Japan. One is a <b>temporary</b> <b>method</b> using Ir- 192 or Cs- 137 needles, and the other is a permanent method using Au- 198 grains [1, 2]. The latter requires implanting small radioactive Au grains (2.5 mm in length and 0.8 mm in diameter), and involves no diet-restriction, whereas the former requires a 3 – 5  day diet-restriction period during which needles are inserted intra-orally to the cancerous tissue. Therefore, the permanent <b>method</b> can be <b>applied</b> to aged or handicapped patients for whom the <b>temporary</b> <b>method</b> is not suitable. Moreover, it can be applied to oral cancers other than carcinoma of the tongue, such as carcinomas of the floor of the mouth and the buccal mucosa, and oropharyngeal cancer [3].|$|R

Aims: To study the family planning practices/methods among the married women of reproductive age (15 - 45 yrs). Study Design: Community-based study. Study Subjects: The Women of reproductive age groups (15 - 45 yrs) adopting family planning methods & those residing in urban slums of, Lucknow. Sample size: 540, Study Period : July 2009 to July 2011. Sampling Technique: thirty cluster sampling. Result: The acceptance {{of family planning}} <b>methods</b> both <b>temporary</b> and permanent <b>methods</b> increased with level of literacy of women. About 53. 40 % adopted I. U. C. D, 38. 83 % O. C pills & only 7. 77 % of their partners used condoms. 66. 6 % have undergone laparoscopic & 33. 4 % mini-lap sterilization. Vasectomy was not done for even a single partner. More number of illiterate and primary educated accepted permanent method after 3 or more children than higher educated who accepted it after 1 or 2 children. Among acceptors of permanent methods, total 70. 27 % were experiencing side effects and among <b>temporary</b> <b>method</b> users, it accounted 23. 30 %. Conclusions: Acceptance in family planning is associated with increasing age, nuclear family & level of literacy. IUCD is the most accepted one among all the <b>temporary</b> <b>methods.</b> Vasectomy and newer contraceptives were not at all used...|$|R
