25|$|The {{lighthouse}} operated until 1990, {{when the}} structure {{was replaced by}} a fibreglass hut and the light {{was replaced by a}}n automatic ML-300 beacon. By then it was the last of its kind to remain operative. The tower was donated by the federal Department of Transport to the Townsville Maritime Museum. It was dismantled and shipped to Townsville. In 1996 it was erected {{in the middle of a}} traffic turnabout near the museum, where it stands on display as of 2011. The Fresnel lens from <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> display inside the museum, along with other lenses used in the area. It is now the only survivor of the series of twenty lighthouses.|$|E
2500|$|The second question, [...] "how is operant {{behavior}} controlled?" [...] arises because, {{to begin}} with, the behavior is [...] "emitted" [...] {{without reference to}} any particular stimulus. [...] Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not. [...] For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, will learn to press the lever only when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b> Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This [...] "three-term contingency" [...] (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.|$|E

5000|$|Strayhorn takes Gantman {{to trial}} for fraud and murder. In the courtroom, Gantman {{demonstrates}} the partial {{success of his}} [...] "treatments" [...] by shining a flashlight in Maggie's eyes and asking her if <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> or off; Maggie gets it right every time. Strayhorn, however, notices that the flashlight makes a clicking sound when it's turned on or off, and asks to test Maggie himself. He tricks her into saying <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> when it's actually off and vice versa, and she confesses that she's still completely blind and that Gantman had told her to play along {{if she wanted to}} get better. Gantman is convicted.|$|E
50|$|Photoresistors can {{be placed}} in streetlights to control when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b> Ambient light falling on the {{photoresistor}} causes the streetlight to turn off. Thus energy is saved by ensuring the light is only on during hours of darkness.|$|E

50|$|Woodman Light, a {{lighthouse}} built in 1902, is located {{just beyond the}} eastern boundary of the reserve. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> small hill to the East side of Cockburn Road and nearby are stone cottages used to house the lighthouse keepers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second example}} {{can be read}} [...] "If both switch A and switch B are closed, then <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b> Therefore, it is either true that if switch A is closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on,</b> or that if switch B is closed, the light is on." [...] Here, the most likely natural-language {{interpretation}} of the [...] "if ... then ..." [...] statements would be [...] "whenever switch A is closed, the light is on", and [...] "whenever switch B is closed, the light is on". Again, under this interpretation both clauses of the conclusion may be false (for instance in a series circuit, with a light that only comes on when both switches are closed).|$|E
50|$|Its {{white light}} rotates {{counterclockwise}} {{and makes a}} full rotation in {{about six or seven}} seconds. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> 24 hours per day with a rotation every 6 seconds, unlike many lighthouses that are near it.

50|$|Many {{external}} modems have LED indicators on the front, one {{of which}} is TR ("terminal ready"). This light follows the state of the DTR pin. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> when DTR is high, and off when it is low. Modems will typically keep the TR light illuminated when the AT&D0 command is used to force the modem to ignore the DTR signal, regardless of the pin's actual state.|$|E
50|$|The Halfmoon Reef Light (also Half Moon Reef Light) {{is one of}} {{the many}} screw-pile type lighthouses built on the Texas Gulf Coast, but the only one that still stands. To {{distinguish}} it from the nearby Matagorda Island Light it was given a red glass chimney to be used with the oil lantern to give it its red beam. Though originally constructed on the bay, the current resting place for <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> Port Lavaca, alongside Highway 35.|$|E
50|$|A new <b>light</b> {{close to}} <b>the</b> entry of pit lane is {{introduce}} since round 5, in Taupo when safety car <b>is</b> out.

50|$|The 1857 lighthouse, a brick {{cylinder}} with attached house, {{was damaged}} in the Civil War and during tropical storms in 1888, 1890, 1915, 1926, and 1931. The station was automated in 1941, and the keeper's house was removed in 1952, {{by which time}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> an island instead of a peninsula.|$|R
25|$|To {{help reduce}} water usage when restrooms are closed, some restrooms with timed {{flushing}} use an electric water valve connected to <b>the</b> restroom <b>light</b> switch. When <b>the</b> building is in active {{use during the}} day and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> timed flush operates normally. At night when the building <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> turned off and the flushing action stops.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} film, there's no smothering {{and only one}} death sequence involves her monstrous breasts. In it, she ambushes and ties up a guy's girlfriend in their bathroom. She then rubs poison over her own breasts and climbs into the guy's bed. Even though <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> and disregarding the huge difference in breasts' size, the sleepy guy thinks it's his girlfriend. He starts kissing her large breasts and soon after dies from the poison.|$|E
5000|$|In modern logic theory this {{scenario}} is not a paradox. The law of implication reconciles what Uncle Joe claims are incompatible hypotheticals. This law states that [...] "if X then Y" [...] is logically identical to [...] "X is false or Y is true" [...] (¬X ∨ Y). For example, given the statement [...] "if you press the button then the light comes on", it must be true {{at any given moment}} that either you have not pressed the button, or <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
50|$|The PVT is {{a simple}} task where the subject presses a button {{as soon as the}} light appears. The light will turn on {{randomly}} every few seconds for 5-10 minutes. The main measurement of this task is not to assess the reaction time, but to see how many times the button is not pressed when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b> The purpose of the PVT is to measure sustained attention, and give a numerical measure of sleepiness by counting the number of lapses in attention of the tested subject.|$|E

50|$|When either type {{of system}} is activated, a 15-minute {{countdown}} starts, after which <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> turn off. While <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> <b>on,</b> whenever a <b>lighting</b> command <b>is</b> issued, whether it changes <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> intensity or not, the fifteen-minute countdown is reset. At some airfields, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> may flash once to warn pilots that <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> about to go off, before turning off two minutes later.|$|R

50|$|Hendricks Head Light is a {{lighthouse}} in Southport, Maine marking {{the west side}} of the mouth of the Sheepscot River. The light station was established in 1829, and its present structures date to 1875. It was deactivated in 1933, but relit in 1951. The two-story wood keeper's house is now a private summer residence. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> continuously, showing white to the west and red to the east.

50|$|Henry York {{moves to}} Henry, Kansas {{to live with}} his Uncle Frank, Aunt Dotty, and cousins Penelope, Henrietta, and Anastasia after his parents are {{abducted}} while bike trekking in South America. On his first night there, Henry sneaks out of his attic bedroom to go to the bathroom. Instead, he discovers that the door is closed and <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b> He waits and sees a short man emerge from the bathroom and enter Grandfather's bedroom, a room that has been locked since Grandfather died two years previously.|$|E
50|$|Rocky then retaliates {{with real}} gunfire {{and he and}} Mugsy chase Bugs across town into a factory. Unable {{to see in the}} dark, Rocky orders Mugsy to turn on the light, but once <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on,</b> Rocky see that Bugs has a gun aimed at him. He orders Mugsy to turn off the light, but Bugs blasts him before the lights go out. Rocky then orders Mugsy to switch places so that Mugsy will blast Bugs. After the places are {{switched}} and Rocky turns on the light, Mugsy fires, only to discover Bugs isn't there. By the time they turn around and see where Bugs is, Bugs blasts Rocky again and turns out the light.|$|E
