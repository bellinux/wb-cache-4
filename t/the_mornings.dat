5|$|Berlin's {{civilian}} {{work schedule}} {{had been that}} of a hardworking night owl, generally writing material until two or three in the morning. His efforts to adjust to military life and become a good soldier included springing out of bed obediently each morning, which earned him the resentment of fellow soldiers because he concealed his hatred of reveille too well and appeared eager {{to wake up in}} <b>the</b> <b>mornings.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1918, the Army {{realized}} that there was a shortage of physicians specializing in anesthesia, a low salary specialty required in the military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. The first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under contract was Dr. Dolores Piñero from San Juan. She was assigned to the San Juan base hospital where she worked as an anesthesiologist during <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> and in the laboratory during the afternoons.|$|E

However, the state put its plans on hold shortly thereafter, following several concerns from the public, and from state senator Jim Ellis.|$|E

Often there are days when 10,000 passengers on 120 flights are channelled through the 2,800m2 terminal, counting as one of the highest peak loads worldwide in this category.|$|E
5|$|Because of its ongoing {{structural}} weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed {{replacing the}} Albert Bridge {{with a more}} conventional design. A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in {{the withdrawal of the}} proposal, but serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|In September 1554, Mary stopped menstruating. She gained weight, {{and felt}} nauseated in <b>the</b> <b>mornings.</b> For these reasons, almost the {{entirety}} of her court, including her doctors, believed her to be pregnant. Parliament passed an act making Philip regent {{in the event of}} Mary's death in childbirth. In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth, but {{in a letter to his}} brother-in-law, Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant.|$|E

5|$|The trivia game begins, {{with various}} {{facts about the}} {{characters}} being revealed such as Joey's space-cowboy imaginary friend (Maurice) and Rachel's actual favorite movie (Weekend at Bernie's). A nine-to-nine score leads to a lightning round. Monica raises the stakes: If the women win, Joey and Chandler must give up their birds, as the maturing Chick is crowing in <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> and waking them up. Chandler rebuts by suggesting Rachel and Monica give up their apartment to them, which Monica agrees to without consulting Rachel. The girls lose the lightning round because they cannot identify Chandler's job, and the boys win.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor {{was raised}} in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her {{childhood}} she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed {{a major part of}} her early years—"the happiest part". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, The Wind in the Willows, and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read to her children in <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her early thirties she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. When she wrote and published Shiloh, her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in <b>the</b> <b>mornings,</b> and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in <b>the</b> <b>mornings,</b> the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
