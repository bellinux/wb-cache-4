In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as a}} decisive force in the battle, thus prompting an old Roman saying: 'It comes down to the triarii' (res ad triarios venit), which meant carrying on to the bitter end.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the quality}} of Meessen's photography, Boom and Wachilin write that his Javanese {{pictures}} are among his best, whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality. They note considerable detail in his cityscapes. He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers, including the Governor General's Palace {{and the home of}} Raden Saleh. Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial, leading Boom and Wachlin to suggest that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> fund Meessen's landscape photography. Some of his images, particularly the portraits, were hand-tinted.|$|E

He deduces that Ms. Lewton is next and rushes to her house to ensure her safety. Thinking Alex is up to no good, Ms. Lewton calls the FBI agents, who take him in for questioning. Although Alex is unable to convince the agents of what is happening they decide to let him go. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after she is impaled and killed by a falling kitchen knife.|$|E

5|$|These modernizations {{have been}} criticized by some naval historians, given that not only these ships would {{eventually}} prove to be inferior to the British battleships <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> face (namely the Queen Elizabeth-class), since {{by the time the}} decision to proceed was taken a war between Italy and the United Kingdom seemed more likely, but also because the cost of the reconstruction would be not much less than the cost of building a brand new Littorio-class battleship; moreover, the reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in the providing of steel plates, that caused substantial delays {{in the construction of the}} modern battleships, which otherwise might have been completed at an earlier date.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the length}} of the front created by the German summer offensive, aimed at taking the Caucasus oil fields and the city of Stalingrad, German and other Axis forces were forced to guard sectors beyond the length <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> occupy. The {{situation}} was exacerbated by the German decision to relocate several mechanized divisions from the Soviet Union to Western Europe. Furthermore, units in the area were depleted after months of fighting, especially those which took part in the fighting in Stalingrad. The Germans could only count on the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, which had the strength of a single panzer division, and the 29th Panzergrenadier Division as reserves to bolster their Romanian allies on the German Sixth Army's flanks. In comparison, the Red Army deployed over one million personnel for the purpose of beginning the offensive in and around Stalingrad. Soviet troop movements were not without problems, due to the difficulties of concealing their build-up, and to Soviet units commonly arriving late due to logistical issues. Operation Uranus was first postponed from 8 to 17 November, then to 19 November.|$|E

God sent the Seraph to return the girls to Heaven {{in order to keep}} the Devil from claiming them as his own. Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but the women are confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly lets go of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder they should have been protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes that they are now in a place where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be.|$|E

25|$|Kulap figurines of {{limestone}} or chalk {{were made in}} Melanesia. The small funerary sculptures from New Ireland were associated with death rituals. They are typical in the hilly Punam region of the New Ireland province in Papua New Guinea of the Bismarck Archipelago. They were believed to contain {{the soul of the}} deceased person whom <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> represent, and would be ritually smashed once their usefulness or the period of mourning was over. In more recent years, some have been sold in their intact forms to Westerners, particularly to German administrators.|$|E

A year later, the Robert Morris Apartments, on 37th Avenue between 79th and 80th Streets, were constructed. Named after Robert Morris, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, the apartments have ample green spaces, original high ceilings, and fireplaces, and are relatively expensive.|$|E
25|$|The Gelflings were {{designed}} and sculpted by Wendy Midener. They {{were difficult to}} perform, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be the most human creatures in the film, and thus their movements, particularly their gait, had to be as realistic as possible. During scenes when the Gelflings' legs were off-camera, the performers walked on their knees {{in order to make}} the character's movements more lifelike. According to Odell, the character Jen was Henson's way of projecting himself into the film. Jen was originally meant to be blue, in homage to the Hindu deity Rama, but this idea was scrapped early on.|$|E

25|$|The mizugumo {{was a set}} {{of wooden}} shoes {{supposedly}} allowing the ninja to walk on water. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> work by distributing the wearer's weight over the shoes' wide bottom surface. The word mizugumo {{is derived from the}} native name for the Japanese water spider (Argyroneta aquatica japonica). The mizugumo was featured on the show MythBusters, where it was demonstrated unfit for walking on water. The ukidari, a similar footwear for walking on water, also existed {{in the form of a}} round bucket, but was probably quite unstable. Inflatable skins and breathing tubes allowed the ninja to stay underwater for longer periods of time.|$|E
25|$|In 778, Seguin (or Sihimin) was {{appointed}} count of Bordeaux, probably undermining {{the power of}} the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass that very year. In 814, Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but he was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress or sympathise with a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when the latter appeared c. 844 in the region of Bordeaux. In Autumn 845, count Seguin II marched on the Vikings assaulting Bordeaux and Saintes, but was captured and put to death. No bishops were mentioned during the whole 8th century and part of the 9th in Bordeaux.|$|E

Combine devices called [...] "Vorti-Cells" [...] were to be encountered in Half-Life 2. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> siphon power from captive Vortigaunts in City 17.

He stated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> signify his need for these attributes after his injury prior to Euro 2000, and that they also represented his [...] "rebirth".

In an interview, Kleinman said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "a kind of story telling sequence" [...] showing that [...] "what was happening in Communist countries was Communism was falling down".
