25|$|Evans, Carman, and Thorndike {{published}} a solution with significant differences from Wright's. Their proposal centred {{on what they}} observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to <b>them</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system {{would lead to a}} much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.|$|E
2500|$|During that engagement, nearly 10,000 slaves left area {{plantations}} {{and city}} households to gain freedom by crossing the Rappahannock River to Stafford County {{and join the}} Union lines, part of a movement by slaves throughout the South in wartime. John Washington, a literate slave who shortly crossed to freedom, wrote later about people watching the approach of Union troops {{across the river from}} Fredericksburg: “No one could be seen on the street but the colored people. and every one of <b>them</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be in the best of humors.” ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} to discuss the {{possibility}} of an absolute minimal temperature was Robert Boyle. His 1665 New Experiments and Observations touching Cold, articulated the dispute known as the primum frigidum. The concept was well known among naturalists of the time. Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth (as one of the four classical elements), others within water, others air, and some more recently within nitre. But all of <b>them</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> agree that, [...] "There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2012, Albarn told The Guardian {{that he and}} Hewlett {{had fallen}} out and that future Gorillaz {{projects}} were [...] "unlikely". Tension between the two had been building, partly due to a belief held by Hewlett that his contributions to Gorillaz were being diminished. Speaking to The Guardian in April 2017, Hewlett explained: [...] "Damon had half the Clash on stage, and Bobby Womack and Mos Def and De La Soul, and fucking Hypnotic Brass Ensemble and Bashy and everyone else. It was the greatest band ever. And the screen on stage behind <b>them</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> get smaller every day.

2500|$|According to Katz, the Secretariat of the Vatican {{believed}} that [...] "the attack on Via Rasella had been undertaken to provoke the occupiers into an excessively repressive act {{and increase the}} people's hatred of the Germans.

None of <b>them</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> believe that the Partisans meant to hurt the Germans as never before to extend {{the popularity of the}} Resistance" [...] nor did they view the Via Rasella attack as a legitimate act of war. Instead, they viewed it as a tragic act of terrorism by Communists, as did the Vatican, and as some of its defenders still do.
