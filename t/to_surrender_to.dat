5|$|After {{a period}} of rest, the 20th Armoured Regiment {{returned}} {{to the front lines}} in early April. It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard. On 2 May, the regiment's A Company was the leading element of the 2nd New Zealand Division and entered Trieste. While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. In fact, the partisans were reluctant to allow Germans <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the New Zealanders at all.|$|E

The partisans were reluctant to allow Germans <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the New Zealanders, and {{the regiment}} remained in Trieste for several weeks until the large numbers of Yugoslav partisans withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis {{refused to}} attend the {{surrender}} ceremony, citing illness. Instead, Brigadier General Charles O'Hara led the British army onto the field. O'Hara first attempted <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> Rochambeau, who {{shook his head and}} pointed to Washington. O'Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused and motioned to Benjamin Lincoln. The surrender finally took place when Washington's second-in-command accepted the sword of Cornwallis' deputy.|$|E

5|$|Dressed in {{mourning}} {{for the remainder}} of her life, Queen Mary's first act as regent was to disseminate a manifesto, outlining James Francis Edward's claims. It was largely ignored in England.

5|$|Napoleon {{was being}} {{pressured}} to leave French soil by the interim French government in Paris. If he delayed, he risked becoming {{a prisoner of}} the Bourbons, Prussians or Austrians. The alternative was <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the British and request political asylum. On 10 July Napoleon sent two emissaries, General Anne Jean Marie René Savary and the Comte de Las Cases, out to Bellerophon to meet Maitland and discuss the possibility of allowing Napoleon {{to travel to the}} United States. Maitland was under orders to prevent this, and instead offered to take Napoleon on board his ship and transport him and his retinue to Britain. Further discussions and negotiations took place over the next few days, but with his options running out, Napoleon had decided by 13 July <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the British. On 14 July Maitland was given a letter informing him that Napoleon would come out to Bellerophon the following morning to surrender.|$|E
5|$|After Roger and Alexander's arrests Nigel {{defied the}} king. The bishops' castles refused <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the king, {{therefore}} Stephen threatened to starve Alexander and Roger until they did. Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into {{the custody of}} Robert, the Earl of Leicester. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between the earl and the bishop. Alexander subsequently excommunicated Earl Robert when the earl refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody. Alexander then successfully applied to Pope Innocent II in 1139 for support {{in his efforts to}} recover Newark castle from Earl Robert.|$|E
5|$|At 15:05 another British ship {{appeared}} on the horizon, the sloop , which persuaded Montfort that {{he could no longer}} protect the battered Pomone against superior numbers. Pauline set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or too distant to pursue. Alceste and Active now concentrated their full broadsides on Pomone, which soon lost both masts and was forced <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> prevent total destruction. Pauline escaped, later reaching Ancona safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.|$|E
50|$|The British then {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} to act against an indecisive opponent, and besieged Chanda and the French on the island. Chanda eventually negotiated a <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> Tanjorean forces that had arrived to assist the British, believing this <b>to</b> be preferable <b>to</b> <b>surrendering</b> <b>to</b> the British. The Tanjoreans violated their promises to assist in his escape and beheaded him on 14 June. Law surrendered the French troops on the same day.|$|R

5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the idea of a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E
5|$|During the Greater Wrath in the 18th century, Kajaani Castle {{was forced}} <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> Russian forces. The Russians blew the castle up in March 1716, {{and it has}} been in ruins ever since. On 17 October 1808, General Johan August Sandels won a key victory to the south of Kajaani near Iisalmi during the Battle of Koljonvirta of the Finnish War, when his army of just 1,800 {{defeated}} over 6,000 Russians. There is a monument {{on the east side of}} the river marking where the spot where Lieutenant Jakob Henrik Zidén and Major-General Mikhail Petrovich Dolgorukov fell.|$|E
5|$|Géza's and Solomon's {{relationship}} only {{began to}} worsen {{during the siege}} of the Byzantine fortress of Belgrade in 1071. Its commander preferred <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> Géza instead of the king and the Byzantine envoys who arrived in the Hungarian camp {{after the fall of}} Belgrade only negotiated with Géza. The division of the booty also gave rise to a new conflict between Solomon and Géza. Although Géza accompanied the king on a new campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1072, but his brother, Ladislaus stayed behind with half of the troops of their duchy.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Kanhopatra. According to most {{traditional}} accounts, Kanhopatra was a courtesan and dancing-girl. These accounts typically concentrate on her death when she chose <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the Hindu god Vithoba—the patron god of the Varkaris—rather than becoming a concubine of the Badshah (king) of Bidar. She died in the central shrine of Vithoba in Pandharpur. She {{is the only person}} whose samadhi (mausoleum) is within the precincts of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved {{north of}} Khafji to block Iraqi {{reinforcements}} attempting {{to reach the}} city. This unit was further bolstered by the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of friendly fire forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to pull back the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of Iraqi troops <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> Saudi forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{siege of}} Kijevo was lifted {{days after the}} protest through {{negotiations}} and {{two weeks after the}} JNA blockaded the village. However, the arrangement proved short-lived as JNA units, again led by Mladić, attacked Kijevo and destroyed a substantial part of the village. The attack began when Croatian forces refused <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> Croatian Serb leader Milan Martić. It {{was one of the first}} instances where the JNA openly sided with the insurgent Serbs in the rapidly escalating Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} of Marsyas fell {{back to a}} sacred grove of Zeus at Labraunda and deliberated whether <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the Persians or to flee Asia altogether. However, while deliberating, {{they were joined by}} a Milesian army, and with these reinforcements resolved instead to carry on fighting. The Persians then attacked the army at Labraunda, and inflicted an even heavier defeat, with the Milesians suffering particularly bad casualties.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, {{and their}} {{followers}} traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture. While camping near present-day Tomah, Wisconsin, Black Hawk's party {{was seen by}} a passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him <b>to</b> <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> the Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E
