5|$|He 111 H-3: Similar to H-2, {{but with}} Jumo 211A-3 engines. Like the H-2, five MG 15 machine guns were standard. One A Stand MG FF cannon could be {{installed}} in the nose and an MG 15 could {{be installed in}} the <b>tail</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A318 {{is a small}} commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) {{aircraft}} with a retractable tricycle {{landing gear}} and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318, CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt & Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E

50|$|Kawasaki {{became the}} first {{manufacturer}} to incorporate a tail fairing on a mass production motorcycle when <b>tail</b> <b>units</b> were fitted to the 1972 250cc S1 Mach I, 350cc S2 Mach II, and 750cc H2 Mach IV models.|$|R
5|$|The {{airframe}} of the Hunter {{consists of}} six interchangeable major sections: the forward fuselage (housing {{the cockpit and}} armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> was swept at 45Â°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of air-to-air {{exercises}} and practice the Wing undertook a Circus operation on 3 August 1941. In the evening the Wing crossed out over Manston at 18,000ft and then dropped to 13,000ft over the coast at Gravelines and set course for Saint Omer. Near Ambleteuse five Bf 109Fs were sighted one thousand feet above and in front travelling past the Spitfires. The German fighters shadowed the flight before three detached and dived to attack, curving in from behind. The Spitfires turned into them. Finucane missed with his first burst of fire and chased the leading Bf 109 into cloud while following the Bf 109's condensation trail. Hitting the enemy with another burst from 200 yards the Bf 109 burst into flames. He sighted another formation of 18 Bf 109s above and climbed to attack supported by six Spitfires. Finucane scored hits on the <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> of one which went down vertically and into a cloud layer at 2,000ft at which point contact was lost. Finucane claimed one destroyed and one probably destroyed. The operation elevated his tally to 7. The day was best remembered in Fighter Command {{for the loss of}} Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock who was shot down by ground-fire in the morning patrol.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, J. Chein & Company {{suspended}} toy production, instead producing nosecones and <b>tail</b> <b>units</b> for {{bombs and}} casings for incendiary devices. After the War, Chein returned to toy production with considerable success. However, as the 1940s {{drew to a}} close, they encountered increasing competition from Japanese manufacturers who produced mechanical tin toys for lower prices.|$|R
25|$|The early Rolls-Royce Griffon powered Spitfire {{variants}} were {{adaptations of}} Mk VC (early Mk XII) or Mark VIII (late Mk XII and Mk XIV) airframes. The later Griffon engined Spitfire variants embodied new wings, <b>tail</b> <b>units</b> and undercarriages and {{were very different}} {{from any of the}} earlier Spitfire marks. Because of this the Griffon engined variants are described in a dedicated article.|$|R
5000|$|A strikingly unusual aircraft, the PL-11 Airtruck was {{developed}} from the Kingsford Smith PL.7 {{as a replacement for}} the de Havilland Tiger Moth in the New Zealand aerial topdressing market by Luigi Pellarini for Waitomo Aircraft. The prototype was constructed using bits of war surplus ex-RNZAF North American Harvards. It featured all aluminium structure, a high-wing monoplane with a steel stub wing and V lift struts, steerable tricycle undercarriage, an extremely stubby pod fuselage, the cockpit (made from shortened Harvard glazing) being mounted directly over the radial engine, providing excellent forward view and very high drag, beneath it was room for a superphosphate hopper or up to 5 people in a cabin. The strangeness was completed by twin booms each supporting unconnected <b>tail</b> <b>units,</b> (the idea being a truck could reverse between the <b>tail</b> <b>units</b> to load the hopper). Despite the outlandish appearance the Airtruck was surprisingly successful, if unable to compete with the Fletcher Fu24 in its design market.|$|R
25|$|From the Bf 109 G-5 on an {{enlarged}} wooden <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> (identifiable by a taller vertical stabilizer and rudder with a morticed balance tab, {{rather than the}} angled shape) was often fitted. This <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> was standardised on G-10s and K-4s. Although the enlarged <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> improved handling, especially on the ground, it weighed more than the standard metal <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> and required that a counterweight was fitted in the nose, increasing the variant's overall weight.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> was of {{conventional}} design, comprising a horizontal tailplane and a single, vertical fin with rudder.|$|E

25|$|The Fokker D.XXIII was {{designed}} as a twin-engined single-seat aircraft. To overcome the problems of asymmetric flight it had a tractor engine at the front and a pusher engine at the rear. The D.XXIII was a cantilever monoplane with the twin <b>tail</b> <b>units</b> on booms. The pilot had an enclosed cockpit in between the tractor and pusher engines and it had a retractable tricycle landing gear.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{prototype}} Model 25 flew in 1941 and {{the production}} version entered service as the AT-9 in 1942. Named the [...] "Fledgling" [...] by Curtiss-Wright, it commonly {{became known as the}} [...] "Jeep" [...] in the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The prototype CW-25 had a fabric-covered steel tube fuselage and fabric-covered wings and <b>tail</b> <b>units,</b> but production AT-9s were of stressed metal skin construction.|$|R
50|$|The Kl 35 was {{designed}} in 1934 {{under the auspices}} of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM). Dipl. Ing. Friedrich Fecher had overall responsibility for the construction. The so-called Gemischtbauweise construction was used: steel for fuselage, wood for wings and <b>tail</b> <b>units</b> and only small quantities of light alloy for linings were used. This became a preferred building method with the RLM around this time, because from considerations of strategic material availability.|$|R

50|$|Designed as a twin-engined {{retractable}} {{landing gear}} version of the earlier Miles Messenger the Gemini first flew on 26 October 1945. The Gemini was a four-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane of plastic-bonded plywood construction. It had twin vertical <b>tail</b> <b>units.</b> Originally powered by 90 hp (67,5 kW) Blackburn Cirrus Minor engines, the aircraft was put into large scale production straight away and 130 Geminis were sold in the first year. Later variants were fitted with different engines.|$|R
25|$|The second MÃ¼22, {{given the}} suffix 'b', {{followed}} the design {{principles of the}} original crashed version but introduced an all-flying vee-tail and a smoother fibreglass covered forward fuselage to reduce drag. Construction of the laminar flow wings, using plywood skin over closely spaced ribs, gives an accurate profile which has remained true since manufacture. Flight testing commenced in 1964 but was marred, on 5 June 1964, {{by the failure of}} a bolt attaching a bearing in the <b>tail</b> <b>unit,</b> the tail fluttered dramatically breaking the <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> off the fuselage. The pilot, Dipl.-Ing. Frodo Hadwich, bailed out safely and the glider impacted relatively softly enabling repairs to be carried out.|$|E
25|$|In May 1951, it was {{reported}} that the Meteor 4's <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> lost half its strength when the skin tore. The skin tearing was found to originate at rivet holes, access panels or discontinuous stringers (stress risers) due to metal fatigue.|$|E
25|$|The R.XV {{also carried}} on the five engine layout of the R.XIV but {{introduced}} a large central fin in the <b>tail</b> <b>unit.</b> Three R.XVs were built, serialed R 46/16 to R 48/16, {{but there is no}} evidence that they carried out operational flights.|$|E
50|$|Oleg Antonov had {{designed}} sailplanes {{since the early}} 1930s, most memorably the Red Front 7 which, flown by Olga Klepikova, set a world distance record of 749 km (466 mi) that stood from 1939 to 1951. The A-9 {{is seen as a}} development of that aircraft, though detailed information from this period of Soviet aviation is often limited. The fuselages and <b>tail</b> <b>units</b> of the two aircraft were very similar but the wings were quite different.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{nonionic}} amphiphiles derived from polyglycerol dendrons were studied {{for their ability}} to solubilize and isolate single-walled carbon nanotubes. The amphiphiles possessed differently sized polar head groups, hydrophobic <b>tail</b> <b>units,</b> and various aromatic and non-aromatic groups between the head and tail groups. Absorbance analysis revealed that amphiphiles with anchor groups derived from pyrene were far inferior to those that possessed simple linear aliphatic tail groups. Absorbance and near-infrared fluorescence analyses revealed a weak dependence on the dendron size of the head group, but a strong positive trend in suspended nanotube density and fluorescence intensity for amphiphiles with longer <b>tail</b> <b>units.</b> Variations in the moieties linking the head and tail groups led to a range of effects on the suspensions, with linkers imparting flexibility and a bent shape that gave improved performance overall. This was illustrated most dramatically by a pair of benzamide-containing amphiphiles, the para isomer of which showed evidence in the fluorescence data of increased nanotube aggregate formation when compared with the meta isomer. In addition, statistical AFM was used to illustrate more directly the microscopic differences between amphiphiles that were effective at nanotube bundle disruption and those that were not...|$|R
25|$|The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Short Brothers and Harland Ltd of Belfast on 2 August 1950. The machine was designed to allow three different wing sweep angles (50Â°, 60Â° and 69Â°). The sweep adjustment of the wings was made when the aircraft was on the ground. Two different tail plane positions (a) low on the rear fuselage and (b) {{on top of the}} fin, were also tested. This requirement was met by the construction of two entirely different rear fuselages and <b>tail</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ki-84-II: Sometimes {{known as}} the 'Hayate-Kai', the Ki-84-II had certain {{duralumin}} components replaced with ones made of wood and plywood, mainly concerning the rear fuselage, <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> elements, wing tips, push-pull rods and other, minor components. This model was produced with the designations Ko, Otsu and Hei depending on the armament.|$|E
25|$|Buffeting is a {{high-frequency}} instability, {{caused by}} airflow separation or shock wave oscillations from one object striking another. It {{is caused by}} a sudden impulse of load increasing. It is a random forced vibration. Generally it affects the <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> of the aircraft structure due to air flow downstream of the wing.|$|E
25|$|Construction was {{primarily}} wooden, with plywood-skinned spruce frames. The cantilever oleo-pneumatic fixed main undercarriage legs were faired with spats. The undercarriage, <b>tail</b> <b>unit</b> and outer wing panels were {{adapted from the}} Parnall Heck 2C. The propeller was a de Havilland fixed-pitch type. Student and tutor sat in open, tandem cockpits, but the rear cockpit was later enclosed.|$|E
