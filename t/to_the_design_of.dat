5|$|Similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the {{majority}} of Delian homes, the House of the Lake is an irregular-shaped home (as opposed to a rectangular or square floor plan), located near a sacred lake and inhabited from roughly 300 to 100 BC. The peristyle impluvium is decorated with a geometric-patterned motif around a central rosette, surrounded on all sides by monolithic columns in the Ionic style.|$|E
5|$|The Sooners {{adopted a}} {{different}} jersey design in 2006, {{which included the}} removal of the players' last names {{from the back of the}} jersey due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the uniform's shoulders and back, and a darker crimson color for the jersey and helmet.|$|E
5|$|The third {{stages of}} the {{flanking}} towers were both built in the Perpendicular style of the late 14th century, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> William Wynford; that on the north-west was not begun until about 1425. The design maintains the general proportions, and continues the strong projection of the buttresses.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the heat sinks that collect the moisture in air wells: high mass, radiative and active. Early {{in the twentieth}} century, there was interest in high-mass air wells, but despite much experimentation including the construction of massive structures, this approach {{proved to be a}} failure.|$|E
5|$|Approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries {{can require}} more sophistication than {{the design of}} a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool. The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz. Executives at Virgin Records {{thought that this was}} important to attract the target audience, who they believed no longer spent much time in record shops. They felt that similarities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the first album, including Meat Loaf's name in Gothic typography, would entice consumers of the 1977 album to purchase this.The section from this episode about the marketing of Bat Out of Hell II, and the filming of this music video, has been reshown as part of BBC Learning Zone's media studies strand.|$|E

5|$|Between 1275 and 1310 the undercroft and {{chapter house}} were built by unknown architects, the undercroft in the Early English and the chapter {{house in the}} Geometric style of Decorated Gothic architecture. In about 1310 work {{commenced}} on the Lady Chapel, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Witney, who also built the central tower from 1315 to 1322 in the Decorated Gothic style. The tower was later braced internally with arches by William Joy. Concurrent with this work, in 1329–45 Joy made alterations and extensions to the choir, joining it to the Lady Chapel with the retrochoir, the latter in the Flowing Decorated style.|$|E
5|$|Commemorative coins with €2 {{face value}} {{have been issued}} with changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the {{national}} side of the coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in about 1175, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> an unknown architect. Wells is the first cathedral in England to be, from its foundation, built in the Gothic style. According to art {{historian}} John Harvey, {{it is the first}} truly Gothic cathedral in the world, its architects having entirely dispensed with all the features that bound the contemporary east end of Canterbury Cathedral and the earlier buildings of France, such as the east end of the Abbey of Saint Denis, to the Romanesque. Unlike these churches, Wells has clustered piers rather than columns and has a gallery of identical pointed arches rather than the typically Romanesque form of paired openings. The style, with its simple untraceried lancet arches and convoluted mouldings, is known as Early English Gothic.|$|E

5|$|Cram {{designed}} the chapel {{with the assistance}} of Alexander Hoyle, a member of his firm. Albert M. Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, {{played a central role in}} planning the iconography. It was built by Matthews Construction Company, which worked on several projects on Princeton's campus. Among those who contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> stained glass windows were Charles Connick, Henry Lee Willet (of the studio that would become Willet Hauser), and Philadelphia-based stained glass artist Nicola d'Ascenzo.|$|E
5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, {{more than a hundred}} pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
5|$|Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} about 1990 or 1992 {{as part of}} {{the contemporary}} Indigenous art movement that had begun at Papunya in the 1970s. By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public institutions, such as Charles Sturt University, and in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue; her painting was printed opposite that of Yannima Tommy Watson, who was by this time famous, particularly for his contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> a new building for the Musée du quai Branly. Petrick's paintings have been included at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong, {{as well as at the}} Australian embassy in Washington in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Monotype created Bembo {{during a}} period of renewed {{interest}} in the printing of the Italian Renaissance, under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison. It followed a previous more faithful revival of Manutius's work, Poliphilus, whose reputation it largely eclipsed. Monotype also created a second, much more eccentric italic for it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> calligrapher Alfred Fairbank, which also did not receive the same attention as the normal version of Bembo.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, while US battleships were {{standardized}} {{as much as}} possible, design improvements {{were incorporated}} whenever possible. Most {{of the changes in}} the Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships' main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be worked out in time. The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled with liquid and being left empty would be a very effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, an alteration <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} be applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods {{can be used to}} help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E
