50|$|Especially for {{advanced}} semiconductor technologies, {{it is expected}} some of the chips on each manufactured wafer contain defects that render them non-functional. The primary objective of testing is to find and separate those non-functional chips from the fully functional ones, meaning that one or more responses captured by the tester from a non-functional chip under test differ from the expected response. The percentage of chips that fail test, hence, should be {{closely related to the}} expected functional yield for that chip type. In reality, however, it is not uncommon that all chips of a new chip type arriving at the <b>test</b> <b>floor</b> for the first time fail (so called zero-yield situation). In that case, the chips {{have to go through a}} debug process that tries to identify the reason for the zero-yield situation. In other cases, the test fall-out (percentage of test fails) may be higher than expected/acceptable or fluctuate suddenly. Again, the chips have to be subjected to an analysis process to identify the reason for the excessive test fall-out.|$|E

This <b>floor</b> slip resistance <b>testing</b> method, developed by the McDonald's Restaurant chain and now specified by many other property owners (e.g. Westfield, Aldi, Toyota) assesses the effects of mild abrasion on wet slip resistance.

40|$|Abstract: All most of floors {{can become}} less slip {{resistant}} with wear. The deterioration of slip resistance can often occur rapidly. So relatively new products can become hazardous {{within a short}} period of time. The main objective of this study was the comparison of slip resistance variations caused by traffic wear and accelerative wear. The second objective was to ascertain the effect of wear, and to find out the causes of slip resistance change. Although statistical differences were observed between results of traffic wear and accelerative wear, the trend of the variations of slip resistance caused by traffic wear and accelerative wear was very similar. The measured slip resistance of <b>tested</b> <b>floor</b> changed up to 29 %(and 26. 5 %) after 100, 000 steps(and 750 cycles). As the traffic wear and accelerative wear were progressed, the surface roughness of the <b>tested</b> <b>floor</b> became smoother, and so the floor became more slippery under the wet condition. The abraded(worn out) floor surface tended to become hydrophilic surface, while the new floor surface tended to show hydrophobic nature. This phenomenon woul...|$|R

40|$|The {{serviceability}} {{limit state}} of structures {{is subject to}} increasing attention. Flooring-systems may encounter vertical vibrations that {{may be perceived as}} annoying by stationary persons sitting or standing on the structure. This can happen on office floors, on grand stands etc. where humans in motion (for instance people walking or jumping) can bring the structure into vibration. The paper looks into human perception of decaying oscillations of floors by doing experiments with a <b>test</b> <b>floor</b> with stationary humans atop. An impulsive load is directed to the floor, and after the decay, the persons on the floor are asked to rate the level of discomfort on a scale from 1 to 10, and to assess the size of floor displacement (the initial amplitude of the decay). Tests are carried out with different numbers of people present on the <b>test</b> <b>floor,</b> and with different initial amplitudes of the decay. The paper presents tendencies in results and seeks to explain some of the observed relationships with offset in an analytical model describing the dynamic behaviour of the human-floor system...|$|E
40|$|The {{growing demand}} to {{construct}} long, slender floors with minimum supports for aesthetic and economic reasons especially in modern building developments {{has resulted in}} increased floor slenderness leading to vibration problems. As a result, vibration serviceability has become the governing design criterion {{for many of these}} new civil engineering structures. It is known that long span, slender floors possess lower natural frequencies and reduced damping leading to vibration serviceability problems. As vibration serviceability becomes a major concern in the design of concrete floors, investigations of the beneficial effects of non-structural elements to the vibration serviceability of floors are becoming increasingly important. The vibration serviceability of long span, slender concrete floors may be improved through the installation of non-structural elements such as partition walls and raised access floors. Little research exists into the quantification of the effects of various types of partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors that support them. There are no guidelines available to designers which take into account the effects of partitions in the design of concrete floors for vibration serviceability besides the different damping ratios that are recommended in different codes for bare floors as well as floors with half- or full-height partitions. Therefore a research project was initiated with the objectives of investigating the effects of non-structural partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors as well as proposing guidelines on how to account for partitions in the design of concrete floors for vibration serviceability. The research project consisted of modal testing on a prestressed pre-tensioned concrete floor slab. The excitation of the floor was generated by an electrodynamic shaker and instrumented impulse hammer. The electrodynamic shaker excitation was used mainly to extract the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the <b>test</b> <b>floor.</b> The instrumented impulse hammer excitation was used mainly for damping studies. Force-balanced QA 700 accelerometers with a sensitivity of 8 V/g mounted to base plates were used to measure the responses of the <b>test</b> <b>floor.</b> The Data Physics Signal Calc Mobilyser was used to acquire the data from the accelerometers. A personal computer was used to store, analyse and present the data. The curve fitting method in Vibrant Technologies ME'Scope was used to estimate the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the <b>test</b> <b>floor.</b> Modal 1. 20 by Brownjohn (2009) was used to estimate the damping ratios of the <b>test</b> <b>floor.</b> Modal 1. 20 uses the logarithmic decrement method to estimate damping.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, scan test has {{turn out to be}} too {{expensive}} to implement for industry standard designs due to increasing test data volume and test time. The test cost of a chip is mainly governed by the resource utilization of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE). Also, it directly depends upon test time that includes time required to load test program, to apply test vectors and to analyze generated test response of the chip. An issue of test time and data volume is increasingly appealing designers to use on-chip test data compactors, either on input side or output side or both. Such techniques significantly address the former issues but have little hold over increasing number of input-outputs under test mode. Further, test pins on DUT are increasing over the generations. Thus, scan channels on <b>test</b> <b>floor</b> are falling short in number for placement of such ICs. To address issues discussed above, we introduce an on-chip self-testing signature register. It comprises a response compactor and a comparator. The compactor compacts large chunk of response data to a small test signature whereas the comparator compares this test signature with desired one. The overall test result for the design is generated on single output pin. Being no storage of test response is demanded, the considerable reduction in ATE memory can be observed. Also, with only single pin to be monitored for test result, the number of tester channels and compare edges on ATE side significantly reduce {{at the end of the}} test. This cuts down maintenance and usage cost of <b>test</b> <b>floor</b> and increases its life time. Furthermore reduction in test pins gives scope for DFT engineers to increase number of scan chains so as to further reduce test time...|$|E
40|$|One usual {{complaint}} about building quality is flatness of a floor. If deviations from planar could be discovered before construction is completed, savings counted in time, money or reputation, can be noticeable. However, finding the possible deviations exceeding the tolerances {{may be time}} consuming using the traditional methods. We have tested three accurate 3 D measurement methods; photogrammetry, laser scanning and tacheometer, for evaluating as-built floor flatness. An experimental work was done and measuring accuracy, time and expenses were compared in order to illustrate, how realistic these methods are for construction companies. All the methods proved to be suitable for the purpose and gave rather similar results for flatness of the <b>test</b> <b>floor.</b> Laser scanner gave the most detailed information of floor flatness.

The tests were carried out on specially prepared model specimens of concrete floor. In order to vary pull-off adhesion in the specimens the surface of the base layer was prepared in four versions. The aim of the investigations was the neural prediction of the pull-off adhesion of the concrete layers in floors on the basis of nondestructive tests.

At the PSL, engineers receive test requirements from customers {{and put together}} the necessary instrumentation, data systems, power requirements, electrical control valves, and engine controls. The engineers are also responsible for facility maintenance, repairs and upgrades. There are four major sections at the PSL; the <b>Test</b> <b>floor,</b> the Data room, the Control room and, the WDPF room. On the <b>test</b> <b>floor</b> are two test cells, cell # 3 and cell # 4. It is within these cells that the actual engine resides for ground testing. The cells, once sealed and taken up to altitude, are capable of reaching engine inlet temperatures of 1000 F to - 90 F, and various atmospheric pressures. The engine, when operational, takes in air and gives out exhaust of up to 2000 F. The exhaust is led to another section of the cell where it is cooled to 150 F before finally redirected to the appropriate disposer. Temperature and pressure transducers detect the conditions within the cell and transmit them to the data room where the results are captured, processed, analyzed, and translated to a more comprehensive language. This is made possible {{with the aid of}} several programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and instrumentation and control systems. The translated data is then sent, via the LAN, to the control room where the results can be viewed on monitors by the engineers and customers. From the control room, the test cell conditions can be changed whenever desired. During tests, a lot takes place in the facility. The WDPF control system monitors and controls all facility parameters.

40|$|It {{is known}} that humans and {{structures}} interact. Humans can cause structures to vibrate, and excessive vibrations may occur if the motion frequency of humans coincides with a resonant frequency of the structural system. It is also known that stationary humans (such as humans sitting or standing on the structure) influence the dynamic behaviour and modal characteristics of the structure carrying them, whether being a grandstand, an office floor or similar. However, {{the interaction between the}} stationary humans and the structure is generally not well understood, and the paper addresses this interaction. Focus is on how modal characteristics of the structure, i. e. its frequency and damping, are influenced by the presence of stationary humans. Vertical vibrations are considered, and particular focus is given the influence of human posture on modal characteristics of the supporting structure. Insight into this area is obtained by carrying out experiments with a <b>test</b> <b>floor</b> carrying humans.

40|$|On {{structures}} carrying humans (e. g. floors, grandstands in stadia etc.) {{there may}} be {{two different types of}} crowds present: Active and passive crowds of people. The active crowd, comprising people in motion, may generate dynamic loads causing the structure to vibrate.

40|$|LecturePg. 117 - 128 Turbomachinery is {{designed}} for optimum aerodynamic and mechanical performance at given user conditions. Before shipment, this performance is usually verified on the OEM's <b>test</b> <b>floor,</b> based on specified design conditions. However, in operation, the gas composition can vary and include unanticipated solid and liquid ingestion into the turbomachinery, causing a buildup of foreign materials. The resulting fouling has an adverse effect on aerodynamic and mechanical performance of the unit. Fouling comes from external dust, dirt or dissolved matter, process materials, condensation and/or chemical reactions. Depending on the rate and composition of the deposits, the effect could range from a fast buildup, causing immediate shutdown of the unit due to high vibration and possible parts damage, to a slow buildup causing increased vibration and/or reduction in performance. An overview is presented of the cause, effect, and prevention of fouling on turbomachinery, with its main purpose to present tested and proven methods of cleaning turbomachinery. Presented are methods of online and offline (without disassembly) cleaning of multistage centrifugal compressors, axial compressors, and steam turbines.

Cold-formed steel channel sections along with fire-resistive plasterboards are used to construct light-gauge steel frame (LSF) floor systems to provide adequate fire resistance ratings (FRR).

This research focuses on adopting improved joist sections such as hollow flange channel (HFC) sections to improve the structural performance and FRR of cold-formed LSF floor systems under standard fire conditions. The structural and thermal performances of LSF floor systems made of a welded HFC, LiteSteel Beams (LSB), with different plasterboard and insulation configurations, were investigated using four full-scale fire tests under standard fires.
