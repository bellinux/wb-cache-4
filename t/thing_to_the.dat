5|$|The Junta was {{rejected}} in Montevideo, {{as was the}} exile of Cisneros and the former Audiencia. Moreno reacted immediately, replying to the Montevidean concerns. He supported {{the legitimacy of the}} Primera Junta by criticizing the Regency Council and stating that the overseas Spanish territories were equally capable of creating Juntas, as it was debated during the open cabildo. He also called for unity and support of the metropolis, and that both cities recognize Ferdinand VII as their legitimate monarch. He argued that the Junta treated the exiles initially with moderation, but their obstinacy, particularly on the part of Cisneros, generated popular discontent. Matías Irigoyen told the same <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British Lord Strangford in Río de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|Yardley and Dollery {{took the}} score to 133 before Toshack bowled the former for 11. He trapped {{the new man}} Coxon two balls later in the same over for a duck, leaving England at 133/6. Coxon shuffled across his stumps and missed his first delivery, which hit {{him in front of}} the stumps and {{prompted}} a loud lbw appeal, and did the same <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next ball. During this spell, Toshack conceded only seven runs from eight overs, but was taken off as Bradman wanted to take the new ball and utilise Lindwall and Johnston. In the meantime, Dollery had continued to bat effectively, watching the ball closely onto his bat, and scoring three leg side boundaries from Johnston's bowling. Eight runs after Coxon's dismissal, Dollery shaped to duck a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Lindwall bowled Laker without scoring later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. Evans continued to resist stubbornly, remaining 24 not out as England were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409-run victory. Johnston had Bedser caught by Hassett for nine before Wright hit Toshack to Lindwall for four.|$|E

The {{evidence}} collected by the prosecution did not allow to establish a direct or indirect role of the accused in the crime. The Court concluded, however, that De Mauro most likely had been killed because he knew the secrets of Enrico Mattei's death, rather than the Borghese coup attempt. De Mauro’s disappearance and likely death {{remains one of the}} unsolved mysteries in Italian history.

500|$|Although the {{majority}} of the tribe decided to follow Keokuk's lead, about 800 Sauks—roughly one-sixth of the tribe—chose instead to resist American expansion. Black Hawk, a war captain who had fought against the United States in the War of 1812 and was now in his 60s, emerged as the leader of this faction in 1829. Like Keokuk, Black Hawk was not a civil chief, but he became Keokuk's primary rival for influence within the tribe. Black Hawk had actually signed a treaty in May 1816 that affirmed the disputed 1804 land cession, but he insisted that what had been written down was different from what had been spoken at the treaty conference.

500|$|Laucke {{studied with}} several {{classical}} guitar masters: FrancoSpaniard Rolando Valdès-Blain from 1963 to 1977, Julian Bream in 1969 as {{winner of the}} Julian Bream Master classes, Alirio Díaz from 1977 to 1979 and Andrés Segovia from 1982 to 1986. Laucke was introduced to complex and advanced flamenco techniques by Spanish guitarist Paco de Lucía when the two shared a loft in New York City in the early 1970s. During this period, de Lucía and Laucke gave a concert in the Spanish Embassy, where Tiffany's jewelry designer Countess Elsa Peretti first heard the two guitarists. She immediately invited them {{to one of her}} parties at her New York penthouse. The two guitarists performed at the party in private for the New York City jet set, including: fashion designer Calvin Klein, Andy Warhol, Halston, and Giorgio di Sant'Angelo.

Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E

Toshack ended with 5/40 from 20.1 overs with Miller unable to bowl due to injury. During the second innings performance, Toshack employed two short legs and a silly mid-off.

500|$|Yes {{had already}} {{recorded}} two albums for Atlantic Records by mid-1970, but neither had been commercially successful and the label was considering dropping them. They had replaced founding member Banks with Howe, who enjoyed playing {{a wider variety}} of styles, including folk and country music, and played a mix of electric and acoustic guitars. Singer Jon Anderson later said that Howe could [...] "jump from one <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, very fast, very talented." [...] After some warm-up gigs with Howe, the band moved to Devon to write and rehearse new material. They arrived at a cottage in Churchill, north of Barnstaple, but the group felt restricted there and were not to allowed to make any noise after dark. They advertised in the local paper for a new location, and moved to Langley Farm in Romansleigh, near South Molton, some 20 miles away. Howe in particular enjoyed working on the farm, and eventually bought it. Following rehearsals, the band booked Advision Studios in London with producer Eddie Offord and spent the autumn recording. The band enjoyed the sessions, and soon had enough material ready for an album.|$|E

It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with temp music." [...] The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios. During a recording session, Paul McCartney heard one of Giacchino's cues being recorded and likened it to The Beatles song [...] "I Am the Walrus". Derrickson, a Bob Dylan fan, looked for {{a place in the}} film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the song [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] by Pink Floyd. Derrickson had hoped to use either [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] or The Jimi Hendrix Experience's [...] "Are You Experienced?" [...] for the film's credits, but the royalties to use either in the credits were too expensive, resulting in Giacchino creating the track [...] "The Master Of The Mystic End Credits".

[...] Wallace, however, claimed that segregation was but one issue symbolic of a larger struggle for states' rights; in that view, which some historians dispute, his replacement of segregation with states' rights would be more of a clarification than a euphemism.|$|E

[...] Line 13 is the poet begging the young man to forgive him and to embrace him. The phrase in line 13 [...] "next my heaven the best" [...] is the poet confessing to the young man that his love is like his heaven. He is the closest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> divine. Radley and Redding state that the poet is saying, [...] "your love is next of the divine (ideal), grant me a welcome sanctuary in your person." [...] The couplet is the most powerful part of the sonnet because now he is saying that the love the young man provides is great next to this divine being.|$|E
