6000|$|Briefly, it was 9 A.M. {{before we}} doubled Point Nyonye, which had now {{been so long}} in sight. With wind, tide, and current dead against us, we hugged the shore where the water is deep. The surf was {{breaking}} in heavy sheets upon a reef or shoal outside, and giving ample occupation to a hovering flock of fish-eating birds. Whilst returning over water smooth as glass I observed the curious effect of the current. Suddenly a huge billow would rear like a horse, assume {{the shape of a}} giant cobra's head, fall forward in a mass of foam, and subside gently rippling into the calm surface beyond; the shadowy hollow of the breakers made them appear <b>to</b> <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> a black rock, but when they disappeared the sea was placid and unbroken as before. This is, in fact, the typical [...] "roller" [...] of the Gaboon coast--a happy hunting ground for slavers and a dangerous place for cruizers to attempt.

To compact grain she added small specific gravity, and, though stout and thick, she advanced at a speed of which I could hardly believe her capable.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wallace, in fact, {{appears to}} me to have mixed up two very {{distinct}} propositions: the one, the indisputable truth that consciousness is correlated with molecular changes in the organ of consciousness; the other, {{that the nature of}} that correlation is known, or can be conceived, which is quite another matter. Mr. Wallace, presumably, believes in that correlation of phenomena which we call cause and effect as firmly as I do. But if he has ever been able to form the faintest notion how a cause gives rise to its effect, all I can say is that I envy him. Take the simplest case imaginable--suppose a ball in motion <b>to</b> <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> another ball at rest. I know very well, as a matter of fact, that the ball in motion will communicate some of its motion to the ball at rest, and that the motion of the two balls after collision is precisely correlated with the masses of both balls and the amount of motion of the first. But how does this come about? In what manner can we conceive that the vis viva of the first ball passes into the second? I confess I can no more form any conception of what happens in this case, than I can of what takes place when the motion of particles of my nervous matter, caused by the impact of a similar ball, gives rise to the state of consciousness I call pain. In ultimate analysis everything is incomprehensible, and the whole object of science is simply to reduce the fundamental incomprehensibilities to the smallest possible number.|$|E

40|$|International audience: A population׳s {{survival}} {{depends on}} its ability to adapt <b>to</b> constraints <b>impinging</b> <b>upon</b> it. As such, adaptation {{is at the heart of}} an increasing number of theoretical models. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up evolutionary model to explore the relationship between individual evolutionary dynamics and population-level survival. To do so, we extend a well-established model of gene network evolution by introducing a cost for reproduction. As a result population sizes fluctuate and populations can even go extinct. We find that if a population survives a small and critical number of generations, it will reach a quasi-stationary state which ensures long-term survival. In a constant environment, individual adaptation occurs in response to changes in a populations genetic composition. We show that genetic compatibility increases over generations as a by-product of selection for robustness, thus preventing extinction. We also demonstrate that the number of reproductive opportunities per individual, initial population size, and mutation rates all influence population survival. Finally, mixing different populations reveals that individual properties of gene networks co-evolve with the genetic composition of the population in order to maximize an individuals reproductive success...|$|R
60|$|Let me shew {{you another}} {{experiment}} {{with a piece}} of iron. It will serve two purposes--shewing you what the blowpipe does as a source of heat, and what it does by sending that heat where it is wanted. I have taken iron in contrast with silver or other metals, that you may see the difference of action, and so be more interested in the experiment. Here is our fuel, the coal-gas; and here our oxygen. Having thus my power of heat, I apply it to the iron, which, as you see, soon gets red-hot. It is now flowing about like a globule of melted mercury. But observe, I cannot raise any vapour: it is now covered with a coat of melted oxide, and unless I have a great power in my blowpipe, it is hardly possible to break through it. Now, then, you see these beautiful sparks: you have not only a beautiful kind of combustion, but you see the iron is being driven off, not producing smoke, but burning in a fixed condition. How different this is from the action of some other metals--that piece of antimony, for instance, which we saw just now throwing off abundance of fumes. We can, of course, burn away this iron by giving plenty of air to it; but with the bodies which Deville wants to expose to this intense heat he has not that means: the gas itself must have power enough to drive off the slag which forms {{on the surface of the}} metal, and power <b>to</b> <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> the platinum so as to get the full contact that he wants for the fusion to take place.

40|$|Abstract: A novel {{framework}} for collaborative estimation of multiple underwater acoustic (UWA) communication channels, considering the high correlation of received signals in a linear hydrophone array, is developed and evaluated. Throughout this work, the channel {{is assumed to}} be a time-variant linear system and is represented by its 3 D delay-Doppler-depth function (DDDF), an extension of the 1 D impulse response of LTI systems. To jointly estimate the DDDF coefficients for all hydrophones in a linear receiver array, sparse estimation techniques such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Basis Pursuit (BP) are used. A new structured dictionary matrix is introduced to encompass the linear structure of energetic parts of the DDDF corresponding <b>to</b> wavefronts <b>impinging</b> <b>upon</b> the array. The over-complete structured dictionary is built by concatenating small blocks, each defining a candidate wavefront in the 3 D DDDF image. Blocks are swept according to a grid of slopes, delay and Doppler shifts. To reduce the problem size and increase the performance, lines are replaced by Gaussian tubes in the structured dictionary. These can accommodate wavefronts that deviate slightly from the linear assumption. For near-field scenarios where wavefronts are more markedly nonlinear, a...|$|R
40|$|The mucosal {{immune system}} {{consists}} of molecules, cells, and organized lymphoid structures {{intended to provide}} immunity <b>to</b> pathogens that <b>impinge</b> <b>upon</b> mucosal surfaces.

New-generation live, attenuated viral vaccines, such as the cold-adapted, recombinant nasal influenza and oral rotavirus vaccines, optimize this form of mucosal immune protection.

Also, the standards for excellence are not as clear cut as in sport, which adds to the ambiguity and tends to increase the stress for performers. Further, musical performers may, in some instances, be required to provide one-on-one auditions with record company executives in order to win recording contracts; a situation that is notoriously anxiety-inducing. Sport psychology strategies have been documented to apply across a range of musical genres, from opera to alternative rock, and for a variety of purposes related to performance, including performance anxiety and other blocks to creative expression, group dynamics and communication issues, and to promote flow, for example, during improvisation sessions among jazz musicians.
