5000|$|Born in Fort William, Ontario in 1930, he had {{his first}} job {{out of high school}} as a {{reporter}} for the Port Arthur News-Chronicle; his father, Alexander Phillips, was at the time the editor of the competing Fort William Times-Journal. He later worked for the Portage la Prairie Press, the Calgary Herald, Canadian Press and Southam News. He won the Bowater Award for Business Journalism in 1960, and a National Newspaper Award in 1961.

50|$|Albert Camus, a French-Algerian (or pied noir), is {{undoubtedly}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known <b>writer</b> <b>ever</b> {{to come from}} Algeria. A philosopher, novelist and playwright, Camus won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. While most of his stories are set in Algeria and he supported civil rights for the indigenous Algerians, he opposed Algerian independence, which has hurt his reputation in his homeland.|$|R
50|$|Raymond Chandler, often {{considered}} Hammett's successor, summarized his accomplishments in The Simple Art of Murder:Hammett was the ace performer... He {{is said to}} have lacked heart; yet the story he himself thought the most of, The Glass Key, is the record of a man's devotion to a friend. He was spare, frugal, hard-boiled, but he did over and over again what only <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>writers</b> can <b>ever</b> do at all. He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before.|$|R
50|$|Charles Rosen was a {{comprehensive}} musician, an outstanding pianist {{and one of}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>writers</b> on music <b>ever.</b> <b>The</b> scope of his knowledge was immense, and its depth showed on every page of his many and various books and articles, from The Classical Style to The Romantic Generation to Sonata Forms, and even to books on Schoenberg and Elliott Carter. Today's students and knowledgeable music lovers return to Rosen's writings again and again, not only to read about the great composers and their works, but to comprehend them historically and as components of the literary and dramatic traditions, which Rosen knew thoroughly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the series is told by editor Mark Chiarello in his {{introduction}} to the first collection, in which he writes about a dinner table-discussion with [...] "a few famous comic-book artists," [...] at which they pondered the [...] "desert island" [...] question in terms of a single complete run of comics one would be happy to be stranded with. Ultimately, with [...] "half a minute"'s thought, they [...] "amazingly... all agreed, pound for pound, page for page" [...] that the unequivocal choice was Warren Publishing's Creepy, a high point unmatched since [...] "there has never been such a collection of stellar artists assembled under one banner publication" [...] as in Creepy, whose pages were host to (among others) [...] "Toth, Frazetta, Williamson, Torres, Colan, Ditko, Wrightson, Corbenetc.."Chiarello notes that [...] "most of those stories" [...] were written by one man: Archie Goodwin [...] "probably <b>the</b> very <b>best</b> editor ever to work in comics, probably <b>the</b> very <b>best</b> <b>writer</b> <b>ever</b> to work in comics," [...] (and early mentor to Chiarello when the two worked at Marvel) whose Warren work was itself an [...] "homage to the favorite comics of his youth, the E.C. line." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the New Statesman, Jason Cowley wrote, [...] "In journalistic mode, Amis {{is without}} peer: {{when he writes}} about writers — indeed, when he writes about anyone, such as Hugh Hefner — the long profile becomes, in his hands, a capacious, {{infinitely}} flexible form in which to combine reportage, criticism, humour, exalted phrase-making, and a clear-eyed, penetrating sense of purpose...Not a month passes, but I encounter someone who has read, and been influenced by, The Moronic Inferno and Other Visits to America, a collection of journalism first published in 1986, but one that continues to enjoy a radiant afterlife. The Moronic Inferno includes some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> profiles of <b>writers</b> <b>ever</b> written. They are as memorable as any postwar literary essay I have read."

5000|$|The {{great ones}} don't {{just give us}} stories and {{characters}} and plots and locales. The great ones give us worlds, fully imagined, fully detailed. Nero Wolfe's brownstone. Agatha Christie's English village. Raymond Chandler's Southern California. And now, Tony Hillerman's world of Navajo culture[...] [...] [...] Hillerman has a poet's way with the land. He rightly understands that his entire drama is being played out against a ragged and rugged land that {{is as much a}} participant in the drama as Chee and Leaphorn themselves. Without getting corny or patronizing, he's able to convey the Navajo reverence for the land and to differentiate how the white man and the Native American view the planet. He is also wise enough not to depict all white people as know-nothing boobs. Boobism is, alas, something shared by all cultures. There's plenty to go around. Hillerman stage-manages all the various plot points — the brain-dead cop, the missing woman, the possible plague, the violent eagle — skillfully and subtly. None of the seams show. And he does it all with a lively, easygoing style that never calls attention to itself, never jars the reader out of the world he's creating before our eyes. There's a simple reason for Tony Hillerman's popularity. He's one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> mystery <b>writers</b> who <b>ever</b> lived.|$|R
