5|$|As Brundage {{approached}} {{the end of}} his track career, he began to involve himself in sports administration, at first through <b>the</b> <b>CAA,</b> then through the Central Association of the Amateur Athletic Union (of which <b>the</b> <b>CAA</b> was a member) and then, beginning in 1919, in the AAU. That group was involved in an ongoing battle for dominance over US amateur sports with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Athletes were often used as pawns in the battle, with one organization threatening to suspend those who participated in events sponsored by the other. Another venue for conflict was in the United States' National Olympic Committee (NOC), which was then called the American Olympic Committee (AOC), and which was AAU-dominated. In 1920, there was public outcry when the AOC chartered a disused troopship to carry home America's representatives in the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp; much of the team instead booked passage by ocean liner. In response, the AAU founded an American Olympic Association as a separate group, although it was still initially dominated by AAU representatives—it then selected the AOC. In 1928, on the resignation of then-AOA president General Douglas MacArthur, Brundage was elected president of the AOA; he was also elected president of the AOC, a post he held for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and {{came to rest on}} the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>CAA</b> and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
5|$|Bringelandsåsen was {{proposed}} by <b>the</b> <b>CAA</b> in 1974. Plans were developed and in 1983 the Ministry of Transport and Communications recommended that Øyrane be closed {{and replaced with}} an all-new airport at Bringeland. Construction started in 1985 and the new airport opened on 31 August 1986, taking over all scheduled traffic from Øyrane. Widerøe started scheduled services to Oslo and Bergen, originally using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 Dash 7 aircraft, of which the latter which was used to Oslo.|$|E

Unlike many other countries, {{there is no}} direct government funding of <b>the</b> <b>CAA's</b> work. It is classed as a public corporation, established by statute, in the public sector. The connection it has with the government is via the Machinery of government and Standards Group of the Cabinet Office.|$|R
50|$|The 2007 {{season was}} <b>the</b> <b>CAA's</b> {{first year as}} a {{football}} conference. The teams in <b>the</b> newly formed <b>CAA</b> football conference came largely from the Atlantic 10 Conference, {{as well as a}} mix of other conferences.|$|R
5|$|The {{airport was}} {{originally}} owned as an inter-municipal enterprise by Gaular and Førde. Operating deficits were covered through various subsidies from the state, often with unclear responsibilities and little financial {{risk for the}} owners. Most regional airports, including Førde, were nationalized in 1996 and transferred to <b>the</b> <b>CAA,</b> later renamed Avinor. Widerøe lost the public service obligation contract to fly to Florø Airport in 2000, and therefore moved its technical base for Western Norway to Førde, which included a new hangar.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} pilots {{licensed}} by <b>the</b> <b>CAA</b> to fly powered aircraft in 2005 was 47,000, of whom 28,000 held a Private Pilot Licence. The remainder held professional pilot licences, either a Commercial Pilot Licence or an Airline Transport Pilot Licence, {{although not all}} of these would be engaged in GA activities. In addition, there are 10,000 active glider pilots, and estimates put the membership of aviation-related sport and recreational associations at 36,000.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, <b>the</b> <b>CAA</b> also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, <b>the</b> <b>CAA</b> licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E

5|$|Aerodrome is a {{collective}} term for any location from which flying operations take place, although more specific terminology {{can be used}} to characterise its purpose. <b>The</b> <b>CAA</b> strategic review of GA applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations, and airfield to locations which predominantly support GA operations. The General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study (GASAR) analysed 687 aerodromes in England which come under the scope of GA, classifying 374 into six types. These range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent of GA flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.|$|E

5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{announced}} in February1993 {{that they were}} considering taking over ownership and operations of the airport through the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor). In December, Widerøe articulated that Båtsfjord Airport {{did not meet the}} demands for future operation as it lacked proper navigational aids and an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash8, which would be phased in between 1993 and 1995, they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. <b>The</b> <b>CAA</b> stated, instead, that the new airport should be built, estimated to cost between 70 and 80million Norwegian krone (NOK). The main reason was that the former airport was poorly located in relation to the terrain, being located in a valley. In April1994 the ministry stated that they were considering closing many of the smallest regional airports, including Båtsfjord.|$|E
5|$|Trans Polar made a {{demonstration}} trip to Stockholm on 13 June 1970—legal {{because it was}} without paying customers. The airline applied for permission to operate out of Sweden, but this {{was rejected by the}} Swedish Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) and appeals were rejected by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. The reason was that it lacked a permanent organization, did not have sufficient experience in large-scale charter operations and could not document that its charter operations would be based on their own resources. Despite the lack of permission, Trans Polar sub-chartered a round trip from Stockholm to London on 28 June. It then operated four flights from Stockholm to Rhodes, Palma de Mallorca and London between 4 and 6 July. Trans Polar claimed that they were flying courtesy trips and that the passengers had agreed to be compensated the part of the package trip which would have been paid to Trans Polar. The arguments were rejected by <b>the</b> <b>CAA,</b> who stated that this was a typical post-excuse and that in case of a courtesy trip the airline should not be collecting the fare in the first place. The incident was investigated by both Norwegian and Swedish police.|$|E

40|$|The general aims of {{the paper}} are, first, to discuss {{the role of the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as a {{regulator}} of the UK scheduled airline industry, prior to the imple mentation of European Community liberalisation of air transport on 1 January 1993. Second, the reactions of the industry itself to CAA policies are examined. Prior to a detailed considera tion of the principles which illuminated <b>the</b> <b>CAA's</b> strategy, <b>the</b> constraints upon that policy are elaborated. Largely, these derive from the characteristics of airline economics and also from the UK government's commitment to privatisation, even at the expense of industry competitiveness. The three principles constituting <b>the</b> <b>CAA's</b> strategy [...] namely, the multi-airline industry, the primacy of long-term user benefits, and the promotion of a profitable UK airline industry [...] which were implemented primarily through a process of route licensing, are discussed in turn. It is concluded that user benefits have been realised from <b>the</b> <b>CAA's</b> regulation of both the structure and the behaviour of the industry, although a more pronounced latter-day emphasis on competition is detected. This {{may be related to the}} advent of European liberalisation which places only the most modest constraints on carriers' rights to fly whichever routes they wish. ...|$|R
