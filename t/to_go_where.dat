And then we just sewed it together. It was rather like the way we'd been working on the dance remixes we'd been doing before. Kind of a cut-and-paste method.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>where</b> only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E

25|$|By X3, the X-Universe {{consists}} of around 160 sectors connected by two-way jumpgates. The main area of each sector typically contains several stations {{and up to}} four gates. The game is open-ended, allowing the player <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>where</b> they like, when they like, doing whatever they like; a player is limited only by their in-game status and resources. As such, a driving force {{of the game is}} to acquire credits (the universal currency) and status.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of New Zealand, the majority of independent Polynesian islands derive much of their income from foreign aid and remittances from {{those who live in}} other countries. Some encourage their young people <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>where</b> they can earn good money to remit to their stay-at-home relatives. Many Polynesian locations, such as Easter Island, supplement this with tourism income. Some have more unusual sources of income, such as Tuvalu which marketed its '.tv' internet top-level domain name or the Cooks that relied on postage stamp sales.|$|E

25|$|LaMountain, {{from his}} {{position}} at Fort Monroe, {{had the luxury of}} flying free. When he was enjoined with the Balloon Corps, he began insisting that his reconnaissance flights be made free. Lowe strictly instructed his men against free flight {{as a matter of policy}} and procedure. Eventually the two men agreed to a showdown in which LaMountain made one of his free flights. The flight was a success as a reconnaissance flight with LaMountain being able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>where</b> he would. But on his return he was threatened by Union troops who could not identify him. His balloon was shot down, and LaMountain was treated harshly until he was clearly identified.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{his career}} Flew was known as a strong {{advocate}} of atheism, arguing that one should presuppose atheism until empirical evidence of a God surfaces. He also criticised the idea of life after death, the free will defence to the problem of evil, and the meaningfulness of the concept of God. In 2003 {{he was one of the}} signatories of the Humanist Manifesto III. However, in 2004 he stated an allegiance to deism, more specifically a belief in the Aristotelian God. He stated that in keeping his lifelong commitment <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>where</b> the evidence leads, he now believed in the existence of a God.|$|E
25|$|Then {{there was}} the debate within the Nader {{campaign}} over where to travel in {{the waning days of}} the campaign. Some Nader advisers urged him to spend his time in uncontested states such as New York and California. These states – where liberals and leftists could entertain the thought of voting Nader without fear of aiding Bush – offered the richest harvest of potential votes. But, Martin writes, Nader – who emerges from this account as the house radical of his own campaign – insisted on spending {{the final days of the}} campaign on a whirlwind tour of battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Florida. In other words, he chose <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>where</b> the votes were scarcest, jeopardizing his own chances of winning 5 percent of the vote, which he needed to gain federal funds in 2004.|$|E

25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>where</b> the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

[...] Not only does Nancy have the freedom <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>where</b> she pleases (a freedom other, similar characters such as The Dana Girls do not have), but she is also able to change a tire and fix a flawed distributor, prompting Paretsky to argue that in [...] "a nation where car mechanics still mock or brush off complaints by women Nancy remains a significant role model." ...|$|E

The following day, on August 16, Lochry sent Captain Samuel Shannon and seven men with a letter to Clark. In the letter, Lochry asked Clark to leave more provisions because he was running short of flour {{and did not want to}} be delayed by having to send out hunters.

500|$|Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben (1551–1637) was a Protestant canoness at the cloister in Gerresheim, today a {{district}} of Düsseldorf. Her family was a cadet {{line of the}} old House of Mansfeld which, by the mid-16th century, had {{lost much of its}} affluence, but not its influence. The Mansfeld-Eisleben line retained significant authority in its district; several of Agnes' cousins and uncles had signed the Book of Concord, and the family exercised considerable influence in Reformation affairs. She had been raised in Eisleben, the town in which Martin Luther had been born. The family's estates were located in Saxony, but Agnes' sister lived in the city of Cologne, married to the Freiherr (or Baron), Peter von Kriechingen. Although a member of the Gerresheim cloister, Agnes was free during her days <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>where</b> she wished. Reports differ on how she came to Gebhard's notice. Some say he saw her on one of her visits to her sister in Cologne. Others claim he noticed her during a religious procession. Regardless, in late 1579or early 1580, she attracted Gebhard's notice. He sought her out, and they started a liaison. Two of her brothers, Ernst and Hoyer Christoph, soon visited Gebhard at the archbishop's residence to discuss a marriage. [...] "Gebhard's Catholic belief, which was by no means based on his innermost conviction, started to waver when he had to decide whether to renounce the bishop's mitre and stay faithful to the woman he loved, or to renounce his love and remain a member of the church hierarchy." [...] While he considered this, rumors of his possible conversion flew throughout the Electorate.|$|E
