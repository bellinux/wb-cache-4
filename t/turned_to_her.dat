5|$|By 221 Elagabalus' eccentricities, {{particularly}} {{his relationship with}} Hierocles, increasingly provoked the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard. When Elagabalus' grandmother Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was waning, she decided {{that he and his}} mother, who had encouraged his religious practices, had to be replaced. As alternatives, she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> other daughter, Julia Avita Mamaea, and her daughter's son, the thirteen-year-old Severus Alexander.|$|E
25|$|When Germain was 13, the Bastille fell, and {{the revolutionary}} {{atmosphere}} of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father's library.

25|$|During {{her first}} years in Great Britain, Charlotte had some {{difficulty}} in {{adapting to the}} life of the British court due to a strained relationship with her mother-in-law, Princess Augusta. Her mother-in-law made it difficult for Charlotte to establish social contacts by insisting on rigid court etiquette. Furthermore, it was Augusta who initially appointed many of Charlotte's staff, among whom several were suspected to report to Augusta about Charlotte's behavior. When she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> German companions for friends, she was criticized for keeping favorites, notably her close confidante Juliane von Schwellenberg.|$|E
25|$|Their Railshead {{residence}} {{had been}} situated {{next to a}} house owned by John's parents, who were angered by Augusta's second marriage and forced Augusta and Frederick to leave. Augusta <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father for help, and he granted her apartments in Kensington Palace and the position of State Housekeeper (replacing her recently deceased sister Sophia). They lived there for many years. In 1847, they embarked on a three-year trip to the continent, visiting Germany, France, and Italy. In 1850, they returned to Kensington Palace and Augusta's daughters came out in society. Both daughters married in 1855 in a double wedding, Wilhelmina to the 2nd Earl of Munster and Millicent to James Hay Erskine Wemyss.|$|E

25|$|Known in Przemyśl as the {{beautiful}} Rosenbach daughter, Helene {{was given the}} title of most 'brilliant {{enough to be a}} son.' It was in early childhood when Helene and her father began to experience tension in their relationship. Spurred by her thirst for education and her disdain for the life her mother planned for her, Helene <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father, only to find him unwilling to help her further her education past the age of fourteen. In her work, The Psychology of Women, Deutsch connects one aspect of feminine masochism with her attachment to her father and the possible consequences of such an identification. She writes that a father will sometimes break his relationship with his daughter when she approaches the age of sexual maturity. Helene later attributed her father's resistance to his subservience to his wife and desire for peace at home.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, the time-traveller Kang the Conqueror {{arrived in}} Egypt and assumed the {{identity}} of Pharaoh Rama-Tut. Knowing who En Sabah Nur was fated to become and where he was, Rama-Tut sent his General Ozymandias and an army to destroy the Sandstormers and find the young Apocalypse. En Sabah Nur and Baal were injured and sought refuge in a cave. Before he died, Baal revealed advanced alien technology hidden in the cave, {{left behind by the}} deity-like aliens known as Celestials. Vowing revenge on Rama-Tut, En Sabah Nur entered the Pharaoh's city posing as a slave and drew the romantic attention of Ozymandias's sister, Nephri. On seeing the mutant's true appearance, Nephri rejected him and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brother for protection. Heartbroken, En Sabah Nur's rage caused his mutant abilities to fully emerge. Rampaging, he renamed himself Apocalypse. Rama-Tut fled and En Sabah Nur used the Celestial technology to transform his former tormentor Ozymandias into a blind clairvoyant made of living stone, now enslaved to Apocalypse. As the years went on, Apocalypse found he no longer aged.|$|E
25|$|In March 1918, George's {{father was}} exiled to the remote city of Perm by the Bolsheviks, and Natalia became {{concerned}} for her family's safety. She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> friends, Prince and Princess Putyatin, for help. The Putyatins' apartment in Saint Petersburg was {{next door to}} the Danish embassy, and the Danes agreed to surreptitiously smuggle George out of the country. The Danish diplomat overseeing prisoner-of-war exchange, Colonel Cramer, gave George and his nanny, Miss Neame, shelter at his home in Sergeyevskaya street for a month until 25 April. On a train carrying prisoners-of-war who were being repatriated back to Germany, and with false passports in the name of Silldorff, Miss Neame posed as the wife of an Austrian officer and George posed as her son. A Danish officer, Captain Sorensen, accompanied them, since neither spoke German, and if they were discovered Miss Neame was in danger of being shot as a spy. They reached the Danish embassy in Berlin safely, and were given shelter by the ambassador, Count Carl Moltke. Informed of their escape, Wilhelm II, German Emperor, chose to ignore the fact that the British Miss Neame was an enemy alien, and permitted them to continue their journey to Copenhagen.|$|E

500|$|Madonna <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{old friend}} and {{producer}} John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to help her remix the songs, and also {{enlisted the help of}} Patrick Leonard, the producer of True Blue. The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing, which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song. Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes, panned across the stereophonic sound outlets. At certain points, almost no music is heard except the drums and at other times, the drums are removed with only the hi-hat left to keep time. The album cover denoted Madonna's continuous fascination with Hispanic culture.|$|E

Madonna later told Vanity Fair that she saw herself in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody." [...] Terrified that her father Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.|$|E
500|$|History of a Six Weeks' Tour {{begins with}} a [...] "Preface", written by Percy Shelley, {{followed}} by the journal section. The journal consists of edited entries from the joint diary that Percy and Mary Shelley kept during their 1814 trip to the Continent, specifically those from 28 July to 13 September 1814. Of the 8,500 words in the journal section, 1,150 are from Percy's entries and either copied verbatim or only slightly paraphrased. Almost all of the passages describing the sublime are in Percy's words—passages describing God in nature, experiences of terror and awe, the transportation of the soul, and particularly {{the feeling of being}} overwhelmed by the majesty of nature, are Percy's. When Mary <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own entries, however, she significantly revised them; according to Jeanne Moskal, the editor of the recent definitive edition of the Tour, [...] "almost nothing of her original phrasing remains". She even included sections of Claire Clairmont's journal.|$|E

500|$|Madonna <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{old friend}} and {{producer}} John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to help her remixing the songs, and also {{enlisted the help of}} Patrick Leonard, the producer of True Blue. Together they chose six of Madonna's old songs and decided to give it a remixed form. The songs chosen were [...] "Holiday", [...] "Everybody" [...] and [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] from Madonna (1983), [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin (1984), and lastly, [...] "Where's the Party" [...] from True Blue. Along with the pre-released tracks, a never-before released song called [...] "Spotlight" [...] was included as a bonus. Madonna said that she was inspired by the song [...] "Everybody Is a Star" [...] (1970), by American rock band Sly and the Family Stone. Written by Madonna, Stephen Bray and Curtis Hudson, [...] "Spotlight" [...] was originally recorded during the True Blue recording sessions. It was omitted from the album because Madonna felt that it was similar in composition and structure to [...] "Holiday".|$|E
500|$|With {{her mother}} dead, Cavendish's aunt Henrietta Ponsonby felt obligated {{to help her}} niece escape a {{difficult}} home situation. For her part, Cavendish had been critical of her aunt {{in the past but}} now <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for affection, support, and as a reminder of her mother. Once the Duke of Devonshire made clear his desire to marry Foster, Henrietta began searching for a suitable marriage prospect for her niece, and suggested Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, as he was known at that time. Lord Granville had been Henrietta's own lover by now for seventeen years; she had borne him two illegitimate children during their relationship and declared once that she [...] "loved him to idolatry." [...] Nevertheless, Henrietta encouraged her niece to consider marriage with the thirty-seven-year-old Granville. Though still infatuated with him, she knew that Granville would need to eventually marry and produce legitimate offspring, and that when he did so, she would likely lose him. Getting her niece to marry him was one way of keeping him within her circle.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{eventually}} {{learned to}} take care of herself and her siblings, and she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place of}} their beloved mother. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way.

[...] Terrified that her father, Tony Ciccone, could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him. Two years after her mother's death, her father married the family's housekeeper, Joan Gustafson. At this point, Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father that lasted for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude.

500|$|In 2002, Marc Cherry {{was in a}} {{precarious}} financial situation and was having trouble finding a job. He commented, [...] "I was broke, unable to get even an interview for a writing job, and seriously concerned about my future. I had just turned forty and was starting to wonder if I {{was one of those}} deluded writers that wander around Hollywood, convincing themselves they're talented when all the evidence points to the contrary." [...] While watching television coverage of the Andrea Yates trials with his mother, Cherry <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and asked, [...] "Can you imagine being so desperate that you would do that to your children?" [...] to which his mother replied, [...] "I've been there." [...] Cherry was intrigued by the idea that a [...] "perfectly sane, rational woman could have the life she wanted, being a wife and mother... and still have moments of insanity;" [...] he began writing the pilot episode soon after. Cherry originally developed the concept as a half-hour comedy. However, after his agent was arrested for embezzlement, Cherry signed with Paradigm Talent Agency, where he was advised to rewrite the script as a soap opera. Cherry completed the first draft of the pilot in April 2002 and pitched the script to CBS, NBC, Fox, HBO, Showtime, and Lifetime, all of which turned it down.|$|E
500|$|On 20January another séance was held, {{this time}} {{at the home of}} a Mr Bruin, on the corner of nearby Hosier Lane. [...] Among those {{attending}} was a man [...] "extremely desirous of detecting the fraud, and discovering the truth of this mysterious affair", who later sent his account of the night to the London Chronicle. [...] He arrived with a small party which included James Penn of St Ann's in Aldersgate. [...] Inside the house, a member of the group positioned himself against the bed, but was asked by one of the ghost's sympathisers to move. [...] He refused, and following a brief argument the ghost's supporters left. [...] The gentleman then asked if Parsons would allow his daughter to be moved to a room at his house, but was refused. [...] For the remainder of the night the ghost made no sound, while Elizabeth Parsons, now extremely agitated, displayed signs of convulsions. [...] When questioned she confirmed that she had seen the ghost, but that she was not frightened by it. [...] At that point several of the party left, but at about 7am the next morning the knocking once more recommenced. [...] Following the usual questions about the cause of Fanny's death and who was responsible, the interrogation <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> body, which lay in the vaults of St John's.|$|E
500|$|Faced {{with the}} {{opposition}} of Venice, William of Villehardouin <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> rival, Genoa, for support. The Genoese, ever eager to thwart their rivals, Venice, and owing a debt for William's assistance to them at Rhodes a few years before, readily accepted. Based at Monemvasia, Genoese-crewed galleys preyed upon Venetian shipping. Othon de Cicon, the lord of Karystos in southern Euboea, {{in control of the}} strategic passage of the Cavo D'Oro, also sided with William. Elsewhere, however, William's appeals were met with hostility and mistrust, due to the Achaean ruler's claims of suzerainty over all the Latin princes of southern Greece. From the summer of 1256, Guy I de la Roche, the [...] "Great Lord" [...] ("Megaskyr") of Athens and Thebes, and his kinsman William de la Roche, had joined the Venetian camp, although they were both vassals to the Villehardouins (Guy as Lord of Argos and Nauplia and his brother as baron of Veligosti and Damala): the treaty between Venice and the triarchs had been signed at Guy's capital, Thebes, while both Guy and William actively aided the Venetians in their siege of Negroponte. Thomas II de Stromoncourt, the Lord of Salona, and Ubertino Pallavicini, the Margrave of Bodonitsa, also entered in the anti-Achaean coalition, to be joined soon after by Geoffroy de Bruyères, [...] "the best soldier in all the realm of Romania [...] ", who deserted his uncle's cause.|$|E
