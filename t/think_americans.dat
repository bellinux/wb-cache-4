2500|$|Later in January 2008, Clinton {{backed out}} of a cover photo shoot with Vogue over {{concerns}} by the Clinton camp that she would appear [...] "too feminine," [...] which prompted the magazine's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, to write, [...] "Imagine my amazement, then, when I learned that Hillary Clinton, our only female presidential hopeful, had decided {{to steer clear of}} our pages at this point in her campaign for fear of looking too feminine. The notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously as a seeker of power is frankly dismaying. How has our culture come to this? How is it that The Washington Post recoils from the slightest hint of cleavage on a senator? This is America, not Saudi Arabia. It's also 2008: Margaret Thatcher may have looked terrific in a blue power suit, but that was 20 years ago. I do <b>think</b> <b>Americans</b> have moved on from the power-suit mentality, which served as a bridge for a generation of women to reach boardrooms filled with men. Political campaigns that do not recognize this are making a serious misjudgment." ...|$|E

60|$|One {{not only}} hears of this favor at home, {{but when one}} goes to England one still hears of it. To be sure one hears of it mainly from Americans, but {{they have the best}} means of knowing the fact; they are chiefly concerned, and they are {{supported}} in their belief by the almost unvaried amenity of the English journals, which now very rarely take the tone towards Americans formerly habitual with them. Their change of tone is the most obvious change which I <b>think</b> <b>Americans</b> can count upon noting when they come to England, and I am far from reckoning it insignificant. It did not happen of the newspapers themselves; it must be the expression of a prevalent mood, if not a very deeply rooted feeling in their readers. One hears of their interest, their kindness, not from the Americans alone; the English themselves sometimes profess it, and if they overestimate us, the generous error is in the right direction. At the end it must cease to be an error, for, as we Americans all know, we need only to be better understood in order to be more highly prized. Besides, liking is much oftener the effect of willing than has been supposed.|$|E

But a British film-maker is determined to make her return to campus in California rather less smooth than she might have wished. On Tuesday night, the college's Amnesty International chapter will host the screening of a new documentary 'American Faust: From Condi to Neo-Condi', made by director Sebastian Doggart. Based on testimony from both supporters and critics, the film makes a number of damning accusations about her time as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State. Most explosive is the coverage of her role as chair of the group of 'Principals' (Vice-President Dick Cheney and then defense secretary Donald Rumseld were also members) who allegedly signed off on CIA [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques" [...] such as water-boarding for terror suspects. That technique has been described as torture by defeated Republican presidential candidate John McCain and new Attorney General Eric Holder, among many others. Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff to Colin Powell who was Secretary of State at the time of those Principals meetings, tells Doggart: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>Americans</b> should be appalled that Dr Rice was sitting there giving the orders to water-board."
