5|$|Understanding <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred}} during an organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct {{parts of the}} body, genes which {{may be involved in}} human genetic disorders. For example, the Mexican tetra is an albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves. This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 8, Money, {{describes}} the internal debate at CBC regarding how {{to cover a}} $70 million loss in advertising revenue from the 2008-2009 recession with the government unwilling to cover the deficit or allow CBC to incur debt. Ultimately, they decided on cutting 400 jobs, {{reducing the number of}} episodes ordered, and selling excess real estate. Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the consolidation of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did not endorse Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process. In the final chapter Stursberg notes <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> occurred since his departure and predicts the demise of CBC Sports as it loses NHL rights to CTV/TSN.|$|E

A number of methods for carrying out language classification have been developed, ranging from simple inspection to computerised hypothesis testing. Such methods have gone through a long process of development.|$|E

25|$|Discussion {{around the}} Law and its wording {{constantly}} reappears on {{private and public}} agendas in Israel and in the Diaspora. The Knesset has repeatedly debated proposals to amend the Law of Return, and it has indeed been amended {{a number of times}} over the years. These modifications reflect <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> taken place in Israeli society, the shifts that have taken place in political dialogue both inside Israel itself, and the political discourse between Israel and the Diaspora.

25|$|Terry {{finds it}} {{particularly}} hard {{to adjust to}} <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> occurred during {{his time in the}} Army. As implied in the lyrics to the programme's theme song, the 1970s series plays on both lads' feelings of nostalgia for the lost days of their reckless youth. Both of them are depressed by the demolition of so many of the landmarks of their youth, though Bob, who works for a building firm, sometimes sees it as progress. Bob has also bought his own house on a newly-built estate, further distancing him from his and Terry's pasts.|$|E
500|$|Yumemi is a goodhearted but {{extremely}} talkative gynoid attendant of {{an abandoned}} planetarium; she is designed {{to look like a}} young girl. Yumemi is slightly damaged and completely unaware of <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> occurred in the past 30 years, as none of the facilities and databases that she connects to exist anymore. Therefore, she treats the protagonist like a regular guest by calling him , speaks of the world as it was before the war, and fails to understand any information he tells her, other than things related to her job at the planetarium. The name [...] "Hoshino Yumemi" [...] itself is a pun—"hoshi" [...] means star or planetary body; [...] "no" [...] is a possessive particle; [...] "yume" [...] is a dream or a reverie; [...] "mi" [...] means see.

500|$|To mark Bondfield's centenary in 1973, Linda Christmas in The Guardian {{reviewed}} {{the progress of}} women in parliament since the 1930s. By 1973, Christmas reported, only 93 women had sat in parliament; their contributions had overall [...] "not been stunning". Their best numerical representation at that point {{had been in the}} 1966 general election, when 29 women (out of 630 MPs) had been elected. The 1979 election saw this number fall to 19, but also saw Margaret Thatcher become Britain's first woman prime minister. Cox and Hobley draw attention to Thatcher's early life as a shopkeeper's daughter, and contrast her account of those days with Bondfield's experiences half a century earlier. Thatcher believed that the concept of service to the customer was absolute; thus, Cox and Hobley assert, she would have had little sympathy for Bondfield's campaigns to better shopworkers' conditions. Despite <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> taken place in the retail industry since Bondfield's day, Cox and Hobley believe that, were she alive, [...] "she'd still be champing at the bit, trying to coax shop assistants to join a union, and fiercely championing shopworkers' rights to better pay and conditions".|$|E
500|$|Wu Hung {{described}} The Founding of the Nation as [...] "arguably {{the most}} celebrated work of official Chinese art". [...] He noted that the painting is the only [...] "canonized" [...] one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze. [...] The painting is a modern-day example of damnatio memoriae, the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person. [...] Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting [...] "the most significant historical image of China's founding". [...] Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> come to China's leadership {{during the years of}} Communist governance. [...] Andrews wrote that [...] "its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting". [...] Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it [...] "a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles". [...] The painting has never been as highly regarded in the West as in China; according to Andrews, [...] "art history students have been known to roar with laughter when slides of it appear on the screen". [...] Art historian Michael Sullivan dismissed it as mere propaganda. [...] Today, following a merger of museums, both paintings are in the National Museum of China, on Tiananmen Square.|$|E
2500|$|The year 2005 is {{significant}} {{primarily because of}} <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> occurred {{in the philosophy of}} physics over the past 100 years. [...] These changes began in 1905 with the publication of four papers by Einstein that: explained Brownian motion, introduced the special theory of relativity, described how the photoelectric effect could be explained by the quantization of light -which helped launch quantum mechanics-, and developed E = mc2. [...] These papers are commonly called his Annus Mirabilis Papers because they later defined 1905 as a miracle year for physics.|$|E

2500|$|Agostini v. Felton, , is a {{landmark}} {{decision of the}} Supreme Court of the United States. In this case, the Court overruled its decision in Aguilar v.

This case is noteworthy in a broader sense as a sign of evolving judicial standards surrounding the First Amendment, and <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> occurred in modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{required}} {{portion of}} the ACT is divided into four multiple choice subject tests: English, mathematics, reading, and science reasoning.

[...] The composite score is the average of all four tests. In addition, students taking the optional writing test receive a writing score ranging from 2 to 12 (This is a change from the previous 1–36 score range). The writing score does not affect the composite score. The ACT has eliminated the combined English/writing score, and has added two new combined scores: The ELA will be an average of the English, Reading and Writing scores. The STEM will be an average of the Math and Science scores.
