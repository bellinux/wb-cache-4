40|$|Software piracy has {{recently}} gained enormous attention, {{not only in}} the context of P 2 P-networks. As one countermeasure against software piracy, publishers have been implementing Digital Rights Management systems such as <b>technical</b> <b>copy</b> protection measures into their software products. This paper examines the impact of different <b>technical</b> <b>copy</b> protection measures and Internet services usage on software piracy using data from an internationally organized online survey. The results show that technical protection measures fail to achieve their protection goals, as none of the studied protection measures completely avoids piracy. A higher level of copy protection does not always make a legal software installation more likely. In contrast, a low level of protection does not necessarily lead to intense illegal copying. P 2 P- and Chat-networks compromise the security of <b>technical</b> <b>copy</b> protections as they provide access to cracked software copies, fostering software piracy. Based on our results, we discuss the impact of our findings on the publishers ' anti-piracy strategy from an economic point of view and present possible security improvements for hardware- and software-based copy protections...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{explosion}} in the popularity of downloading and transmitting high-value digital content, triggered by the growth of the Internet and the evolution of peer-to-peer systems. At the same time, there is a substantial disconnect between public attitudes toward copyright and the letter of the law, and growing concern among copyright-holders over the erosion of their rights. The National Academy of Sciences has identified the phenomenon at the center of these developments and labeled it the "digital dilemma": The same technologies that allow the creation and manipulation of digital content (as well as its perfect reproduction and nearly free distribution) {{can also be used to}} prevent access to digital content. The result is a major policy debate between those who seek to protect their rights in digital content and those concerned about the public access to content that has traditionally been guaranteed under copyright law. In this emerging digital world, what, if anything, should be done to ensure that authors, artists, songwriters, and musicians have adequate incentives to create content? And what, if anything, should be done to protect the public's access rights, developed in the physical world, in order to encourage innovation and dissemination and to enhance the public domain? This report from the Digital Connections Council (DCC) of the Committee for Economic Development presents a different view of this "digital dilemma. " Because of CED's mission to foster economic growth, the DCC has focused on the economic impact of copyright protection in the digital age and the potential economic effects of proposals for change. The report briefly explores the history of copyright law, revealing that legal protection of the rights of creators has always been explicitly balanced against protection of ongoing innovation. The DCC brings the perspective of the second innovator [...] the creator of new social value based on existing copyrighted works [...] to bear, noting that every creator owes a debt to what has come before. For this reason, our intellectual property systems are based on providing incentives to both create new material and to make such material open to the public for use for subsequent creation. The report then discusses current proposals for legislative and regulatory change, focusing on requests by the content distribution industries for <b>technical</b> <b>copy</b> protection mandates. Such mandates would have substantial effects on the information technology and consumer electronics industries in this country, on innovation, and on the economic growth that stems from the freedom to innovate...|$|E

40|$|Digital technologies, {{especially}} broadband technology, create {{opportunities for}} new services to emerge. A {{good example of}} such a new service in the market of audiovisual content is the so-called «Digital Cloud Recorder» (DCR). How should such a new «device» or service be perceived from a –Belgian– copyright point-of-view? Does the actual legal framework offer the right level of clarity to answer business-relevant questions? In this paper I will discuss the difficult relation of the DCR with traditional copyright concepts: the exceptions for private <b>copying</b> and temporary <b>technical</b> <b>copies,</b> cable retransmission and communication to the public and conclude that not all questions asked can be resolved with a simple yes or no answer. As with many copyright-related issues, the DCR and the entrepreneur wishing to bring it to the market will have to face the considerable risk of legal uncertainty. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a new {{computational}} method for discovering and evaluating ink-trace characteristics related to the writing process. Typically, these ink-trace characteristics are inner ink-trace morphology, trace width and / or ink-intensity variations, but also specific stroke phenomena, such as ink drops, feathering and stri-ations. The aim of the evaluation is to provide objective and reproducible analysis results for stroke morphologies in order to detect skilled forgeries and <b>technical</b> <b>copies.</b> The influences {{of different kinds of}} writing material, like the ink type used, is taken into account. By means of recorded, temporal (online) data, segmented ink traces are sampled equidistantly, and local ink-trace character-istics are encoded in one feature vector per sample record. These data establish a sequence which faithfully reflects the spatial distribution of ink-trace characteristics and solves problems of methods previously available. Dy-namic Time Warping is implemented for the verification of two feature-vector sequences. The proposed method works towards (1) detailed studies of ink-deposition pro-cesses, (2) objective testing procedures in forensic prac-tice, and (3) the advancement of skilled forgery detection for automatic bank-check processing...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 This {{case study}} investigates how {{scientists}} who write <b>technical</b> marketing <b>copy</b> experience and resolve {{the tension that}} results from the conflicting demands of their local (company) and global (research science) discourse communities. Twelve scientists, who are currently technical marketing writers at a small biotechnology company, were interviewed by e-mail {{over the course of}} three months, and they were also asked to submit writing samples. The results of this study challenge the theory that a writer's perception of audience, which is also linked to philosophical orientation (positivist/constructivist), is the primary factor that determines whether they will write persuasively or informatively. Killingsworth's concepts of local and global discourse communities were applied to help develop a comprehensive picture of the tension experienced by these authors. Although all of the positivists in this study did choose a strictly informative writing style, there appeared to be a number of factors affecting whether the constructivists wrote persuasively or informatively. These factors included the strength of a writer's professional identification with the local (company) or global (research science) discourse community, the level of tension created by the conflicting demands of the local and global discourse communities, and the extent of a writer's perception of audience...|$|R

40|$|Algorithms to {{estimate}} the power spectrum using Maximum Entropy Methods were developed. These algorithms were coded in FORTRAN 77 and were implemented on the VAX 780. The important considerations in this analysis are: (1) resolution, i. e., how close in frequency two spectral components can be spaced and still be identified; (2) dynamic range, i. e., how small a spectral peak can be, relative to the largest, and still be observed in the spectra; and (3) variance, i. e., how accurate the estimate of the spectra is to the actual spectra. The application of the algorithms based on Maximum Entropy Methods {{to a variety of}} data shows that these criteria are met quite well. Additional work in this direction would help confirm the findings. All of the software developed was turned over to the <b>technical</b> monitor. A <b>copy</b> of a typical program is included.

40|$|As {{the first}} Technical School in Ontario, the Toronto Technical School {{played a role}} that {{directly}} influenced provincial legislation {{which resulted in the}} formal recognition, public funding, and eventually, the inclusion of technical education in the public school system. A well organized local support network for technical education, as well as a highly supportive local newspaper, created an environment suitable for educational change that would {{serve as a model for}} the province of Ontario. Once officially included into the public school system, the roles of many of the original supporters of the Toronto Technical School were no longer needed. However, remnants of their initial efforts are still evident in our educational structures today in the form of both integrated technical programs within a high school and individual technical high schools. Although formally amalgamated in 1904, distinct schools within the public school system remain. The initial dream of a school dedicated primarily to technical education, as was the Toronto Technical School, still exists today, serving as a reminder of the significance of the Toronto <b>Technical</b> School.

40|$|Abstract Background Illumina Infinium whole genome {{genotyping}} (WGG) arrays {{are increasingly}} being applied in cancer genomics to study gene copy number alterations and allele-specific aberrations such as loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Methods developed for normalization of WGG arrays have mostly focused on diploid, normal samples. However, for cancer samples genomic aberrations may confound normalization and data interpretation. Therefore, we {{examined the effects of}} the conventionally used normalization method for Illumina Infinium arrays when applied to cancer samples. Results We demonstrate an asymmetry in the detection of the two alleles for each SNP, which deleteriously influences both allelic proportions and copy number estimates. The asymmetry is caused by a remaining bias between the two dyes used in the Infinium II assay after using the normalization method in Illumina's proprietary software (BeadStudio). We propose a quantile normalization strategy for correction of this dye bias. We tested the normalization strategy using 535 individual hybridizations from 10 data sets from the analysis of cancer genomes and normal blood samples generated on Illumina Infinium II 300 k version 1 and 2, 370 k and 550 k BeadChips. We show that the proposed normalization strategy successfully removes asymmetry in estimates of both allelic proportions and copy numbers. Additionally, the normalization strategy reduces the <b>technical</b> variation for <b>copy</b> number estimates while retaining the response to copy number alterations. Conclusion The proposed normalization strategy represents a valuable tool that improves the quality of data obtained from Illumina Infinium arrays, in particular when used for LOH and copy number variation studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|La investigación consistió en la aplicación de la técnica de los Mapas Mentales con el objetivo de desarrollar las habilidades de comprensión y producción de textos en los estudiantes del cuarto grado de educación primaria, en el área de Comunicación Integral de la Institución Educativa Experimental "José Carlos Mariátegui" de ta Facultad de Educación y Humanidades -Rioja. La investigación surgió {{debido a}} que se pudo observar que en la actualidad no se utilizan modelos o técnicas sistematizados para leer y procesar la información de los textos y en vista de que los estudiantes leen como pueden: Unos identificando ideas principales de los párrafos con algún criterio técnico; otros, copiando la información literalmente o simplemente suprimiendo algunas líneas del texto. De esta manera, casi nunca emplean esquemas o representaciones gráficas para traducir el producto de la lectura y comprensión def texto; tampoco conocen cómo se elaboran los Mapas Mentales, entre otras técnicas que le ayuden en su proceso de aprendizaje. A la luz de esta realidad, y en base a los antecedentes de la investigación. se postuló que con fa técnica de los Mapas Mentales los estudiantes desarrollarían sus habilidades para la comprensión y producción de textos, lo cual se constituyó en la hipótesis de investigación. En cuanto a la parte metodológica, se trabajó con una muestra de 15 estudiantes a quienes se les administró un pretest al inicio de La investigación y un postest después de aplicar 12 sesiones de aprendizaje en base a los Mapas mentales.
