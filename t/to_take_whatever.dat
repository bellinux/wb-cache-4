5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} falling out of fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but rather, to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree took the form of a recommendation from the Senate to the consuls <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>whatever</b> actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging from the Senate to ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E
5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the {{thousands}} of pages of evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>whatever</b> they wished. On their way to the finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E

25|$|In 1840, {{a federal}} {{district}} court found that the transport of the kidnapped Africans across the Atlantic on the slave ship Tecora was in violation of laws and treaties against the international slave trade by Great Britain, Spain and the United States. The captives were ruled to have acted as free men when they fought to escape their illegal confinement. The court ruled the Africans were entitled <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>whatever</b> legal measures necessary to secure their freedom, {{including the use of}} force. Under international and sectional pressure, U.S. President Martin Van Buren ordered the case appealed to the Supreme Court. It affirmed the lower court ruling on March 9, 1841, and authorized the release of the Africans, but overturned the order of the lower court that they be returned to Africa at government expense.|$|E
25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>whatever</b> he desires.|$|E

Operasi Trisula, directed by BZ Kadaryono, dealt with the extermination of G30S and PKI members in Blitar, East Java. Djakarta 1966, meanwhile, was directed by Noer and showed the lead-up to the signing of Supersemar on 11 March 1966, in which Sukarno gave Suharto authority <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>whatever</b> measures he [...] "deemed necessary"; Kayam and Katamsi reprised their roles for the latter film, which won seven awards at the 1989 Bandung Film Festival.|$|E

Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg {{described}} his task to cut down the novel as searching for [...] "the best equivalent way to tell the story.

Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that [...] "she just wanted to see a great movie, and gave [...] permission <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>whatever</b> liberties [...] felt [...] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love". Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film, Goldenberg explained, became [...] "clearer when [...] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry's emotional journey". He and Yates [...] "looked for every opportunity to get everything [...] could in there. And where [...] couldn't, to sort of pay homage to it, to have it somewhere in the background or to feel like it could be taking place off-screen".|$|E

Claudia Black characterized early Vala as [...] "sassy", [...] "intelligent", [...] "manipulative", and [...] "mercurial", but found it [...] "very {{hard to tell what}} the real core of Vala is."

With Vala being a departure from Black's former Farscape role as Aeryn Sun, Black regarded Vala as a comedic and energetic character with streaks of irreverence and naughtiness who [...] "says everything that everyone else is thinking, but doesn't dare say", although both characters share [...] "being damaged goods [...] and on a path to becoming a better person". Robert C. Cooper thought of Vala as [...] "a bit of a wild card" [...] and [...] "a very sexy character, who isn't afraid <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>whatever</b> she wants in any given situation."

Few of Lee's subsequent corps commanders had this ability. At Gettysburg, this resulted in lost opportunities.

The verses were prayers for the dead. According to Kakachi, the passengers were silent and began to feel panicked. The hijackers knew the negotiators were in the control tower, so through the side window of the cockpit, they began to fire automatic machine guns towards the control tower.

In order to avoid charges of hypocrisy or racism it would have to take the lead in population reduction efforts. Ehrlich floats the idea of adding [...] "temporary sterilants" [...] to the water supply or staple foods. However, he rejects the idea as unpractical due to [...] "criminal inadequacy of biomedical research in this area." [...] He suggests a tax scheme in which additional children would add to a family's tax burden at increasing rates for more children, as well as luxury taxes on childcare goods. He suggests incentives for men who agree to permanent sterilization before they have two children, as well as a variety of other monetary incentives. He proposes a powerful Department of Population and Environment which [...] "should be set up with the power <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>whatever</b> steps are necessary to establish a reasonable population size in the United States and to put an end to the steady deterioration of our environment." [...] The department should support research into population control, such as better contraceptives, mass sterilizing agents, and prenatal sex discernment (because families often continue to have children until a male is born.
