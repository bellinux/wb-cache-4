Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria, of poisoning him.|$|E

5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states.

5|$|Postwar {{redevelopment}} and anti-Victorianism {{resulted in}} the loss of dozens of Victorian buildings like New Street station and the old Central Library, often replaced by brutalist architecture.

In inner-city areas too, much Victorian housing was demolished and redeveloped. Existing communities were relocated to tower block estates like Castle Vale.|$|E
