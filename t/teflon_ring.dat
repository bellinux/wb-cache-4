40|$|The {{method of}} X-ray {{structural}} analysis (X-ray scattering at small angles) {{is used to}} show that the structures obtained by self-organization on a substrate of lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots are ordered arrays. Self-organization of quantum dots occurs at slow evaporation of solvent from a cuvette. The cuvette is a thin layer of mica with <b>teflon</b> <b>ring</b> on it. The positions of peaks in SAXS pattern are used to calculate crystal lattice of obtained ordered structures. Such structures have a primitive orthorhombic crystal lattice. Calculated lattice parameters are: a = 21, 1 (nm); b = 36, 2 (nm); c = 62, 5 (nm). Dimensions of structures are tens of micrometers. The spectral properties of PbS QDs superstructures and kinetic parameters of their luminescence are investigated. Absorption band of superstructures is broadened as compared to the absorption band of the quantum dots in solution; the luminescence band is slightly shifted to the red region of the spectrum, while its bandwidth is not changed much. Luminescence lifetime of obtained structures has been significantly decreased in comparison with the isolated quantum dots in solution, but remained the same for the lead sulfide quantum dots close-packed ensembles.

In this approach the rotating-disk extraction device {{consists of a}} Teflon disk, with a cavity that is loaded with a commercial sorbent phase selected according to the polarity of the analyte. To avoid leakage of the sorbent, the cavity {{is covered with a}} fiberglass filter and sealed with a <b>Teflon</b> <b>ring.</b> The proposed novel analytical RDSE technique was used in this study to determine florfenicol levels in plasma as a model analyte, or sample system, to describe the pharmacokinetics of a veterinary formulation. The sorbent used for this application was the copolymer of divinylbenzene and N-vinylpyrrolidone (Oasis HLB), which was selected because the florfenicol molecule contains both hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties. After the extraction, final determination of the analyte was performed by HPLC– DAD. Calibration plots and other analytical features were obtained after 90 min of extraction. The calibration plot was linear over the interval 0. 4 – 16 μg mL− 1 (n= 6), with R 2 = 0. 9999. Recovery and repeatability were determined using a blank plasma sample spiked with 4. 8 μg mL− 1 florfenicol. A recovery of 91. 5 %, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 8. 8 %, was obtained when the extraction was evaluated using six different rotating-disk devices. Precision was also assessed, using the same disk (containing the same sorbent phase) for eight aliquots of the same sample. The RSD under these conditions was 10. 2 %, clearly indicating that the sorptive phase could possibly be re-used. Accordingly, RDSE is a suitable sample preparation alternative to liquid–liquid extraction (LLE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), and stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE).

40|$|Preprosthetic surgery {{has become}} a routine {{procedure}} to obtain sufficient bone quantity and quality for dental implant installation in patients with an initial inadequate bone volume. Although autologous bone onlay or inlay grafting is still the preferred bone augmentation technique, {{a broad range of}} synthetic bone substitutes have been developed, for example, calcium phosphate cement (CPC). The introduction of porosity within CPC can be used to increase CPC degradation and bone ingrowth. Therefore, three different strategies to obtain porous CPCs were evaluated in this preclinical study. Instantaneously porous CPC (CPC-IP) was compared with delayed porous CPC in vitro and in vivo. CPC-IP was obtained by the creation of CO(2) bubbles during setting, whereas delayed porous CPC was obtained after the degradation of incorporated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres. As an additional aspect, delayed porous CPC was created by the incorporation of either hollow or dense degradable PLGA microspheres (CPC-hPLGA and CPC-dPLGA). All CPC compositions showed appropriate clinical handling properties and an interconnected porous structure with a final porosity above 70 % (v/v). In vitro degradation studies showed the gradual formation of pores and further CPC-matrix dissolution for CPCs containing PLGA microspheres (dPLGA microspheres > hPLGA microspheres). For in vivo evaluation of the CPCs, an augmentation model was used, allowing a CPC injection into a rigidly immobilized <b>Teflon</b> <b>ring</b> on the rat skull. Histological evaluation after 12 weeks of implantation showed bone formation using all three CPCs. Bone apposition reached volumetric amounts of up to 10 % of the augmentation area and a maximum augmentation height of approximately 1 mm. CPC-IP showed significantly more bone formation and resulted in a superior bone apposition height compared with both CPCs containing PLGA microspheres. No differences in biological performance were observed between the CPCs containing hPLGA and those containing dPLGA microspheres. Further research is necessary to enhance the bone appositional speed and amount of CPCs for bone augmentation procedures before them being used in a potential clinical setting...|$|E
40|$|Background/purpose: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} antibacterial activities of the leachable components of root-end filling materials (calcium silicate cement). Materials and methods: Root-end filling materials were mixed according to the manufacturers' directions and then placed into 6 -mm-diameter <b>Teflon</b> <b>rings</b> with mixed materials; {{they were allowed to}} set for 24 hours and then tested. Antibacterial activities of the root-end filling materials were evaluated against Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans and Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity of the root-end filling materials tested was determined by measuring the diameter of each zone of inhibition (on an agar diffusion test). An Alamar blue assay was used to detect bacterial growth. Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance. Results: Zones of inhibition were observed in the zinc oxide–eugenol cement (IRM) group treating S. sanguinis and E. coli agar plates in the agar diffusion test. Cultures of S. sanguinis and E. coli showed the lowest absorbances with the IRM group at different times of observation (1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours and 12 hours) (P 0. 05). Conclusion: We concluded that both the agar diffusion test and Alamar blue assay gave comparable findings of assessing the antimicrobial activity present in root-end filling materials. No antimicrobial activity was detected for mineral trioxide aggregate, calcium silicate cement, or amalgam after coming into contact with S. mutans, S. sanguinis and E. coli.

It was found that the commonly used 1. 23 % acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) gel has a deleterious effect on different dental materials. The effect of the gel on zinc phosphate cement is still not known. It is expected that 1. 23 % APF gel may affect the microstructure of the zinc phosphate cement. Thirty <b>Teflon</b> <b>rings</b> were prepared. Zinc phosphate cement was mixed and loaded into the rings. Excess cement material was removed and samples were stored in 20 ml of distilled water at 37 °C for 24 hours. They were then equally divided into five groups. Samples of the control group were stored in 20 ml of distilled water at 37 °C for 24 hours. The other four groups received four times application of 1. 23 % APF gel for 1, 4, 6 and 10 minutes at each application with an intermediate washing and immersion in 20 ml of distilled water at 37 °C for one hour between applications. Samples were prepared for examination under the scanning electron microscope. Results showed that as the application time of the gel is increased, more reaction products are formed on the surface of the set zinc phosphate cement. These products mask and may protect the surface from erosion by the acidic APF gel. However, more surface roughness is produced that may accumulate bacteria and affect the gingival health.

A test of the setting time was performed following the # 57 ADA specifications and {{a test of the}} final setting time according to the ASTM. For the solubility tests disintegration and pH, <b>Teflon</b> <b>rings</b> were filled with the cements and weighed after setting. After 24 h in a desiccator, they were once again weighed. Thereafter, they were immersed in MiliQ water for 24 and 72 h and 7, 14, and 28 days, with maintenance in the desiccator and weighing between periods. The pH of water in which the rings were immersed was measured immediately after contact with them and in the other periods. The addition of CaCl(2) provided a significant reduction (50 %) in the initial setting time of cements. The final setting time of WMTA was reduced in 35. 5 % and the final setting time of WPC in 68. 5 %. The WMTA with CaCl(2) absorbed water and gained weight with time, except for in the 24 -h period. The addition of CaCl(2) to the WPC reduced its solubility. The addition of CaCl(2) increased the pH of WMTA in the immediate period and at 24 and 72 h and for WPC in the immediate period and at 24 h. The addition of CaCl(2) to WMTA and WPC reduced the setting times and solubility of both and increased the pH of cements in the initial periods. (J Endod 2009; 35 : 550 - 554...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{nanomaterials}} {{has been}} shown to be promising in potential applications such as magnetic storage devices, nano-optical devices and sensors, amongst others. Such applications require the disposition of nanoparticles, of a wide variety of materials and with a narrow size distribution, into large and ordered arrays. With this aim, it {{has been shown}} that by modifying the forces present in self-assembly processes of colloidal particles the fabrication of ordered nanostructures over large surface areas is possible, more precisely for particle systems with sizes smaller than 100 nm. In the present work, various colloidal suspensions were used to fabricate self-assembled nanostructures. Silica 75, 45 and 20 nm, gold 50, 30 and 15 nm, iron oxide 10 nm and zinc sulphide 5 nm particles as aqueous suspensions were arranged on various substrates. Prior to self-assembly, these nanoparticles were characterized in their suspending medium. Zeta-potentials, and more generally colloidal stability, have been measured for various ionic strengths and pHs. Size distribution measurements using four different methods have been performed on these particles. Investigations have shown that difficulties are encountered when analyzing amorphous and isolating particles smaller than 30 nm. The surface of the silica particles has been studied in more details, since abnormal colloidal stability was detected compared to that predicted by classical models for colloidal stability, especially close to the isoelectric point. This study revealed that a surface hairy layer was very likely to reinforce the repulsive interaction between particles, as a steric effect. This hairy layer probably derives from the synthesis process employed to produce the silica particles, and may be composed of silanol groups and/or polysilicic acid chains. Three-dimension colloidal crystals with ordering lengths of tens of micrometers have been obtained by drying, under controlled temperature and relative humidity, a highly (0. 36 g/ml – ∼ 15 % volume) concentrated 75 nm silica suspension on a flat substrate in a so-called <b>Teflon</b> <b>ring</b> cell, or by using dip-coating. As a result, a thick cracked film was produced in which the particles were ordered in three dimensions, as a colloidal crystal. The ordering length, which could reach several tens of micrometers, was also present for 45 nm silica particles but was lost when using 20 nm particles, most probably due to polydispersity and colloidal stability. The ordering of the particles in their suspending fluid close to the end of drying, influenced by the repulsive forces was believed to be at the origin of this phenomenon. Investigations of the drying process were carried out using optical microscopy, spectrophotometry analysis and weight loss measurements. It was shown that this drying process could be related to the one observed in sol-gel science, and the stress induced in the film during drying of the suspending medium could be calculated using existing models. Capillary forces were compared to particle-particle dispersion forces to again confirm the probable presence of a hairy layer at the silica particles' surface. Further investigations were also pursued to check the in-situ ordering, but without definite confirmation of the effect. Using the <b>Teflon</b> <b>ring</b> cell or dip-coating and working with dilute suspensions (3. 6 · 10 - 4 g/ml – ∼ 2 · 10 - 2 % volume) of 75 nm silica particles allowed the fabrication of particle monolayers for which pH and thus colloidal stability played an important role. Short-range ordered monolayers were obtained at pH 6 and 10, while agglomerates were observed at pH 2, i. e. close to the isoelectric point of the silica particles. The driving forces encountered during the formation of 2 D and self-assembled films could be described using models of capillary forces, particle-particle and particle-substrate interactions. The particle concentration, the dip-coating speed and the wettability of the substrate were also investigated more in detail. Finally, monolayers of 10 nm superparamagnetic particles, stabilised by electrostatic or steric effects, and obtained on silicon wafer were investigated by AFM. This shows how the presence of a polymer in suspension could help the deposition of particles on an atomically flat, non-wetting surface. These experimental and theoretical descriptions of the self-assembly process of 3 D and 2 D nanostructures were employed then to set the range of parameters required for exploring the next step: the guided self-assembly process. Dip-coating combined with topographically nanopatterned substrates, prepared by Extreme-UV Interference Lithography (EUV-IL), allowed the production of micrometers-long chains of silica and gold particles with diameters between 50 and 15 nm. The structure and quality was shown to strongly depend on the various experimental parameters, as in the case of the 2 D nanostructures preparation. The particle concentration of the suspension, pH, ionic strength and the removal speed of the substrate out of the suspension were shown to be the most relevant parameters on the way to obtain long lines with few defects. Similar dip-coating experiments using substrates patterned with holes lead to ordered arrays of single dots of silica and gold, and ordered clusters of iron oxide and zinc sulphide over tens of micrometers. As a final step in this study, some physical properties of the obtained nanostructures were investigated. Surface plasmon resonance measurements performed on gold particle chains using UV/vis spectroscopy. These measurement showed very coherent results compared to theoretical simulation and other works. Cathodoluminescence spectra were also obtained using zinc sulphide nanoparticle arrays, and conductivity measurements were attempted on gold particle chains. Finally, a feasibility study on the colloidal lithography process was performed with more or less success depending on the employed method...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Recently a new root-end filling {{material}} (NREFM), {{referred to as}} Cold Ceramic (CC), has been introduced; different studies have shown its biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity and good sealability. One of the disadvantages of CC is its low radiopacity in clinical procedures. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate radiopacity of CC by incorporating different radiopacifiers (Bi 2 O 3, BaSo 4) in comparison to Pro-root MTA and PC. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study 7 groups of materials (Group 1 : 0. 9 NREFM + 0. 1 gr Bi 2 O 3; Group 2 : 0. 8 gr NREFM + 0. 2 gr Bi 2 O 3; Group 3 : 0. 9 NREFM + 0. 1 gr BaSo 4; Group 4 : 0. 8 gr NREFM + 0. 2 gr BaSo 4; Group 5 : NREFM; Group 6 : Pro-root MTA; Group 7 : PC) were mixed with 0. 3 mL of distilled water and placed in <b>Teflon</b> <b>rings</b> measuring 10 mm in internal diameter and 1 mm in thickness, based on ISO 6876 / 2001 and allowed to set.

Data were analyzed by SPSS using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Group 6 exhibited the highest radiopacity (6. 85 mm Al) and PC samples exhibited the lowest radiopacity (2. 74 mm Al).

MTA Fillapex, a mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) -based, salicylate resin containing root canal sealer, was compared with iRoot SP, a bioceramic sealer, and AH Plus Jet, an epoxy resin-based root canal sealer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To evaluate cytotoxicity, all materials were packed into <b>Teflon</b> <b>rings</b> (4 mm&# 181; 3 mm) and co-cultured with hTGSCs with the aid of 24 -well Transwell permeable supports, which had a pore size of 0. 4 &# 181;m. Coverslips were coated with MTA Fillapex, iRoot SP and AH Plus Jet and each coverslip was placed onto the bottom of one well of a six-well plate for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Before the cytotoxicity and SEM analysis, all samples were stored at 37 &# 186;C and at 95 % humidity and 5 % CO 2 for 24 hours to set. The cellular viability was analyzed using MTS test (3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl-thiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxy-methoxy-phenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfo-phenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium). The cytotoxic effects and SEM visualization of the tested materials were analyzed at 24 -hour, 72 -hour, one-week and two-week periods. RESULTS: On the 1 st day, only MTA Fillapex caused cytotoxicity compared to negative control (NC) group (p 0. 05). After 14 days of incubation with the test materials, MTA Fillapex exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity compared with iRoot SP, AH Plus Jet and the NC group (P< 0. 008).
