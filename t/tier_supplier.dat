40|$|The world {{automotive}} industry has evolved through different manufacturing methodologies over many decades. It originated from craft production, but was transformed to mass production by Henry Ford {{in response to}} increased market demand. The methodology developed by Henry Ford {{made it possible to}} produce quality vehicles in large numbers and at affordable cost to the general public. However, it cannot deliver a great variety of products to the marketplace. Mass production was overtaken by a new automotive manufacturing methodology developed in Japan after World War II. The methodology, commonly referred to as lean production, yields consistently high quality products at even lower costs, whilst being able to deliver a variety of products to the consumer. The effectiveness of the lean production methodology hinges upon the strength and closeness of the relationships that exist between the assembler and its suppliers. Different models have been developed over time to describe the relationships between automotive assemblers and their suppliers. The lean supply model is generally accepted as an effective way of describing the relationships that exist between an automotive assembler and its first <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> in a lean manufacturing environment. The research study aims at gaining an improved understanding of the relationships that exist between a selected Eastern Cape automotive assembler and its first <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The effect of its supplier support practices towards lean manufacturing implementation amongst its first <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> is evaluated. For the selected assembler it is found that the effect of its supplier support practices on lean manufacturing implementation amongst its first <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> is limited by a non-uniform approach followed towards the supplier base.

40|$|Abstract: The {{decision}} of adopting integrated product architecture {{has been replaced}} by a modular approach for designing new products. The impact of this decision can be viewed in terms of internal activities of product development and production or transferring those activities to suppliers. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to investigate added-value transfer when adopting modularity. It is part on an ongoing research project designed to investigate current managerial practices that could be categorised as transferring added-value activities through the supply chain. Case-based research was employed as the methodological approach. A conceptual model of added value transferring in the literature was used to analyse the cases. The results identified issues that characterise activities that have been transferred from the first to the second <b>tier</b> <b>supplier.</b> The value of the paper is towards an exploration of modularity decision in the automotive supply chain within the context of a developing country.

40|$|Supply chain design {{deals with}} {{long-term}} and strategic decisions on thestructural design and configuration of supply chains. Available supply chain designtools offer particular planning functionaIities. They provide only little support for linking all activities within the workfIow of the user.

This language translates the modeling elements of the application (application language) into the technical modelling elements of the tool (simulation tool language) and vice versa. As a result, the complexity of configuring a simulation model is kept at a minimum in the background. All this is embedded in an service-based tool architecture that enables work flow support of the user and collaborative engineering.

A manufacturer must choose whether to delegate component procurement to her <b>tier</b> 1 <b>supplier</b> or control it directly. Because of information asymmetry about suppliers’ production costs and the use of simple quantity discount or price-only contracts, either delegation or control can yield substantially higher expected proﬁt for the manufacturer.

40|$|Part 13 : Design Science and Business Models - Design Science ResearchInternational audienceThis study explores {{strategic}} agility of an automotive {{corporate group}} {{and its influence}} on facility layouts and operational performance. Strategic agility is viewed here as a firm’s strategic intent to achieve agile operations through collaboratively deploying the layouts {{of a set of}} facilities, driven by a management focus on improving its responsiveness and adaptability to customers’ requirements. Our “collaborative multi-facility layout problem” involves the physical organization of departments between and inside several facilities geographically dispersed, that collaborate in manufacturing a complex product in a given time window. The model proposed in this work allows us to analyse the benefits of new horizontal collaboration forms with respect to several objectives, namely costs (material handling inside and between facilities, re-layout) and adjacency between departments. A case study of a first <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> in the automotive industry shows the applicability potential of the approach to real-life problems.

40|$|Abstract: Apple {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dominant}} and most admired computer companies in the world. But hidden behind the clean surface of Apple’s advanced gadgets lies a dirty world of work. This paper focuses on the dark side of the information age by looking at working conditions in the workshops of Apple’s contract manufacturers in China. For this purpose I suggest a systematic model of working conditions that can be used for assessing and comparing work in different industries. Departing from Karl Marx’s circuit of capital it identifies elements that shape working conditions throughout the capital accumulation process including productive forces, relations of production, the production process, products, and labour legislation. Subsequently I apply this model to the realm of electronics manufac-turing. Based on research conducted by corporate watchdogs this paper provides detailed insights into the work and life reality of workers in Apple’s first <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> factories. An analysis of Apple’s re-sponse to labour rights allegations furthermore reveals three ideological patterns that rather obscure existing problems than offering viable solutions...|$|E

This article discuss the major findings of a study conducted in a representative supply chain of the auto industry to verify the use of contracts and how they affect the relationships of the companies in question. Based on an intentional sampling approach, a case study was made of an automaker that uses the industrial condominium configuration, two first tier suppliers operating inside the condominium, and a first <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> operating outside the condominium (a conventional supplier). Additionally, a basic framework was built to guide and define the key content of the research, which considered two premises and eleven parameters in the companies in question.

40|$|Over the years, {{avionics}} {{systems have}} increased in complexity {{to the point where}} 1 st <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> to an aircraft OEM find it financially beneficial to outsource designs of subsystems to 2 nd tier and at times to 3 rd <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Combined with challenging schedule and budgetary pressures, the environment in which safety-critical systems are being developed introduces new hurdles for regulatory agencies and industry. This new environment of both complex systems and tiered development has raised concerns in the ability of the designers to ensure safety considerations are fully addressed throughout the tier levels. This has also raised questions about the sufficiency of current regulatory guidance to ensure: proper flow down of safety awareness, avionics application understanding at the lower tiers, OEM and 1 st tier oversight practices, and capabilities of lower <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Therefore, NASA established a research project to address Regulatory Compliance in a Multi-tier Supplier Network.

40|$|International audienceThe {{performance}} of mixed-model assembly lines used in sectors {{such as the}} automotive industry depends on theavailability {{of a large number}} of components that have to be supplied to the line on time and at minimum cost. Insuch settings, components may have different features such as volume, weight, bill of material coefficient, etc. Additionally, a given component may have several alternative variants among which a single one is used in theassembly of end products. Each variant is thus characterized by a varying degree of usage rate. Hence, thediversity of parts requires the selection of the best assembly line feeding mode that aims at minimizing theaverage total operating cost which mainly consists of labor costs associated with parts preparation beforeassembly, transportation to the line, picking operations during assembly, as well as parts storage cost. This paperproposes an optimization model that assigns each individual component to the most efficient line feeding modeamong three alternatives which are line stocking, kitting and sequencing modes. The developed mixed integerprogram is applied to a first <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> plant in the automotive sector. Based on this model, insight is gained onthe trade-off to be considered when deciding the more appropriate line feeding mode for each individualcomponent and how system parameters impact this trade-off...|$|E
40|$|Traditional Leadership is {{most often}} {{authority}} driven. In traditional organizations, assignments for work and allocations of resources are made {{by those who have}} power and authority. In a traditional organization if you have a title you have the power. Thus, in a traditional Organization: Leadership = Authority (L=A). Adaptive Leadership has been developed by Ronald Heifetz in 2009 to help individuals lead with or without authority, “it is an approach to making progress on the most important challenges you face in your piece and part of the world” (Heifetz, Linsky, & Grashow, 2009, p. 3). In contrast to traditional organizational structures, goods and services move quickly through supply chain departments and organizations. Modern supply chains are increasingly characterized by complexity, several suppliers, second tier suppliers, far-flung affiliates, global aspects, cultural differences, communication challenges and differing legal environments. In such fast changing and complex environments authority is often unclear. For example, the CEO of a second <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> for raw materials may have very little authority as the product moves {{toward the end of the}} supply chain. Authority alone cannot make a supplier meet a deadline. Suppliers are often in a battle for resources, and simply yelling at a supplier does not make them produce more or better product. It takes leadership and collaboration skills, not just authority, to move products and services through the complex supply chain pipeline.

This study aims {{to find out how}} apparel and footwear brands implement environmental management in their supply chain. Furthermore, what motivates them to carry out environmental management, and lastly, what challenges the industry encounters in carrying out effective environmental management. Primary and secondary data research were carried out in this study. Primary research, in a form of self-administered survey, was conducted for 11 brands and 15 of their respective suppliers. Secondary research was conducted through desktop research to gather additional information from brands, NGOs, academic studies and news. The study revealed environmental management in apparel and footwear supply chain is becoming more important. However, most of the brands’ approaches on environmental management are loose (i. e. lack industry-wide sustainably environmental management strategy), and small in scope (i. e. first <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> only).
