5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E
5|$|The United States presidential {{election}} of 1880 was the 24th quadrennial {{presidential election}}, held on Tuesday, November 2, 1880. <b>The</b> <b>voter</b> turnout rate {{was one of}} the highest in the nation's history.|$|E

However, shortly afterwards the government accepted a bailout with even harsher conditions than the ones rejected by <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Department {{was created}} in 1956 when <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> of Oklahoma {{approved}} State Question 374, which amended the Oklahoma Constitution by adding Article 26.

5|$|As {{part of the}} process, Elections Canada mails out {{letters to}} 18-year-old {{citizens}} explaining how to register for inclusion on the voters list. The letters have been mistaken by some recipients as confirmation {{that they have been}} added to <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> list.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was later}} {{introduced}} {{to amend the}} type of data collected and stored in the National Register of Electors. On 17 May 2007, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs regarding Bill C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act submitting a letter in which she criticised the proposed changes to the Elections Act. One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of birth in <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> lists sent to polling stations on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth year would be sufficient. The second problem she raised was inclusion of the date of birth in <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> lists sent to each candidate for all electoral districts in Canada, and also to all political parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E
50|$|The Constitution {{established}} in 1894 required <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> {{to vote on}} the necessity of a subsequent constitutional convention in 1936. On November 3, 1936, <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> approved <b>the</b> holding of a Convention which was held two years later in 1938.|$|R
25|$|Measure 50 {{was sent}} to <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> by <b>the</b> Oregon Legislature in 1997. Once passed by <b>the</b> <b>voters,</b> <b>the</b> measure {{replaced}} Measure 47. The problems with Measure 47 that Measure 50 aimed to address included a lack of precision about the assessment of property taxes, unintended consequences, and vulnerability to legal challenges.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>voters,</b> in {{a special}} {{election}} held March 7, 1978, solely to ratify the amendments proposed by the convention, voted to remove the archaic provisions and the usury cap and to accept the changes regarding the governor's terms and metropolitan government, but they narrowly turned down the judicial amendment, marking {{the first time that}} an amendment put to <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> by a convention had been defeated. Of the 13 proposed amendments, only that one was rejected by <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|R
5|$|To be {{eligible}} to vote at a contested election in any constituency, a voter's name must be on the latest certified register of electors for that constituency. The name of <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> {{will be included in}} the register of electors for a constituency if on the cut-off date for the production of the register of electors <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> is a citizen of Singapore, at least 21 years old, and ordinarily resident or deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore at an address that is in that constituency. For the purpose of preparing or revising a register of electors, information stated on a voter's National Registration Identity Card is used to determine that he or she complies with the above requirements, unless the facts are shown to be otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Cranston {{continued}} intervening {{on behalf}} of Keating after the April 1987 meetings, contacting both Wall and California state regulators and continuing to receive large amounts of new donations to <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> registration projects from Keating. DeConcini also continued {{on behalf of}} Keating, contacting Wall, California State regulators, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) advocating approval of a sale of Lincoln as a December 1988 alternative to government seizure. Bank regulators refused to approve the sale of Lincoln. Glenn too continued to help Keating after the April 1987 revelation, by setting up a meeting with then-House Majority Leader Jim Wright.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Parliament of Norway {{are elected}} based on party-list {{proportional}} representation in plural member constituencies. This means that representatives from different political parties are elected from 19 constituencies, which are {{identical to the}} 19 counties. The electorate does not vote for individuals but rather for party lists, with a ranked list of candidates nominated by the party. This means that the person {{on top of the}} list will get the seat unless <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> alters the ballot. Parties may nominate candidates from outside their own constituency, and even Norwegian citizens currently living abroad.|$|E

In each electoral college, the seats were divided by proportional representation, using the D'Hondt method.|$|R

5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee {{ruled that}} Cranston had acted {{improperly}} by {{interfering with the}} investigation by the FHLBB. He had received {{more than a million}} dollars from Keating, including $850,000 to <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> registration groups closely affiliated with him; he had done more arm-twisting than the other Senators on Keating's behalf; and he was the only senator officially rebuked by the Senate in this matter.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the National Geographic Database, the National Register of Electors is used to create preliminary voters lists for each electoral district in Canada for each election, byelection, and referendum. Each candidate from each electoral district is given a voters list for that district, which is {{a subset of the}} data in the National Register of Electors whose addresses are within the boundaries of the district as defined in the National Geographic Database. That data may only be used for election purposes; any other use of that data subjects the user to penalties including fines, imprisonment, or both. <b>The</b> <b>voter</b> lists are updated by returning officers based on information received during an election campaign, ultimately resulting in final voters lists being distributed by election day.|$|E
5|$|In this period, {{while the}} Great Migration of African Americans {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E
50|$|In {{fact there}} are two Landamann: a {{so-called}} Regierender Landaman (acting Landamann) and a Stillstehender Landamann (vice Landamann). The terms are {{for two years and}} will switch between them after the two year, but they have to be confirmed every year by <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b> In particular <b>the</b> Regierender Landaman has to be confirmed by <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> by actually voting. This actually leaves <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> with <b>the</b> possibility to drop any member of the government during the Landsgemeinde and select someone else.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the current}} system used in the Australian Senate a voter whose first {{preference}} is for a minor candidate and their subsequent second preference for a major candidate that has been declared elected earlier in the count is denied {{the opportunity to have}} their second preference vote allocated to the candidate of their choice. With the reiterative counting system <b>the</b> <b>voter's</b> second preference forms part of <b>the</b> <b>voter's</b> alternative chosen candidate's surplus and is redistributed according to <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> nominated preference allocation.|$|R

5|$|Moore {{ended in}} 11th place overall, {{receiving}} 6,555 votes nationwide out of over 125 million cast. He thus missed, {{by a large}} margin, the 5 percent needed to qualify the Socialist Party USA for federally distributed public funding in the next election. His best showings were in Tennessee, where he received 1,326 votes out of over 2 million votes cast, and in Ohio, where he managed to receive 2,731 votes. His weakest showings were in Kentucky and Minnesota, where he managed to gain 7 votes in each state. Moore {{was not able to}} enlarge the party's voter base, but instead <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> base shrunk by over 4 thousand votes nationwide from the previous election fronted by Walt Brown.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} amendments {{have been}} passed by the General Assembly and approved by <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> to conform to provisions in the U.S. Constitution, rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and Congressional statute. The voting age {{has been reduced to}} eighteen, voting residency requirements have been removed, and voter registration conforms to the Motor Voter Act. Additionally, the Virginia Constitution now provides for a General Assembly session following a governor’s veto, and {{the right of the people}} to hunt, fish and harvest game is guaranteed. In 2006, Virginians passed an amendment limiting marriage to “unions between one man and one woman”. That has since been overturned by Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).|$|E
5|$|Since the {{constituency}} {{was created}} in 1983, the Member of Parliament for North Thanet, covering northern Thanet and Herne Bay, has been the Conservative Roger Gale.

Labour won 32.2% of the vote, Liberal Democrats 14.4% and United Kingdom Independence Party 3.9%. At the 2001 general election, the Conservatives had a higher share of the vote with 50.3% but a lower majority of 6,650. During Labour's landslide victory at national level at the 1997 general election, the Conservative majority in North Thanet was reduced to 2,766, with the Conservatives on 44.1% of the vote and Labour on 38.4%. <b>The</b> <b>voter</b> turnout during the past three general elections has been between 59.3% and 68.8%.|$|E

Voter rejection of 2002's Referendum 51, which would have funded the replacement of car ferries with a gas tax, led the state to consider eliminating passenger-only service to Bremerton and Vashon Island {{to make up for the}} shortfall. In May 2003, the state legislature approved cuts to ferry service, including the elimination of passenger-only ferries. Passenger-only ferry service ceased operations on September 20, 2003, and the MV Chinook and MV Snohomish were sold in 2008 to Golden Gate Ferries in the San Francisco Bay Area after an unsuccessful auction on eBay.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{suggested}} that McKinley's campaign {{of education of}} <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> through speakers and literature brought him victory, but with a cost to the close identification between voters and the political parties that was typical in the 19th century. Voter turnout was almost 80 percent in 1896, about average for presidential elections in the late 19th century, but then dropped substantially and remained at lower levels as voters, who once participated in rallies and torchlight processions for candidates, were distracted by radio and by professional sports. Nevertheless, later campaigns tried to recapture the magic of 1896; Warren G. Harding conducted his own front porch campaign in 1920, even borrowing the flagpole from McKinley's old front yard.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E
